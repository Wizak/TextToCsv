 the hindmost danced they were dancing as far as the eye could see beneath a ceiling that was a flat mirror tens of thousands of his kind moved in tight patterns that were great mutating curves heads cocked high and low to keep their orientation the clicking of their hooves was a part of the music like a hundred thousand castanets kick short kick past veer one eye for your counterpartner in this movement and the next never glance toward the wall that hides the brides never touch for millions of years the competition dance and a wide spectrum of other social vectors had determined who would mate and who would not beyond the illusion of the dance loomed the illusion of a window distant and huge the hindmosts view of hidden patriarch was a distraction a groundrules hazard an obstacle within the dance extend a head bow the other threelegged dancers the vast floor and ceiling were projections from hot needle of inquirys computer memory dancing maintained the hindmosts skills his reflexes his health this year had been a time for torpor for recuperation and contemplation but such states could change in an instant one earthly year ago or half of the puppeteer worlds archaic year or forty ringworld rotations the hindmost and his alien thralls had found a milelong sailing ship moored below the map of mars they had named it hidden patriarch and set sail leaving the hindmost behind the window in the hindmosts dance was a realtime view from the webeye device in hidden patriarchs fore crows nest what the window showed was more real than the dancers chmeee and louis wu lolled in the foreground the hindmosts servantsinrebellion both looked a bit the worse for wear the hindmosts medical programs had restored them both to youth not much more than two years ago young and healthy they still were but soft and slothful too hind kick touch hooves whirl brush tongues the great ocean lay beneath a sea of fog windroiled fog made streamline patterns over the tremendous ship at the shore the fog piled like a breaking wave only the crows nests six hundred feet tall poked above the fog far inland far across the white blanket mountain peaks burst through nearly black with glittering peaks hidden patriarch had come home the hindmost was about to lose his alien companions the webeye picked up voices louis wu im pretty sure thats mount hood and mount rainier there that one i dont know but if mount st helens hadnt blown her top near a thousand years ago that might be it chmeee a ringworld mountain doesnt explode unless you hit it with a meteor pre cise ly my point i think well be passing the map of san francisco bay inside of ten hours the kind of wind and waves that build up on the great ocean youll need a decent bay for your lander chmeee you can start your invasion there if you dont mind being conspicuous i like conspicuous the kzin stood and stretched claws extended eight feet of fur tipped everywhere with daggers a vision out of nightmare the hindmost had to remind himself that he faced only a hologram the kzin and hidden patriarch were miles distant from the spacecraft buried beneath the map of mars whirl forefeet glide left step left ignore the distraction the kzin sat again this ship is fated dont you think built to invade the map of earth pirated by teela after she became a protector to invade the map of mars and the repair center now hidden patriarch returns to invade the earth again within the hindmosts crippled interstellar spacecraft a rising cooling wind blew through the cabin the dance moved faster now sweat soaked the hindmosts elegantly coiffed mane and rolled down his legs the window gave him more than visible light by radar he could see the great bay south by the maps orientation and a crust of cities the archaic kzinti had built around its shore the curve of a planet would have hidden that from him louis said im going to miss you for a few moments it might be that his companion hadnt heard then the great mass of orange fur spoke without turning louis over there are lords i can defeat and mates to bear my children there is my place not yours over there hominids are slaves and theyre not quite your species either you should not come i should not stay did i say different you go i stay im going to miss you but against your intellect eh chmeee said louis i heard a tale of you years ago i must learn the truth of it say on after we returned to our worlds after we gave over the puppeteer ship to be studied by our respective governments chtarraritt invited you to make free of the hunting park outside bloodofchwarambr city you were the first alien ever to enter that place other than to die you spent two days and a night within the grounds what was it like louis was still on his back mostly i loved it mostly for the honor i think but every so often a man has to test his luck we heard a tale the next night at chtarraritts banquet what did you hear you were in the inner quadrant among the imports you found a valuable animal louis sat bolt upright a white bengal tiger id found this nice green forest nesting in all that red and orange kzinti plant life and i was feeling kind of safe and cozy and nostalgic then this this lovelybutohfutz maneater stepped out of the bushes and looked me over chmeee he was your size maybe eight hundred pounds and underfed sorry go on what is it bengal tiger something of ours from earth an ancient enemy you could say we were told that you stepped briskly past it to pick up a branch confronted the tiger and brandished the branch like a weapon and said do you remember the tiger turned away and left yeah why did you do that do tigers talk louis laughed i thought he might go away if i didnt act like prey if that didnt work i thought i might whack him on the nose there was this splintered tree and a hardwood branch that looked just right for a club and i talked to him because a kzin might be listening being killed as an inept tourist in the patriarchs hunting park would be bad enough dying as whimpering prey nyet did you know the patriarch had set you a guard no i thought there might be monitors cameras i watched the tiger go turned around and was nosetonose with an armed kzin i jumped half out of my skin thought he was another tiger he said he almost had to stun you you challenged him you were ready to club him he said stun he did louis wu laughed he had an arm stunner with a builtup handle your patriarchy never learned how to make mercy weapons so they have to buy them from the united nations i guess i set myself to swing the club he dropped the gun and extended his claws and i saw he was a kzin and i laughed how louis threw his head back and laughed mouth wide all teeth showing from a kzin that would have been a direct challenge and chmeees ears went quite flat hahahahah i couldnt help it i was tanj lucky he wasnt about to stun me hed have killed me with one swipe of his claws but he got himself under control either way an interesting story chmeee a notion has crossed my mind if we could get off the ringworld youd want to return as chmeee wouldnt you little chance that i would be known the hindmosts rejuvenation treatment erased my scars too i would seem little older than my oldest son who must now be managing my estates yeah and the hindmost might not cooperate i would not ask would you ask me chmeee said i would not need to i hadnt quite realized that the patriarch might accept the word of louis wu as to your identity but he would wouldnt he i believe he would speakertotigers but you have chosen to die louis snorted oh chmeee im dying no faster than you are ive got another fifty years likely enough and teela brown slagged the hindmosts magical medical widgetry that the hindmost thought was quite enough of that he must have his own medical facilities on the command deck the kzin said we cant get to those and the kitchen had medical programs louis and id be begging from a puppeteer yet an interruption might infuriate them perhaps a distraction the speech of the puppeteers was more concise and flexible than any human or kzinti tongue the hindmost whistlechirped a few phrases chmeee louis they both jumped then rolled to their feet staring do i interrupt i desire to show you certain pictures for a moment they simply watched the dance the hindmost could guess how silly he must look grins were spreading across both faces though louiss meant laughter and chmeees meant anger youve been spying chmeee said how look up dont destroy it chmeee but look above your head at the mast that supports the radio antenna just at the reach of your claws the alien faces expanded hugely louis said like a bronze spiderweb with a black spider at the center fractal pattern hard to see hard to see where it stops too i thought some ringworld insect was spinning these the hindmost told them its a camera microphone telescope projector and some other tools too it sprays on ive left them in various places not just this ship louis can you summon your guests whittle i have something to show you they should see this too what youre doing it looks a little like tai kwon do louis said the information surfaced a fighting style ridiculous his species never fought the hindmost said i dont want to lose my muscle tone the unexpected always comes at the most awkward times a second window opened among the dancers the city builders were preparing a meal in the huge kitchen you must see chmeees claws swiped at the puppeteers eyes window six blinked white and closed kick weave past the moments leader stand shift a millimeter stand patience avoid him they might they had avoided him for ten hours now and for half an archaic year before that but they had to eat the wooden table was tremendous the size of a kzinti banquet a year ago the hindmost had had to turn down the olfactory gain in the webeye for the stench of old blood rising from the table the smell was fainter now kzinti tapestries and crudely carved frescoes had been removed too bloody for the hominids taste some had been moved to chmeees cabin the smell of roasting fish was heavy on the air kawaresksenjajok and harkabeeparolyn were doing things in the makeshift kitchen their infant daughter seemed happy enough at one end of the table itself at the other end the raw half of a huge fish awaited the kzins pleasure chmeee eyed the fish your luck was good he approved his eyes roved the ceiling and walls he found what he sought a glittering fractal spiderweb just under the great orange bulb at the apex of the dome the city builders entered wiping their hands kawaresksenjajok a boy not much past adolescence harkabeeparolyn his mate some years older both quite bald across the crowns of their heads their hair descending to cover their shoulder blades harkabeeparolyn picked up the baby and gave it suck kawaresksenjajok said we lose you soon chmeee said we have a spy i thought as much but now we know it the puppeteer placed cameras among us the boy laughed at his anger we would do the same to him to seek knowledge is natural in less than a day i will be free of the eyes of the puppeteer kawa harkee i will miss you greatly your company your knowledge your skewed wisdom but my thought will be mine alone im losing them all the hindmost thought survival suggests that i build a road to take them back to me he said folk will you give me an hour to entertain you the city builders gaped the kzin grinned louis wu said entertain sure if youll turn off the light louis did that the puppeteer whistlesang he was looking through the display watching their faces where the webeye had been now they saw a window a view through blowing rain down past the rim of a vast plate far below pale humanoid shapes swarmed in their hundreds they seemed gregarious enough they rubbed against each other without hostility and here and there they mated without seeking privacy this is present time the hindmost said ive been monitoring this site since we restored the ringworlds orbit kawaresksenjajok said vampires flup harkee have you ever seen so many together louis asked well before i brought our probe back to the great ocean i used it to spray webeyes youre seeing that region we first explored on the highest structure i could find to give me the best view alas for my view rain and cloud have obscured it ever since but louis you can see that there is life here vampires kawaresksenjajok harkabeeparolyn this is to port of where you lived can you see that life is thriving here you could return the woman was waiting postponing judgment the boy was torn he said a word in his own language untranslatable dont promise what you cant deliver said louis wu louis you have evaded me ever since we saved the ringworld always you speak as if we turned a blowtorch hundreds of thousands of miles across on inhabited terrain ive questioned your numbers you dont listen see for yourself they still live wonderful louis said the vampires lived through it more than vampires watch the hindmost whistled the view zoomed on distant mountains thirtyodd hominids marched through a pass between peaks twentyone vampires six of the small redskinned herders theyd seen on their last visit five of a bigger darker hominid creature two of a smallheaded variety perhaps not sapient all of the prey were naked and none were trying to escape they were tired but joyful each member of another species had a vampire companion only a few vampires wore clothing against the chill and the rain the clothing was clearly borrowed cut to fit something other than what wore it vampires werent sapient at all or so the hindmost had been told he wondered if animals would keep slaves or livestock but never mind louis chmeee do you see here are other species also alive i even saw a city builder once louis wu said i dont see cancer and i dont see mutations but they must be there hindmost i got my information from teela brown teela was a protector brighter than you and me one and a half trillion deaths she said the hindmost said teela was intelligent but i see her as human louis even after her change human humans dont look directly at danger puppeteers you call cowards but not to look is cowardice drop it its been a year cancers can take ten or twenty mutations take a whole generation protectors have their limits teela had no notion of the power of my computers you left me to make the adjustments louis drop it i will continue to look the puppeteer said the hindmost danced the marathon would continue until he made a mistake he was pushing himself toward exhaustion his body would heal and then grow strong he had not bothered to eavesdrop through the aliens dinner chmeee had not slashed the webeye but they would not speak secrets in its view they need not a year past while his motley crew was still trying to settle the matter of teela brown and the ringworlds instability the hindmosts flying probe had sprayed webeyes all over hidden patriarch he would rather have been concentrating on the dance time enough for that chmeee would be gone soon louis would revert to silence in another year he too might leave the ship leave the hindmosts control the city builder librarians work on them they were lost to him already in a sense the hindmost controlled needles medical facilities if they saw that he used his power for extortion they saw nothing but the truth but he had been too direct chmeee and louis had both refused medical attention they were walking briskly down a shadowed corridor louis wu and chmeee reception was poor in so little light but they wouldnt see the web the hindmost caught only part of the dialogue he played it back several times afterward louis dominance game the hindmost has to control us were too close to him we could conceivably hurt him chmeee ive tried to see a way louis how hard never mind he left us alone for a year then interrupted himself in the middle of an exercise routine why bother nothing about that broadcast looked urgent chmeee i know how you think he overheard us didnt he if i can return to the patriarchy i wont need the hindmost to recover my properties i have you you do not exact a price louis yeah the hindmost considered interrupting to say what chmeee by my lost lands he controlled me but how did he control you he had you by the wire but you gave up your addiction the autodoc in the lander was destroyed but surely the kitchen has a program to make boosterspice likely enough for you too chmeee dismissed that with a wave but if you allow yourself to grow old he has nothing louis nodded but would the hindmost believe you to a puppeteer i do not insult you im sure you speak the truth louis but to a puppeteer to let yourself grow old is suicide louis nodded silent is this justice for a trillion murders louis would have broken off conversation on another night he said justice for us both i die of old age the hindmost loses his thralls loses control of his environment but if they lived if they lived yeah the hindmost did the actual programming i couldnt go into that section of the repair center it was infested with treeoflife i made it possible for him to spray a plasma jet from the sun across five percent of the ringworld if he didnt do that then i can live so the hindmost owns me again and thats important if im the reason he doesnt own you ex act ly so show louis an old recording and say its a live broadcast the wind was rising gusts drowning the voices chmeee what if numbers hindmost to drop it brain is aging faster than the rest of you the kzin lost patience dropped to all fours and bounded away down the deck it didnt matter they were out of range the hindmost screamed like the worlds biggest espresso device tearing itself apart in his scream were pitches and overtones no creature of earth or kzin could hear with harmonics that held considerable information lineages for two species barely out of the veldt down from the trees designs for equipment that would cause a sun to flare then cause the flare to lase a cannon of ringworld scale specs for computer equipment miniaturized to the quantum level sprayed across the hindmosts cabin like a coat of paint programs of vast resiliency and power you twisted rejects from halfsavage halfsapient breeds your pitiful protector your luckbred teela hadnt the flexibility or the understanding but you dont even have the wit to listen i saved them all i with software from my ship one shriek and the hindmost was calm again he hadnt missed a step back one bow while the moments leader engages the brides in quadret a chance to get a drink of water badly needed one head lowered to suck one raised to watch the dance sometimes there were variations was louis wu going senile so quickly he was well over two hundred years old boosterspice had kept some humans hale and sapient for half a thousand years sometimes more but without his medical benefits louis wu might age fast and chmeee would be gone no matter the hindmost was in the safest place imaginable his ship was buried in cubic miles of cooled magma near the center of the ringworld repair center nothing was urgent he could wait there were the librarians something would change and there was the dance part one the shadow nest chapter one a war of scents ad cloud covered the sky like a gray stone plate the yellow grass had a wilted look too much rain not enough sun no doubt the sun was straight overhead and the arch was still in place but valavirgillin hadnt seen either for twenty days now the cruisers rolled through an endless drizzle through high grass on wheels as tall as a man vala and kay rode the steering bench barok rode above them as gunner baroks daughter forn was asleep under an awning any day now any hour sabarokaresh pointed is that what youve been looking for valavirgillin stood up in her seat she could just see where the vastness of grass turned to a vastness of stubble kaywerbrimmis said they leave this pattern well be seeing sentries or a harvesting party boss i dont understand how you knew theyd be grass giants here ive never been this far to starboard myself you youre from center city thats a hundred daywalks to port word came to me valavirgillin said he didnt ask more a merchants secrets were her own they rolled into the stubble and turned the cruisers rolled faster now stubble to right shoulderhigh grass to the left far ahead birds were wheeling and diving big dark birds scavengers kaywerbrimmis touched his handguns for reassurance muzzleloading the barrel as long as his forearm big sabarokaresh eased back into the turret the top of the payload shell housed the cannon and that might be needed the other wagons were swinging left and right covering kays wagon so that he could investigate in safety the birds wheeled away theyd left black feathers everywhere twenty big birds gorged until they could hardly fly what might feed so many bodies little hominids with pointy skulls lying some in stubble some in uncut grass stripped of most of their meat hundreds they might have been children but the children among them were even smaller vala looked for clothing in strange terrain you never knew which hominids might be intelligent sabarokaresh dropped to earth gun in hand kaywerbrimmis hesitated but nothing sudden popped out of the grass and he followed foranayeedli popped a sleepy head through the window and gaped she was a girl of sixty falans or so just reaching mating age since last night kay said presently the smell of corruption wasnt strong yet if ghouls hadnt arrived before the birds then these victims must have been slain near dawn vala asked how did they die if this is local grass giant practice we want none of it this couldve been done by birds cracked bones see but cracked by big beaks for marrow these are gleaners boss see this is how they dress in feathers they follow the harvesters the gleaners hunt smeerps firedots anything that digs cutting the grass exposes the burrows feathers right these feathers were black and red and purplegreen not just black so what happened here forn said i know that smell beneath the corruption what something familiar not itself unpleasant but it made foranayeedli uneasy valavirgillin had hired kaywerbrimmis to lead the caravan because he was local because he seemed competent the rest were his people none had ever been this far to starboard vala knew more of this place than any of them if she was right about where she was well where are they watching us maybe kay said vala could see a long way from her perch at the bow of the cruiser the veldt was flat the yellow grass was chopped short grass giants stood seven and eight feet tall where grass stood half their height could they hide in that the traders pulled their cruisers into a triangle their midday dinner was fruit and roots from stores on the running boards they cooked some local grass with the roots theyd caught no fresh meat they took their time most hominids were more approachable after feeding if grass giants thought like machine people they would let strangers eat before they made contact no ambassador came the caravan rolled on three cruisers rolled sluggishly across the veldt with no animal to pull them big square wooden platforms rode four wheels at the corners the motor centered aft turned two more drive wheels the castiron payload shell rode ahead of the motor like an iron house with a fat chimney big leaf springs were under the bow under the steering bench a savage might wonder at the tower on the payload housing but what would he think if he had never seen a cannon harmless shapes the color of the golden grass shapes too big to be men two big humanoids watched from the crest of a far hill vala saw them only when one turned and loped away across the veldt the other ran along the crest toward where the cruisers would cross he waited in their path watching them come he was nearly the color of the golden grass golden skin golden mane big armed with a great curved sword kaywerbrimmis walked to meet the giant valavirgillin set the cruiser following him like a friendly ridebeast distance put strange twists in the trade dialect kaywerbrimmis had tried to teach vala some of the variations in pronunciation new words and altered meanings she listened now trying to make out what kay was saying we come in peace intend to trade farsight trading rishathra the giants eyes flicked back and forth while kay talked back and forth between their jaws forn and vala and kay and barok the giant was amused his face was hairier than any machine persons pretty forns jawline fringe of beard just growing just long enough to take a curl at the corners valas was turning elegantly white two points at the chin other hominids were too often distracted by machine people beards especially on the women the giant waited out kays chattering then strode past him and took a seat on the cruisers running board he leaned against the payload shell and immediately jerked away from the hot metal recovered his dignity and waved the cruiser forward big barok held his post above the giant forn climbed up beside her father she was tall too but the giant made them both took stunted kaywerbrimmis asked your camp that way the giants dialect was less comprehensible yes come you want shelter we want warriors how do you practice rishathra it was the first thing any trader would want to know and any beta male too if these were like grass giants elsewhere the giant said come quick else learn too much of rishathra what vampires forns eyes widened that smell kay smiled seeing not a threat but an opportunity i am kaywerbrimmis here are valavirgillin my patron and sabarokaresh and foranayeedli in the other cruisers they are machine people too we hope to persuade you to join our empire i am paroom our leader you must address as thurl vala let kay do the talking grass giant swordscythes had too little reach farsight tradings guns would make short work of a vampire attack that should impress the bull and then business grass giants scores of them were pulling wagons filled with grass through the gap in a wall of heaped earth this isnt normal kaywerbrimmis said grass giants dont build walls paroom heard we had to learn fortythree falans ago the reds were fighting us we learned walls from them fortythree falans was rotations of the star patterns where the sky rotated every seven and a half days in forty falans valavirgillin had made herself rich had mated had carried four children then gambled her wealth away these last three falans she had been traveling fortythree falans was a long time she asked or tried to ask was that when the clouds came yes when the old thurl boiled a sea yes this was the place she sought kaywerbrimis shrugged it off as local superstition how long have you had vampires paroom said always there are some in this last few falans suddenly they are everywhere more every night this morning we found nearly two hundred gleaners all dead tonight they will hunger again the walls and our crossbows hold them back here said the sentry bring your wagons through the gap and prepare them to fight they had crossbows and the light was going it was crowded inside the walls grass giant men and women were unloading their wagons pausing frequently to eat of the grass they looked up as the machine people moved among them they gaped then returned to work had they ever seen selfpropelled cruisers but vampires were a more urgent concern already men in leather armor lined the wall others were heaping earth and stones to close the gap vala could feel the grass giants staring at her beard she could count roughly a thousand of them as many women as men but women outnumbered the men among grass giants elsewhere and she didnt see any children add a few hundred more then for women tending children somewhere in the buildings a great alien silver shape strode down the slope to meet them it lifted its crested helm to reveal a golden mane the thurl was the biggest of grass giant males the armor he wore bulged at every joint he looked like no hominid vala had ever seen thurl kaywerbrimmis said carefully farsight trading has come to help good what are you machine people we hear of you our empire is mighty but we spread through trade not war we hope to persuade your people to make fuel for us and bread and other things your kind of grass can make good bread you might like it yourselves in return we can show you wonders the least are our guns these handguns theyll reach farther than your crossbows for close work we have flamers killingthings are they our good luck that you have come yours too to reach cover you should move your guns to the wall now thurl the big guns are mounted on the cruisers the wall stood twice the height of a machine person but valavirgillin remembered a local word ramp thurl is there a ramp that leads up the wall will it carry our cruisers the days colors were turning charcoalgray it was starting to rain far above these clouds the shadow of night must have nearly covered the sun and there wasnt any ramp until the thurl bellowed his orders then all the huge males and females broke from their labor and began moving earth vala noted one woman climbing guiding shouting big mature with a voice to shatter rocks she caught a name moonwa perhaps the thurls primary wife metal payload shell and metal motor and wide timber running boards a hand thick a cruiser was heavy the ramp tended to crumble the cruisers went up one by one with the wall brushing their right sides and ten grass giant males lifting and steadying on the left how would they get the cruisers down the top was as wide as a cruiser wheelbase sentries guided them face your weapons starboardspin vampires come from there the wagonmasters placed their vehicles then met to confer kay asked whand anth what do you think shrapnel in the cannon they might bunch up they often do anthrantillin said have the giants gather some gravel save our shot this will be handgun work though spread out whandernothtee said thats what the giants want me too kaywerbrimmis said vala said the grass giants have crossbows why are they worried crossbows wont have the reach of guns but theyll outreach vampire scent the wagonmasters looked at each other anth said grass eaters oh no elsewhere theyre considered scary fighters whand said nobody answered whandernothtees cruiser and anthrantillins rolled off in opposite directions they were almost invisible in the rain and dark before the grass giant warriors stopped them kaywerbrimmis said barok you on the cannon but keep your guns handy im on handguns forn reload she was too young to be trusted to do more boss do you like the flamer vala said theyll never get that close i throw pretty good too flamer and fistbombs then i hope we do get to use the flamer itd help if we could show them another use for alcohol grass giants dont need our fuel they pull their own wagons vampires arent intelligent are they the ones near center city arent forn said in most languages its vampires not vampires they take the prefix for animals language wasnt kays interest do they charge boss one big wave i only fought vampires once thats one more than me i hear stories what was it like i was the only survivor valavirgillin said kay just stories do you know enough to use towels and fuel kays brow furrowed what and valas head whipped around at a sentrys bass call all was shadows now and a sound that might be wind through taut cords and the whisper of crossbows the grass giants were being chary of their bolts bullets werent replaceable either where there was no client race to make more vala couldnt see anything yet for the grass giants it would be no darker but these plains were their home a crossbow whispered and something pale stood up and fell over the wind picked up that wasnt wind song look for white forn called unnecessarily kay fired changed guns fired it was well that the cruisers were spaced far apart the flash of their handguns was blinding vala thought it over while the fire balloons in her eyes faded then she rolled under the cruiser and pulled the flamer and the net bag of fistbombs after let the cruiser shield her eyes from the flash and the cannon they were firing around her her sight was back there a pale hominid shape another she could see twenty and more one fell and the rest backed away already most of them must be beyond crossbow range their song plucked at her nerves cannon barok commented and she closed her eyes just as he fired fire was trying to light in the stubble there were pale bodies six eight thirty or forty vampires stood in plain view still in gun range she thought why would men with crossbows fear vampires because nobody had ever seen so many vampires together it was bizarre insane how could so many feed themselves high rangers trading group had died in a tower in a deserted city fortythree falans ago high rangers had fought no more than fifteen that night killed no more than eight all the rest had died and only a fluke had saved valavirgillin she remembered the song wafting up from the street the vampires pale naked beautiful the terror high rangers had fired from tenthfloor windows and posted sentries down along the stairwell one by one the sentries had disappeared and then kay said the winds blowing right barok said cannon she clenched her eyelids against the flash baroks cannon roared then one from farther away barely heard baroks voice was faint they could circle theyre not sapient kay said to left another distant cannon fired to right another vampires carried no tools wore no clothing reach into the lovely wealth of ashblond hair on a vampires corpse you would find too much hair around a small flat skull they built no cities formed no armies invented no encircling movements but the warriors on the wall were buzzing among themselves pointing firing bolts into the dark to spin and starboard and antispin kay theyve got noses barok looked down kay said what they dont have a battle plan valavirgillin said theyre just avoiding the smell of fifteen hundred grass giants served by a primitive sewer system its the same smell that brought them here when they get upwind of that the smell wont bother them anymore and then well be downwind from them ill get whandernothtee to move his cruiser around barok said and ran vala bellowed after him cloth and alcohol he came back what pour fuel into a towel just a splash tie it around your face it keeps the scent out tell whand kay spoke from overhead i still have targets here boss theyre not in throwing range you go tell anth to move tell him about towels and fuel then the grass giants might not know either boss remember i wanted to show them some use for fuel idiot she splashed a towel for herself and took two more with her this could turn urgent in the dark with a drop on either side she had to watch her footing it had stopped raining the song of the vampires rode the wind she breathed alcohol fumes from the towel around her face it made her dizzy she heard distantly cannon closed her eyes waited for the roar walked on toward a square shadow she called anthrantillin hes busy vala taratarafashts voice hell be very busy tarfa the vamps are circling round get your towels out splash them with fuel tie them over your mouths then move the truck a sixth around the arc valavirgillin i take my orders from anthrantillin fool woman get the cruiser into place or you can both tell it to the ghouls get a towel on anth too but first give me a fuel jar for the giants pause yes valavirgillin do you have enough towels the fuel jar was heavy valavirgillin was terribly conscious of the weapons she wasnt holding when the big shape loomed before her she was embarrassingly relieved the grass giant didnt turn how goes the defense valavirgillin vala said theyre circling us youll smell them in a minute tie this fowh what stink is that alcohol it moves our cruisers but it may save us tie this around your neck the guard didnt move didnt look at her he wouldnt insult an alien guest so valavirgillin has not spoken she didnt have time for games point me toward the thurl give me the cloth she threw it to him underhand he snorted in disgust but he was tying it around his neck he pointed then but shed already seen the shine of the bulls armor the bull looked at the cloth in her hands even as he backed away from the stink but why you dont know about vampires stories come to us vampires die easily enough and they dont think as for the rest should the cloth cover our ears why thurl so that they cannot sing us to our deaths not sound smell smell grass giants werent idiots but theyd been unlucky first somebody has to live through a vampire attack even if a child survives he wont know why the adults all went away she kay someone should have raised this subject no matter the rush vampires put out a mating scent thurl your lust rises and your brain turns off and you go the stink of your fuel it cures the problem but isnt there another problem we hear of you machine people and your empire of fuel you persuade other hominid species to make alcohol for your wagons they learn to drink it they lose interest in work and play and life itself anything but the fuel and they die young vala laughed vampire scent does all of that before you can take a hundred breaths still the thurl had a point do we want crossbowmen drunk while vampires circle the wall is fuel better try strong herbs when can you pick these herbs i have fuel now not tomorrow the bull turned from her and began bellowing orders most of the males were on the wall now but women began running bales of cloth appeared women climbed up the wall and along the top to the cruisers vala waited with what patience she could muster the bull roared come he entered an earthen building the second largest it was fabric stretched over the top of a dirt wall and one central pole here were tall heaps of dried grass but other plants too a thousand scents the bull crushed leaves under her nose she shied back a different leaf she sniffed gingerly another she said try all of those but try fuel too well find out what works best why do you store these the bull laughed flavoring these pepperleek and minch woman eats this makes her milk better did you think we eat only grass wilted or sour grass needs something for taste the bull gathered armfuls of plants and strode out bellowing she could have heard his roar in center city she thought his voice and the womens and presently the scuff of their big feet as they climbed vala retrieved her fuel bottle and climbed after from the top she watched the big shadows warriors motionless women moving among them distributing impregnated towels vala intercepted a big mature woman moonwa valavirgillin they kill by smell they do we dont know what smell protects best some men already have alcoholscented towels leave them those give the thurls plants to the rest well see see who dies eh vala walked on the alcohol fumes were making her a little giddy she could handle it and for that matter her towel was nearly dry this morning vala had been thinking that forn was mature enough to practice rishathra or perhaps to mate straight off forn had beaten that prediction she could hardly be remembering the smell of vampires shed recognized the scent of a lover that old scent of lust and death was into valavirgillins nose and nibbling on her brain the grass giant warriors were still shadows amid the moving shadows of women but they were fewer the grass giant women had noticed too breathy screams of rage and fear then two four ran down the embankment shouting for the thurl another ran the wrong way down moaning out onto the stubbly field vala moved among the remaining defenders sloshing fuel on towels women men whoever she could find haste would kill fuel would protect herbs well the smell of the thurls herbs might last longer in every direction she could see pale hominid shapes so little detail you had to imagine what they looked like and with the scent tickling your hindbrain you saw glorious fantasies they were closer why wasnt she hearing guns shed reached anthrantillins cruiser up onto the running board hello anth the payload shell was empty she used the trick lock and climbed into the payload shell all gone no damage no trace of a fight just gone soak a towel then the cannon the vampires were bunching nicely to spin bunching around anth or forn or himp somewhere down there it didnt matter she fired and saw half of them fall sometime during that night she heard a repeated whisper of sound anthrantillin gone she said and couldnt hear her own voice she screamed gone its valavirgillin and barely heard that her bellow his bellow reduced to whispers by the cannons earshattering roar it was time to move the cruiser the vampires had pulled way back here theyd learned not to bunch but she might find fresh prey elsewhere guns werent needed on the starboard and spin sides upwind from the vampires crossbows would reach them its kay are they all gone yes were low on firepower you plenty we wont have any fuel come morning no i set all mine out and told the women about it i thought moonwa the grass giant who was forcing towels on the warriors teach her to use the cannon do we want no boss no secrets take too long to train her anyway kays head rose into the cannoneers chamber he pulled out a jug of gunpowder hefted it with a grunt back to work do you need smallshot plenty of rocks he looked at her froze he set the jug down she slid down they moved together should have soaked that towel again she said unsteadily it was her last coherent thought for some time he not vala kay wriggled out of the door and splashed into mud in a blowing rain vala followed to snatch him back he ripped her shirt off she pressed herself against him but he howled and ripped it again and turned in her arms and turned back with two dripping half shirts and pushed one into her face and one into his own she breathed deeply of alcohol fumes choked all right he gave it to her he tied the other around his own neck im going back he said youd better fight your gun alone under the circumstances they laughed shakily are you safe alone have to try it she watched him go she should never never never have mated with another man her mind her self had washed away in a tide of lust what would tarb think of her mating with tarablilliast had never been so intense but now her mind was flowing back she was mated she lifted the towel to her face the alcohol went straight to her head and cleared it unless that was an illusion she looked along the wall and saw big shadows too few but some hominid shapes in the black fields were also fewer but very close they were taller more slender than her own species they sang they implored they were bunched almost beneath the cruiser she climbed up and loaded her cannon chapter two recovery a pale light was growing lighter to spin the song was over vala hadnt heard a crossbow twang in some time vampires had become hard to find unnoticed the dreadful night had ended if she had ever been this tired exhaustion must have wiped the memory clean and here was kaywerbrimmis asking do you have any smallshot left some we never got our gravel barok and forn were both gone when i got back to the cruiser vala rubbed her eyes there didnt seem to be anything to say whandernothtee and sopashintay came up leaning on each other whand said what a night spash said chit liked the singing overmuch we had to tie him up i think i put too much fuel in his towel hes sleeping like like i would if i could just she hugged herself just stop jittering sleep and several hundred grass giant males were expecting i couldnt handle rishathra now vala said shed put off the memory of mating with kay that could have consequences kaywerbrimmis said sleep in the cruisers at least for tonight hello his hand on her shoulder turned her around company nine grass giants and a suit of silver armor had come among them you could see their exhaustion and smell it the thurl asked how is it with you machine people half of us are missing valavirgillin said whand said thurl we never expected so many we thought we had weapons for anything travelers tell that vampires sing us to our doom kay said half of wisdom is learning what to unlearn we were prepared for the wrong enemy vampire scent we never guessed but weve set the vampires running the thurl boomed shall we hunt them through the grass whand threw up his arms and staggered away vala and kay and spash looked at each other if grass giant warriors could still fight whand was done used up but someone had to stand up for the machine people they trailed the warriors down into the wet stubble shapes stirred at the foot of the wall two hominids naked crossbows and guns swung around arms batted them aside voices barked no not vampires a big woman and a little male were helping each other to stand not vampires no a grass giant woman and barok sabarokareshs face was slack with a terror too deep to touch surface he looked at valavirgillin as if she were the ghost not he half mad dirty exhausted scarred alive i thought i was tired vala thumped his shoulder glad to feel him solid under her hand where was his daughter she didnt ask she said you must have quite a tale to tell later the thurl spoke to the crossbowman paroom paroom led pulled barok and the grass giant woman up the slope the thurl moved at a trot away from the wall to starboardspin his people followed and then the machine people a night of sleepless terror and wild mating had left them all without strength they passed vampire corpses none of their beauty survived into death a grass giant stopped to examine a female skewered by a crossbow spash stopped too vala remembered doing that fortythree falans ago first you smell rotting flesh then the other scent explodes under your mind the grass giant lurched clear he stayed head down vomiting then slowly straightened still hiding his face spash straightened suddenly then wobbled toward vala and hid her face against her shoulder valavirgillin said spash you havent done anything love it feels like you want to mate with a corpse but thats not your mind talking not my mind vala if we cant examine them we cant learn about them its part of what makes them so scary lust and the smell of rotting meat do not belong together in one brain vampires near the wall had crossbow bolts in them farther out they were chewed by balls or smallshot vala saw that machine people had scored as many kills as a hundred times as many grass giants two hundred paces beyond the wall they werent finding vampires any more dead grass giants lay naked or half clothed gaunt with sunken eyes and cheeks and savage wounds in their necks wrists elbows that slack face vala had seen this woman run out into the dark hours ago where were the wounds her throat seemed untouched left arm thrown wide wrist unmarred right arm across her body no blood on the ruckedup tunic vala stepped forward and lifted her right hand her armpit was torn and bloody a grass giant man turned and wobbled back toward the wall retching big woman small vampire couldnt reach her neck spash is right we have to learn farther along bright cloth lay near the grass border vala began to run then stopped as suddenly that was taratarafashts work suit vala picked it up it was clean no blood no groundin dirt why had tarfa been brought so far where was she the thurl had outrun his party by a good distance hed almost reached uncut grass how much did that armor weigh he scrambled up a tenpacehigh knoll then paused at the top waiting while the rest straggled up no sign of vampires he said theyve gone to cover somewhere travelers say they cant stand sunlight kay said that tales true the thurl continued then id say theyre gone nobody spoke the thurl boomed beedj thurl a male trotted up mature bigger than most eager indecently energetic with me beedj tarun youll circle and meet us on the other side if youre not there ill assume you found a fight yes beedj and the thurl went one way the rest of the giants went the other vala dithered then followed the thurl the thurl noticed her he slowed and let her catch up beedj would have waited too but the thurls gesture sent him on the thurl said we wont find live vampires hiding in the grass grass grows straight up night slides across the sun but the sun never moves not anymore where can a vampire hide from sunlight vala asked do you remember when the sun moved i was a child a frightening time he didnt seem frightened enough vala thought louis wu had been among these people but what louis had told valavirgillin he didnt seem to have told them its a ring he said the arch is the part of the ring youre not standing on the sun has started to wobble because the ring is off center in several falans the ring will brush the sun but i swear i will stop it or die trying later the sun had stopped wobbling beedj was still jogging stopping here and there to examine bodies swinging his sword to cut a swath of grass to see what it hid eating what he cut as he resumed his patrol he was burning more energy than the thurl vala had seen no challenge between them easy command and easy submission but she became sure that she was watching the next thurl she nerved herself to ask thurl did an unknown hominid come among you claiming to be from a place in the sky the thurl stared in the sky he could hardly have forgotten but he might hide secrets a male wizard bald narrow face bronze skin straight black scalp hair taller than my kind and narrow in the shoulders and hip fingertips lifted and stretched the corners of her eyes eyes like this he boiled a sea hereabouts to end a plague of mirrorflowers the thurl was nodding it was done by the old thurl with this louis wus help but how do you come to know about that louis wu and i traveled together far to port of here without sunlight the mirrorflowers couldnt defend themselves he said the clouds though they never went away they never did we seeded our grass just as the wizard told us smeerps and other burrowers moved in well ahead of us wherever we went we found mirrorflowers eaten at the roots grass doesnt grow well in this murk so at first we had to eat mirrorflowers the reds who fed their herds from our grass in my fathers time and fought us when we objected they followed us into new grassland gleaners hunted the burrowers water people moved back up the rivers that the mirrorflowers had taken what of the vampires it seems they did well too vala grimaced the thurl said there was a region we all avoided vampires need refuge from daylight a cave system trees anything when the clouds came they feared the sun less they traveled farther from their lair we know no more than that we should ask the ghouls do you machine people talk to ghouls the thurl didnt quite like that idea they keep their own company but ghouls know where the dead have fallen they must know where the vampires hunt and where they hide during the day ghouls only act at night i would not know how to talk to a ghoul its done vala was trying to remember but her mind wasnt working well tired its done a new religion pops up or an old priest dies and then its a rite of ordeal for the new shaman the ghouls must know and accept what rites he demands for the dead the bull nodded ghouls would carry out funeral rites for any religion within obvious limits how then you have to get their attention court them anything works but theyre coy thats a test too a new priest wont be taken seriously until hes dealt with the ghouls the bull was bristling court them my people came here as merchants thurl the ghouls have something we want knowledge what do we have that the ghouls want not much ghouls own the world arch and all just ask them court them it grated how what had she heard tales told at night not much in the way of business dealings but shed seen and talked to ghouls ghouls work the shadow farm under a cluster of floating buildings far to port we pay them in tools and the city builders give them library privileges theyll deal for information we dont know anything nearly true what else have we got the thurl said oh valavirgillin this is nasty stuff what the thurl waved about him in view were nearly a hundred vampire corpses all lying near the wall and half as many grass giant dead scattered from the crossbow limit to the uncut grass beedj was examining a smaller corpse he saw he had her attention and he lifted the head so that vala could see its face it was himapertharee of anthrantillins crew a shudder rippled along valas spine but the thurl was right she sad ghouls must feed more than that if these thousand corpses were left to lie there would be plague all would blame the ghouls the ghouls must come to clean up but why will they listen to me vala shook her head it felt stuffed with cotton what then after we know where the vampires lair attack them ourselves the ghouls might tell us that too the thurl broke into a run vala saw beedj waving holding what at that moment he shook it violently then flung it away and hurled himself in the other direction where it fell it writhed and went quiet though beedj was howling it was a living vampire beedj called thurl im sorry it was alive wounded just the bolt through its hip i thought we might talk to it examine it anything but but the smell calm yourself beedj was the smell sudden you attack it defends what like a fart sometimes controlled sometimes not thurl im not sure resume your patrol beedjs sword slashed viciously at the grass the thurl walked on vala had been thinking she said you must set a delegation among the dead a tent a few of your men wed find them sucked empty in the morning no i think its safe for tonight and tomorrow night the vampires have hunted this area out and theyd smell their own dead even so arm your people and mmm send men and women together valavirgillin i know your custom but if the vampires sing best your people mate with each other should she be saying this she surely would not have spoken thus before other grass giants the bull snarled but yes yes and what the thurl does not see did not happen so the thurl beckoned at beedj he asked vala will farsight trading join us we should support you two species in need will speak louder than one farsight trading could roll away from most problems but not this theyd poured most of their fuel into towels three species then many gleaners died the night before last the gleaners will wait with us should we be more yet vampires must have hunted among the reds worth a try beedj came up the thurl began talking much faster than vala could follow beedj tried to argue then acquiesced we should sleep during the day vala said her body was crying for sleep something closed on her wrist boss she jerked awake her squeak was intended as a scream she rolled away and sat up and it was only kaywerbrimmis boss what have you been telling the bull she was still groggy she needed a drink and a bath or that rattle was it rain and a flash and boom that was certainly thunder shed pulled off her filthy clothing before she slept she slid out of the blankets out of the payload shell into the cool rain kay watched from the gun room as she danced in the rain consequences traders didnt mate they shared rishathra with the species they met but mating was something else you didnt get a business partner pregnant and you didnt engage in sexual dominance games and you didnt fall in love but in far realms among strange hominids you couldnt shun each other either she beckoned and shouted wash with me what time is it coming on dusk we slept a long time kay was pulling off his clothes in something like relief i thought wed need this time to arm against vampires well do that hows barok dont know they drank washed each other dried each other and were reassured the mating urge could be resisted the rain stopped you could see wind driving the last flurries across the stubble swaths of navyblue sky showed through blowing broken clouds and a sudden narrow vertical line of bluewhite dashes vala gaped she hadnt seen the arch in four rotations by glow of archlight she could see patterns in the grass stubble an arc of pale rectangles a tent erected within the arc grass giants moved back and forth and a handful of much smaller hominids moved with them on the rectangles sheets they were laying out bodies did you tell them to do that no not a bad idea though vala said in anthrantillins deserted cruiser they found barok with a woman twice his size he seemed abnormally subdued but he was smiling wemb my partners valavirgillin and kaywerbrimmis folk this is wemb kay started to say i would have thought baroks laugh was not quite sane yes and you wouldve been right if you would have thought we slept wemb cut in sleeping here together protects each against intent of the rest against yet more rishathra we were lucky in each other groping through his exhausted mind barok found another thought forn you never found foranayeedli vala said shes gone baroks body rippled an uncontrollable shudder his hand closed on valas wrist i shouted down at her load nothing she was gone i stepped out to look for her to stop her if she followed the singing stepped out and my mind turned off i was at the foot of the wall and the rain was hammering me into the ground someone stumbled into me knocked me in the mud wemb we rishathra isnt a strong enough word wemb took him by the shoulder and turned him toward her shared love or even mated but we must say rishathra barok truly we must tore our clothes away and rished and rished and our minds seeped back to us with not a heartbeat to spare a half circle of those pale things was closing on us the rain must have washed away some of the scent i saw crossbows lying all around us grass giant warriors have been stumbling down the wall all night long dropping crossbows and anything else theyre carrying we picked up crossbows the grass giant woman cut in i saw makee lying dead with a vampire in his arms and a bolt through both of them and his quiver dropped beside him picked up the quiver and dumped it and pushed a handful of bolts at barok and shot the nearest vampire then the next at first i couldnt cock the crossbow then the next is that why you were screaming we never talked till after scream and pull scream for strength barok said your cursed tools arent built for tiny little machine people vala asked you were out there all night wemb nodded barok said when the rain started to slack off i got us towels there were heaps of towels his grip was painful kay vala we saw why warriors walked past us wemb said i shot heerst in the leg but he just kept walking following the singing vampires came up to him and pulled the towel off his face and led him away hes my son if something is covering your face they pull it off heerst was using fuel in his towel rain washes it out we looked for towels that had wemb pepperleek minch yes those kept their scent they kept us alive the towels and the rishathra any time it was too much for us we rished and crossbow bolts the guards were dropping their swords and crossbows but not their quivers we had to go looking rob the dead i saw what i didnt understand wemb said i should tell the thurl vampires rished with some of us then led them away into the high grass and farther why keep them alive are they still alive vala said the ghouls might know ghouls keep ghoul secrets wemb said the clouds had closed again in the dark barok said i shot the vampire who was leading anth away it took two bolts another picked up the song and i shot her anth followed a third woman and by that time he was out of range they led him into the grass i never saw him again should i have shot him they only looked at him i cant keep vigil with you barok said i cant face rishathra now my head is too i dont know if i can make you see they squeezed his arms and tried to assure him that they understood they left him there chapter three the gathering storm the tent huddled beneath the walk but faced outward into an arc of gray sheets the corpses were laid headtohead two giants to a sheet or four vampires giants had found anthrantillin and his crewman himapertharee and laid them out on one sheet taratarafasht and foranayeedli must be still missing another sheet held six tiny gleaner dead the giants had nearly finished making their patterns tiny hominids moved about them not helping much but carrying food or light loads all wore sheets with holes in them for the head to poke through a grass giant could lift a vampire with no difficulty it took two to carry a dead giant but beedj was carrying a dead grass giant woman across his back he rolled the woman off his shoulders to slump across a sheet perfectly placed he took her hand and spoke to her sadly vala changed her mind about disturbing him two women finished laying out more vampire dead one approached we rubbed pepperleek along the rims of the sheets stop small scavengers moonwa said to the three machine people big scavengers we can crossbow ghouls wont have to fight for whats theirs a polite notion valavirgillin said tables would have raised the dead out of a scavengers reach but where would grass giants find wood what can i do for you moonwa asked weve come to keep vigil with you the battle cost you too much no ghouls come on the first night rest vala said but it was my idea after all thurls idea moonwa informed her vala nodded and carefully didnt smile it was a social convention as in louis wu helped the thurl boil a sea she waved toward the little hominids who are these moonwa called perilack silack manack coriack four small heads lifted these are more allies kaywerbrimmis valavirgillin whandernothtee the gleaners smiled and bobbed their heads but they didnt come up at once they moved off to where grass giants were carefully stripping their sheets off inside out well away from the dead and the tent then picking up scythes and crossbows the gleaners stripped off their contaminated sheets then hung slender swords behind their backs beedj approached sheetless and armed towels under the tent we rubbed minch on them he said welcome to all gleaners stood armpithigh to machine people navelhigh to beedj and moonwa their faces were hairless and pointed their smiles were wide and toothy a bit much they wore tunics of cured smeerpskin with the beige fur left on lavishly decorated with feathers on the women perilack and coriack the feather patterns formed smallish wings the women had to walk with some care to protect them manack and silack looked much like the women their clothing showed greater differences feathered but with arms free to swing or fight rain spattered down just enough to send the machine people into the tent vala saw grass piled thickly on the floor grass for bedding and to feed the grass giants she stopped her companions until they had taken off their sandals already it was dark enough that vala could barely see faces rishathra was best begun in the night but not on a battlefield this is a bad business perilack said whandernothtee asked how many have you lost nearly two hundred by now we were only ten four are gone sopashintay and chitakumishad we left on guard above us with the cannon barok is recovering from a night in hell our queens man went with the thurls woman to bring other hominids to bargain if the the little womans eyes flickered about her lords of the night do not speak other voices will join ours tomorrow legend told that the ghouls heard any word spoken of them unless some said during broad daylight the ghouls might be all about them even now kay asked would your queens man truly rish with his traveling companions the four gleaners tittered beedj and moonwa boomed their laughter a little woman perilack said to kay if the grass giant women would notice size matters but you you and we might make something happen perilack and kaywerbrimmis looked at each other as if both taken by the same notion the little woman took kays elbow kays arm brushed the gleaners feathers he suggested i expect you accumulate these faster than you can use them she said no the skins spoil quickly we can trade a few not many what if we could find a way to delay the spoilage from time to time valavirgillin would catch a foul whiff of battlefield stench and snort it out but the smells werent reaching kaywerbrimmis not him kay was into trader mode his mind was in a place where win and lose were a matter of numbers where discomfort was an embarrassment one could not afford where an empire survived because one hominids trash was anothers ore bed full night had fallen but by the faint flash of an arc of daylit arch she saw beedjs broad grin she asked the grass giant have you watched bargaining sessions some louis wu came when i was a child but agreements were all between him and the old thurl the reds made peace with us thirty falans ago we parceled up habitats twentyfour falans ago we gathered with the reds and sea people shared maps all peoples have learned things about the new territory but all find grass giants awkwardly large a polite disclaimer would not be believed vala reached up to grasp elbows with the grass giant shed been listening for ghouls in the night but the only sound was the rain the clouds had closed it had become full dark one of the gleaner men asked should we only wait would they find that more polite manack wasnt it hair thicker around the throat as if he were an alpha male and silack a beta in a good many hominid species one male got most of the action but vala didnt know that about gleaners vala said manack were here in their habitat you may even consider that weve come to entertain the lords of the night will you share rishathra to beedj she quickly added beedj this is for size to leave me larger i expect whand will go with moonwa first though kay and perilack she noticed were no longer talking business philosophies differ to rish with a gleaner male was no more than foreplay rishathra with the thurls heir was something else again it had its pleasures he was big he was very eager he was very proud of his selfrestraint though it was right at the edge of his control he was very big kaywerbrimmis was having a wonderful night or seemed to be he was sharing some joke or secret with moonwa now good trader that one a generally good man vala kept looking in his direction theyd mated vala couldnt get her mind out of that mode shouldnt try really it was a good mindset for a rishathra party still mating is a matter of order eons of evolution have shaped many hominids mating responses approach scents postures and positions visual and tactile cues culture shapes more dances cliques styles permitted words and phrases but evolution never touches sex outside ones species and rishathra is always an art form where shapes dont fit other shapes might be found those who cannot participate can watch can give ribald advice can stand guard for that matter when a traders body or mind needs a rest the night was almost silent but not every whisper was wind ghouls should be out there it was their duty but if for any reason word hadnt reached them of a corpsestrewn battlefield then those sounds might be vampires vala perched on a stool three paces high and sturdy enough for a grass giant the night was warm enough for nakedness or she was but loaded guns were on her back before her was blowing rain and little else to see at her back any excitement had died for the moment we and the grass giants we love each other but were not mere parasites one of the gleaners was saying wherever there once were mirrorflower forests there are plant eaters now prey that can feed us we forage ahead of the thurls people we probe we guide we make their maps manack that was he was a bit small to accommodate even a machine people woman and inexperienced but he could learn the proper attitude was easy for some others never learned it mating has consequences a hominids response to mating is not of the mind rishathra has no consequences and the mind may remain in command embarrassment is inappropriate laughter is always to be shared rishathra is entertainment and diplomacy and friendship and knowing that you can reach your weapons in the dark we hope to make our fortunes kay was saying those who extend the empire are welltreated the empire grows with our fuel supply if we can persuade a community to make fuel and sell it to the empire the bonus would let each of us raise a family moonwa said those rewards are yours your client tribes face something else loss of ambition loss of friends and mates delusion and early death for any who learn to drink your fuel some are too weak to say enough moonwa you must be stronger than that of course i can do that tonight now enough kaywerbrimmis vala turned to see white grins large and small beedj said i wore one of your fuel wetted towels last night it made me dizzy it threw my aim off kay gracefully changed the subject valavirgillin will you return to center city mate and raise a family i mated she said kay suddenly had nothing to say he didnt know what had he been thinking that he and she would be come formal mates valavirgillin said i made myself rich with a gift from louis wu of the ball people how she had done that was nobodys business and illegal i mated then tarbs parents were friends of my family as is usual with us moonwa he had little money but hes a good father he freed me to engage in business dealings i grew restive i remembered that louis wu suggested no asked if my people make tools from the sludge that remains after we distill alcohol plastic he said his talking thing would not translate but i learned his word he said it means shapeless plastic can take any shape the maker likes that sludge is useless nasty stuff clients might be grateful if we had a reason to haul it away for them so i funded a chemical laboratory she shrugged in the dark always it cost more than anyone expected but we got answers there are secrets in that goo one day most of my money was gone tarablilliast and the children are with my sirefamily and i am here until i can feed them again coriack are you ready to take guard of course hold the thought whandernothtee vala whats out there rain i glimpse something black and shiny sometimes and i hear tittering no smell of vampires good moonwa had lapsed into grass giant language and was making jokes that set beedj roaring in the gray light of morning the gleaners spoke together waved at the brightening land then more or less fell over in a pile do you think they came spash asked nobody in particular and he stepped out of the tent whand said i dont care lets sleep they came spash said vala stepped out it was moments before she realized that one sheet was empty which far left six gleaner dead the rest were untouched beedj came forth briskly swinging his scythesword more giants were coming down the earth wall they conferred then fanned out to explore looking for evidence of what the ghouls hod done but vala climbed up the wall to sleep in the payload shell at midday she woke ravenous with the smell of roasting meat in her nostrils she followed the smells down to the tent she found gleaners and machine people together the gleaners had been hunting the fire they had made to cook their kills barok and whand had used to make bread from local grass we eat four five six meals in a day silack told her pint says you eat once a day yes but a lot are you finding enough meat when your men came down to eat ours went to hunt more eat what you see the hunters will be back the flatbread was a good effort and vala complimented the men smeerp meat was good too if a bit lean and tough at least the gleaners didnt have a habit found in other hominids changing the flavor of meat by rubbing it with salt or herbs or berries vala wondered about breeding smeerps in other places but all traders knew the answer to that one hominids local bounty was anothers plague with no local predators to restrict their numbers smeerps would be eating somebodys crops breeding beyond their food source then vectoring diseases when starvation weakened them meanwhile she had eaten everything in sight gleaners and machine people alike were watching her in amusement silack said heavy exercise last night did i miss anything kay said the ghouls were active there arent any dead grass giants between the wall and the tall grass beedj found neat piles of bones in the grass they didnt touch the vampires saved them for tonight i guess considerate of them with their dead gone the grass giants mourning was over except more considerate if they would take the rest of our dead anything else silack pointed it wasnt raining now the clouds formed an infinite flat roof way high you could see a long way across the veldt what vala could see was a sizable beastdrawn wagon plodding toward grass giant domains five great bigshouldered beasts more than that highsided wagon needed though it was big it will be here well before dusk even so if your species can sleep in spurts you will have time vala nodded and climbed up the wall to sleep some more paroom was riding in the guide seat beside a much smaller redskinned man three more reds rode in the enclosed space beneath they stopped the wagon just under the wall near the opening they lifted a thing out of the wagon bed vala squinted trying to see something almost invisible her mercenary instincts raced along her nerves gibbering at the fall of the cities flying vehicles were the most common of fallen objects this curved transparent sheet was the kind of thing people found in fallen cars most were shattered this one looked intact its value must be immense the reds came forward carrying it at the corners each carried a sword nearly as long as himself hung from his back in a leather sheath they wore dyed leather kilts and leather backpacks men and women both though brighter colors adorned the womens their teeth were pointed all of them a double row of canines valavirgillin kaywerbrimmis moonwa the thurl in full armor manack and coriack waited to greet them the group had been pruned a little thurl this is a window one red male said solemnly it is a gift from the marsh people who cannot go from where they live they beg that we shall ward them from the spreading plague of vampires the marsh people cannot flee for only the marsh gives them life valavirgillin caught the thurls questioning look we know species like that she said marsh desert one side of a mountain a forest that is all one kind of tree their bellies have changed to accept only one food or they cannot survive cold or heat or too little moisture in the air or too much but this is a magnificent gift it is we will do what we can for the marsh people the thurl said these our allies were able to reach us and the thurl made introduction speaking slowly pronouncing the names of gleaners and machine people with varying accuracy i am tegger hookithandarthal the red male said this is warvia hookimurf thandarthal we travel with anakrin hookiwhanhurhur and chaychind hookikarashk the other two reds had moved away to tend to the loadbeasts the thurl asked how do your people deal with rishathra we cannot said warvia and did not amplify paroom grinned and vala grinned back picturing the male grass giants disappointment the thurl as host spoke for all as protocol required but briefly what point in enlarging upon a guests skill at rishathra for a species that couldnt do that at all tegger and warvia merely nodded when he fell silent the other red males were not even listening they were examining the vampire corpses lying on one sheet and chattering at high speed tegger and warvia looked much alike their red skins were smooth their faces were hairless they wore kilts of soft leather with decorative lacing they were as tall as machine people but much thinner big ears stood out from narrow heads their teeth seemed to be not filed but grown that way warvia had breasts but almost flat we never hear of so many vampires found together warvia said you killed an army tegger said vampires lie everywhere your neighbors must be glad warvia asked the ghouls have they come the thurl said an army of vampires came the night before last an army was gone when the shadow withdrew from the sun you have seen the dead they left behind but our own dead have gone with the ghouls they were half as many or a bit more plus a hundred of gleaners and four of our machine people the vampires are a terrible foe welcome to you we have seen nothing of the terror tegger said young hunters disappear our teachers lose their skill we said or some new hunting thing has found us paroom if we did show disbelief forgive us paroom nodded graciously the thurl said what we knew of vampires was half false the machine people empire came in time to help us vala was beginning to realize that no other grass giant could say such a thing to disparage the tribe was to disparage the thurl we must show you our defenses he continued but have you eaten should you cook while there is still light we eat our meat uncooked we like variety grass giants eat no meat but what of gleaners and machine people may we share let us show you what we have they had five loadbeasts and the cage atop their wagon the thing in the cage felt their gaze and roared it was a beast as massive as a grass giant and a killer vala realized she asked what is that hakarrch tegger said with visible pride a hunter of the barrier hills two were sent us by the gardener people for our sport hunted outside its familiar terrain the male still killed one of us before we brought it down it was a brag mighty hunters we are we hunt the lesser hunters and well hunt your vampires vala suggested perilack shall we sample this not tonight but tomorrow at our one meal the gleaner woman said bargain warvia tonight you may kill a loadbeast tomorrow and after let us play host we will feed all until the shadows edge had bitten a piece from the sun but the light was still bright eaters of the dead deign to speak youll want to taste smeerp meat we thank you the fire had become the only light not enough light to cook but the cooking was over of the other reds anakrin hookiwhanhurhur was an old man wrinkled but still agile chaychind hookikarashk another male was badly scarred and had lost an arm in some old battle they had brought a gift of their own a sizable ceramic jug of a strong dark beer not bad at all vala saw kay react too lets see how kay handles it kay exclaimed do you make this yourselves do you make a lot yes do you think of trade chaychind it might be worth moving if its cheap enough tales of the machine people are not exaggerated kay looked flustered too bad but vala had better step in kaywerbrimmis means that if we can distill enough of this we would have fuel for our cruisers our cruisers carry weapons and can carry much more they move faster than loadbeasts but they cannot move without fuel a gift you want chaychind asked while tegger exclaimed you would boil our beer for fuel gifts for the war all must contribute grass giant fighters gleaner spies your fuel our eyes ah we know of no species that can see as far as any red herder your eyes our cruisers our cannon our flamers can you contribute three hundred manweights of beer to the war against the vampires it would distill to thirty manweights of fuel we carry a distilling system simple enough to be copied warvia exclaimed thats enough to souse whole civilizations but tegger asked what size of manweights hah vala said your size tegger had asked the obvious question but it implied agreement and a machine people manweight would have been a sixth higher im thinking of taking two cruisers leave the third here let the thurl fuel the third cruiser whand and chit can supervise that kay said oh shed wondered why both were absent theyve had enough boss spash is wavering too sos barok any foray would be to murder selves red warvia said unless we can know our enemy have the ghouls spoken the thurl said some bodies are gone and shrugged were paying for our good manners vala said a trader must know how to project her voice on demand the bodies we guarded from vermin the lords of the night will take last they took our gleaner dead because they died a day earlier the night would hear her tonight kay and whand were on the wall with barok watching over them with the cannon spash and chit had traded places with them this night looked to be less exhausting but less joyful too the gleaners and machine people and an undersized grass giant woman named twuk tried to get something going the thurl kept his armor on the four red herders watched gleefully from beyond touching distance and chattered in their own language and it all sort of fell apart the reds werent unfriendly they might be a little stiff around the thurl himself but around others they were relaxed and talkative spash and three reds were trading stories now the reds had considerable experience with hominids despite their handicap vala listened idly the reds were guided by their diet they ate live meat and they were herdergourmets herding one lifeform rarely two was easier than trying to keep several types of meatbeast together the red tribes mapped their routes to cross each others paths to trade feasts they traded stories too and met hominids in a variety of environments now they were speaking of two types of water people apparently not the same two vala was familiar with the fourth red tegger was on watch with chit the thurl was asleep in full armor he clearly wasnt interested in rishathra or ghouls either vala thought sopashintay lay propped against a tent pole i wonder what its like inside the wall tonight she said vala considered the thurls out here beedj is in there on defense what the thurl does not see did not happen spash came up on an elbow where did you hear that from the thurl the beta males are doing a lot of mating i expect and some fighting too i suppose were missing all the fun again in my case spash said but they wouldnt rish anyway if they can mate and i can use the rest so can the thurl he sleeps like a neardormant volcano spash said chit looked at the women and smiled and stepped lightly out of the tent a dense mist cloaked the night chit picked up a bone from dinner and threw it vala heard a tiny muffled tock a silver bulk was at her shoulders sensed but never heard the thurl sniffed while his hands cocked a crossbow without sound or effort he said they are not near vampires or night people chitakumishad did you see anything smell anything nothing the thurl seemed exceedingly alert for one who had been sleeping moments ago he pulled his helm closed and stepped out a grass giant guard tarun followed him spash said i had it wrong didnt i but why vala whispered reds theyre the ancient enemy and theyre all around him thats why he kept his armor on and thats why he pretends to sleep bet on it in the morning there were no dead between the wall and the tall grass save for those that lay on sheets the ghouls had taken vala at her word it seemed chaychind asked of nobody in particular where shall we turn the hakarrch loose coriak looked at manack the gleaner female said just short of the tall grass but let me tell my companions first vala will your people hunt too i think not but ill ask she spoke to the others none were eager machine people did eat meat but predator meat generally had a rank flavor but kay said well look timid if someone doesnt join the hunt ask some questions she told him that thing looked dangerous the more you know the less often you get killed hed never heard the proverb he stared laughed then said we want to bring it to less than once yes she slept through the hunt at midday she woke to share in the meal kaywerbrimmis bore a single slash along his forearm the fool vala bound it with a fuelsoaked towel hakarrch meat had a flavor of cat the dead were fewer but the stench of them hovered about the tent and the dreadful night was coming the ghouls would take her at her word she thought the bodies we guarded from vermin the lords of the night will take last tonight chapter four the people of the night when shadow had nearly covered the sun vala found the gleaners and reds around a fire the gleaners were eating they offered to share the reds had eaten their kills as they were made a fine rain began to sizzle on the coals the negotiators retreated into the tent valavirgillin chitakumishad and sopashintay for the machine people three of the reds the four gleaners anakrin hookiwanhurhur and the thurl and a woman vala didnt know were already inside stale grass had been replaced with fresh the thurl spoke his powerful voice cutting through all conversation folk meet my negotiator waast who has a tale to tell waast stood gracefully for so large a woman paroom and i went to starboard two days ago on foot she said paroom returned with these reds of ginjerofers folk i followed on foot with a guard of red warriors to speak to the muddy river people the muddy river people cannot join us here but they may speak of our sorrows to the night people theyll have the same trouble we did coriack said waast sat to the reds she said you cannot practice rishathra but mating it is not my time warvia said primly anakrin and chaychind were grinning tegger seemed angry many hominid species were monogamous exclusive of rishathra of course tegger and warvia must be mates and the thurl was saying i must wear my armor we know not what might visit us too bad they might have gotten some entertainment going spash asked uneasily do you hear music that isnt vampire music the sound was still soft but growing louder almost painfully near the upper end of her hearing range vala felt the hair stir on her neck and down her spine she was hearing a wind instrument and strings and a thuttering percussion instrument no voices the thurl lowered his helm and stepped out a crossbow was in his hand pointed at the sky chit and silack stayed at either side of the door their weapons readied others in the tent were arming themselves tiny silack walked backward into the tent the smell came with him carrion and wet fur two big hominid shapes followed and then the much bigger thurl we have guests he boomed in the tent it was almost totally dark vala could make out the gleam of the ghouls eyes and teeth and two black silhouettes against a scarcely brighter glow archlight seeping through clouds but her eyes were adjusting picking out detail there were two a man and a woman hair covered them almost everywhere it was black and straight and slick with the rain their mouths were overly wide grins showing big spade teeth they wore pouches on straps and were otherwise naked their big blunt hands were empty they were not eating vala was terribly relieved even as she resisted the impulse to shy back likely enough none but valavirgillin had ever seen one of these some were reacting badly chit remained in the door on guard facing away spash was on her feet not cringing but it seemed the limit of her selfcontrol silack of the gleaners tegger and chaychind all cringed away with wide eyes and open mouths she had to do something she stood and bowed welcome i am valavirgillin of the machine people weve waited to beg your help these are anakrin and warvia of the red herders perilack and manack of the gleaners chitakumishad and sopashintay of the machine people picking them out as and when she thought they had recovered their aplomb the ghoul male didnt wait we know your various kinds i am something breathy his lips didnt close completely otherwise he was fluent in the trade dialect his accent more like kays than valas but call me harpster for the instrument i play my mate is something breathy and whistling not unlike the music that was still playing outside grieving tube how do you practice rishathra tegger had been cowering now he was beside his mate instantly we cannot he said the ghoul woman half hid a laugh harpster said we know be at ease the thurl spoke directly to grieving tube these are under my protection my armor may come off if you can speak for our safety after that you need only have care for my size and waast only smiled at harpster but vala could admire her for the nerve that took the gleaners were in a line all four standing tall our kind does practice rishathra coriack said vala longed for her home somewhere she would have found food for her mate and children and as for her love of adventure a person could set that aside for a time too late now rishathra binds our empire valavirgillin told the lords of the night harpster said truth was that rishathra bound the city builders empire fuel binds yours we do practice rishathra but not tonight i think because we can guess how it would disturb the red herders we are not so fragile warvia said and for another reason harpster said do you have a request to make of us they all tried to speak at once vampires you see the terror the deaths the thurl had a voice to cut through all that vampires have devastated all species in a territory ten daywalks across help us to end their menace two or three daywalks no more harpster said vampires need to reach shelter after a raid still a large territory housing more than a ten of hominid species but they feed us well grieving tube said gently her voice pitched a little higher than her companions the problem you face is that we have no problem what is good for any of you is good also for the people of the night the vampires feed us as surely as the lust for alcohol among your client species valavirgillin but if you can conquer the vampires that serves us too did they realize how much they had revealed in a few breaths of speech but too many others were speaking at once and vala held silence for your understanding grieving tube said consider manack what if your queen had a quarrel with the thurls people you might persuade us not to touch any dead who lie near the thurls walls soon he must surrender manack protested but we and the grass giants we would never of course not but warvia you and the old thurl were at war fifty falans ago suppose your leader ginjerofer had begged us to tear apart any grass giants who came to kill their cattle warvia said very well we understand do you we must not side with any hominid against any other you all depend on us without the people of the night your corpses lie where they fall diseases form and spread your water becomes polluted the ghoul woman sang in her high pitched breathy voice she had made this speech before we forbid cremation but suppose we did not what if every species had the fuel to burn their dead clouds still lid this sky fortythree falans after a sea was boiled what if that were the smoke of the burned dead a stench growing richer every falan do you know how many hominids of every species die in a falan we do we cannot choose sides chaychind hookikarashk had been flushing a darker red how can you speak of siding with vampires with animals they dont think said harpster and you do but can you always say that so surely we know of hominids just at the edge of thinking several just along this arc of the arch some use fire if they find it or form packs when prey is large and formidable one strips branches into spears one lives in water they cannot use fire but they flake rocks for knives how do you judge where do you draw the line vampires dont use tools or fire not fire but tools under this endless rain vampires have learned to wear clothing stripped from their prey when they are dry they leave it like garbage the ghoul woman said you see why we should not rish with you if we must refuse your other desires grieving tube did not see chose not to see the mixed emotions that statement generated well she must try something vala said your help would be of immense value if you had reason to give it already you have told us the reach of vampire depredations and that they must return to their lair that they have one single lair what else could you tell us harpster shrugged and vala winced his shoulders were terribly loose like unconnected bones rolling freely under his skin she continued stubbornly i have heard a rumor a story a fable the machine people hear it where vampires are known you must understand that to our client species far from center city theres no real explanation of how all these vampires appeared so suddenly they have a high breeding rate harpster noted grieving tube said yes and clusters of them split from the main body to find other refuges ten daywalks was not too large a guess the others even chaychind were letting vala speak vala said but a less sensible explanation spreads too the victim of a vampire will rise from the dead to become a vampire himself that said harpster is purest nonsense and of course it was of course it is but it explains how the plague spreads so rapidly see it from the viewpoint of a careful now hanging person widow and mother hanging people were everywhere vala set one hand on the beam overhead lifted her feet to hang and said what is to be done lest my poor dead vaynya become my enemy in the night the lords of the night forbid us to burn the dead but sometimes they permit it never said grieving tube vala said starboardspin from center city by twelve daywalks there are memories of a plague long ago and far away harpster snapped we designed the crematorium ourselves taught them how to use it then moved away years later we returned the plague was beaten the digging people still cremated but we persuaded them to leave their dead again it was easily done firewood was scarce you see the danger vala said i dont believe locals have started burning vampire victims yet no we would see plumes of smoke but if one client species begins the rest might follow grieving tube said sadly then of course wed have to do a deal of killing valavirgillin throttled a shudder she bowed low and answered why not begin now with vampires grieving tube mulled it not so easy that they too command the night and valas eyes closed for an instant now its a problem a challenge and lesser species must see you solve it now i have you the ghouls had cleared the grass away from a sizable section of tent floor they were drawing in the dark tweetling at each other in their own highpitched language they argued over some feature none other could see and settled that and harpster stood up when the shadow withdraws you may examine these maps harpster said for now let me only describe what you would see here spin by port by two and a half daywalks the ancient structure of an industrial center floats two tens of manheights above the ground i know of a floating city vala said of course near your center city a collection of free buildings linked floaters are rare enough these days we think this one made machinery for the city builders later it was abandoned vampires have lived beneath the floater for many generations for hundreds of falans the perpetual shadow is perfect for vampires locals moved out of their reach long ago peaceful travelers and migrations were warned to avoid it warriors must look to themselves in that regard this range of mountains to port and antispin of the shadow nest stands between there and here it formed a barrier for the mirrorflowers hominids on the far side came to call it the barrier of flame for the fire they could sometimes see playing along the crest the flowers would ultimately have crossed the crest and burned out the shadow nest in their usual fashion vampires wouldnt be safe from horizontal beams of light but then the clouds came heads nodded in the dark harpster said the vampires range expanded by a daywalk grieving tube is right the damage is worse than that their population has grown and hunger drives families of vampires into other domains valavirgillin asked can you blow away the clouds both ghouls hooted laughter grieving tube said you want us to move clouds we beg why do you think we could do such a thing as move clouds over the rising sounds of throttled laughter valavirgillin said louis wu did that harpster said omnivore tinker not odd as hominids go but from off the arch from the stars he had tools to prove what he said he was but we do not know that he made clouds the thurl spoke he did he and the old thurl boiled a sea to make these clouds above us then go to him louis wu is gone the old thurl is gone we cannot move clouds our embarrassment is great harpster laughed what can we do that you cannot do yourselves the thurl said we will use your maps much thanks to you i will lead an army of whatever species will fight we will destroy this nest of vampires thurl you cannot go grieving tube said harpster questioned grieving tube began to explain but the thurl would not wait i am protector to my people when we fight i fight at the head in armor the ghoul woman pointed out of course you must not wear armor your armor keeps your smell you all who fight you must wear nothing bathe where you find water wash every surface of your cruisers and wagons cant you see that the vampires must not smell you vala thought oh the bottleneck is the fuel chitakumishad was saying the reds make a beer it can be turned into fuel go to your war by way of the red pastures we can send them the design for your distilleries by a secret means tomorrow let them make fuel there while you make fuel here from your own stills and rotting grass you will confront the shadow nest no more than a falan from now chit nodded his own mind busy with plans fuel to take two cruisers there and back you must cross the barrier of flame i think your cruisers can do that there are passes takes more fuel fuel to explore or for towels or flame throwers would come out of what you have what of it only in victory will you need fuel to return here and then your third cruiser can meet you or you may leave one behind travel in mated pairs harpster said grieving tube and i will travel together thurl we know your customs but from time to time your tribe divides do it that way tegger you and warvia believe you can resist the vampires it may be so but what of these others let them mate when they must and not rish with bloodsuckers anakrin chaychind you have no mates you should go home and the arguments began no hominid here would uncritically accept a ghouls plan for their war but vala remained silent and knew how much she had won theyre with us they really are and theyll bathe chapter five the web dweller weaver town ad no telling how long the wizard had been there the older children had gone into the great wood to compete at catching birds the boy parald threw with conspicuous grace his net kept its shape longest flew the farthest though hed caught only two strill was thinking how to speak to him when she chanced to look up the wizard was out on the river floating far above the silver water on a thick coinshaped support not much wider than a man is tall they shouted beckoning him down when he noticed them he stopped his stately progress among the treetops then descended gradually he smiled and spoke in an unknown tongue he was bald over most of his body but that wasnt rare among visitors they led him home talking all the way some of the boys tested his knowledge with insults strill disapproved and presently knew she was right the wizard never did learn their speech barring a few basic words like flup and rishathra but he wore a necklace that spoke like a teacher before they reached the village anyone of a strange species might be a teacher a wizard who flew who was served by a magical translator must have a good deal to teach nine years now since hed left kawaresksenjajok and harkabeeparolyn ten since chmeee departed for the map of earth eleven years since theyd set sail aboard hidden patriarch twelve since their return to the ringworld fortyone years since louis wu and his motley crew first touched down cocooned in stasis at miles per second the first hominids theyd found had been small furry religious fanatics these chattering youths were of that or a similar species they were chinhigh to louis wu and covered with fluffy blond fur and wore kilts of muted browns they threw their wonderfully patterned nets with wonderful skill in this maze of bare trunks beneath branches spread like the caps of mushrooms they were friendly every species around the great ocean was friendly to strangers louis was used to it the oldest girl asked what shape is the world quiet fell and heads turned was it a test i should ask rather than tell strill what shape is the world a circle the shape of infinity the web dweller says i dont understand though i see an arch like strill pointed there were small conical roofs below sprouting among the trees a sizable village strung along the rivers vastness upstream was an arch like the oftrebuilt st louis arch broad at the base narrowing as it rose like the upstream gate so that was all right the arch is the part of the ring youre not standing on louis said web dweller he was walking with one proprietary hand on the stacked cargo plates as they floated alongside him there were millions of these in the repair center beneath the map of mars hed welded some needed items to the topmost floating disk these included handholds a seat back a bin for spare clothing and another for food and a little attitude thruster a spare part for the hindmosts probes and well hed found that already in place after the battle eleven years ago it was teela browns medkit furry adults and small furry children saw the bird catchers returning early most stayed with their tasks but a man and a woman waited at the arch to greet them strill cried hes a wizard kidadasir he says its a ring the man glanced at the floating plates he asked do you know this louis said ive seen it im louis wu of the ball people it shouldnt have meant anything to them but the elders gaped and the children ooohed the woman said louis wu of the ball people age had put white in her golden fur and more of that in the mans their kneelength kilts were elaborate tapestries that would have been valuable in any culture i am sawur and this is kidada both of the council both of the weaver folk you are from nowhere on the arch yes the web dweller has vouched for your power and wisdom web dweller how could anyone have known of him here kidada said the web dweller is certainly of another world its got two heads and servants like itself in uncountable numbers aw tanj what else did the web dweller have to say it showed us pictures from far up the arch so it says what did you see vampires strange humanoids living in darkness and an alliance of many kinds of people come to attack them can you tell us of those i know something of vampires the web dweller may know more but i havent spoken to him in thirtysix falans how do your folk manage rishathra sawur asked and there was suppressed giggling louis grinned as best we can yours we weavers are said to be very good with our hands and visitors speak well of the touch of our fur one must ask shall we wash good idea weavers they called themselves their village city was nowhere crowded but it seemed to go on and on spilling up and down both sides of the river sprouting among the trees of the vast forest their houses were wickerwork shells shaped like low mushrooms not unlike the trees louis was being led toward a vertical cliff of bare pale rock kidada said see you water running down that cliff face the baths are below sunlight warms the water as it flows a little the pool was long and narrow low tables bore little heaps of embroidered kilts sawur and kidada added theirs to a heap three parallel furrows ran through the hair across the old mans buttocks old scars rimmed with white fur leading louis to wonder about local predators weavers were already bathing themselves children and the elderly seemed to gravitate together postadolescents separated out but rarely formed pairs louis had learned to look for such patterns the water was muddy he didnt see any towels he set his clothing canyon style camping garb and backpurse from two hundred lightyears away on a table and stepped in when in rome it wasnt all that warm either now all the ages mixed as the weavers gathered around the visiting alien the teacher newly met species always had the same questions my companions and i steered our great ship to the shore of the great ocean forty falans ago we found desolation long before any of you were born fistofgod raised the shore forty manheights along twenty thousand daywalks of shoreline confusion louiss translator would translate sol system measurements into the ringworlds thirtyhour day seventyfive days to a falan but daywalks and manheights varied by species louis floated on his back treading water while they spoke of distance time height no hurry hed done this dance before people to spinward remember fistofgod in their legends something bigger than any mountain struck the floor of the world from underneath at hellish speed thirtyfive hundred falans ago ad by louiss best guess it pushed the land up and then ripped through as a fireball you can see the mountain it made from here a hundred thousand miles away and the deserts all around it the shore of the great ocean moved a thousand miles seaward all the patterns of life changed the water was armpitdeep shallower at the end where the children gathered a kind of dance was going on here not a courtship game but the women around louis were of mating age and men their age were hanging back ring pattern a rishathra dance his eye kept snagging on strills attentive look and wonderful smile they all had questions the same questions always but louis had seen the glitter of bronze on the bare cliff above his head the fractal spiderweb was out of a weavers reach and the water flowing down the rock wasnt washing it off so he spoke for an unseen audience we had to stay with the ocean or wed have had nothing to eat we spent two falans cruising along the shore and finally we realized we were in a river mouth we continued upstream the fertility has returned to the soil along the shenthy river valley weve been in this vast river valley for thirtyfive falans my city builder friends left me at a village downstream twenty falans ago why they have children now but i continued upstream the people are friendly everywhere they like hearing my tales sawur asked why does that surprise you louis wu he smiled at the older woman when a visitor comes to your village he probably doesnt eat what you eat or sleep where you sleep or feel quite comfortable in your house an alien doesnt compete with his host and he might have something to teach but the ball people are all one species on all the worlds a visitor can be bad news a moments uncomfortable silence followed one of the brawny boys settled behind strill broke it he called can you do this he reached around his back one arm above one below and clasped wrists with himself louis wu laughed once he could have no then you should have your back washed the boy said and they all moved in the great thing about the ringworld was its variety and the great thing about variety was that rishathra wouldnt work at all if it required an elaborate dance how do your folk manage rishathra if you will state your gender how long can you hold your breath sea folk no but we like to talk about it we cannot dont be offended red herders it was thus we ruled the world city builders only with sapient species here solve this riddle only with nonsapient species we prefer not to become involved may we watch you with your companion louis had once had to explain that chmeee was not a hominid and was male besides he wondered how much the weavers knew about the bronze spiderweb above their heads they were pairing off now but not mating in public how would weavers rish sawur led him out of the water she squeezed a liter of water from her brown and white fur with louiss help when she saw he was shivering she wiped him down with his shirt louis could smell roasting bird flesh they dressed sawur led him into a circle of woven wicker cages council house she said of one birds were roasting above a barbecue pit the smelts were wonderful birds and a huge fish tended by sawur those arent weavers no sailing folk and fishers one weaver of middle age was tending the pit with the help of seven aliens they werent all of the same species two males had webbed hands and broad flat feet and oily straight hair slicked along their bodies in a smooth curve the other five three men and two women were burly powerful versions of the weavers with altered jaws close enough that they might still mate maybe all seven were wearing the fantastic weaver kilts the big fisher shans serpentstrangler made introduction louis tried to remember their names his translator would retrieve them if he could remember even a syllable shans explained we trade for cloth yes we compete when hishthare rockdiver and i offer to broil this monster fish the sailors catch downstream the sailors offer too afraid we talk to kidada learn something needful get a lower price meanwhile we argue over how to cook our fish that was the sailor wheek kidada at least gets his birds the way he wants id say those birds are done louis said i cant guess about the fish when did you start it will be perfect in a hundred breaths shans said cooked on the down side for the sailors warm on the up side for us how do you like it down side the weaver population half dried themselves and came to eat the birds came off the hot rocks and were torn apart the fish continued to cook louis would find his own vegetables tomorrow and they talked the weavers nimble fingers wove nets to catch midsized birds and beasts of the forest but they wove cloth for river traffic peekaboo clothing hammocks fishnets belt pouches and back pouches a variety of things for a variety of species fishers and sailors traded up and down the river carrying weaver kilts smoked and salted fish salt root vegetables it was shop talk louis eased out of that he asked kidada about his scar and was told of a fight with what sounded like a monster bear weavers withdrew theyd heard the tale kidada told a good tale though from the sound of it the scar should have been in front at sunset all the weavers seemed to melt away sawur led him to a ring of tents their feet crunching in dry brush sailors and fishers remained in conversation around the dying coal bed one called advice after him dont wander only the night people walk these paths at night they stooped under the edge of the wicker cage sawur rolled against him and fell asleep at once louis felt a moments irritation but species differ sleeping in a strange place hadnt bothered louis in falans no in years nor sleeping in a strange womans arms nor rubbing against fluffy fur like sleeping with a big dog nor both together but knowing the hindmosts eye was near that kept him awake for some time sometime in the night he dreamed that a monster sank teeth into his leg he woke holding back a scream sawur spoke without opening her eyes what is it teacher cramp in my leg louis rolled out of her arms and crawled to the door i get cramps too walk sawur was asleep he limped outside the side of his calf was shrieking he hated muscle cramps the daylit arcs of the ringworld reflected far more light than earths full moon the medical kit would give him medicine for a cramp but it didnt act any quicker than just walking it off his foot crunched dry twigs low dry brush surrounded the guests huts friendly as they were the weavers must have some way to discourage thieves this dry stuff might be their defense the cramp had eased but he was wideawake his cargo plates floated outside the guest hut he pulled himself aboard he crossed the brushy barrier without a sound weaving among the tree trunks not a bit nocturnal these weavers no sign of any of them sleeping like the dead how would they catch a thief the visiting aliens had retired too lanterns lit the bow and stern of a long low sailboat he hadnt noticed earlier in a minute or two louis was floating silently above the pool lit by archlight real and reflected motion within the cliff and a light blazed in his face louis squinted cursing he looked into the glare through a window with fuzzedout edges at an impressive cinder cone capped in what seemed dirty snow on any world that would be a volcano here it could be a meteor crater punched from below it looked very like fistofgod crowned with vacuum and naked ringworld floor structure a message from the hindmost once the puppeteer knew louis was moving up the river he could have moved his probe ahead hed sprayed a spy device on this rock cliff and others elsewhere no doubt hed talked to the weavers easy enough but why bother what did he want something spat from the crater twice thrice within ten seconds six hundred and ten hours ago said a familiar contralto watch the view zoomed on the three objects lensshaped spacecraft big kzinti design louis thought they stopped just above the peak then began their descent two or three meters above the glassy crater wall the warcraft are moving quite slowly let me show you fastforward the hindmost said the warcraft moved briskly downslope beyond and below cloudscape jumped into streamlined motion in two hours twenty minutes at just under sonic speed they had covered fourteen hundred miles for kzinti amazing restraint then they diverged thus the cloudscape and the saucers jerked to a near stop two veered off at right angles the third continued straight on white light blinked then the scene was as before but the three ships had a blobby halfmelted look and they gleamed like mirrors they began to descend to fall stasis fields they stopped your beam louis said worrisome louis wrong twice within five seconds is your brain deteriorating that can happen louis said equably the hindmost said those beams were intense vast energy flux was trapped inside the stasis fields before they formed but you and nessus survived a similar attack because we design defense mechanisms to react quickly those kzinti warcraft are nothing but bombs now and that was the ringworld meteor defense but i did not use it yeah right observe the view jumped a view of the magnified sun darkened to something tolerable from the fluid storm a plume rose in fastforward motion higher straight toward the camera hundreds of thousands of miles a brighter shock wave was rising from its base it lashed out along the plume and was suddenly terribly bright a superthermal laser effect definitely the ringworld meteor defense louis but not mine the hindmost would lie but would he shoot down an invading ship louis im not shooting down invading spacecraft i want to contact them a hyperdrive motor could free me from this place i buy that i guess but hindmost do you think someone is in the repair center with you i do not believe my defenses have been breached louis there are two great oceans it took louis a moment to see what the hindmost meant a single great ocean would unbalance the ringworld the water involved would mass as much as a major jovian moon there had to be two on opposite arcs and there were the hindmosts crew had found a repair center in one great ocean under the map of mars the other ocean they had never explored at all and it was across the ringworlds diameter the ringworld was sixteen lightminutes across sixteen minutes at lightspeed before a second repair center could see invading ships coming through fistofgod eight minutes more to begin to affect the sun more time an hour two to stretch a plume of plasma some millions of miles out from the sun then cause it to lase the terrible sword of light would be another eight minutes on its way two hours and twenty minutes was a plausible guess louis said stet youd best assume theres another repair center on the far side of the ringworld arch and a protector inside why a protector mind you louis i think so too a protector would find a way in if a hominid got in somehow a breeder hell be a protector by now the other repair center must be infested with treeoflife like ours was is this what you wanted me for you know almost as much about protectors as i do and its dead of night here so my brain may not be fully functional age too may have affected your brain we do need to talk and i have more to show you louis shall i appear to the weavers and acknowledge your power or shall i not thoughtful of you but that may be out of our hands the locals slept but fishers or sailors must have seen this glare and who could know when a ghoul was nearby actually the hindmost missed louiss sudden grin he said these weavers seem hospitable every species around the great ocean is friendly if you watch your mouth what news of our companions chmeee took an assault vehicle to carry his gear didnt you have a webeye on that he buried it the hindmost said louis laughed he can unearth it if he has need what of the city builders louis said kawaresksenjajok and harkabeeparolyn had two children to raise and another on the way i wont say we were bored with each other but futz i put them off at a village downstream from here with one of the assault boats theyre teaching there and along the far shore how are you not presentable louis three silver blobs bouncing down the slope of fistofgod were replaced by a glare of snow a mountain ridge in broad daylight a green outline blinked around two dots crawling through a cleft in the ridge let me direct your attention to these ten years ago i showed you i remember is this the same view yes as of three days ago taken from the rim of a floating structure above a vampire nest is this what youve been showing the weavers yes the view zoomed those were great crude sixwheeled vehicles possibly powered by steam one of them was turning back upslope the view zoomed on the other on the driving bench these are machine people louis looked right note the beards looks like machine people vehicles too hey louis my computers recognition program thats valavirgillin chapter six snowrunners pass the barrier of flame had been given a low eroded look none but valavirgillin would see mountains that way louis wu of the ball people had taught her to view the world as a mask he and his weird companions had looked up into its black underside where seas were bulges mountain ranges were chains of pits and tremendous pipes carried seabottom flup under the world and over the rim wall to become spill mountains some entity had carved the barrier of flame to suit esthetic whims had carved passes through the range for the convenience of travelers various red tribes and their herds had followed the retreating mirrorflowers across snowrunners pass two of these same reds now guided the cruisers night was biting an edge from the sun as the cruisers crossed the crest of snowrunners pass none of them had seen blue sky in many falans they gloried in it unbroken clouds spread below them there was snow on the ground not deep but enough to cause the wheels to slide vala had trouble steering to left and right the mountains flamed raw sunlight reflecting from snowfields below and behind the driving bench waast was telling someone unseen we didnt see snow when we crossed here the mirrorflowers burned it all away her bulk had half hidden tegger he said mirrorflowers dont like clouds they burn anything that moves waast is it good to separate the wagons this late in the day one must decide waast said firmly the red herder frowned of course the pilot gives the orders but look you mates have been separated valavirgillin and kaywerbrimmis grieving tube and harpster too kaywerbrimmis and chitakumishad are both male what if vampires come warvia and i are safe separated beedj is with you paroom is with twuk manack is with coriack but what of the rest vala steered cruiser one down the long slope pretending not to listen this was how a red herder expressed his dissent by letting it be overheard mates the next turn put her in sight of a wide brown river the reds were of a monogamous race and mated they didnt like being separated but two cruisers need two guides kay and vala must part too two cruisers need two drivers but she and kaywerbrimmis were not mated and here came pilack pelting after her ahead of cruiser two vala choked the fuel line and let her cruiser stop gleaners could run like the wind pilack looked up at her grinning for a moment in which to catch his breath he said kaywerbrimmis wants to go farther up she looked back left of the pass the crest rose gently enough kay would be above the snow line and hed have a view shall we wait kay says dont wait stop the cruiser if you find danger well have you in view well come pilack ran away uphill kays crew were offloading cargo tons of it without paroom and twuk it would have taken forever a few tenbreaths later cruiser two was in motion with kay on the steering bench and the rest of the crew walking behind except for the ghoul of course grieving tube would not wake till halfnight now a curve took them out of sight cruiser one carried valavirgillin and sabarokaresh waast and beedj manack and coriack tegger and harpster they stayed out of the payload shell the payload shell had never been so clean so scentless the ghoul harpster would have liked the darkness but he made do with the rest taking their turns under the awnings on blankets spread along the running boards the machine people on cruiser two were both male she and kay had dithered about taking chitakumishad theyd have preferred spash but nobody would risk spashs life while she was pregnant and chit had had to be tied up during the vampire attack but he was clever and skillful with tools theyd be all right there was always rishathra cruiser one was beneath the cloud deck now the darkening day signaled a sun half shadowed and what was happening down there at the river tegger give me your sight the river gleaners were nearsighted they could barely see beyond their toes machine people had good eyes but none had eyes like the reds tegger scrambled up onto the steering bench peered under his hand then climbed to the cannon tower higher yet vampire two of them theyre hideous vala do you hear anything no i think theyre singing vala and a black thing is coming out of the water what do river people look like wet black your size but compact streamlined short arms and big hands with webbed fingers legs likewise theyve lured one out now one vampire is moving downstream wrong gender maybe i cant tell from this far away how fast can we get down not that fast not fast enough for rescue they were closer now vala could see two pale shapes and a black one pale shape ambled away down the shore the black waddled to the other white who enfolded it in its arms moments later the white hurled itself backward onto the mud the squat black shape approached again arms outstretched the white backed away fast on its skinny buttocks recovered its courage or its hunger got up and accepted the others embrace black rubbed against white vala heard a squall like a mountain cats as the pale shape tore itself free and ran away along the shore upstream the black shape couldnt catch up it stopped and cried a desolate honk how fast tegger asked again well be down before halfnight in time to wash then well test our defenses i think best if cruiser two stays high manack you listening coriack i hear coriack said cruiser two stays high till dawn go tell kaywerbrimmis then stay with cruiser two i dont want you alone on the slopes when night falls beedj was up and walking ahead and to the right his crossbow cocked barok was tending the cannon tegger perched above him the black hominid lay inconsolable on wet river mud it presently rolled over and saw the descending cruiser it waited manack dropped from the running board and ran ahead valas gun was in her hands ready a vampire sang the music was unmistakable thrilling along her nerves manack came to a jarring stop vala could see no target the river person waddled toward the bushes the second vampire stepped timidly out to meet it male it was it raised its arms imploringly with the scent and the music going wild in her head vala fired the bullet struck beneath its armpit slamming the vampire violently away in the neardark its blood was as red as any hominids vala caught a stronger whiff of its scent she raised the towel and inhaled pepperleek manack was hanging back the river person cast itself on the body the vampire spasmed in agony then relaxed vala pulled the cruiser alongside both passengers were dropping from the running board slick black hair short thick arms and legs wide hands and feet streamlined body clothing the river womans torso was covered with some other creatures brown fur she looked up then pulled away from the vampire male with visible effort greeting she said i am wurblychoog a liquid flow of syllables and a trace of smile you cant pronounce that vala said greetings wurble valavirgillin why didnt the vampire kill you this the woman said and her hands waved down her barrel body the garment was stiff around her throat the sides were smooth leather the hair shaved off the rest chest and back were fur taken from some water beast she said we take a jell from a floating predator in lake deeps half a daywalk across land the jellfisher stings fish to eat them the sting is in the jell we smear an otter fur vest with jell then shave off the fur where our arms lie when we swim vampires dont like the sting but after must must she turned to manack can swim little courageous one can hold breath for a little while i would drown said manack the river woman told vala homeflow tribe has only four vests vampires bar us from shore many falans now if from time to time one of us wears a vest and lets a vampire embrace her she may teach them to leave river people alone then we can hunt the shore for a time you show great courage i show my courage for borubble to take him for my mate and get some vampire scent on yourself too waast leered shubble flup this is not to speak of you red one can dive deep for only a few tens of breaths tegger shook his head he was tired of the question the river woman sighed we hear rishathra never practice must mate will tell borubble the good news will tell him visitors come too stay here on mud flat see vampires coming from a long way she was across the mud and into the water before vala could frame an intelligent reply water could hide threats other than vampires the whole team bathed with edged weapons in hand afterward barok went upstream with the gleaners to fish vala envied him a little but she must remain to set up defenses cruiser one spent the night on the mud flat no visitors came vampires or river people it was all going very smoothly vala thought very much according to prediction and plan that worried her three nights ago they had put a final shape to their plans four reds had come to the war warvia and tegger had stayed but two unmated males anakrin hookiwhanhurhur and chaychind hookikarashk had been persuaded to return to red territory carrying instructions that might be the saving of them all whand had had enough of vampires and it seemed he and spash had gotten pregnant they would stay to refuel cruiser three that left valavirgillin and kaywerbrimmis the remaining drivers split up to command two cruisers theyd chosen the teams early then argued about it every night since raking through a mountainous grass giant midden for several days had not improved the machine peoples standing with these tribes vala was sure of that but grass giant dung had yielded many barrels of saltpeter crystals the relief map outside the wall had become elaborate and wonderful only at halfnight and halfday was there light for ghouls and the other species to work together on it but theyd had a falan seventyfive days to do that dirt was replaced with colored clays once witnesses agreed on the shape of the land theyd baked it hard under coals and afterward used colored sand to mark possible routes for the cruisers they were still moving those lines when night fell and all retreated inside the vampires didnt come every night but they came in swarms vampires didnt learn didnt communicate moonwa had mounted the marsh peoples curved window in the starboardspin curve of the wall the vampires attacked from starboardspin and warriors of four species killed them with guns and crossbows firing around the edge of an invisible shield vala had learned crossbows that way several nights running she loved the false sense of invulnerability false because the window would not stop vampire scent the main building was a neardome fabric stretched over the top of a dirt wall with a central pole it was awesomely big but awesomely crowded fifteen hundred grass giants more women than men a great many children infants everywhere made a stench rich enough to slice with a scythesword wemb was in a cluster of wives they were feeding her by hand feeding themselves too and wemb seemed to be enjoying it barok waved at her and she waved back without getting up recovering nicely vala thought from the night she and barok had spent down among the vampires barok would ride with cruiser one vala had wondered if he would drop out of the game with whand and spash or chase down the vampires who had taken his daughter grass giants were big but they could stand crowding for machine people vala discovered the problem was to avoid getting stepped on the reds were prickly grass giants steered clear of them if reds and machine people were feeling overmatched why werent the even smaller gleaners intimidated but theyd found strategies that seemed to work some were playing with the children some were grooming adults their nearsighted eyes found insect parasites with precision the thurl pulled himself free of a ten of wives he asked vala courteously and with no malice do you have what you wanted of the shit pile so it was time to reveal a secret yes we thank you when we mix the crystals with the sulfur and charcoal the reds are gathering we will have what propels our bullets ah the thurl said hiding surprise he could not make gunpowder he still didnt know the proportions vala told herself but now he knew that this was no mere machine people perversion into the quiet vampire music insinuated itself and quiet became silence but now the vampires song had a rising instrumental accompaniment first it matched the vampire music vala had learned to pick out the harp the grieving tube the whistling tube the thutter now the ghoulish music swirled away jarring with the vampire song drowning it while the thutter in the background played faster and faster pulling heartbeats along and now there was no vampire song at all next down theyd been rolling by night they camped on a bluff above a river the vampires left them alone they reached ginjerofers herds early on the second day the reds had fuel waiting charcoal and sulfur they had imported from far away trading away their own wealth with little yet to show for it night covered the sun before the cruisers were loaded the reds made camp around the cruisers when the vampires came the cannon fired over the heads of red sharpshooters by dawn the vampire dead numbered forty or more cruisers carried trade goods and vala made gifts but forty vampire dead were what bonded these species together the third day carried them through snowrunners pass the length of a daywalk varied by difficulty of the terrain by altitude and slope and species but vala thought theyd covered two honest daywalks they could reach the vampires refuge by midday tomorrow if they were crazy enough to travel so directly in the morning cruiser two came rolling down warvia rode above the cannon housing beneath a sheet awning twuk called cheerily waast is it so that snowrunners pass is the easiest through the mountains when reds and ghouls agree who can doubt vampires think so too cruiser two was noisy with victory even grieving tubes dark head lifted into the light squinting and grinned grotesquely before it sank back vala didnt notice warvias silence then red herders were rarely merry the din roused others vala saw wet black heads surfacing in a line along the shore the river people came no farther and vala let them be while kay chit twuk paroom perilack and silack told their interwoven stories kaywerbrimmis parked cruiser two on a knob of rock above the pass the view was of unbroken clouds not what kay had hoped for but he would wait all had bathed in the streams they crossed twice in three days if they were not scentless at least theyd tried darkness flowed over them vampires began to stream through the pass grieving tube on watch alerted the rest cruiser twos heavy cargo still piled in the pass must have carried a scent kay sighted the cannon starboard of that point and waited he killed twenty with three blasts the vampires left the pass empty for a while then theyd begun darting across kays passengers used the chance for target shooting but otherwise let the vampires through bolts and bullets could be recovered but not gunpowder they bunched up again later kay used the cannon again and stopped almost at once they had prisoners vala big slow guys with big hands and big shoulders widebodied women a head shorter both of em with yellow hair blooming out around their heads like mushrooms warvia saw them best warvia warvia roused herself we know the farming people herbivores they grow and tend root vegetables and keep animals too in partnership with red herder tribes who defend them we didnt see any reds last night paroom they werent bunched up and they werent trying to escape they were each with their own vampire ah companion i couldnt get a clear shot we shot a few that didnt have company twuk they sang at us grieving tube played along that scared them kay i couldnt use the cannon because of the prisoners not that we were any help to them what under the arch would vampires want with prisoners tegger said herds he spoke almost absently he was studying warvia who would meet nobodys eyes still it was an ugly thought doubleugly it implied uncomfortably high sapience in vampires the wind kaywerbrimmis said was cold and wet and clean in our nostrils until the night was half gone the vampires started crossing again and these didnt have prisoners they ran maybe the smell of their own dead made them nervous it was fine shooting then the wind shifted around and we smelled them too grieving tube was looking out from under the awning listening though her face was deep in shadow i would have hunted them kay she said our music confuses them freezes them kays eyes were on vala whatever i invited grieving tube to join me in rishathra unspoken the ghoul woman was about to join the vampires she played we danced warvia accused me of abandoning the fight but the rest got the idea quick enough in the general laughter harpsters tenor whisper sounded clear how was he grieving tube inspired paroom too we all kay stopped suddenly for no more than a heartbeat but vala knew at once we all joined in you understand vala we had them backed up at the pass as soon as we stopped shooting they flowed through like a wide river the smell of them we could have chopped it into bricks to sell to the elderly tegger was looking up at his mate warvias silence disturbed him vala thought but he hadnt noticed anything more ominous kaywerbrimmis said i think the thurl gave us twuk because shes small inspired decision twuk smiled brilliantly at him warvia was looking into far distances her face like stone twotenths of night passed this way i think then the wind swung around i didnt notice right away the vampire scent was gone but we had our own smells by then but chit saw chit vampires trying to creep upon us across the ice theyre not much darker than snow themselves kay the wind went gusty and stayed that way theyd get a whiff of us and look around and we were conspicuous i guess paroom ten tens of them kay toward morning they stopped coming entirely we left a carpet of vampires dead in the pass twuk theres nothing under the arch like the stink of a hundred vampire corpses they do avoid their own dead vala might keep it in mind twuk we collected our cargo and our bolts and bullets at halfdawn vala i think we saw the shadow nest tell it warvia the red woman didnt look down from spin the light of day flowed toward us while we were still in dark we were exhausted but i was at my post here on the cannon tower the clouds parted i saw two black lines hard to tell how far hard to tell how high but a black plate with structures above high in the center and glittering silver and its black shadow parallel below not much more than what harpster told us vala said probing a flash of anger throttled i could see the silver curves of the river this river flowing into the shadow we know of the shadow nest a new voice heard from a glossy black shape of uncertain gender and uncertain age slid out of the water and stood erect on the mud i am rooballabl welcome to the homeflow have free passage of us i speak the tongue better than most im told none of you will rish not underwater roobla vala said with regret that would be a coup shadow nest the shadow nest is a cave without walls a black roof fifteen hundred paces around with open sides vampires have lived and bred below since before any of us were born harpster spoke without emerging from the awning only vala heard fifteen hundred paces around would be less then five hundred across in water people paces two hundred for grass giants three for the rest of us three hundred paces in diameter as we were told vala asked roobla how high is that roof rooballabl exchanged a quick sequence of honks with someone still in the water then fudghabladl doesnt know more honking rooballabl said low enough to block rain even in high wind understand only fudghabladl has been there whats the homeflow like under the shadow nest can vampires swim a gabble of honking voices one came forward white fringes on his head and along where his jaw would have been and chattered at rooballabl rooballabl said we must hug the bottom when we pass through none of us go anymore the water is a sewer sometimes a whonkee unknown word vampires never swim unseen harpster spoke whonkee path of the dead vala nodded warvia swung down into the cannon enclosure vala watched cruiser two while the discussion ranged warvia didnt emerge and where was tegger the river people had observed the vampires for generations but from their own viewpoint vampires sporadically rolled corpses into the homeflow hundreds at a time from ten to twenty species including their own a turn later there would be a glut of fish that used to be worth knowing but old fudghabladl hadnt been near the shadow nest in twenty falans or more fishing aside nothing that lay beyond was worth traversing the shadow nest vala dropped her voice harpster corpses rolled into the homeflow are lost to you arent they fish eat them and fishers eat the fish and in the end all is ours flup youre being robbed vala vampires are animals animals dont rob rooballabl none but the river people may come to the shadow nest and leave alive why do you ask these things why are you here so many species beedj spoke before vala could we go to end the vampire menace we will attack them in their home hominids who cannot travel have supported us the river people discussed that vala thought she saw silent laughter maybe not rooballabl said valavirgillin we think we saw a ghoul among your number two of the night people travel with us others parallel our path as friends they dont like sunlight roobla ghouls and vampires are all people of the night did rooballabl mean they were allies they compete for the same prey on the same terrain truly its more complicated than that are you sure they stand with you for all of a falan vala had wondered at the ghouls motives she said yes quite sure we could not travel with you no but if you will roll your wagons along the homeflow we can travel alongside fudghabladl and i tell you things take vests teach our lessons downstream they began working out details this was unlookedfor luck and vala knew she must pursue it though tegger and warvia were nowhere to be seen chapter seven wayspirit tegger knelt with his back to a big pale rock his heels under his buttocks quite still the scrub was all around him hiding him this was how reds hunted and tegger was hunting through his mind seeking tegger his hands played idly with his sword honing the edge thoughts played over the surface of teggers mind if he let them go deeper hed be thinking of warvia he knew he couldnt face that the waters steady roar had him nodding he would not hear any creature approaching perhaps he would smell it or see motion in the scrub around him his sword was defense enough all the action was at the shore at some point the negotiations had become a swimming party a sword could be used on oneself just turn it around jump from the top of a rock the thought merely skimmed the surface of his mind tegger hookithandarthal tegger jumped and was on the rock his blade swinging in a full circle before his mind caught up vampires dont speak what a voice just louder than the river so low that tegger might have imagined it said i cannot harm you tegger i grant wishes no living thing was in sight tegger asked wishes had he been found by a wayspirit i was a living woman once now i help others in hope of making a better self what would you have of me want to die pause then such a waste tegger heard a rasp of effort deep beneath the whisper somehow he could not believe that his sword would be fast enough he said wait i wait the whisper was much closer now tegger had twice spoken without thinking now he had evaded a quick death did he want that but if wishes could be granted something happened last night i want it not to have happened that cannot be every man on cruiser two whatever his shape chemistry diet had mated with teggers mate they have to die he thought but the women all who know warvia too he thought even as his mind was rejecting the notion they did this to warvia to me it was the vampires shall i kill half of us with a wish undefended the rest would die ginjerofers tribe he saw suddenly how the red tribes would fall before an expanding vampire plague men and women unable to trust one another would separate in rage families and tribes would disintegrate vampires would take them one by one tegger said i would have you kill every vampire under the arch the whisper came i have no such power what power have you tegger i am a mind and a voice i know things sometimes i see things before you do i never lie useless creature wayspirit your good intent exceeds your means what if i wish for a fish to eat i can do that will you wait i will but why i must not be seen i could much more quickly tell you how to get your own fish true the shore was very active do you have a name call me what you wish whisper good whisper i want to kill vampires so do all of your companions will you rejoin them tegger shuddered no think what you will need by now you must know that the vampires power reaches farther than your sword tegger moaned his head bowed low his hands over his ears the whisperer waited him out and presently said you will need defenses we should make a list whisper i dont want to talk to any of them he was beginning to remember that for a falan of nights among the thurls people he and warvia had tried to explain why their monogamous nature made them superior to the lure of the vampire it made the other species irritable whisper said the first vehicle is abandoned save for harpster harpster sleeps even if he wakes he will not disturb you take what you will need vala was wishing she could get into the spirit of the thing the water was cold you had to stay active to stay warm everyone seemed to be washing each other discussions involving physiognomy or rishathra could be answered by pointing chitakumishad and rooballabl were trying to work out an arrangement that would leave chits mouth above water beedj and twuk were watching and making suggestions any parasites had been washed away but gleaners were good at finding a phantom itch barok turned grinning his hands took valas shoulders and firmly turned her around he scrubbed her back briskly with some scratchy seavegetable thing it was all wonderfully friendly as it can be among species who dont compete for the same needs all would be well if only warvia and tegger would come running out of the payload shell hand in hand she looked over her shoulder the river sounds would drown her lowered voice sabarokaresh i need your help you and kaywerbrimmis and chitakumishad barok continued his work what kind of help come with me when i look inside cruiser two his hands stopped then he looked around i dont think we should disturb chit no do you think hell get that to work might drown himself theres kay over there unusual view kaywerbrimmis was lying on his belly mostly in the water drawing maps in the mud with his fingertips an unidentifiable river person was advising him vala pulled herself up on his other side and asked learning anything maybe give me a few breaths of your time me and barok he looked around studied her face decided not to ask jumped to his feet and was pulling her along as naked as she and barok there was no chance for vala to go to her piled clothes she might have liked going naked if the rain would ease off was clothing really that dangerous but it wasnt just a matter of keeping clean a vampire night learn that there was blood underneath the scent of woven cloth or cured leather it wasnt her clothes she wanted it was her pack a pack would look incongruous on a naked woman oh no doubt it would be all right when the three were out of anyones earshot vala asked kay how did warvia act rished with all of us she stepped up onto the running board bother her it did a few times she tried to go outside maybe just to get clear of us maybe to go to the vampires they would have had her anyway shes wrong about being immune kay nobody believed that warvia did i couldnt let her out come daylight we tried to calm her down he was talking through clenched teeth no good maybe a woman or someone who wasnt there could get her talking ill try vala said she opened the trick lock and entered the payload shell it wasnt quite dark light glared down from the gun tower vala sniffed at the ghosts of old cargoes and waited for her eyes to adjust gunpowder minch and pepperleek great masses of grass for twuk and paroom soap strange stuff made by a species far to starboard she sniffed for old stenches the fearsweat of people hiding from attackers agony of the wounded but those had been cleaned away there was no smell of blood she climbed the ladder to the cannon no sign of tegger kaywerbrimmis touched her ankle she half sobbed oh flup oh flup i was so sure wed find everything covered with blood tegger must have guessed and how could warvia lie to him warvia warvias feet dangled listless before the cannon slot vala pulled herself half through the opening warvia where is he warvia made no answer well hows he taking it warvia spoke dead inside warvia cherished ally nobody really thought youd be immune to vampire scent i thought hed kill me warvia said it never even crossed his mind can we do anything for him he wants to be alone i guess for you so do i vala slid down the ladder he cant lose us kaywerbrimmis said he can follow the river follow the wheel ruts maybe he just wants some time to digest whats happened rethink she nodded in the gloom vala we should get the wagons moving ill take the tail position while the rest got cruiser one ready to roll maybe she could search out tegger she didnt believe it keep a close eye on warvia or shall i take her take her youre the boss and shes got the best eyes that isnt its a decent excuse but she might talk to you because he stalled because she hasnt rished with anyone in cruiser one just so youre a male kay boss i just cant guess how teggers feeling now this doesnt happen to reds tegger dropped silently from the cannon mount no living thing was in his sight and he jumped when a voice whispered from far too close to his ear do you have what you need to travel tegger remained crouched he whispered towels and a pepperleek soap clean clothes my sword im following the river so i wont need the canteen so i filled it with fuel that can be useful stuff not for drinking i hope fuel burns none of your business is it random killing you plan or something more organized i dont know anything they live under a factory city a big floating structure whisper if we if you if i cant destroy their refuge i accomplish nothing if i dont if i cant do something large for your honor yes what warvia did i am nothing now i must make myself something wish to destroy the shadow nest you shall make it fall crush them underneath that could be difficult difficult tegger shouldered his pack he noticed three naked machine people entering cruiser two that was harmless but they might search the other cruiser next tegger eased away into the bush he spoke to himself or to the empty air difficult its impossible i cant invade a vampire nest if i could get above them onto that floating factory but id have to fly whisper what is valavirgillin hiding huh machine people have their secrets tegger said whisper she knew that you and warvia would succumb to the vampire lure still she hopes that her little army can win does she know something that nobody else does teggers mind was trying to shut down the moan was rising in his throat theyd hear him find him his mind he must not lose his mind to his bodys hysterics think his first coherent thought in some time was that he had just heard whispers first real command however phrased louis wu of the ball people had visited ginjerofers tribe valavirgillin knew him too knew him better since rishathra was among her skills had louis wu revealed something to her and hed seen her naked moments ago she must have left her pack with her clothes whisper where are valavirgillins clothes look along the shore there the pack is on the mud flat but you could reach it with a stick whisper im not a thief i only want to look the voice whispered what if valavirgillin hides knowledge that would help her companions information is property silence answered am i mad he asked himself this wayspirit had done nothing teggers own mind couldnt do what had happened to him might drive anyone mad was there a whisper warvia had suffered a shattering shock what was she feeling the horrifying truth was that she might be as crazy as him and tegger was creeping through the brush like some predator his prey a leather pack that didnt belong to him stop listen for rustling brush for whisper or for his companions nothing he must already be lunatic to suspect the machine people woman this was truly valavirgillins war she had involved the ghouls where a megalomaniac would have kept command for herself valavirgillins weaponry was worth their lives but here was her clothing washed and tossed over bushes and her backpack hung here too he could look he need not show himself his blade had the reach he slid its point under the strap and fished the strap to him and slid backward on his belly into the bushes the pack opened out flat like many hed seen but unlike those this had a good many pockets leather on the outside some very finely woven stuff as a lining her firestarter was as good as his own traded from some distance away blanket fancy canteen a box containing damp soap bullets and an empty handgun the gun for tegger it might be the difference between life and death between thief and there was no word for what he and warvia were now but every hominid knew the word thief lunatic he said he was trying to put things back as hed found them could he get the pack back without being suspected he whispered into the silence i do not hold title to machine people gunpowder stealing that secret would be stealing and he rolled the pack closed and open again something had felt cold the lining it was cold the cold fading under his touch he rubbed it in his fingers its weave was too fine to see at any distance it had layers several layers he separated a layer out and pulled threads of a less robust material separated and the layer detached it was filmy stuff very fine he could see no way to put it back what was it what was whispers interest he stuffed it into his kilt that was less likely to be searched than his pack he wrapped valavirgillins pack his blade set it back on a branch perhaps the right branch his erstwhile companions were all up and down the beach and into the bush maybe they were hunting him hed best be on his way tegger kneewalked through brush until the brush petered out then he ran on bare mud hidden in a mist growing gradually denser the river was broadening and so was the mudflat shore the cruisers were out of sight tegger wasnt worried about river folk folk whose eyes must see through air and water both would have trouble identifying him they couldnt swim as fast as he could run and they could hardly walk at all how would they inform the cruisers he was outrunning the news of himself tegger was on his own the knowledge was a tearing in his chest though four alien species had been his allies and friends he gave them little thought his grief was for warvia never since their mating never since his childhood or hers had they been separated for more than a few days the world must change before he could ever face her again the over changed as he ran sand pebbles a stand of trees dug in all over a bare rock cliff nearly to the water narrow rapids here and he had to climb a cliff side to get around them three vampires and an infant huddled in the meager shadow of an overhanging cliff across the river watched him run away from them and didnt give chase as the day passed he ran chapter eight for not being warvia it had been raining since midday valavirgillin tried to find paths over bare rock but there was mud everywhere tilting skidding never quite toppling over the wagons moved downstream toward the shadow nest when night bit an edge from the sun vala already had the military high ground picked out the river was four hundred paces wide here rooballabl and fudghabladl should be safe enough the cruisers filled their water tanks then rolled up toward the crest these nearer mountains were foothills to the barrier of flame but that highest one would do the cruisers slipped and tried to slide off cliffs would rain slow vampires the way it was slowing her she should have camped earlier but they still had daylight when they reached her chosen position she set the cruisers backtoback not too close cannon facing out those who must cook their food cooked under an awning while they still had light warvia had shot some creature big enough to share with the machine people in the last light they washed then piled their towels a distance from the cruisers the gleaners retired they didnt like rain and they needed their sleep the rest talked or slept or merely waited vala would have welcomed the ghouls advice they were perched on a bare granite peak overlooking the shadow nest talking in their own tongue with their backs to the doused fire and the company valavirgillin saw two only but she seemed to hear several voices the other hominids were letting the machine people do most of the talking so be it vala said any vampires that get this far should be exhausted from the trek uphill our smell is all on the towels itll distract them theyll be easy meat give me your thoughts what have i missed barok said vampires would be coming back from where they hunt they wont expect to hunt this close to their nest theres no prey left well see chit said when they come they come in hordes reminds me kay said i scooped up three barrels of river gravel vala want some we still have to use powder but we can save our shot good hows warvia warvia said warvia hookimurf thandarthal can speak for herself kaywerbrimmis warvia is in health have you seen sign of tegger vala said i found some things missing survival stuff enough to fill a backpack all from cruiser one tegger must be the quickest thief alive her backpack had been disturbed too but nothing seemed to be missing that she didnt mention next question what do we do tomorrow harpster grieving tube come and see said grieving tube vala climbed the rock it was nearly flat on top and cold to the touch she saw that warvia had followed her she reached down and pulled the red woman after her downstream the homeflow split and split again her gaze followed the main channel to where it dipped into shadow the floating factory was ominously close and huge grieving tube was almost scentless smelling only of wet fur she said valavirgillin can you see beneath the floater do you see dangling loops near side right of center it was as tegger had described it a disk that bulged upward in the middle beneath beneath was shadow and a sense of restless motion about the edges no vala said yes said warvia ill sketch it come day the ghoul said warvia that dangling helix is a ramp wide enough for heavy machinery there are cogs along one edge so that machines need not slip and stairs along the other no eyes have seen these things in many generations the description you hear is more than twenty lifespans old stored in a library far to spin given me some days ago at the thurls fort given how but communication was a ghouls secret and what vala cared about was you have maps of the floating thing yes from before the fall of the cities before so many things stopped working details only reached me yesterday while we were above the clouds thats it doesnt touch the ground warvia said grieving tube said i was afraid of that harpster said none of us have been this close in a very long time there was no point before louis wu boiled a sea and after it was too dangerous vala broke in warvia the ramp doesnt touch im having trouble with distances valavirgillin but its hanging in midair the bottom of the ramp straightens out flat like a shovel blade but twice as high as those vampires around it we did not expect this grieving tube said our chosen path would have been to force a way onto the floater then vampires would have to come to us along a narrow way they prefer to swarm they might even have to face raw daylight that high vala was holding tight to her temper long practice made that surprisingly easy i see but we cant reach it i see no way harpster said but there are more minds here than ours let us set them thinking running through fog and mist running from his life his eyes always where his feet would fall tegger would not have seen any threat but he smelled it gasped it in as if the memory of warvia punched him in the face he stopped caught his balance reached over his shoulder and was armed fingers brushed his face he slashed waist high forward and back before ears and eyes caught up her song peaked in a squeak of agony he poked out at throat level the song ended tegger clapped his hands over his ears and ran and ran he knew that smell she was behind him dying but with her scent in his nose he saw her more clearly than his pounding feet the leather cloak she wore was too big for her and in tatters and she spread it like wings to show her nakedness her song was piercingly sweet she was slender and very pate perhaps adolescent her hair thick and white the points of her canine teeth visible past her red lips vampire night after night they sang outside the thurls wall tegger was stronger than their lures hed said so over and over but that drifting scent was older yet for it was warvias scent during the friendliest part of her cycle only stronger his heaving breath was driving it out of his nose out of his mind and he ran out of the mist and slowed to a stop for most of a falan hed studied the map the relief map theyd shaped and fired outside the thurls compound now it was as if he were an ant viewing it at eye level he crept uphill to put a boulder between himself and the creatures around the floater before he looked again an ant looking at an anthill it was far away still but a reds eyes are good those were human shapes interacting in what seemed human patterns they moved as if at work or gathered in little social groups some carried burdens that their posture said were babies they moved in and out of the black shadow that lay beneath a huge disk a mass like a fullsized city floating above them the ghouls had called it a factory complex but tegger couldnt help but think of it as a city builder city a vampire city now he could see no more than twenty vampires even including the few down at the river but there must be thousands in the shadow of the floater if it fell it would crush most of them shrapnel spraying horizontally would take out most of the rest tegger thought he could see something hanging down like an unsupported spiral staircase he couldnt see the bottom maybe he could climb that how to reach it as best he could judge through the drifting fog the floating city was twelve hundred paces downstream along a wide mud flat that the homeflow had carved into multiple channels the main channel flowed under the city but many channels went around here and there along the river vampires had come into daylight to drink too close to the shadow nest channels flowed around both sides of some tremendous thing a tilted square plate obtrusively artificial and half buried in the mud some relic from the fall of the cities no doubt vampires nearby didnt seem to be avoiding it a pity he couldnt swim could he hide beneath the water and move downstream that way or would he freeze or were there vampires too close and would the smell be too much for him for the vampire womans scent was still in his mind if not his nose were there river people about he was willing to ask for help mist blew across his view a fine rain washed him and a voice in the mist whispered in his ear so you really were as strong as you thought tegger snorted an unarmed woman no challenge mere murder his mind shied from what the dying vampire had taught him of himself and fastened on another puzzle how did you get ahead of me whisper silence tegger was coming to believe that whisper was a machine something left over from before the fall of the cities or else a wayspirit who had dreadful secrets whisper didnt answer questions about whisper ask instead is there a way to make the floater fall on the shadow nest the whisperer said i know of none my father told me the city builders made lightning to flow through silver threads for their power we could turn it off find the threads rip them out whisper said floater plates dont use power to float though power was needed to make them they were made to repel the scrith the floor of the arch and that is what they do it was impossible then it had always been impossible in some bitterness tegger said you know so much you hide so much are you a ghoul silence one might consider that distance means nothing to a wayspirit or that a madmans imagination is as quick as thought or if gleaners run faster than reds faster than tegger at a dead scared run then something else might run faster than gleaners but ghouls could not whatever else he was though ghouls were as elusive as whisper whisper was not a ghoul the mist drifted revealed and concealed it was full dark or very near through gaps in the clouds tegger could catch an occasional vertical bluewhite glare the arch still unchanged whatever happened to his universe the activity beneath the floating mass was increasing tegger thought it was certainly growing darker vampires would be waking tegger said we should hide i see a place but it might not help you why not tegger asked and was instantly aware of the sweat running freely down his arms much of that was rain still his own smell would attract vampires for a daywalks distance he waited while the mist closed in and heard no more from whisper on hands and toes then he moved down to the river he drew his sword before he waded in no telling what lived in the brown water if a fish brushed him he might find his dinner he stopped as water brushed his kilt valavirgillins rag should he get it wet he pulled it free of his kilt it was filmy stuff very finely woven very strong hed seen his hand through it earlier though it was too dark now hed noticed it because it was cold but it wasnt cold at all an instant after he stuffed it in his kilt during a halfday of running hed forgotten all about it he let a corner dip into the river it wasnt dissolving good but the upper corner in his fingers was as cold instantly as the river washing past his legs he submerged himself rubbed himself with moss climbed out fast dried himself fast running had kept him warm in the wind and rain but he wasnt running now there was a poncho in his pack and the firestarter valas cloth was like a pipe for heat and cold what would happen whisper what if i put a corner of valavirgillins cloth in a fire would it burn would it be too hot to hold there was nowhere whisper might be on this bare mud his own mind told him hed be crazy to build a fire hominids used fire vampires no matter how stupid would learn to seek fire still he couldnt help but wonder he toweled his face and pulled the towel away in time to see six vampires running at him across the mud they didnt sing they didnt posture didnt implore with their bodies they came fast tegger snatched up his sword a sword didnt frighten them they were pacing each other spreading out a little attacking as a pack tegger ran to the left and slashed slashed two fell back with haphazard wounds enough to put them out tegger thought but he was too busy to look the other four had him encircled he half rested turning in a stepstop motion his sword held vertical reversing himself reversing he and his friends had played this game with sticks when they were children their elders had fought grass giants this way two wounded were crawling away uphill toward the shadow the remaining three men and one woman circled him he hadnt known none of the vampire hunters had known that when vampires outnumbered their prey six to one they didnt bother with lures or song or even scent they just attacked he must reach the cruisers if he lived tell them even if he must face warvia again warvia the vampires didnt seem to be in any hurry no reason why they should be more were trickling down from the shadow nest more yet would be returning from the lands beyond the mountains darkness was falling whisper he screamed hide me nothing the rain had stopped he was on a wide mud flat this time there really was no place for a wayspirit to hide the scent it wasnt strong but it was getting into his head and it wasnt coming out he remembered the other vampire remembered killing her killing her for not being warvia his mind was going and there was no reason why he should wait and the woman spread her arms for him imploring tegger jumped backward turning sword swinging yes the men were coming at his back converging while she held his mind prisoner his blade swiped across their eyes he missed the second clean came back and stabbed economically into that ones throat he jabbed back blindly at where the woman should be she slammed into him with his sword through her to the hilt knocking him off balance her teeth slashing at his biceps he curled her away onehanded he could hear himself screaming one man was crawling backward leaving his lifes blood behind one seemed blinded the third brushed blood from his eyes and saw tegger as tegger reached for him then teggers hands were on his throat and teggers weight was driving him into the mud the rest was a fog the man gripped teggers shoulders and tried to pull tegger close to his teeth tegger shook him like a rat while he strangled him the woman had almost reached the river when tegger reached her and took back his sword he stepped too close to one who should have been dead felt teeth close in his ankle stabbed down and kept walking the blinded one came toward him sniffing tegger took three swings with a blade dulled as blunt as a club before the head came off he could hear himself snuffling like a sick herdbeast in the shifting fog he could see shapes moving down from the shadow nest the pack dont forget the backpack good where now whisper hide me whisper spoke but not in a whisper run toward me the voice was a whipcrack command with just a trace of speech impediment coming from far downstream straight toward the shadow nest tegger ran he was a hundred paces along when the voice spoke again much closer now out into the river tegger veered left into the water toward the voice of whisper was there something out there in the rain and the dark was a shadow on the fog a shadow too big to be solid and a strip of darkness an island vampires couldnt swim or the water folk would have known it tegger was a plains dweller he had never tried to swim it was ankle deep knee deep pause a moment to get his pack on his back no kilt hed left it sword into the sheath on his back hed need his arms to swim if hominids swam like rooballabl if reds could swim at all and he ran on knee deep knee deep and out here said whisper from far away go to the downstream end hed crossed thirty paces of kneedeep river to reach a shallow bulge of dark mud that did not really deserve the name of island vampires were piling up on shore one then another stepped into the water and came toward him downstream he went running over mud beneath a shadow too big to be anything but fog patterns wondering if vampires could fight while water impeded their feet this might really be the best place for a final stand he did not shy from dying i killed a vampire woman for not being warvia hed told himself but when he killed the six it felt like he was killing warvia over and over killing her for what shed done in the night and he gloried in it if he killed more vampires he would lose warvia even in his mind as his feet pounded across the mud the monstrous shadow shifted it was too rigid was solid suddenly and alongside him he lashed out at it with his sword and whacked something he rapped it with his fist not a fog pattern it was flaky and a bit springy like layers of hammered metal hed seen this thing from much farther away it was a tilted plate with square corners obtrusively artificial fifteen paces by fifteen paces if half of it was under the mud it stood out of the mud at an angle of forty degrees the mud had piled up against it there were notches along the rim big enough to attach cables a thick post stuck up from the center at one of the visible corners was what looked like a pulley if there had been a cable it was gone the highest corner bulged there was no smell of vampires here at the fall of the cities hundreds of falans ago vehicles were said to have rained out of the sky most of those were gone buried or corroded out of existence sometimes you could find the shell of a floating car and curved sheets of stuff as transparent as water usually broken windows sometimes something bigger like a big plate for carrying cargoes too big to fit into a car the fog concealed revealed the plates highest corner bulged like soap bubbles stuck together faceted and as with soap bubbles you could see in one facet was crazed as if crawlerwebs covered it others were clear when tegger tried to climb the plate was too smooth and too slippery with rain and mud hed better do something he didnt doubt he had outrun this latest wave of vampires but even wading theyd catch up tegger backed up several paces then ran at the plate halfway up he ran out of momentum he dropped arms and legs spread wide the mud didnt reach this high it wasnt metal or it was covered metal a gritty surface offering traction even under a rain slick he crawled the bulb was a single bubble part windows part painted metal what was clearly a door hung by one hinge teggers fingers found an edge of the opening and pulled himself up and in he looked down to see a vampire below him she looked back watching him now two now four tegger reached down for the hanging door his thrashing foot went through something crunchy he ignored that he lifted the door it wasnt heavy pulled it into place and looked for a way to lock it there was clearly a lock but he couldnt make it work now the vampires began to climb and slip and climb again the door wouldnt stop them the slope might otherwise this bulb would become their larder whisper what next he asked expecting nothing nothing he must have left whisper down there with the vampires funny but he couldnt make himself worry for whispers safety tegger took off his pack he wanted light and there was no harm now in setting a fire he struck his firestarter until he had a blaze he studied the crunchy stuff for a moment hed seen the bones of prey and of cattle and he knew the feel of his own bone structures his foot had punched through some ribs it seemed the pilot had been of an unknown species bigger than a red burly with long arms its clothing was mere shreds of no particular color the skull had fallen too easily as if its neck was broken when the carrier hit the mud it had the massive jaw of an herbivore a hominid skeleton imagine that the ghouls had never come for it at the fall of the cities the night people must have been gorged and busy beyond imagination when they found they couldnt climb this wreck to reach the corpse in the control bubble theyd given up nothing else would be climbing up here they must have reasoned to find an abandoned corpse and upbraid the untidy ghouls in the dazzle of the firelight he couldnt see the vampires below the shell glowed around him one curved window was not covered with webs as hed thought but shattered the pieces still stuck together others were intact before him were toggles just big enough for his fingertips that slid horizontally or vertically there was a little door as big as his two spread hands and another twice that size but neither would open there was a wheel on a post that tegger found he could push in all six directions though that took both hands and all of his strength he moved all of the toggles right or left or up or down whichever way theyd move none of them did anything his tinder was running out and there was nothing here to burn if warvia were here shed figure this out if warvia were here hed tell her he never doubted her she hadnt chosen to break their marriage shed been overwhelmed by a smell that entered below her mind and clamped down on the soul how long had he been hearing that vampire song the light was going and now he could see a triangular face peering longingly in at him animal brain half the size of his if she ever realized what the door was he was dead but the real danger tegger knew was a scent that would have him tearing it free himself he shouted whisper she shied from his scream just for a moment then answered with her song he drove his fist into one of the little doors with all his strength it popped open the compartment behind it wasnt large but he found what he needed a thick book full of dry sheets of thin stuff that would burn the vampire woman women shied back from the light two women now and a man too all trying to balance above him on the shell waiting he held a burning sheet above the compartment there was the book he was tearing up a thick book of maps and a paper bag filled with dry mold and a peculiar dagger which he took and nothing else so he smashed the other door it hurt but the door popped open this recess was no deeper than one joint of a finger what showed was entirely cryptic a maze of toy knob the gun of a city builder machine tegger thought and he looked for silver threads linking the little knobs he had been told that they were what carried power he was disappointed not to find them he touched two of the points with his fingertips the muscles in his arms spasmed hard and threw him back in the seat for a long moment he couldnt remember how to breathe was this what lightning felt like power but it would kill him he lit another paper and held it above the recess some of the little knobs were linked by slender lines of dust his own touch had disturbed the rest it was as if something linked in his mind tegger pulled out valavirgillins cloth the peculiar dagger didnt have an edge only a flattened point he used his badly blunted swords edge to cut a narrow strip from the cloth he should lay it along one of those lines of dust he brushed it the little strip of valas cloth quickly across the knobs lightning flashed up his arm jolting him just for an instant the smell he couldnt fight it forever but hed fight it for now the vampire that sang in his mind he glared at them and tried to think glove he pulled his towel out and tried gripping the strip through that no good he could grip the peculiar dagger through it though he could drop the strip of valas cloth into the recess and push it around with the point of the dagger until it mated two knobs he couldnt see what suddenly glowed it was outside the cabin three vampires suddenly lit up like suns they yelped and tried to leap away from the light two slid away down the plate the man dropped off the edge reflected light was still pouring in he didnt need the fire anymore he left the first strip in place he cut another strip from valavirgillins cloth and began testing that his teeth hurt from being clenched he could hear his whimpering and know how badly he wanted to throw himself out that door and follow two vampire women down to the mud but warvia warvia i did it i made the lightning flow now why didnt he have anything but light it might be he thought that light was only the easiest part of city builder tech the part that lasted the longest or the part that used the least power and too little power remained for any of these other unnamed wonders but tegger didnt believe that hed felt the shock wherever it came from there was power and it was driving the vampires back the old skull was so clean something had claimed the meat if not ghouls then birds the big empty sockets seemed to be looking at him he set it in the larger compartment but changed his mind about closing it he said to the ancient pilot you think you had a bad day i had a day nobody would want to live through you had maybe a hundred breaths but it must have felt like forever to the pilot he thought falling out of the sky maybe in a cloud of smaller vehicles maybe screaming for help through a voicesender that didnt work anymore as every part of his wonderful flying hauler went dark and dead ah tegger began sliding every toggle that would move when the lights died he slid that one back yes every sliding thing was on full power when this thing fell and in his experimenting he had turned each of them off everything but the lights the hauler must have fallen in daylight and the next thing tegger caused to happen was a sputtering and a smell of something burned he feared he had destroyed something but the next was a wind in the control bubble which carried the vampire scent out and away and left his head clear and cold and then he screamed in triumph he twisted himself around to look down the length of the cargo plate it was hard to pick out the vampires the lights seemed to be to either side of his bubble they cast shadows and vampires like shadows he thought he saw five and guessed at twice that but they would come no closer time now to remember hunger to wonder if anything nested in here the outside was too bare hed have to wait for full day and catch a fish it seemed he would live through the night where was the power the lightning coming from he couldnt guess he cut another fingerlength strip and began trying that chapter nine familiar faces weaver town ad through the window in the cliff louis studied the weathered woman in weathered clothing she was steering a steampowered vehicle downslope with a similar man beside her and a small red man perched above her head three days ago ninety hours exactly if thats valavirgillin she doesnt took good neither do you louis perhaps shes been neglecting her boosterspice louis ignored the dig shes gotten old eleven years louis himself had lived eleven years without the bioengineered seeds that kept a human being from aging vala had never touched the stuff was it really valavirgillin it was hed rished with the woman this skews the odds a bit doesnt it louis she must be tens of thousands of miles starboard of where i left her what would she be doing there attacking a vampire enclave i believe its her isnt it have i made my point if i show you ten healthy hominids they could be ten survivors out of a thousand dead but i show you a woman you knew before the radiation storm and clearly in present time what are the odds now louis shifted on the watersmoothed boulder hed chosen for a seat is this present time hindmost forty hours ago louis asked what he had refused to ask for eleven years are you claiming teela lied why she acted on insufficient knowledge with enhanced intelligence comes enhanced arrogance and she never did have good sense louis she could have done what i did with my computers to play with louis teela never grasped how closely i was able to guide the plasma plume we ripped from the sun i set it flowing directly into the attitude jets on the rim wall the plasma never played across the main ringworld surface the radiation she feared of course it was well above background level the rim louis said he was beginning to believe yes the rim of course and how do you suppose the spill mountain people made out along five percent of the rim wall i suppose i must have killed a great many ten million a hundred million people of a kind louis wu had never met several species maybe nonetheless louis said hindmost i believe i owe you an apology the hindmost chimed making sure its in his records louis thought then another matter notice the man in lookout position red herder yeah little red carnivores lived not that far from the rim wall very fast runners they were the great wagon suddenly zipped downslope fastforward dodged boulders at mach in a storm of streaming cloudshadows and was lost in a maze of rocks i lost the wagons for a time the hindmost said fifteen hours later i picked up this a small red man ran down a river shore mach for sure louis laughed theyre not that fast its the same man i cant tell slow him down the red man slowed to something an olympic runner might hope for louis said looks like him infrared the hindmost said a pink shadow glowed through the fuzzyedged window in the dark cliff running along a black river amid glowing rocks a brilliant green cursor pointed this a running pink shadow and glimpses of another the red ran steadily some warmer shape flitted from cover to cover flashed between rocks slow that down now through brush now where was it reds ran fast but this thing was keeping up with the red while hiding most of the time louis couldnt get any notion of its shape louis we watched the burning of three patriarchy ships i suspect a protector the hindmost said might we have another protector here why not just a ghoul the red dots streaked away in fastforward then shifted to normal light the red herder ran alone near him there was a suggestion of sporadic motion and the mans eyes were constantly shifting something popped up in front of him his sword came out pause and the hindmosts cursor pointed red herder vampire do you see anything else give me infrared in infrared louis found five glow spots in normal light the cursor pointed red herder vampire this and this are ghouls see louis remembered ghouls though they were hidden in brush and shadow he knew their lanky shape but the fifth glow was hiding even from the ghouls louis could make out a hand smaller than a ghoulish hand nearly hairless an old mans hand arthritic with knobby knuckles protector why would a protector bother unknown but see this fastforward the vampire woman fell dying the red ran stopped splashed in the river and was suddenly fighting half a dozen vampires the recording went dead slow the reds sword swept around a woman was uncoiling herself at his back a hand slapped her ankle the hidden one was mudcolored plastered with mud its knotted hand only just touched her closed and released the woman swiped with her claws at nothing she could see returned to the attack and died on the red mans sword minimalist louis said a rustling sound was trying to find his attention secretive the hindmost said the red herder ran along mud vampires converged and they all faded into distance hes out of my instruments range i lost him for a time i nearly lost the hidden one too and that concerns me look the camera viewpoint swung back along the river caught a splash then moved fast upslope and into shadow louis said i dont here again in infrared the lurked is nearly invisible yeah he was underwater of course shedding heat wheres he going into the vampire nest the sequence ran again lightenhanced splash something emerged from water and ran upslope in jerky random fashion pause not a good view but the shadow was clearly hominid run up into shadow gone that was the last i saw of it clearly it is not a vampire it guards the red herder and perhaps his companions too avoiding notice at all costs in a crunching of brush the fishers and sailors were lining up along the pool to stare at louis wu afloat in midair or else at a window in a rock cliff a view of distant daylit mountains louis asked what else have you got nothing of interest since three hours ago hindmost my brain really is dying for lack of sleep the hindmost said wait this thing is thirtyfive degrees up the curve of the arch five and a half minutes away at lightspeed cant hurt you youre right though its a protector louis you must accept medical help you dont have medical help you put the doc on the lander remember the crew cabin kitchen has a medical menu louis it can make boosterspice boosterspice doesnt make a man well it only makes him young are you no im not sick but humans get sick hindmost and i keep remembering why we dont have a full working doc chmeee and i we didnt volunteer for this work you thought we might refuse to operate the lander so you put the autodoc in the lander and teela flamed it but leave the window running i dont want anyone to think were hiding something from them louis stood and turned away louis i weary of your not listening to me louis took two more steps but hed refused to listen to the hindmost for eleven years and he found apologizing tanj awkward so he turned back and resumed his seat on the boulder speak he said i have my own medical facilities oh yes the hindmost would surely be protected against any concievable accident or malaise nessus had lost a head and neck on their first visit and louis had seen it replaced surgery for a piersons puppeteer what would that do for a human louis this technology was of human origin we bought it from a kzin law enforcer on fafnir but it appears to have been an arm experiment of more than two hundred years ago stolen from sol system the system uses nanotechnology to make repairs inside the cells themselves no second was ever built ive had it modified to heal humans or kzinti or my own kind louis was laughing tanj youre careful most of what was aboard needle was of human manufacture and what wasnt had been carefully hidden if the hindmost were caught while abducting his crew he wouldnt implicate the fleet of worlds pity ill never see it i can move it to the crew deck louis felt cold running up his spine like river water he said youre not serious and im too tired to think good night hindmost louis parked his stack of plates next to the guest house dry brush rustled as he stepped down he spoke to the night not loudly when youre ready to talk im here and i bet youre wearing an embroidered kilt the night had no answer sawur barely stirred when he crawled into the tent he fell asleep at once chapter ten stair street a whiff of corruption pulled her half awake pointed fingernails pressing hard into her elbow pulled her the rest of the way vala sat up with a yelp harpster ducked below the gun she managed not to fire valavirgillin come and see flup are we attacked you would smell vampires im surprised they havent come to look at us perhaps theyre distracted vala stepped out onto the running board rain was falling in fat drops the awning kept her half dry but visibility was low lightning played to antispinstarboard the direction of the vampires stronghold lightning and something else downslope toward the river a steady white light after all their talk had tegger lit a fire but fire wasnt quite that color and fire would have flickered grieving tube was above them on the rock on sentry duty harpster said will you wake warvia yes vala slipped into the payload shell no point in waking anyone else but warvia could see details she might even see something that would tell her this was tegger warvia im awake come and look rain came and went at random permitting glimpses of the light the glow wasnt a dot she saw presently it was a tilted line the light blinked off then on again warvia said tegger likes to fiddle with things is it him how would i know the red woman snapped they watched by and by harpster said light could keep away the vampires if its bright enough warvia was slumped against a rock asleep vala said wake me if something changes ill be out here but i want a blanket she started to climb into the payload shell thinking get two one for warvia the light began to jitter vala paused to watch then a bright dot separated from the tilted line and went straight up the hauler was shuddering shaking trying to tear itself apart tegger clung to the seat as he would have clung to warvia could he free a hand to pluck the strip of valacloth away from the contacts did he want to the shaking wasnt killing him only jarring his teeth mat was doing this some halfruined motor or else a motor doing just what it was told to trying to lift a cargo hauler along with the riverbed it was buried in and while his mind toyed with such notions teggers fingers toyed with toggles flup that was the lights again that one didnt do anything nor that one that one turned the wind off then back on an ominous grating sound from somewhere below had been the response to this one but now it did nothing something protruded from the shadowed recess where the skeletons knees would have gone a big twopronged handle that didnt move under his hand tegger gritted his vibrating teeth gripped the chair with his knees and the handle with both hands and pulled nothing fine push push and twist it lurched under his hands and his head banged hard into the controls he was being hurled into the sky the twist of cloth get it out of there he dared not let go of the chair and perhaps that was a good thing dark as the night was he could see the riverbed dwindle a fall from this high would kill him if he could free a hand or a toe from its deathgrip on the chair there must be a way to steer this bubble as the river wheeled past him he glimpsed a halfburied square plate with a notch missing at the high corner hed torn the control bubble loose from the hauler then he was falling he felt it in his belly falling falling surge twenty to thirty manheights above the river and moving inland moving toward the city a way to take control there must be a way did he trust whisper whisper had led him to the cargo hauler whisper had put valacloth into his hands what would whisper have done if tegger hadnt experimented on his own but whisper had never suggested he steer the hauler or its rippedaway control bubble either anywhere but where he was going now the damaged machine was going home to its aerial dock so whispers minimal guidance was taking him where he wanted to go to trust whisper was to let it happen but he didnt know whispers nature and had never known whispers motives rain running down the windows had tegger half blind by flickering lightning and glimpses of archlight he saw a flattopped mass approaching he could see no motion wait the rain was swirling wheeling suddenly he was in a cloud of screaming birds could vampires fly but even in the rainy dark he knew them bluebelly makaways no different from the makaways of his own turf wingspread greater than his spread arms good gliding ability raptor beaks maks were meat eaters big enough to carry off a herder boy hed never seen so many together he couldnt navigate through that he kept his hands where they were gripping the chair back the birds withdrew to a wheeling pattern the window bubble had come to rest still in midair plainsman that he was tegger had once boarded a barge to trade stock with another tribe he was familiar with docks he was floating a manheight from the edge of what might have been a riverside dock hung in midair floating boats would ride against this buffer rim those cables hanging over the rim would tether them cargo in those big buildings behind those vast doors the birds were losing interest returning to roost makaways werent nightbirds the bubbles doorway was facing out from the dock was there at least a way to turn it around maybe if he twisted something tegger was reluctant to experiment this high in the air what should be happening here the hauler might be waiting for the citys signal to land might be sending a signal of its own maybe one of those cables was supposed to reach out and secure the hauler pull it in but none of it was going to happen because the dock was as dead as anything else that had died in the fall of the cities the door hung loose as hed found it pack sword tegger eased out into a light rain feet on the hanging doors wobbly rim jump to the bubbles slippery top flatten and cling the birds wheeled closer looking him over tegger crept forward on his belly down the slope of the bubble a little farther hands and knees now a bit more knees forward feet braced slipping jump he landed flat banging his chin his legs kicking in open air the dock felt like soft wood hed have stayed but for the shrieking of the birds as they dropped toward him he rolled over pulled his sword and waited when one came close enough he slashed he must have found some city builder thing something like an old car made it work hes up there warvia stared fiercely at the light that blazed at the edge of the floating factory her faith was stronger than valas vala asked what do you see i cant see past the light there are big birds wheeling around it i think i saw him jump the tight sank faster flashed painfully bright and was gone he jumped warvia said positively vala im about to fall over ill give you a better description come daylight can we do anything vala id do anything to reach him grieving tube any thoughts the ghoul shook her head well have to wait i dont know any safer spot for the cruisers and the view is lovely dig in here wait and watch makaways preferred live prey but they would eat carrion makaway meat had a nasty taste tegger felt much better after he had devoured the bird take away hunger disperse the rutting scent of ten thousand vampires give him a flat surface to rest the wind was cold this high tegger pulled a poncho from his pack and wiggled into it the cold the aches the troubles of a nightmare day began to recede and sleep was a vampire with its teeth in his throat he dared not sleep in the open he looked about him in woozy panic the huge door on that storage cube was surely too heavy to move too heavy for anyone and wildly wasteful of power around a corner from the huge door was a door not much taller than tegger a kick sent it springing back at him he went into darkness found something resilient to climb and slept he clung to sleep fearing what his memory would tell him memory came anyway but it was wavering light on his eyelids that snapped him awake sunlight flooded through the mansized doorway it faded even as he was climbing down from a mountain of bales that smelled weakly of vegetable rot stuff to be turned into cloth foodstuffs would have been in a worse state he stepped outside broken cloudscapes swept sluggishly overhead sunlight swept in vertical beams along the dock tegger didnt see any birds until he crept to the edge on hands and knees and looked down the windowed bulb that had carried him here was below him crushed he wasnt going home that way hadnt planned to myriad birds wheeled with spread wings in the sunlight dropping to snatch up what makaways in such numbers must be finding plenty of prey a whole ecology would be feeding off what the vampires left off whole populations of drained corpses there might be nothing but birds up here no wait here was some kind of web on the vertical face of the dock facing outward to starboard he had to lean far over to see it the threads were bronze when the light fell right otherwise nothing could be seen at all size was hard to judge because of the way the web divided itself into nothing at the edges it might be as wide as a grass giant was tall the motionless black dot at the center might be the webspinner dead of starvation tegger hadnt seen an insect since he left the ground birds and a webspinner implied insects but the birds might have eaten the insects tegger wondered if he would starve at best he faced a time limit as if he hadnt known that already what hed been thinking of as the city was unfamiliar in nearly every detail tegger didnt have names for most of what he could see the city sloped upward in irregular geometries and peaked at the center in a vertical tube tegger began running there was no fear in him now it was just a way of exploring he ran and the dock eight manheights wide ran away before him now it narrowed but continued two manheights wide not a dock anymore but merely the rim of the city rim street structures lined it some had doors here and there an alley ran out of sight between windowless bulks rounded doorless shapes had ladders running up their sides the rain resumed tegger had to watch his footing now but the surface was rough beneath his feet and the rain was running off into a gutter along rim streets inward edge he was not much more than warmed up when he saw an anomaly a wide street becoming flights of steps and on either side tegger stopped dwellings he knew the thurls tents and ginjerofers much smaller tents hed seen permanent dwellings kept by more sedentary hominids hed never seen anything like these brightly painted square houses but they were houses with manheight doors and trees arrayed about them and windows later he ran on there were no more houses along rim street he saw brobdingnagian shapes rectangular solids distorted eggs forests of tubing great flat and curved metal webs his mind wasnt making much sense of what he saw get a rounded picture that was it go for detail later he was looking at the city not at the landscape beyond but he had the river in view again and a line of rocky bluffs the cruisers no species had better distance vision than a red herder and no natural shape could pass for a machine people cruiser he couldnt be wrong hed found valavirgillins caravan on that rocky peak most of the expedition seemed to have gone off he saw no sign of life until one of two specks stood up to stretch grass giant sentries tegger stepped to the edge and waved like a man trying to fly would they see him not here against all these confusing shapes but if he could put the sky behind him all in good time the cruisers would keep surprises were not easy to come by when you recognized nothing rim street opened out widened far ahead that was the door hed kicked open last night and here at the portspin end of the docks a street ran off at a right angle a darkmouthed street eight manheights wide angling steeply down where everything else ran uphill toward the citys center he turned right he was running into darkness he slowed the stench would have stopped anyone death and corruption and something under that something familiar a bit of night vision was coming now the street curved off to the right still descending he ran out faster than hed gone in what hed seen as a spiral staircase last night was far larger than hed realized big enough for four cruisers moving abreast he thought for vampires too this was the way up tegger looked into the darkness and knew that he would have to go there and wait while his eyes adjusted and look into the shadow nest and see what looked back but not yet tegger ran on docks and storage great silvered tanks here sunlight flashed off windows short streets and wide stairs skewed as they rose windowed houses rising tier after tier to what might be a great eyeball hed reached stair street tegger began to climb the houses had bands and patches of dirt around and between them for most of stair streets length the wide dirt patch stretching out from the front door of one house was the flat roof of the house below some of these plots were flooded some had been washed away or reduced to sand by hundreds of falans of rainfall here grew tall grass here grew nothing there were dead trees fallen trees live trees fruiting trees here a straggling line of pomes ran from the topmost house nearly down to rim street they looked planted at first but two topmost pome trees were dead and the bottommost were just beginning to produce headsized fruit tegger pictured tens of thousands of spherical pomes rolling downhill over hundreds of falans seeding this whole slope from one tree here was a windowflat not like a vehicle window as big as the thurls bed awesome its surface was murky tegger peered through it but the interior was dark next door a huge tree had uprooted and cracked the wall of a house this house too had one great window facing the earthen plot tegger picked up a chunk of fallen rubble and tried to smash it it was the rubble that cracked but the cracked wall might he squeeze through that opening yes the place was big by teggers standards larger than a tent the scale was larger too not quite grass giant size a chair he sat in left his feet dangling he found an oval bed on the other side of the picture window five skeletons on the bed three adults two children they were a friendly group and seemed at peace one more child size was off the bed reaching for a door the space behind that door looked very dark he used rotted bedding to make a torch and went in no windows here there were furnishings controls levers that would wiggle anyway above spouts that came out of the wall two were at either end of a tub with a drain in the bottom water spouts but no water ran from them tegger continued his search another windowless room another skeleton adult size lay near a shallow opening with tens of tiny knobs inside more controls tegger thought reaching for his pack like the recessed control panel in the hauler towel wedgebladed knife strips of valacloth already cut he began pushing them into place nothing nothing nothing a miracle happened light a point in the ceiling was blazing too bright to look at tegger got out of there lights were shining throughout the house tegger left them that way it surprised him that there was still power where did it come from thunderstorms power was directed lightning he moved up the line of houses faster now looking through windows here and there he saw skeletons always inside bodies outside were gone meat for birds there were scrubby grasses some he knew as edible to hominids plants too weird to be anything but ornamental unless that one with big purple leaves he dug a bit pulled and found fat roots cloudy river delta farmers would eat those boiled these were miniature farms tegger settled himself crosslegged on the roof edge of a plot of earth slumping within his earthcolored poncho letting the rain wash over him like just another lump on the landscape these little patches of dirt were farms no longer the plants were no orderly array of crops untended since the fall of the cities likely enough but was it not strange that in this restricted space the occupants would seed croplands too small to feed a smeerp tegger found it more than interesting he hadnt been nibbled by pests last night maybe hed climbed out of their reach maybe nothing lived here save for the makaways who foraged below but if there was anything like a food chain up here it would begin with growing plants so he would hunt what else was worth noting here vines had grown from two narrow strips of soil to engulf the house behind him and tear it down windows and their frames had buckled he could see furniture ruined by rain the houses were flat surfaces and right angles but stair street was crowned by a dome of windowstuff as big as two or three houses hed compared it to an eyeball but he was only seeing reflections of white clouds it had no color of us own the tube that was the citys peak loomed above even that he was among the topmost houses and they were the biggest with the widest of garden farms it seemed the city builders liked a view the wilderness before and below him was almost a perfect square the center was an empty pool in the shape of a scallop shell four trees had been planted at the corners but rain had carved runnels undercut one of the trees and felled it its roots poked into the air beyond the roofs edge tegger liked the pool it might have been some cluster islands grotto its rounded bottom was smooth blue city builder stuff and there were stairs leading in there was even a running waterfall a spout in the pile of boulders at one edge he could see where the outflow from the waterfall and the rain all ran into a drain at the bottom and disappeared there was dirt in the pool too but it didnt belong there wasnt enough it had washed in still plants had taken root and were cracking the blue bottom a pool for swimming why stairs to get out you could drown otherwise maybe city builders swam maybe homeflow river folk came visiting but having built it why leave it empty nothing was happening among the patches of plants tegger supposed he would have better hunting during halfnight between light and dark was an active time for things that were used to evading predators maybe he could chase something into the pool trap it there meanwhile he dropped to the grass then walked into the pool mud had half choked the drain it had not quite hidden the cover a round drain and a pipe below a round cap the size of his spread fingers on a hinge with a rusted chain hanging from it tegger could see where it ought to lead up there at the edge youd stay dry while you pulled the chain to open the cap he tried to close the cap it resisted he leaned his weight on it and the hinge snapped he set the loose cap on the drain it stayed he watched as the pool began to fill chapter eleven guard duty weaver town ad daylight was glowing on his eyelids louis tried to roll over then stopped hed wake her his memory oozed into place sawur weavers shenthy river valley hindmost vampires and vampire killers a hidden protector she turned in his arms gold and silver fur thin lips her breasts were near flat but prominent nipples poked through the fur she was awake in an eyeblink bare black eyelids made her brown eyes look huge sawur studied him to verify that he too was awake then he hadnt asked but he had guessed morning was sawurs time for rishathra and louis needed this in the worst way the worst way she certainly sensed something wrong she pulled back two inches to see his face do you hunger in the morning sometimes something is distracting you something was is sorry she waited to be sure he had no more to say then will you teach today i should go looking for plants i can eat were omnivores our guts need roughage hey the older children go hunting yes well go with them sawur said theyll learn more from you in the woods than they would from me in a hut here this would be your parting gift but you need it now from a corner she pulled something with straps louis took it into sunlight to admire it it was intricately embroidered weavework a valuable gift a backpouch he found remains of last nights fish in the ashes of the barbecue wrapped in leaves it made a good breakfast he caught up to sawur trying to herd a score of children all in one direction while she lectured on plants fungus animals and animal spoor yesterday hed seen fleshy arrowheadshaped leaves on a purple stalk growing at the bases of the trees something like that grew downstream and those leaves had been edible ordinarily an omnivore could watch what other hominid species ate and try that himself try eating whatever another hominid found safe he couldnt do that among strict carnivores then again what he found need not be shared if it was poisonous there was the medkit eat one thing at a time and check himself if it was mildly poisonous he might have to eat it anyway for roughage for potassium for whatever scarce substance he wasnt getting the children watched as he tested this and that chewed this threw that away put this or that in his backpouch sawur tried to help she pointed out a poisonous twining plant before louis could hurt himself and a blue berry the birds liked that tested clean and tasted of lemon a fungus the size of a dinner plate tested positive for allergies they reached a pond a little ahead of the children sawur slowed him with a hand on his arm the water was flat and still his knees and back protested as he knelt his hair hed never seen it like this laced with white strands his eyes were lined at the edges louis saw his age in an agony of regret he thought like this i should have dressed like this at my two hundredth everyone at the party would have freaked sawur grinned at him impishly were you hoping that strill would come to you louis stared at her then laughed with surprise sawur hadnt been seeing his age but her own he was saved from answering the children were crowding around them again there was something louis wanted to know he could learn by teaching he picked out a blondfurred net thrower who was fighting hard to attract strills attention parald do you know that all humans were once alike they had heard of such they didnt quite believe and they didnt quite disbelieve louis drew in the mud homo habilis life size as best he could render him pak breeder our ancestors lived on a planet like the world i was born on a ball but much closer to the center of our whorl of stars and he drew a barred spiral the galaxy were out here the pak lived in there he couldnt draw the pak world nobody had ever seen it a plant grew there called treeoflife he began to alter homo habilis giving him a swollen misshapen head swollen joints wrinkled and folded skin toothless jawbones grown through the gums into a bony beak youre turning from children into adults he told them when all humans were alike before there was a ringworld there were children and adults to make more children and a third shape to protect them both adults didnt have minds then when an adult got old enough he would eat treeoflife she parald said and giggled stet their generic pronoun was female louis said then she would sleep and change as she slept like a butterfly her sex would fade away protector men and women look alike her jaw would grow to replace her teeth her brain case would expand her joints would expand to give the muscles greater leverage her skin would become thick leather armor when the change was over she would be smarter and stronger and she would care for nothing except to protect her children protectors fought terrible wars over whose children would survive strill asked why doesnt it happen to us theres an element almost missing from the soil beneath the arch the virus that makes protectors cant live without it but in a cavern under one of the islands on the great ocean treeoflife still grows with the virus in the root the terrible thing about a protector is that shell do anything to give an edge to her own relatives whoever built the ringworld locked the treeoflife up so nobody could reach it it grows in artificial light in great plantations beneath the map of mars but somebody must have got to it thats what scares the web dweller parald crowed right he thinks hes found a protector on the other great ocean and another halfway up the arch to antispin and maybe more at work on the rim wall the web dweller isnt related to any human protector by instinct they would call him an enemy he controls the meteor defense in the repair center with that he can burn whatever he likes anywhere on the arch so who should we be afraid of the web dweller or the protectors the children shivered and giggled and then began to talk louis listened and learned they knew of protectors war was only a rumor to them yet the rumor came clothed in protectorshaped armor all hominids seemed to carry that shape in their minds as heroes or monsters as saint george or grendel as designs for armor among the grass giants and as pressure suits on the spaceport ledge after much argument the children seemed to side with the hindmost strangers didnt compete didnt steal didnt rape and what could be stranger than the web dweller presently they all ran off to swim in the lake plants here reminded louis of another plant with a fat root like a beet he began digging sawur watched for a bit then asked well luweewu can you feed yourself i think so it isnt the style of life whereby a man gets fat he sad and are you glad you came among us oh yes he was barely listening a decision hed made eleven years ago was unraveling but you wanted strill louis sighed strill would have been a delight but even sawur mature at fortyodd earth year was as close as he wanted to get to child molesting he said strill is beautiful sawur if strill had come it would have been bad news i can tell how wealthy a culture is from the woman who shares her tent with me im the prize here whatever my real value high and you claimed me but if people are starving or beset by predators or at war they try to guess what prize i want then i find some glorious young woman in my bed and i know we have a problem but you would not no i mean they might need more than ideas hed given away two of his cargo plates to people along the river who needed heavy lifting power he didnt want to tell sawur that so he only said knowledge is like rishathra you have it you give it away you still have it but ive had to give away tools what made you so twitchy this morning protectors louis dropped a root into his pack now he had four you know about protectors since i was a little girl in the stories they are heroes but at the end of time their battles destroy arch and world together kidada and i dont tell those stories anymore these are heroes louis agreed the ones on the rim wall theyre repairing motors that hold the arch where it belongs another has been repelling invaders but protectors can be a bad thing the web dwellers records suggest that protectors destroyed all the life on home on one of our ball worlds it was part of a war between protectors who wanted more turf for their breeders sawur asked do you trust the web dwellers records theyre very good shall we swim in midafternoon the boys killed something like a small antelope the children cut a pole to carry it down to the village with louis marching at the fore end it was pleasant to be the strongest man and not all that uncommon the average ringworld hominid was smaller than louis wu the swimmers had moved on but the sailors and their ship were still in port theyd caught a few fish and started the fire by halfnight the antelope was nearly done half seen between the huts tonight the window in the cliff showed the ringworld edgetoedge a checked blue and white band with black sky along either edge where in tanj were the fearless vampire hunters louis set his assortment of roots to roast at the edge of the coals children and adults were abuzz with questions its the arch he told them tonight the web dweller must be looking all the way across to the opposite edge see theres the edge of the sun itself and thats part of one of the shadow squares that hide the sun at night all that patchy white is clouds no you cant see them moving if they moved as fast as that the wind would blow the landscape right off the scrith foundation those glittering dots and curves and lines if you can make them out those are seas and rivers hes showing the stars larger too old kidada said whats that moving one and louis what is the web dweller trying to tell you off the edges of the arch all of the bright stars were adrift the brightest was moving crosswise to the rest louis had been watching it it slowed as it approached the rim wall it was on the rim wall turning a stretch of the rim into a brilliant bluewhite line and it went out louis said hes trying to tell me that another invader has come under the arch parald sliced off meat and passed it to kidada then sawur then a sudden crowd wheek offered louis a fish on a stick weavers and sailors took their meals and moved through the huts to the cliff side i show you the ringworld invaded come and talk i do not show you valavirgillin alive or dead you must ask louis accepted a slice of antelope and eating twohanded followed parald the weavers sat on tables and the sand watching sawur made room for him on a table within the webeye window a shadow square crossed the sun details became clearer sharper brilliant light flared on the rim wall over the next several minutes the point moved inward above the ringworld surface dimmed blurred went out dull stuff but they watched louis wondered if weavers would become addicted to passive entertainment the clouds were moving now vast wind patterns showed their shapes in fastforward a tiny pale hourglass sucked streamlines at both ends a hurricane on its side a meteor puncture hole fastforward a solar prominence rose past the rim of the shadow square a shock wave of green brilliance rose up the plume then a burning green star delicately touched the rim wall at the point where the earlier star had rested the green star walked off the rim and blurred as it intersected clouds as the last sliver of sun vanished overhead the weavers all streamed off to their huts chattering in excitement punctuated by yawns louis watched in astonishment these weavers were really diurnal before the hindmost could decide to speak in front of them louis strolled back to the fire he raked two roots out of the coals one was acrid one wasnt bad he didnt always eat this well the sailors had remained one came to join him that show is for you isnt it louis looked back within the hindmosts window the green star had gone out i dont know what to say to him louis said wheek did he speak to you no he frightens me the hindmosts message seemed clear enough fusion drive invading spacecraft arm and patriarchy and the fleet of worlds all knew of the ringworld each had had time to mount expeditions or the invader might be a returning city builder craft or someone else entirely the automatic meteor defense wouldnt react if an invader moved slowly some entity was actively killing ships the killer had a problem too lightspeed the invader had landed lightminutes from the second great ocean but the attack had come hours slow a solar plume must be ejected the superthermal laser effect must propagate along the plasma and it all took time but there was still that lightspeed delay the prey might still escape the hindmost would be extremely eager to find a hyperdrive ship undamaged low music was playing through distant branches wheek had gone to his boat louis raked a third root from the fire he slit it then pushed on the ends to open it live steam and a smell not too different from a sweet potato he wondered if hed found wild treeoflife no matter the soil wouldnt have enough thallium the plant wouldnt support the virus that caused the change and cooking would kill it anyway louis took his time eating then went toward sawurs wicker hut the music seemed to grow louder strange stuff with qualities of wind and humming strings he stopped outside sawurs wicker hut to listen the music stopped a voice said will you not speak to the web dweller not tonight louis said and looked around him the voice was a childs with a bit of a speech impediment tonight was foggy but ringworld nights were bright and he should have seen something louis thought will you show yourself a nightmare rose out of low brush too near lank hair covered its body the color of the night big spade teeth forced an exaggerated grin long arms big hands a miniature harp in one hand the ghoul seemed male but a kilt hid that sparse facial hair flat chest a child boy or girt nice kilt louis said nice backpouch weaver work is loved all through the shenthy river valley louis knew that he had seen weaver work tens of thousands of miles downstream he asked do you do security work for the weavers sec guard their possessions by night yes we stop thieves but youre not paid for normal ah in lieu of answer was there a word for garbage disposal plus funeral service the child blew into the handle of his harp while his fingers played across the holes and tweaked the strings he played a tune on his tootling twanging instrument then held it out do you have a name for this illegitimate child of a harp and a kazoo a kazarp then i am kazarp the ghoul said are you louis wu how we know that you boiled an ocean far up the arch kazarp pointed there you vanish for fortyone falans and we find you here kazarp your communications are awesome how is it done louis didnt expect an answer ghouls had their secrets sunlight and mirrors kazarp said was the web dweller your friend once ally not friend its complicated the pointyfaced hominid examined louis louis was trying to ignore the smell of a carrion eaters breath the child asked would you have spoken to father maybe how old are you near forty falans ten years how old is your father a hundred fifty in falans im about a thousand louis wu said he decided that the child was too easy to notice a distraction was his father eavesdropping well then how to tell this should he louis said the web dweller the big cat two city builders and me we saved everything under the arch kazarp said nothing some wanderers must be great liars louis thought he said we had a plan but it would kill sssome it would kill many of the people we were trying to save im as guilty as i thought the web dweller was and i hated him for it now i find out that the web dweller saved many more than i realized then you must thank him and apologize i did that kazarp kazarp i expect well talk again but my species needs sleep if your father wants to talk a ghoul could certainly find me louis knelt to enter the wicker house did it leave a bad taste louis laughed a ghoul might well know all about bad taste but that voice wasnt kazarp he stepped back outside he said yes still you swallowed what you must now the web dweller must decide a valuable alliance a breach of manners youre a thousand falans old how old is the web dweller even guessing makes my head hurt the child had settled crosslegged and was playing background music to the voice that spoke from nowhere the adults voice said we live perhaps two hundred falans if your misunderstanding only cost you forty or fifty falans for such as you it must be worth repairing oh the city builders were refugees and killing doesnt bother chmeee but im still guilty i consented i thought we killed all those people to save the rest be joyful yeah he couldnt ask even a ghoul to consider the numbers involved no sane mind could grasp them hominids of varying intelligence inhabit the ringworld invading every conceivable ecological niche cattle otters vampire bats hyenas hawks roughly thirty trillion with a margin of error bigger than all known space we can save most of them we will generate a solar flare and turn it on the ringworld surface to bring heated hydrogen fuel to the few remounted attitude jets on the rim walls lose fifteen hundred billion to radiation and fire they would die anyway save twenty times as many but the hindmosts advanced adaptable programs had exercised fine control over a plasma jet bigger than worlds the hindmost had not killed fifteen hundred billion not at all but louis wu had consented to their deaths he said that region of the repair center was infested with treeoflife with the plant that changes hominids into something very different kazarp says youre about the right age to become a protector im seven times that old the virus in treeoflife would kill old louis wu so i sent the web dweller in alone to cause their deaths otherwise i would have seen how many didnt die i took all those lives and the only apology i could make was to die but youre not dead the hidden voice said dying with the medkit on my cargo plates i might get as much as another falan the childs music broke in discord and the night was silent tanj he had longevity and hed thrown it away but these people had never had the choice just how illmannered had he been the adult said and you gave up his friendship the web dweller doesnt exactly have friends he bargains very exactly and his aim is always to make himself safer he intends to live forever whatever that takes that bothered me then it bothers me now what will it take your alliance does he have something to gain from you a traveling pair of hands a life to risk that isnt his own a second opinion he can offer me another hundred twenty falans of life and that was scary could he do that for let us say me offer longevity to a ghoul no his systems the programs to heal him or me or the big cat he must have designed and built them before he left home he cant get home i stopped that and if he could why not just stay and he thought further hes got a program to repair humans and a program for a kzin for a ghoul hed have to write a new program what my life would cost me is already too much but what would it cost to write a treatment program for yet another species and if louis wu asked him to save a ghoul then why not a weaver next a city builder a impossible the hidden ghoul had accepted that or else he was thinking that some wanderers were mad kazarp was playing again louis said when i thought id murdered so many people i decided to age and die in traditional fashion how bad could it be people have done that since there were people luweewu i would give all i have to be a hundred falans younger the web dweller can do that for me for my species he can do it again when i get old again demanding anything he likes of me each time you could refuse each time no thats my problem exactly louis peered into the dark what shall i call you the music of the kazooharp suddenly had a bass accompaniment louis listened for a time a wind instrument he could not guess its shape tunesmith he decided tunesmith its been helpful talking with you we should speak of other things ships and shoes and sealing wax and protectors what did the ghoul heliograph net know of protectors but im groggy tomorrow night louis said and crawled inside to sleep chapter twelve weaning vampires tegger had expected the windowdome to be some kind of weird dwelling but it wasnt there was no obvious way to lock the door the interior was all one big room and that was a stairway too big even for grass giants concentric semicircles of steps and tables a dozen light tables on skids what was this he wondered if a hundred or so hominids sat on those steps theyd have one fine view of the factory city and lands beyond a conference room he tried it himself for a bit then moved on doors at the top of the last step beyond darkness tegger lit a torch this was not a room to live in it was all flat surfaces and thick doors that had little windows in them and little boxes inside when in doubt he thought keep looking three big water basins with drains a flat table of wood now warped hanging from a hundred hooks metal bowls and dishes with long handles behind a panel above eye level tegger found something he recognized tiny knobs joined by fine lines of dust he began replacing the dust lines with strips of valacloth a light came on six channels hed laid one light what did the others do there were more doors to the back tegger took up his torch and passed through storage here doors drawers and bins the ghosts of old smells were pleasant enough plants they didnt smell like food but they probably were tegger searched out dried plant residues but found nothing that even a grass giant would eat they sat on those semicircular steps and ate maybe tegger went back into the lighted room it seemed warmer and he still didnt get it until he tried to lean on one of the flat surfaces red herders dont yell when hurt tegger hugged his burnt arm teeth bared in pain then after careful thought he began to spit on flat surfaces twice his spit sizzled the doors to two of the boxes were hot to the touch he was in some kind of chemical plant maybe another hominid could understand this better than he the peak of the city was a great squat tube with a waspwaist constriction a helical stair took him to the rim tegger looked about him like a king what hed missed before leapt at him now that hed reached the tallest point in the city every roof was the same color the flat tops of rectangular solids the curved tops of tanks were all a glittery gray some had symbols painted on the gray in narrow lines the only exceptions were the houses along stair street where flat places were soil and pools and yes the stairs were glittery gray but the sides of things were of all colors industrial shapes were not so much decorated as labeled there was script tegger didnt recognize square and curved and scrawly there were simple pictures the old city builders could fly why not label the tops of things too unless this gray surface had was flup he almost had it work on it meanwhile he was standing at the rim of a tremendous tube ten manheights tall and about that wide tegger looked down inside a much greater distance than ten manheights the reek of ash and chemicals was faint but he wasnt imagining it here was a chimney big enough to burn whole villages this alone might be reason enough to set a factory floating the smoke from such a burning might hover for years before drifting away but at least it would rise first irritated neighbors might be pacified then again how would neighbors reach a floating industrial center to make their complaints hed been climbing stairs and exploring houses for a quarter of the day but the cruisers hadnt moved valavirgillin must have chosen that peak as a defensible position sentries shifted on the rock watching the river watching the shadow nest and its floating roof tegger dropped his poncho to expose the unmistakable color of his skin at the rim of the tallest point of the city he raised both arms and waved warvia by the power of our love and valavirgillin by the power of the cloth i stole ive reached this place here i will accomplish something somehow somehow had he been seen he thought they were pointing at him well then the city rolled away below him he was able to find the dock to orient himself from that the houses and stairs ran from just below him down to rim street along both sides of a zigzag line that line was nearly opposite the docks most of what he saw he still didnt understand but cisterns sixteen huge cylindrical tanks were open to the sky evenly spaced about the city he had to guess that those tanks were intended to hold water the houses and windowdome at least would need water but the cisterns were empty every one of them like the pools along stair street all empty after the fall of the cities citizens would have nothing to carry them down some must have gone down the ramp when the vampires moved in that option closed they were marooned they would need water there was the river there must be pumps why else position a factory above a river but the pumps had likely stopped working and the rain hadnt started yet but theyd drained the citys water why had they done that were they already crazy whisper was gone and his own mind wasnt enough he had to get the cruisers up here somehow he slept in the windowdome that night on one of the steps it seemed safe and he loved the view at halfnight several hundred vampires streamed away from the shadow nest up the homeflow and into the mountains as the last edge of sun disappeared their numbers rose into the thousands valas people reacted variously to that many vampires passing that closely the gleaners simply missed it they had to sleep at night vala rapidly realized that she couldnt use grass giant sentries at night anyone could see their courage but anyone could smell their fear except beedj how did they train a budding thurl was it something she could use too she sent the rest to bed and relied thenceforth on her own people and the ghouls whatever their frustrations they were learning a great deal about vampires the second night was ending and now in driving rain beneath a black lid of cloud the vampires straggled home their numbers were thinned a bit harpster said and they had a few tens of prisoners they had been more quarrelsome going out the ghouls reported structures in the shadow nest there were huts or storage shacks many had fallen down something mountainous stood in midriver the ghouls couldnt see the top of it their angle was too high they could see no way up save for the spiral ramp there was a midden a garbage dump off to portantispin of the shadow nest it must have been growing for ages a mountain of vampire and prisoner corpses until even vala could see it once it was pointed out it was too close to the shadow nest to be of use to ghouls there was no place beneath the floating factory that the vampires didnt go it was full light now and the procession of vampires had become a trickle when that stops were going back to the river vala said we need our sleep harpster said i know you stay here were ripe for bathing and we need to learn well sleep under the awning wake us at the river valavirgillin rolled the cruiser along the riverbank there was no way to hide anything so large and she didnt try flashes of daylight came and went and flurries of rain the shadow nest loomed ahead too near none of her companions could see into the blackness below the ancient hulk but when the shifting black clouds closed their own lid over the land vala could see motion around the shadows edges some vampires at least were active it was midday valavirgillin kept a wary eye on the weather if it got too dark the vampires would be out and hunting the tilted plate loomed across the sluggish brown water it looked hard to reach vampires seemed safely distant vala stepped out onto the river mud two black heads surfaced well out into the water and swam toward them it was best to introduce oneself repeatedly to aliens who might not see differences in individuals i am valavirgillin rooballabl fudghabladl the river is shallow here your cruiser might safely roll as far as the island it would be more difficult to attack you warvia manack beedj barok and waast were tending the cannon were not planning to stay roobla there was activity around here last night the red companion you asked us to look for we have seen him we could not come near but we saw him fight and we saw him fly fudghabladl says that he had a companion i never saw one warvia burst out companion where would tegger find a companion was it a vampire i saw no companion no kind fudghabladls sight fails tegger talked to himself from time to time he came to look at this tilted flying thing six vampires jumped him they did no courting they simply attacked rooballabl sounded petulant as if the vampires had broken a rule vala nodded worth knowing beyond that the river folk had seen not much more than warvia had seen from the cruisers when the tale was told vala asked are you safe here we believe so we learn too do you know that prisoners live in the shadow nest we saw prisoners brought through the pass warvia said some roam free rooballabl said we did not come near those but we watched never were more than two or three loose at once what species two big ones went to eat river grass then back under the shadow grass giants i think many vampires came to meet them the vampires fought some ran away and the rest fed upon the grass giants the grass giants did not survive but we saw farmers of the spin delta region pull up roots and boil and eat them and return alive fudghabladl spoke the river folk chatted a bit then rooballabl translated in spurts fudghabladl watched a red woman she spent half a day hunting but badly she had no patience she came back again and again to the shadow and her vampire he would send her again late in the day she caught a leaperbuck drinking jumped it and broke its neck pulled it back to the shadow three vampires shooed the rest off these three drank the beasts blood then they rished with the red then the red ate of the leaperbuck she was very hungry vala tried not to see the hot rage and shame in warvias face she asked rooballabl did you see any of my species more river folk chatter then one a young woman goes guarded by a vampire male valavirgillin what success for you weve seen tegger waving at us hes up there alive and active i still dont see how we can get ourselves up i dont see how else we can do anything what did you expect warvia half snarled the ghouls had a plan the ramp they want doesnt go all the way down vala half expected angry comments from under the awning but the night people held their peace it must have reached the ground once rooballabl said what else could it be for when the city worked there had been flying cargo craft but rolling craft must have been cheaper and surely there were cargoes too heavy to float i expect the fall of the cities brought the vampires vala said beedj asked how with her eyes on the misty outline of the shadow nest valavirgillin let her mind roam and her tongue follow a center of industry could hardly permit vampires to nest in their basement so somehow they kept the vampires out but when the cities fell it stopped working vampires look for shadows they moved in one night the vampires went up the ramp they didnt get everyone so by the next night the refugees had pulled up the ramp again beedj asked how vala shrugged rooballabls voice was like bubbles popping in mud ask instead why they built a tremendous hanging road for cargoes too big even for this great floating plate why would anyone build it to move to lift such a vertical bridge would be difficult to build and easily damaged if it also had to lift we understand weight and mass a little i think rooballabl was right and vala was irritated i dont know the answer how about a war between people who could fly and people who couldnt youd want to pull up the bridge so to speak her crew looked at each other beedj asked do any of you have old records of such a war none spoke rumors then forget it vala snapped manack asked why build the ramp to lift why not just lift the city a little alien or not he saw something in valas demeanor and added never mind the sky was black and pouring rain when tegger waked into the shadow he lit a torch when he could but the light didnt travel far it lit a featureless circle of the road down he was walking into a roar like a rainstorm he edged to the right side and found a ribhigh curb peered over and saw nothing they must have seen him they might not like the torch but it certainly made him conspicuous he was carrying nine more what would happen if he dropped one instead he leaned far over the curb and hurled the torch onto the loop of road below him he looked over to be sure it still burned then walked a little farther down the ramp hed come somewhat more than a full turn now he could let his night vision develop these odors reminded him of the nights he and the others had spent waiting to speak to the ghouls the sounds were like the thurls tent at night domestic sounds murmurs sudden quarrels all in an alien language all above a sound like a waterfall what he imagined below him must be worse than the reality tegger looked over the bottom of the spiral ramp was high off the ground something inside him saw that as funny he could see pale triangular faces looking up and that was funny too tegger began to giggle deep into shadow water fell in a vertical river a waterfall of tremendous scope all the rain falling on the city was pouring onto some huge dark mass and thence into the homeflow he was at the edge of the city the waterfall must be near or at the center but the roar was loud even here it was pouring onto into a vast intricate structure then into the homeflow via lesser falls and streams tegger could see little but darkondark but here was a fountain of such size as nobody but an ancient city builder would even consider the homeflow ran around the fountain on both sides here it seemed to be confined in concrete where the concrete ended near teggers perch was rapids water falling from the city adding its momentum to the homeflow itself had cut a deep canyon only its walls showed in the blaze of daylight around the citys edge and of course there were vampires everywhere most were asleep cuddled in family groups wait now that was a machine people wasnt it hard to tell in the dark a woman despite the mustache she had breasts and no clothing she was the center of a circle of vampires it looked to tegger like they were protecting her from other vampires from thieves four of adult size two small enough to be children and the infant in one womans arms enough to guard her machine people had been taken during the attacks on the thurl tegger continued to watch the baby woke and attempted to suck the woman half woke she gave the baby to the red woman oh flup the red was putting it to her neck tegger let himself slump against the curb in the dark he hadnt eaten in some time but old bird meat was trying to rise again why do vampires collect prisoners how do vampires wean their babies tegger didnt want to know anymore sometimes the trick is to set a problem aside tegger had almost reached the light above him when it all came together in his mind water ramp lights vampires below stranded city builders above the cruisers there was more to be learned but tegger knew what he had to do now and afterward ultimately hed love help all over the floating industrial structure lights were going on valavirgillin was hurting for lack of sleep soon she would seek her bed but they were so beautiful her mind drifted food was running low in the heights grass was scarce prey was scarce and agile the gleaners were finding enough to eat the river folk had found fish enough and to spare cruiser one had brought whole basketfuls back fish would feed anyone but the ghouls and grass giants machine people would need something more than fish but not yet a few vampires were hunting around the shadow nests garbage dump they must be hungry vala thought but they were having some success warvia reported scavengers no red had ever seen before perhaps ghouls killed competing scavengers where they could fudghabladl had said they rolled corpses into the homeflow the vampires numbers must have been smaller then now they stacked them away from the river scavengers came for the bodies and starving vampires hunted them for their blood the cruisers were once again parked backtoback with sentries on duty vampires had ignored them on the first night theyve had the whole day to watch us as we watched them in a day or two the stored grass would be gone the giants would have to forage in the lowlands in daylight only with companions to guard them the ghouls might find forage too vampire prisoners must die during the trek home grieving tube spoke power cannot be made to flow without certain unusual materials valavirgillin didnt jump didnt look around i know unusual some wire must have survived the fall of the cities or else come under the arch afterward where would a red herder find such in my pack i think valavirgillin said ghouls know all secrets a good thing for tegger he would have died at the river yes into the silence valavirgillin said louis wu left me a stack of it has a long name superconductor cloth i traded it to the city builder families of a floating city they used it to repair their lights and water condensers so i was rich i took tarablilliast for my mate i bore three children i invested in a project to make what louis wu described plastic tarablilliast has never criticized me for wasting our money never but once she remembered after all it was my wealth he brought little to the mating this plastic grieving tubes pronunciation was the exact imitation of valavirgillins does it have a name in our tongues i think not louis described stuff that could be made from the nasty residue after one makes fuel scentless taking any shape he showed me one or two plastic things otherwise i was guessing tarbavala labs has produced results answers nothing we can sell tarb and our parents are taking care of our children while i scramble for money to keep our concerns going i thought a trading expedition would serve me persuading hominid cultures to make alcohol commands a bounty trade is wealth on top of that how long have you been gone nearly ten falans too long i dont know ive mated tarb never bargained for that vala shook her head i need sleep i will watch chapter thirteen sawurs law weaver town ad louis was alone when he woke and hungry he pulled on his zipsuit and walked out through crackling brush the village seemed empty there was warmth in the ashes of last nights fire he found the last of his roots and cut it open it was almost like eggplant not a bad breakfast noonday sun of course but it felt like noon like hed wasted half the day he boarded his cargo stack and went up for a look around there they were instantly obvious comet sawur leading a tail of children through the upstream arch he caught them leaving the arch left the cargo sock and joined the tail they walked along the river louis drew maps of the ringworld for them and spoke of its builders and its age and its fate and tried to tell them which parts were guesswork he drew the double superconducting toroids theyd found remounted on the city builder spacecraft bussard ramjets taken from their mountings on the rim wall he did not speak of what it had cost him to fuel the rest some of the boys had disappeared now they were back theyd found hundreds of bird nests perched in forked trees the entire horde ran off and louis and sawur followed slowly sawur said i cannot work out your sleep pattern i talked long last night with two whom you may never meet people of the night theyre said to know all and to rule everything under the arch the dead belong to them louis we have guested visitors who speak to such folk but why do you ill talk to anyone louis admitted sawur i enjoyed it i may have learned a little i think the child wanted to talk and her father didnt move fast enough to stop her then tunesmith gave away more than he knew and now i almost know how their empire communicates over all that vast distance along the arch sawurs jaw sagged louis said hastily not my secret to tell sawur not even if i knew it even so they dont know everything theyve got problems ive got problems you do yes she said sharply you wouldnt wake this morning but you were talking to your dreams what torments you louis but they had nearly walked into an explosion of small nets the children had crept around the grove surrounded it now the nets were flying in an hour they had caught an amazing number of pigeonsized birds weavers seemed to have no interest in eggs but louis collected a dozen they looked and felt like slick plastic like freefall drinking bulbs with no nipple worth a try in midafternoon they were back in the village while the children plucked the birds louis and sawur went off alone they sat on a flat rock and watched the older weavers building the fire sawur asked again what torments a teacher louis laughed teachers dont have torments but how to explain to a weaver i made a fool of myself long ago it must have taken the web dweller four or five falans just to realize how stupid ive been why louis wu wasnt talking to him but were talking now and thats not the problem sawur the web dweller captured me and chmeee to be his servants very reprehensible of course but he has gifts to pay for such a theft he has seeds to be chewed to make an old hominid young or a kzin sawur nibbled her lip well he can will he for value received and he has a device an autodoc it can heal serious wounds scars and missing limbs likely it can repair damage even boosterspice wont touch sawur to rebuild a man requires extreme medical techniques if he can build me young i believe he can build me docile chmeee and i both made poor slaves the hindmost can make me a better servant a perfect servant until the right before last i had an excuse for keeping myself out of his machines now i dont sawur asked have his machines had you before that was a good question he had me in frozen sleep for two years he may have done some medical work on me he could have done anything he wanted but he didnt i dont think he did i dont feel any different sawur was silent louis laughed suddenly turned and hugged her never mind i cut his hyperdrive motor apart he cant go back to the stars and thats why he had to save the arch if he made me a servant he made me a bad one sawur stared then laughed loud but louis you trapped yourself too id made a promise to valavirgillin of the machine people i said id save the ringworld or die trying sawur was silent he thought he had a wirehead louis heard the gap in translation wirehead had no equivalent in sawurs tongue he thought i would do anything he asked for electric current through the pleasure center of my brain as a weaver might sell her freedom for say alcohol he didnt know i could throw it off he knows now sawur said so what if he makes you young and docile but what if you first determine that you will ignore his commands sawur he can change my mind ah louis brooded for a time presently he said im clever and agile and the web dweller knows in if he made me a better servant i might become stupid or slow i can tell myself hed be a fool to alter me very much its hellishly tempting im afraid ill believe it sawur would he keep a promise to you another good question nessus rejected by his species nessus the mad puppeteer had demanded that the hindmost mate with him should he return from the ringworld the hindmost had agreed and kept the covenant but that was a bargain between equals no it wasnt nessus had been presumed mad mad for centuries throughout known space puppeteers had kept their contracts with a variety of species hed forgotten sawur he jumped when she spoke youve given me my youth and snatched it away if i believe your crazy dream but ill tell you this she said with a whip in her voice the older i am the more i would give to be young again if you dont ever intend to deal with the web dweller thats one thing if you do then the last thing you want is to wait until youre old and sick she was he decided dead right that night they cooked their meat and the sailors their fish and louis his eggs and a river weed hed found edible and went to sit beneath the cliff louis found himself looking for tunesmith in the brush there was no sign of the ghoul but he would be listening the floating industrial park had been lifeless when last louis had seen it now the hindmosts webeye window showed it blazing with lights youve got me louis said to the empty air i have to know how that happened the view jumped chapter fourteen invasion pointed claws rested on her wrist she whispered grieving tube harpster my mate wakes others valavirgillin you must see it seemed shed only just closed her eyes vala rolled out of her blanket she didnt say this had best be important other species had their priorities traders had to learn them black night and rain the shadow nest was a blurred constellation harpster had returned to the cruiser waast and beedj came out then barok barok asked what is it boss i cant see anything warvia came up beside them its murky down there valavirgillin i know the ramp vala you really cant see it isnt just the ramp the whole city has settled a little flup manack was right the folk in cruiser two spilled out all at once gaping chattering they saw no more than vala did but harpster was at warvias side saying not our imagination the vampires are trying to jump to the ramp its still too high for them theyll have it in not too many breaths its tegger warvia screamed he did it but theyll be pouring up the ramp vala wondered is this real nobody could see the change but warvia and the ghouls and even they wouldnt claim that the ramp was down board valavirgillin bellowed anyone not aboard gets left board your vehicles and arm yourselves were going up tegger lay on his belly looking over the edge of the dock he didnt see many vampires it wasnt good hunting territory for them their only prey were the besotted prisoners under the shadow a few starving rogues hunted out here vampires desperate enough to try to trap animals for their blood it was dark down there and rain blurred the view but the cruisers were unmistakable they rolled slowly mud and sand sucked at their huge wheels four vampires swarmed onto the first cruiser quick as gleaners and climbed toward the driving bench gleaners dropped from the turret towels across their mouths swords in hand paroom stepped from aft swinging some kind of mace in a moment the invaders became imploring suitors another moment and two were dead the others in flight and parooms long mace caught one in midair a shock traveled lightly up teggers spine he had been waiting for that hed spent most of the day finding circuitry panels opening them testing what their circuits did hed learned to recognize the styles of panel that controlled lighting here was the panel that controlled the dockside lights hed already placed twists of valas cloth he flicked two switches and the dock lit up like daylight with his eyes tightly closed tegger felt his way to ramp street and into the darkness he paused for a bit to get his night vision back then he looked over hed felt the shock as the ramp touched bottom vampires were moving up the successive turns of the ramp there werent many perhaps their noses told them how little awaited them one little lone red herder and no other prey at all tegger set to the patient work of lighting a torch when he had it flickering he set it aside and looked down again roughly thirty young adults and adolescent children were climbing toward him in no great hurry what were they thinking heres a road where no road was but theres no scent of prey follow it but best not be first light oh my it hurts they were piling up a level below him their arms hiding their faces tegger wondered if the dockyard lights would hold them the scent billowed into his face reflex said do something and reflex called him down but he couldnt couldnt he whipped the torch around his head and hurled the fireball a level below all the pale faces ducked away and most of them were running back down the ramp a few were trapped between the torch and the dockyard lights tegger fled at the docks edge he leaned over empty space and sucked great lungfuls of clean air the cruisers were close now two or three hundredbreaths away vampires were harrying them more with every breath that passed warriors lined the running boards gleaners jabbed spears between the pillars of grass giant ankles while grass giants fired crossbows at more distant targets tegger heard very faintly above the whisper of the river the duet the ghouls were playing from the cannon towers no gunfire had valavirgillin ordered silence to delay alerting the nest but the vampires numbers were growing the nest was waking to an invasion the river flowed into darkness and the cruisers followed darkness it was black as sin below him vampires would see just fine ghouls on the driving benches might be able to shout directions but the rest would be blind there was something he could do hed need nerve and his sword valavirgillin drove with a hand for the tiller and another for her gun barok rode the bench with her facing backward she was breathing pepperleek through a towel the thurl had been right from the first herbs were more effective than fuel a white face popped up and she fired twohanded and had the tiller again before the cruiser could veer other guns began firing barok took her gun and handed her another loaded the noise drove the vampires back and the cruisers rolled into darkness the floating factory glowed above her like a constellation she could see little below its edge but she knew where the ramp was and she aimed for that how well would these reject vampires fight now that only they could see she was driving into a black stench like all the graveyards under the arch disgust should be a defense but it wasnt it wasnt as always the real enemy here was a growing urge to mate in the middle of a war harpster interrupted his eerie music to shout boss left left then hook around right and onto the ramp boss there are vampires on the ramp vala turned left into blackness the cruisers were holding their own the shadows they fought were children maimed and halt elderly pregnant all who hadnt departed in the stream of hunters in the dead of night they were at their peak of alertness vala had considered waiting for dawn but dawn would have brought the hunters back however exhausted in all their strength and numbers and these she fought now would have had half the night to reach tegger meteors fell ahead of her vampires crouched waiting between vala and the ramp skreeked and rolled aside fireballs fell torches and some went out but six still burned teggers gift she was on the ramp and cruiser two right behind her and vampires coming from all sides one popped up on the bench vala blasted it away and set the gun aside the cannon roared a wind of fire and pebbles swept the ramp clean ahead of her behind her light suddenly blazed as if the sun had fallen from the arch in the terrible glare vampires hid their eyes and froze sitting birds guns and crossbows banged and twanged all around her the bench shook vala whirled around with vampire scent driving her crazy and only her empty gun for defense a distorted machine people face looked back at her foranayeedli looking quite crazy gripped the bench with all four limbs and her teeth vala kept driving round and round a shadow in the light semaphored both arms one hand brandished a sword she drove into the light red tegger naked why stepped aside to let the cruisers past she saw warvia leap from the cruiser the shock when she impacted tegger sent his sword flying warvias tunic flew after it vala hardly needed to hear the shouts of her companions it was celebration time rishathra time someone must keep her wits long enough to guard them vala pulled up in the white light of the dock she heard fighting vampire no she heard speech foranayeedli had found her father they were screaming mortal insults at each other vala tried to judge if they would kill each other there was a moment in which they paused for breath vala touched their shoulders get their attention back up fast talk fast forn no barok really it was my fault our fault any of us could see what would happen cant we share the blame father and daughter looked at her shocked you should not have been together when vampires came i should have parted you i was wrong dont you understand we all mated we couldnt help it chit and kay are pregnant barok they still dont know about you and forn do they barok mumbled dont think so but we cant go home forn waited rish with someone vala said boss dont you see now silly girl paroom looks distractable get it out of your blood so you can think go forn suddenly laughed what about you boss ive got to button this up barok find waast but that was waasts voice waast had been found and by more than one male or someone go she pushed them in opposite directions and they went next the reds seemed reconciled that might even last tegger must know the power of the vampire scent by now the scent still fizzed through valas brain and blood but shed known it far stronger and resisted well not resisted exactly a pale child stood before her half her size squinting mutely beseeching she stepped toward it a crossbow bolt sprouted in its chest it squawled and ran wobbling into shadow vala turned it was paroom she said i thought id use the gun butt it was too young to put out a scent the grass giant accepted that we may have brought more than one rider i havent seen any but that child check the tunnel i found four vampires dead by blade teggers prey i think thatll help one of them had all her teeth knocked out and what did you say thats right vampires dont like the stink of their own dead they wont go past then we made it were safe good enough paroom said and folded her in his arms the party was ending vala didnt want to notice she was wrapped in sexual congress with kaywerbrimmis it should be safe shed be doing it anyway but after what hed been through this past halfnight she thought no male could still make a child the sun was a blurred silver in the graywhite clouds all four gleaners were asleep in a pile the ghouls had dropped out early and crawled under an awning the grass giants had begun exploring each other outside the rishathra pattern as she and kay were and tegger and warvia were talking just talking kaywerbrimmis relaxed in her arms and was fast asleep vala disengaged herself rolled kays tunic and pushed it under his head she strolled limped down the dock toward the reds alert for body language but they didnt seem unwelcoming she said tell it tegger how do you lower a floating factory tegger grinned in pride and so vala believed did warvia he said its a puzzle youll see the pieces all around you there are swimming pools and cisterns and every one of them was empty when i got here vala waited city builders were stranded here after the fall of the cities ive seen their bones we know vampires moved into the shadow they must have come up the ramp what would you have done we talked about lifting the ramp somehow tegger nodded happily every cistern empty but the fall of the cities came long before louis wu boiled a sea they had to have a water supply but the vampires scared them more so they let all that mass of water run out and the city went up so you plugged all the cisterns there were some big metal sheets at the dock i used them for plugs and waited for the rain to fill them up and the city went down yes thank you for the light tegger laughed heh i thought youd like that i lit all my torches and dropped them over then i poured a canteens worth of fuel down on the fire and now what tegger said now were where we can do something and now ive got fifteen bright friends to work something out vala nodded tegger didnt have an answer but hed done miracles already chapter fifteen power in the blaze of full day tegger led them up stair street to show them his discoveries he found it frustrating warvia would dive into houses jungles of ornamental plants and halffilled swimming pools then rush back with questions tegger couldnt follow her he must keep to the pace of the rest gleaners were even faster than she was and they got into places no red would fit then came sprinting back to chatter at the grass giants here these grasses ought to serve you tegger told waast while she was the only grass giant handy she took the handful smiled at him and chewing followed perilack and silack into a collapsing house i havent seen any plant eaters he told coriack i looked for droppings nothing oh well find something to eat therere webspinners if nothing else did we bring any insect eaters he was talking to valavirgillin now youd think there must be animals to eat the plants but i havent been able to catch anything but birds and i havent seen any insects vala asked carrion he guessed her meaning old dry bones the ghouls wont eat until we starve but i did find these pomes a whole line of pome trees here vala broke a pome apart and began to eat theyd feed machine people yes for a while tegger what do these factories make i found a warehouse full of cloth maybe they make that here vala i havent really looked yet vala was interested in the factories with her pack full of louis wus magic cloth she might get some motors working even if she couldnt if everything had deteriorated too far she might still find wonders made before the fall of the cities stacked in factories or warehouses still waiting to be shipped but tegger himself must be starving her people had to be fed now look for profit later after she found some way down the little party trickled up stair street to the bubble at its top and in what tegger found mysterious was clear enough to machine people barok smiled and led them up the giant stairs and into the back banquet hall he pronounced city builders are omnivores who cook they like a lot of variety look at all this equipment tegger said its all boxes and surfaces that get hot yes and a table for chopping stuff above stair street was only the chimney and its spiral stair warvia was on the rim of the chimney kicking her heels in space looking down on the floating factory city and the lands beyond she seemed indecently happy i can see our river folk waving rooballabl hey any of you come up here and show them we made it theyll think im just tegger vala climbed the spiral stair to meet her past a bronze web clinging to the stone the women edged around the rim to leave room for those who followed coriack manak paroom barok tegger stopped to study the web then climbed to join them there is something about being at the top of well anything that puts one in command practically speaking vala could see nothing of what was most interesting vampires swarming in the shadow nest below and the regions nearby but far into the mountains sluggish pale streams flowed through the passes flowing along the homeflow they became individual dots vampires returning in their thousands the river and the snowcrested mountains glittered in patchy sunlight close in two squat black manshapes stood against the glitter vala and the others waved reassured rooballabl and fudghabladl sank beneath the water but she could see all of the factory complex tegger had left lights burning everywhere a broken line of green ran down stair street green showed nowhere else none near the chimney what would a webspinner eat the flat tops of warehouses and factories the curved tops of tanks were all a glittery gray the only exceptions were the houses along stair street where the flat places were soil and pools and the stairs were glittery gray paroom asked valavirgillin see those gray roofs well i wondered why the lights still work everything thats flaton to the sun is that same glittery gray that stuff must be storing sunlight tegger said yes paroom smiled bothered you yes but its obvious once you lets see they cant have been getting much light through these clouds but none of the power was used before i got here hundreds of falans that means could run out wed better turn the lights off in the daytime the hauler plate was that color before i tore the cab loose thats why it could still lift so lightning is sunlight turn them off paroom what are we saving power for i dont know the grass giant said but i dont like waste leave the lights on around the dock though where the vampires come up thats my thought tegger shrugged suddenly he looked exhausted warvia led him away murmuring in his ear the rest of the party werent finding anything noteworthy presently like tourists on holiday they trickled back to the cruisers most of them were ready to fall over gleaners had to sleep at night all four looked alert enough now at midday the only members of the foray team who did vala set manack and coriack on guard then she crawled under an awning forn was there fast asleep not just from exhaustion poor girl but loss of blood too she looked peaceful though vala dipped a towel in fuel and washed the angrylooking wounds on forns neck then she spread a blanket and lay down when beedj came in she only closed her eyes against the light beedj spread a double armful of freshcut grass in what space was left and curled himself into it he murmured clever what red tegger did yub said vala maybe we can go further with that mm boss we can collect more water bash holes in the roofs of all those factories storage tanks whatever anything that isnt a roof seal it so water doesnt run out spread cloth for funnels let it rain a sea of water this factorything would sink even farther wouldnt it crush the vampires could he be right vala was too tired to think no who speaks foranayeedli it isnt flat under here beedj theres a structure as big as administration in center city oh flup thats right you were living down there what kind of thing is it forn like a statue or like a building something we could crush forn began to answer vala crept out into daylight pulling her blanket along and into the darkness of the payload shell she spread her blanket and a voice said valavirgillin this is a good time to look into the shadow nest harpster i dont smell you we explored before we slept theres a row of houses you saw and pools delightful and grass to roll ourselves dry appreciate it harpster this is a good time to sleep night people sleep too boss in daylight id rather sleep one sharp claw pricked her side for emphasis so do vampires theyll be torpid we can just push them off the ramp what im really after is the light conditions shall i take some gleaners and go down vala tried to think i put two on guard take silack and perilack take kaywerbrimmis because hed had some sleep and theyd want a variety of viewpoints ask beedj the thurls heir would volunteer for anything flup vala sat up and reached for a gun and alcohol flamer and me they were eight two machine people beedj two gleaners warvia and the ghouls the ghouls moved ahead of the circle of torchlight cast by valas throttledback flamer the rest followed masked and half blind vala was looking at four vampire dead she should have been watching where she stepped she stumbled on a handful of vampire teeth pointed like a reds teeth sure enough the one woman was toothless just as paroom had described her and not just hacked vala shuddered grieving tube bounded out of sight vala drew breath to shout and harpster was gone too vala ran instead flamer held high and found the ghouls standing over a male vampire still twitching they moved on rich and corrupt scents were working their way through the pepperleek she breathed but her sight was coming back the party halted three loops down two and a half loops above the vampireinfested floor a broken circle of daylight lit the shadow nest bright enough to hurt there was dark soil on either side of the homeflow patches each the size of a lords farm that was off to portandantispin where the river entered the shadow huge mushrooms grew in those plots and vampires lived under them shadow farms a hundred varieties of fungus might have grown here before the vampires moved in the monster mushrooms must have been too big to trample directly below was paving similar to the stuff the machine people used for roads you see theres quite a lot of light grieving tube said cheerfully i wanted to wait for a wind harpster complained a wind yes vala felt madness bubbling in her blood the rich smell of pepperleek had become no more than a spice for the rutting scent wind would have blown that away there must be tens of thousands of them down there she thought and they were starting to look up warvia was breathing through her mouth in great gasps warvia knew her will could be broken kay was edging away from vala no distractions needed now the others looked all right try to concentrate that center structure the fountain was many things there were windows in the side that faced the ramp and small balconies without railings and outside stairways probably offices rather than domiciles partway around a flat space faced rising concentric arcs something like the steps in the feeding dome seats that had to be a stage piles of rotting stuff at the corners might have been a curtain collapsing flat structures must be props a flimsy wall fallen showed a honeycomb of backstage structure valavirgillin wondered if others would recognize it for what it was water poured from above a waterfall surrounded by shadowy giants and wound through and around every part of the structure standing statues of city builder folk poured water from great bowls water flowed down the back of the stage a permanent backdrop thus watered vividly hued mushrooms still grew behind the office structures it all flowed down through a maze of pipes and channels to meet the homeflow forn was right that mountain of masonry was as big as a civic center it wouldnt support the mass of a floating factory maybe but it would stand against any mass of water this group could collect all right all right we cant lower the factory on them perilack said what if we move it sideways somethings holding it here what if we could set it loose let it slide away with the vampires all running after it wouldnt they make great targets grieving tube said shes at least partly right something holds it here some she went off into her own language and so did harpster vala turned back even the ghouls might not be able to set a floating city adrift harpster dropped back into the tongue like at the bottom of a bowl a low spot in the realm of magnetic power we could tow the floater out of it if we had enough power but with two steam cruisers flup i wish you people had never heard of louis wu statuary lines of windows a stage a sculpted flow of water whats missing vala asked herself grieving tube heard boss vala said tell me what you see the ghoul woman obliged offices public affairs i bet they put it all down here so they wouldnt have to invite political entities topside the stage is for speeches and conferences but its a stage too this was a social center harpster said id like to see around the other side what do you think youd find vala asked i think a podium this ones for plays its not really right for speeches or music for that matter i bet somebody got an award for the way he worked the fountain into it all think how beautiful it would be if we could clear the vampires out got it vala shouted lights the ghouls eyes glowed at her lights plays music speeches bureaus of this and that awardwinning sculpture vampire song rose high at the sound of valavirgillins shout but her warriors were listening too nobody but a ghoul would expect all that to be played in the dark warvia tegger must know where the lights are warvia was fully awake now hed have turned them on flup boss the switches might be down here flup thatd be nasty harpster said i see it he was pointing up warvia that group of statues right at the top city builder warriors three manheights tall theyre all carrying spears vala could see vague hominid shapes up there but nothing more the ring of daylight didnt reach that high its just one great black spot to me warvia said theyre there grieving tube said that top one bigger than the rest spear as thick as my leg and it doesnt have a point it just goes right up into the roof its a pipe for the power sorry boss flup not water pipes of course not theyve got infinite water all right but well search topside first because its easier get tegger to show us what he found then look where he didnt warvia refused to let them wake tegger boss he showed you everything he knows harpster and grieving tube dropped out early nobody could expect ghouls to guess where an alien hominid would put light switches the rest of the warriors spread through the city valavirgillin cut a sheet of louiss cloth once a priceless secret into strips and gave them away like confetti they played with the boxes and switches tegger had showed them and presently had the city blazing to rival the cloudy daylight thin strips of glittery gray ran from the glitterygray rooftop patches down the sides of buildings several of the party followed those lines to where they converged when twuk brought valavirgillin to see she found a hole near the citys center that was as wide as a ghouls leg she stirred traces of dust she found inside and sniffed her finger she couldnt be sure that it was ruined superconductor but vala didnt doubt what theyd found she hated what had to come next but there was no help for it the channel could be two tens of manheights high vala cut all of her remaining sheets of louis wus cloth into strips knotted them together tied the resulting rope to a chunk of wall and lowered it into the hole until it went slack what was it touching down there at the bottom of a statues spear haft it might be an unbroken line of power shed done what she could now she used torn branches to move the top end of her toe to where all the channels of silvergray joined that patch was flat there was nothing to tie her line to but she could weight it with a block of rubble only three grass giants could lift the clouds darkened and presently sent forth a steady rain the explorers bore what they could of that then came trickling back to the dock area each looked into ramp street the grass giants were the last to give up the others told them what theyd found but the grass giants had to look too the shadow nest remained in shadow chapter sixteen web of spies a shadow crossed the light falling on his closed eyelids tegger was just close enough to waking to enjoy the warmth the relaxation the sense of warvias back against his chest and belly the smell of her hair if he let himself wake further hed be thinking of hunger hunger how was he to feed warvia the carrion birds had fled from noise and alcohol fumes and heroes there were vampires he shied from a sick memory but what was here for carnivore reds drive the vampires away descend hunt in daylight all shadows were vertical night must have fallen and these must be dockyard lights who would be moving past at night tegger opened his eyes two furry backs moved in and out of the light moved away down rim street tegger slid away from warvia he found a blanket and covered her harpster and grieving tube were turning into stair street tegger followed stalking ghouls were a secretive bunch they had the right to their secrets but reds were stalkers the night people moved in a glare of artificial light the rest of valas crew had found switches tegger missed night was their element but tonight it was the ghouls who were half blind would it bother them ghouls must depend a good deal on scent the houses along stair street were staggered there was plenty of cover tegger hid behind solid masses trees and walls staying well back where were the ghouls coming out of a shattered window softly complaining in their own speech tegger had found a whole family of skeletons in that house were the ghouls sniffing out carrion theyd find nothing but bones at the top of stair street they moved into the bubbleshaped banquet hall nothing for them there either tegger remembered he waited in an empty pool his eyes just above the rim they came out and continued up into shadow the citys apex the chimney was still dark would they climb it to view their domain but as tegger eeled up crooked stair street he did not see shadows rising against the sky he grew more cautious still the sound he heard then was loud metal was being tormented he climbed a ladder and peered over the top of a chemical storage tank his shadow lost in a maze of pipes the ghouls were at the base of the chimney it was still too dark to see what they were doing he heard brick being cut in rhythmic fashion cut by a saw he dropped from the ladder and began weaving closer it wasnt food they were seeking what then he edged from behind a radiator wall and grieving tube took him by the wrist he most carefully didnt reach for his sword he whispered its tegger grieving tube called its tegger she grinned into his face and said you slept through some of this valavirgillin is sure there must be lamps focused on the structure below us only need to be turned on we think so too but switches are down there what in the fountain fountain stage midstage command offices speaking platform they would want to command the light themselves valavirgillin has restored the cable that carries the sunpower theyd want some way of getting down there too harpster said he had come up quite silently ghouls could teach red herders how to stalk prey i thought we might find a stairway something for people for visitors the ramp isnt it the ramp is for vehicles people would feel menaced grieving tube said so we looked for a stairway along the chimney because we already know it goes pretty far down but grieving tube has a better idea tegger said that chimney goes down to a furnace it goes to furnaces all over the city channels off to all sides down inside we looked harpster grinned with great square teeth coming or would you prefer to stalk us tegger said theres not much entertainment up here and not much distraction to a hungry red harpster said you solved that one you ate come then grieving tube said hastily we will divert you she walked downstep toward the dining place away from the chimney her hand was on teggers wrist her grip unbreakably strong i know what i ate tegger said yes but who would you tell your mate yes grieving tube stopped in the door truly of course i must tell warvia harpster said four vampires on the ramp you killed three the remaining woman you knocked out all her teeth and rished with her then hacked off a segment of muscle meat it seems clear you must have eaten it tegger said i could see the cruisers below me running into shadow i had to get into the ramp to give the drivers light the smell maddened me and my hunger maddened me and i did mad things but i still dropped the torches and the fuel in the end it was harpster who turned away a table or two fell over as they climbed the giant steps the ghouls werent dexterous here after the boss said that about lights grieving tube said i got to thinking what else theyd want down there i thought food harpster pushed through and waited for the others to follow him the big room was stifling hot dont touch anything tegger said i should have turned those off if you can remember which ones arent lights grieving tube said tegger nodded he began plucking valacloth twists from between pairs of knobs snatching them free in a jolt and sparkle of sunpower people working down below us in offices harpster said people sitting in arcs around a stage people just watching water fall would they get hungry omnivores get hungry a lot maybe not just omnivores other hominids too said grieving tube diplomatic relations it may be it seems the long way around tegger said catch food down there on the surface raise it grow it ship it in from farms what then char it cut it up mix it with flavorings fine but why carry it up here just to send it back down grieving tube sighed the reds got a point yes and we didnt find anything but the lighting is fluppy awful in here harpster said see what you can see tegger he opened another door it was the storage chamber tegger had explored earlier lights glowed in the ceiling tegger had found doors and drawers at every level doors an armlength high and smaller but he hadnt left them open like this valas whole caravan must have been through here storage areas behind the doors and not much in the storage areas dried plants various kinds some covered with fungus harpster said gleaners and grass giants found some dried roots here not much else but these lights are blinding and if we turn them off its like being buried harpster cant you see in the dark night people can see at night by archlight even in a rainstorm its not black none of these cupboard doors was even big enough for a gleaner did you find any more doors nothing mansized a cheery voice called what about hanging people tegger jumped that was warvia she was looking down at him from above a wall of boxes warvia where have you been he cried she laughed flattered behind you as you left the dock when your prey stopped i bathed in a pool so i could get closer still harpster said prudent our sense of smell is better than you might guess so shall we invite you into our puzzle she jumped down on her back was one of valavirgillins alcohol flamers i heard most of it and solved some of it come and look we follow warvia led them back into the heat you know she said the raw foodstuffs probably come up from the docks up the alleys whatever they do to it here theres probably some chemistry involved things none of us would do to food but its food going down that has to be in small clumps grieving tube asked truly why warvia moved among the tables and hot surfaces and doors youre watching a play or youre playing dominance games for high stakes water and grazing rights or your thurl is speaking your tribes future down comes your dinner but its half a weebler its burnt black on the outside and seared dry on the inside just the way you like it and theres enough to feed twenty people but theres twentysix of you what now shes worked this out after she had the answer tegger thought she was enjoying herself greatly you fight for your share or you try to cut it evenly but maybe six of you are all trying too you forget the play or the shouting match or the speech the actors grow enraged or the thurl but if individual portions come down nobody needs to fight warvia said here was a little door set into a wall a thick door with a window in it showing two shelves in a box warvia opened the door and put her hand in tegger shouted hot i touched the door first love she pushed against the back of the box and the box wiggled watch this she closed the door and flipped a switch down the box dropped away leaving an empty space behind the door wont open now she said and showed them harpster asked how far down does it go it should go to where foods wanted what you were saying i never could see why people had to go down with the food so i touched every door and opened doors that werent hot and this was what was loose then i had to find someplace to put a strip of valacloth harpster flipped the switch to its middle position then up that box wouldnt hold a man itll hold me if we take the shelves out it would hold tegger as easily tegger didnt bother offering warvias puzzle warvias choice red herders are territorial the shelves came up and out easily maybe the old city builders did sometimes send down a whole burnt weebler or whatever warvia tried to crawl into the resulting space and couldnt the night people lifted her bodily into place on her side her legs and arms sprawled past the door on her back on her face but her legs wouldnt fold that far tegger thought of tearing the top off the box to see if there was room above it what he finally said was even major surgery wont get you in there with weapons too id go naked you dont fit grieving tube said this is a box for a gleaner try all you like warvia we are not hurried harpster my love our part here is over gleaners dont wake until full day the night people chatted as they walked back to the docks harpster said we should send something down ahead of our emissary a bottle of fuel balanced to spill over in case there are vampires between him and the fuse box a quick fireball poomf tegger didnt feel like talking and warvia spoke not at all they crawled under their awning and watched grieving tube and harpster slink away then warvia took teggers hand and slid out the other side of the awning they ran softly to where the docks narrowed to become rim street we explored while you slept warvia whispered follow me tegger said i have to tell you about something on the ramp i heard you went mad i went mad were still mates but love i do not see how we can go home tegger sighed relieved that such a nightmare could be solved so easily where then i have half a notion come they ran a zigzag path through a system of alleys climbed through and along pipes to reach a higher level working their way up warvia led the way over the banquet hall and down and farther up and behind the chimney and around on their bellies now toward a sound of metal being tortured the noise stopped warvia gestured him back she stood and stepped forth very good now how will you get it down harpster and grieving tube finished lowering the great ceramic slab onto its back they had cut it no more than a thumblength thick it must be quite fragile warvia assumed the front of it was a bronze web of intricate geometric form harpster said we do love our secrets still this slab isnt going down unless in a cruiser well have to tell the boss so how much do you know i saw you cutting it looked it over after you led tegger away what is it why do you want it harpster said we think its an eye and an ear and maybe other senses too we think it belongs to louis wu and his offarch companions we think they were the ones who recentered the sun grieving tube said that would make them immensely powerful we could tell them how to use that power if we could communicate with them but louis wu popped into some kind of flying tube later our sources saw that tube or another such hovering near the shadow nest night people elsewhere report more such webs it must be for spying warvia asked youll try to talk to it well try that if nothing answers then well take it to where it can see what we want seen tegger and i cant go home warvia said carefully if we had night people to speak for us as heroes we might find entry into another tribe of red herders with that in mind where do you intend to travel harpster began to bark laughter grieving tube snapped at him fool they need not come all the way warvia we no tell me this instead how much shock can you stand warvia beckoned tegger came into view no point in hiding now he was laughing too hard he said if you think you can still shock us go ahead and try harpster began to talk chapter seventeen the war against the dark tremendous tilted faces looked out of the rock two red herders and two even larger night people spoke secrets none could hear for an audience louis wu was the only one laughing louis tore his gaze free of the hindmosts show for the locals it must seem that they were watching gods decide their fate the sailing people had run he saw no trace of tunesmith or kazarp weavers were all about him but most of them were asleep torpid weaver children were trying to keep their eyes open tomorrow theyd know they had dreamed louis wu was alone before these tremendous faces he said in interspeak for the hindmosts benefit those ghouls came a long way to steal a webeye they really must want to talk to you the view changed for the blink of an eye it became an infrared map of the village pool black water faintly glowing weavers asleep on low tables the brighter glow of louis wus naked skin and a lacework glow behind him and another alongside the council house kazarp and tunesmith hidden in tall grass the ghouls are watching too will they recognize themselves huge faces dimmed the webeye and its brick backing were being set down in darkness now the cliff was only dark rock the sun was no more than a sliver of light palely glowing through cloud when valavirgillin rolled out to see what the commotion was about it was about reds and ghouls guiding four grass giants who were carrying a slab of cut brick down stair street a slab of brick with a bronze web splayed across it heavy from the way they moved they eased it up to cruiser two and set one edge on the running board and rested the ghouls began to talk the reds wanted to interrupt but got little chance when all conversation was done the web and its backing rested on the floor of the payload shell in cruiser two sleepy gleaners had come out to join the excitement sleepy ghouls were crawling under an awning and the way down seemed almost clear somewhere behind black clouds valavirgillin thought shadow must be sliding away to reveal the sun the only light that reached through the storm was a frenzied dance of lightning four gleaners and valavirgillin marched through the rain to the top of stair street they entered the bubble followed by every hominid save the ghouls and climbed the giant steps into that amazing kitchen silack fitted himself into the moving box only the other gleaners knew how he had been chosen over the rest the flamer fitted easily into his arms fire it at a wall or a vampire or anything manack told him he was jittery and he held a machine people handgun it took both hands im coming right down after you with nothing but this and when i get down i want light i want to see what comes at us your first move when the door opens give me light they closed the door on silack and flipped the switch down there was light enough to watch the line vibrating noise enough too the motor noise stopped they waited manack tried to move the switch it didnt respond to easy pressure vala restrained him from using more force the switch clicked up by itself and the line began to vibrate they waited while the box rose into view silack rolled out and sucked air for a great shout light he bellowed perilack threw herself at him and hugged him tight he talked over her shoulder manack im sorry but the panel was right there and i thought i might want to leave fast when i turned the switches on and flup was i right i turned on all the lights at once and the perilack cried theyre on yes said silack and his audience ran away valavirgillin was gasping and staggering as she reached ramp street the gleaners and reds were far ahead of her and the other machine people the grass giants were pounding along behind them ramp streets lights burned through the rain they swarmed down the ramp there was light below too and a traffic jam out of nightmare light blazed pitilessly on the great central structure on sage and windows and running water and all the space around it the shadow nest was brighter than the murky daylight vampires caught in the light were trying to get out vampires returning from their hunt were trying to get in silack was shouting as soon as the lights came on the vampires ran every way there was two or three tens of them decided the offices were a cave theres a big space in there that overlooks the stage on one side and the speaking platform on the other harpster was right about that and connects to the offices too vampires were coming at me from three directions manack i propped the door open to the moving box ten i got out time i got down i knew i didnt want it leaving without me you greedy flupsculptor you i know manack you took all the glory i was very very glad i still had the box they came in i flamed them i went up murderous fights were developing between vampires who wanted in and those who wanted out three turns above grass giants were starting to cheer them on in a moment theyd be taking bets valavirgillin announced listen up im thinking this is the best time to get out most of the vampires are still out hunting and most of what weve got are blind and confused if we wait as much as a tenthday the hunters will be home and well have to wait for night im hungrier than that so we go now if im crazy point it out they looked at her in a silence broken only by shrieking of ten thousand vampires now she bellowed and her people began to run louis could see three sailing people peering over the council house roof they showed courage but they werent seeing any more than louis was the window in the cliff had become no more than dark rock the hindmosts spy device lay in darkness in the payload shell of a sixwheeled wagon the hindmost said in interspeak i still can hear them louis and smell them the dark cliff became a dark window a piersons puppeteer danced and uncountable others wove a pattern behind him a dark forest of oneeyed snakes louis was amused dancing in the dark the hindmost twirled a test of agility darkness was common enough long long ago not impossible that the dark might come to any of us so they tested each other for mating privileges like the fertility board on earth the hindmost was honing his skills but hed said you can hear whom i can hear valavirgillins company with the door in the payload bay closed i can still resolve voices they are organizing to defend the wagons now the wagons are in motion with vampires all about would you hear in a minute i wonder what our ghoulish observers make of your dancing the small one shifts position constantly the larger remains still would you capture him no touch your translator to the core of the webeye i will transmit louis waded through shallow water to the cliff it remained a fuzzyedged doorway to piersons puppeteers dancing in dusk a black dot like a lumpy heart floated unsupported at nose level and louis pushed his translator against that he heard voices human shading into animal bass to tenor and higher agony and rage and urgency once a cry of surprise and pain more yelling then a solid thud as a body fell on the webeye itself once he made out valavirgillins voice bellowing orders as she never had in his presence otherwise it was all a confusion of screaming the vampire shrieking dwindled over several minutes then jarring as hell came a cool musically persuasive voice that sounded not quite like speech that stopped suddenly followed by eerie quiet vala turned them downstream because the upstream direction seethed with vampires returning from the hunt she kept them moving for a tenthday after they were clear slick black heads popped into view on the river the river people were keeping pace cruiser one was still rolling when beedj swung the payload bay doors open and rolled inside vala waited something heavy rolled out paroom theyd been all over him tearing him to ribbons while friends hacked at them from above and below a vampire had slashed perilack too vala waited beedj climbed up beside her dead he said perilack doesnt look bad i washed the scratches with fuel does that really do anything vala nodded wondering if grieving tube and harpster would be offended would understand why parooms body was better left for strangers than for his night people friends she said none of that to the thurls heir it was all his own decision a meadow stretched away from the river it looked like good hunting valavirgillin kept them in a clump all the several species and made them wear towel masks there were vampires about vala had taken stacks of cloth from the dock warehouses she gave rooballabl and fudghabladl a long sheet of gauzy stuff for netting fish they were hugely successful and now there was fish for any who could eat it the grass giants had found some acceptable river grass there was prey about reds and gleaners didnt need to wait for fire the machine people had a firepot starting to boil and roots and meat in it her crew was being fed valavirgillin looked her people over while she waited tegger looked much better with food in him forn and barok were cooking dinner together if they shied from body contact it was hard to tell grieving tube and harpster were kneeling twenty manlengths away and a good thing because they were eating the ghouls had found a hominid of the farming folk perhaps a vampires captive fallen on the trek to the shadow nest theyd stopped short of actually dragging the carrion into camp vampires still dotted the passes the excitement around the shadow nest drew them eventually vala knew she would have to get past that gradually perhaps only from hunger valas mood darkened an antic whim set her walking toward the ghouls grieving tube saw her coming she came over to stand not too close you havent eaten yet she said soon your mood will improve weve escaped valavirgillin were free with a tale to tell that no hominid can match grieving tube what have we accomplished here i dont grasp your point we came we found our way up we used up most of louis wus magic cloth we found our way down we killed some vampires and drove the rest out into the rain weve lost one cruiser and paroom and what else can i brag about we rescued foranayeedli you loaded ten manweights of wonderfully preserved ancient cloth into your cruiser vala shrugged indeed shed reap a profit from what shed collected from the docks and not just the cloth and forn yes the ghoul woman dropped a stripped rib and walked closer boss weve ended the vampire infestation oh grieving tube we drove them out now theyll spread to every land around us the vampire infestation is going to get worse theyll be far fewer in a generation the ghoul woman said placidly in forty to fifty falans brag now await vindication i dont see why valavirgillin youve felt the pull of the vampire musk no hominid can stand against it not even a red herder does it not strike you that they also secrete that scent to lure a mate what vampires secrete their musk when prey is about when food is to be had that is a time to breed when theyve found a cave for refuge that too is a time to breed and a cave concentrates the musk it was their mating scent when their ancestors were like ours and it is their mating scent now but weve taken away their refuge and driven them into the rain the same rain that hasnt stopped since louis wu boiled a sea boss the rain is washing off their mating scent valavirgillin thought it over until she believed it then she stood up and whooped theyll stop breeding day was near its end before night the cruisers must be where vampires couldnt reach them come morning she would siphon the fuel from cruiser two to move cruiser one home she said and you youve got the bronze web somewhere beneath the arch louis wu can look and hear through that pattern there is something we must show the wizard if the wizard still lives and cares to look if the web is still a window youll have to find your fuel somewhere else she told grieving tube the woman nodded placidly well make our needs known night people will set fuel dumps all the way to the rim wall i suppose tegger and warvia told you theyll travel with us not a bad notion there are reds everywhere theyll find a home yes how do you propose to buy a trading cruiser she blinked ah the legendary greed of the machine people valavirgillin we need cruiser two to end a threat that endangers all who live beneath the arch you know enough to take my words seriously seriously yes but moving your massive spying thing formed no part of our agreements valavirgillin smiled remembering the negotiations outside the thurls wall the effort with which shed persuaded the night people to join her assault on the shadow nest she couldnt have driven them away with a cannon you went to some effort to get louis wus spy thing you thought to keep that secret from me i expect but how a ghouls shrug looked like shed disjointed both shoulders how were we to know we couldnt just peel the web off and roll it up and walk off but its embedded in the brick and so we must reveal our need valavirgillin we will buy your cruiser she named a sum payable in center city by any local night people concern when you return sold the money was at the low end of reasonable and so what long before she could return to get it grieving tube would have fuel to simply take cruiser two i may have to explain this to my superiors will your people back me up your associates may learn as much as i will reveal to you tonight some secrets we keep but let us gorge first boss isnt your meal prepared yet foranayeedli bellowed two words in valas center city tongue boss eat hunger sank sharp teeth into valavirgillins belly thats my secret name she told grieving tube and she went chapter eighteen costs and schedules weaver town ad even the sailing people had retired now only a pair of heat shadows in grass and louis wu remained to watch the hindmosts dance the pace was brisk now but the hindmost never seemed to run short of breath this isnt over louis i heard some of what they told the red herders they spoke of spill mountains and problems with a scrith surface use the webeye ask them where theyre going no i will reserve that one secret let them struggle for a time before i speak let me see how urgently they want your attention mine louis wu who boiled an ocean o subtlest one they know nothing of the hindmost louis youre showing marked signs of deterioration do you want medical attention yes louis wu said the hindmost said very well my risk and effort involved in sending you my refueling probe must be compensated youve had a free hand louis waved it off dont risk your probe you might need it ill go back the way i came back down the shenthy river valley there are mistakes i dont need to make twice so itll go a little faster i was eleven years coming id be nine years returning maybe less itll give you time to move your doc to crew quarters louis i have mounted a stepping disk on my refueling probe in one turn of the ringworld it can reach you in an instant youll be aboard that probe is your fuel source hindmost and i i have refueled hot needle of inquiry which in any case is still embedded in cooled lava and i dare not think what price you would ask for its use anyway youll want to move your doc into crew quarters or the lander bay i have done that the window shifted and louis was looking into the cabin that he hadnt seen in eleven years a huge coffin occupied what had been his and chmeees exercise space well futz the hindmost was eager louis said i left hidden patriarch a few thousand miles downstream didnt you leave a stepping disk aboard i can be there in seven or eight falans two years louis matters are becoming urgent the ringworld seems infested with protectors oh all innocence was louis wu with a smile beginning deep inside yes it all came down to protectors before she died teela said she had left one living ghoul protector in charge on the rim wall i can verify that the repair crew is still active show me louis said the window in the cliff panned along a wall a thousand miles high the rim wall was a frieze mountain shapes reliefcarved into a continuous wall the color of earths moon bands of night swept along its length their motion barely visible spill mountains stood as tiny cones five to seven miles tall along its base along the top of this stretch of the rim wall twenty faint violet flames pointed toward the stars the hindmost said these are the rim ramjets as they were when we first saw them i was testing a webeye camera the same that the ghouls now hold here five years later six years ago the same view night again but the ghost flames had gone out the ringworld was back in place by then louis said oh yes but i kept track louis cant you see the attitude jets the view zoomed now louis could make out the dark mouths of spillpipes high above the spill mountains and ghostly shapes much larger than hed guessed pairs of coppercolored toroids circled the tiny wasp waists of twentyone double cones of fine wire huge skeletal bussard ramjets six years ago six before i noticed caught up in the dance i might have lost track for as much as hesitation a falan lonely to the point of madness lost in a dance with ghosts the poor herdbeast once allpowerful now all alone rejected by his kind louis shook it off so someone mounted the twentyfirst motor the one we found on the spaceport ledge yes but copied it first here less than two years ago twentythree motors and a twentyfourth with skewed orientation not yet mounted louis couldnt see what was moving it he only saw minute adjustments in position my webeye has no more definition than this but new motors are being manufactured and set in their cradles on the rim wall is this not evidence for a protector more than one louis said manufacture transport placement supervision hesitation again louis some hominids go in herds or tribes but my records suggest that protectors do not i believe i could monitor all these activities so could a protector mmm and defense but a second protector is using the meteor defense to destroy invading ships stet and what of the unseen creature following the red herder no i wont give you that one a ghoul spying on other ghouls local politics louis think we saw him enter the vampire sanctuary he must be a protector if the vampire scent doesnt affect him stet what was he doing in there do you think protecting the red herder it seemed he may be of that species our next sight of him would have been the river i expect yeah selfeffacing he was and you cant do that when youre covered with vampire scent but we wont see him because your camera is lying in the cargo hold of a three protectors louis six to eight if your guess is right war among pak protectors made a radioactive waste of their own world i see your point louis said placidly protectors of divergent species would leave fragments of the ringworld falling to interstellar space louis we cannot have two years i could escape into stasis for the remaining lifespan of the universe you cant even reach hot needle of inquiry maybe theyll cooperate louis said ringworld hominids do get along different species dont use the same resources and they all cooperate with ghouls once youre in that mode you can get along with anyone there was war between red herders and grass giants futz hindmost they both wanted the grass i feel the situation is urgent louis stretched his joints creaked and tendons were protesting even this afternoons moderate exercise tell you what he said send your refueling probe to where i left hidden patriarch itll make a nice big target for you ill move back downstream and see if our city builder friends want to join us again eight falans two earth years one of yours then if we can come to an agreement ill accept your medical attentions the hindmost said agreement ill work out a contract you are in a poor position to bargain let me know if you change your mind louis said he got up and waded back through the river waiting for the musical scream behind him it didnt come louis came awake slowly groggy from lack of sleep sawur felt good moving against him he asked do weavers rish at sunglare by preference we do stet louis got his arms working and began running his hands through her fur nice thank you she stretched along his length her fingers caressed his scalp grooming what hair she could find they moved easily into rishathra it was a wonderful lifestyle in its way presently sawur pulled back to look at him tired or not you seem very relaxed i think ive got him night i have formulated a contract the hindmost said so have i louis wu said he held up his translator its in memory mostly in notes i cant read that well have to work from here the cliff abruptly glowed with lines of print black on white and a virtual keyboard taller than louis himself their audience murmured appreciatively most of the villagers were seated around louis louis wondered what they thought they were seeing hed been making notes toward his own contract all afternoon to work from the hindmosts instead of his own would violate a basic principle of negotiation louis didnt intend that but another principle said that a negotiator should never admit to being under a deadline louis asked in interspeak how do i work it point the hindmost said left for cursor right to type louis tried it waving his arms like an ambidextrous orchestra conductor louis deleted that and wrote the section on looked reasonable he was to be charged for work comparable to treatment in hospitals at sol system paid off in service not to exceed twelve years hold it boosterspice and standard tech by no means what then puppeteer experiments ive tried to describe what i have available a modified arm xprogram you cant compute the cost of this thing against fees payable at a sol hospital your system would give me another thirty years of life roughly speaking wouldnt it ill give you seven years of service following my emergence from the doc twelve louis this system will rewrite you to the age of twenty youd get another fifty years with no further medical treatment at all the risks youll put me through ill be lucky to get fifty good days and you know it thats why i went on sabbatical in the first place seven stet louis pointed with his left forefinger the cursor now what is this flup what about consultation time travel time actions done without consulting you because theres no time subconscious problemsolving during sleep write it in your motives are questionable no honest entity would have tried that this is how negotiation works louis youre going to teach me how to negotiate stet louis erased the offending sentence then typed onefingered on the air he ignored the squawk of distress now i need a clause to protect me from being altered into a better servant i dont see anything in here that will do that text added itself louis watched for a bit then said no write then no can you think of any way to get yourself a copy of my contract no itll have to wait for me to reach hidden patriarch then ill start tomorrow wait louis i can easily find you here hindmost i think ill have to insist on your accepting my contract not yours if you cant read it how can you suggest changes you must read it to me aloud tomorrow now something else has been bothering me how long does it take you to shape a plume from the sun and then set off the superthermal laser effect two hours sometimes three conditions vary three ships came through fistofgod near here and someone blasted them one landed on the far side of the ringworld and something blasted it did that take longer what with all the fastforward action i just couldnt tell i will look louis woke late sawur and the children were gone nothing edible remained from last night louis worked near the empty firepit louis crossed out servitude a few talking points wouldnt hurt hed become ferociously hungry he knew where to find more roots louis rode the cargo stack straight up to seek out a path and saw children milling in the upland woods across the shenthy river sawur had found two big mushrooms of different species and the children had killed a landgoing crustacean as big as a rabbit they watched with interest as louis wrapped them in leaves and then wet clay he dug his flash out of the lockbox on his cargo stack with the flash on microwave wide aperture medium intensity he heated the mound of clay until it puffed steam then he carefully locked the flash away a dangerous thing to leave loose strill parald keep the rest away from the clay itll burn you sawur i want to make you a parting gift louis are we to part the web dweller sent his refueling probe to spray the cliff it must be nearby i expect he could have it here in a few hours he hopped off the plates let me show you this now im wondering if it should go to you or to the whole village the cargo plate controls were depressions on the rims and they took some strength to move protector strength louis jabbed with a slender piece of rod held in both hands the bottommost plate dropped from his stack and floated an inch above the grass sawur asked will you present it tonight give it to the village in charge of me and kidada i will be as surprised as any show him and me how to work it but none other and no visitors stet this is a magnificent gift louis sawur youve given me my life i think maybe do you still doubt give me a moment louis knocked the clay off one end of his mound the mushrooms looked and smelled done they tasted wonderful he broke open the rest of the mound and found the crawler done too most of the meat was in the spinnerets and the children shared those around the tail made one bite each for him and sawur thats better im not rational when im that hungry now look louis drew a ring in the dirt light takes thirtytwo minutes to cross the ringworld and come back he heard the translator converting times and distances really trust me eight minutes for a beam from the sun to touch the arch sixteen minutes across thirtytwo to cross and come back if three starships pop up through a hole here near the great ocean and two and a half hours later theyre destroyed and a ship lands here and is destroyed two hours later where is the attacker sawur studied the sketch then pointed here across the arch the first ships he needed half an hour just to see them but what if it is attacked three hours later sawur said that would put the attacker here where you drew the great ocean yeah when shadow touched the sun louis had written a contract that ought to protect him if a puppeteer would honor a contract he presented the cargo plate to weaver town while dinner was broiling they acclaimed him as a mighty magician a vashnesht then children wanted to ride the plate while parents were urging caution louis showed kidada the setting that would hold the disk two feet high low enough to be safe he watched kidada swooping among the houses with strill whooping in his arms and hoped that they wouldnt burn the thing out joyriding one day theyd need it to lift something heavy the light was disappearing hunters had killed a predator the meat tasted too much of cat weavers took slices and settled to watch the cliff as it came alight perched on his stack of cargo plates like a proper wizard louis nibbled cooked reeds and a root hed microwaved in clay puppeteers were dancing in a swirling rainbow louis watched with the others then asked in interspeak are the pyrotechnics supposed to throw you off they are for loveliness louis you must come to me how is it with the fearless vampire slayers i hear only voices the cruisers have separated cruiser two is gone to starboard with my webeye in the cargo shell the red herders speak of an entity the male calls whisper tegger thinks whisper has left them warvia thinks he dreamed i think whisper is our phantom protector louis will you come well have to reach terms i accept your contract you havent seen it i accept it provided you make no changes from this moment as youve had no extortionate advantage you will have written it fairly my probe will arrive within twelve minutes louis looked at the sky nothing was visible yet where will i pop out in your suite aboard needle suite it was one compartment locked that he had shared with a kzin contract pays me triple time during emergencies shall i arm myself yes sawur get the children out of the water hindmost land in the stream now i remember crawling through the disk you mounted for refueling it was pretty cramped i do learn louis ive mounted a fullsized stepping disk on the side of the probe big enough for you and your cargo plates too louis thought fortunately i always keep my feathers numbered for just such emergencies it wouldnt have meant anything to a puppeteer from his safe box he withdrew the flashlightlaser and a variableknife two powerful weapons he set the flash for narrow short range high intensity he extended the blade by two feet then brought it back to a foot and a half lose your hold on a variableknife the wire blade would cut whatever was close a violetwhite light peeked above the cliff the refueling probe settled on fusion flame the cavity in its nose that was the refueling system a filter to pass hydrogen ions and a oneway stepping disk no wider than louiss hips a much larger stepping disk had been mounted on its flank a circular plate like an afterthought of a wing weavers oohed and ahhed then shied back from a wave of steam the flame went out as louis glided above the probe it splashed down on its flared motor then rolled and toppled into the water the water dimpled above the stepping disk so it was on louis cut the lift and dropped straight in his peripheral vision caught a shadow leaping after him part two dancing as fast as i can chapter nineteen the knobby man hot needle of inquiry ad hot needle of inquiry had been built around a general products hull with interior walls to separate the puppeteer captain from his alien crew currently the ship was more dwelling than spacecraft needle couldnt exceed lightspeed because louis wu had cut the hyperdrive loose from its mountings eleven years ago for reasons that seemed good at the time the ship itself had been embedded in magma during negotiations with the protector who had once been teela brown during that period and after the hindmost had deployed stepping disks through the ship and the repair center and elsewhere too louis expected to appear in the blockedoff crew quarters the hindmost hadnt needed to suggest maybe hadnt dared to be overheard suggesting that louis come in fast the floating plates come down hard louis caught the recoil with bent knees but he was still knocked off balance he shouted somethings somethings following me hindmost but there was plenty going on here thousands of piersons puppeteers shifted and swirled and kicked stage left it might have been distracting but it wasnt louis and chmeee had learned to ignore that part of the ship that was the hindmosts and the wall wasnt glass it was the invulnerable stuff a general products hull was made of but one twoheaded threelegged alien his mane curled and bejeweled in formal fashion was between the kitchen wall and a coffin as big as a transfer booth lying on its side a knobby old man in a floppy vest was running at the hindmost knees and elbows pumping a hidden stepping disk led to the hindmosts quarters the hindmost must be near or on it louis thought he would be invulnerable there instinct must have been too strong the hindmost turned his back instead it all happened very fast louis was still catching his balance the hindmost was spinning around heads splayed wide apart looking back binocular vision with a baseline of three feet sighting on his target his hind leg folded forward and shot straight back as the knobby man attacked the hindmosts kick was good square on target louis heard a clank the knobby man must have been wearing a chest plate armor or no that kick would have knocked a normal hominid into a coma the knobby man turned with the impact feet off the floor one hand on the hindmosts ankle to borrow its momentum as the hindmost pulled back for another kick the knobby man stepped past the hoof and slammed a fist down hard on the puppeteers bejeweled mane where the two necks connected to the torso that was the hindmosts skull and louis was bringing the flash around too slow too clumsy the stunned puppeteer was in the way something whacked his right wrist and sent the flashlightlaser flying a metal ball another knocked the variableknife spinning louis flinched violently away from the spinning wire blade the hindmost was down curled into a ball heads and long necks tucked between his forelegs the floor was ankle deep in water the fallen flash was submerged but it sent a thread of light through needles transparent hull and into the lava beyond the wire blade hadnt cut louis in two blind luck but his hands and wrists felt shattered he was way off balance and the knobby man was coming at him protector louis rolled off the stepping disk and into a corner and started to stand up his right wrist was a sea of pain the left was only numb in the space where he had been something huge flicked in on all fours it stood erect as big as an orange bear holding a small cannon in one huge hand the knobby man spun and ducked and swept louiss variableknife past the big intruder the kzin the kzins weapon flew away with big clawed fingers still attached the kzin froze in a crouch throttling a howl the knobby man held the flash too in a clear threat you dont move it said web dweller you dont move either louis wu you dont move does your contract call for you to die the knobby mans lips had withdrawn from the gums the gums had hardened almost to bone and jawbone had grown through in a jagged pattern his face was hard almost a beak he spoke with a breathy speech impediment but in interspeak how would the knobby man have learned interspeak eavesdropping on the hindmost contract reality came in waves washing past pain eleven years since hed been in this much trouble louis said stalling yes under conditions subject to my own sole judgment do you accept my contract yes said the knobby man despite what had gone before that was astonishing the kzin male was bleeding freely from a hand sliced down to one thumb he was hugging that arm trying to squeeze arteries shut his eyes were on louis he said also in interspeak what shall i do raise your arm above your head keep squeezing the wrist squeeze the blood vessels dont try to fight thats a protector hindmost set th hindmost nap time is over for all of us the puppeteer uncurled speak louis the black coffin your autodoc you said you could set it to treat a kzin yes do that then you can tell me what happened im on triple time by the way because this has the authentic feel of an emergency the hindmost wasnt at his best he said heal an injured strange kzin do it now but louis im under contract this is for our benefit cant you see who this must be the puppeteer knelt before the doc and began mouthing the controls the protector still had the flash and variableknife louis couldnt think of anything to do about that or the sudden strange kzin or the constant flicker of dancing puppeteers in his peripheral vision one tanj thing at a time the kzin who are you acolyte son of chmeee louis guessed hed forgotten how huge a kzin male became when you stood next to him this one couldnt be more than eleven years old not quite fullgrown no true name not yet eldest son of chmeee i challenged we fought father won he told me learn wisdom stalk louis wu acolyte aww hindmost how long to set the doc for kzin metabolism minutes give the kzin a tourniquet louis moved to the wardrobe dispenser slowly hands visible to the protector his right hand and wrist were hugely swollen he held that arm raised above his head his left hand felt numb but it would work he thought the kitchen wall had menus for kzinti and human cuisine diet supplements allergy suppressants clothing and more louis hadnt seen pharmacy menus but he didnt doubt they were there the hindmost had found him as a wirehead he would not have shown him how to access recreational chemicals louis dialed and a selection of cravats resisting temptation he chose an orange and yellow pattern that would look good on a kzin not even his eyes moved toward the slaver digging tool hed taped under the dispenser port a lifetime ago the smell of the kzin was faint acolyte must have washed himself scentless to stalk him louis wu thought his orange fur bore three parallel ridges across the belly otherwise he wore halloween markings both ears tipped with bitter chocolate nearly black a broad chocolate stripe down the back a smaller chocolate comma down his tail and leg he was shorter than chmeee seven feet even but just as wide a hybrid his mother would be of the archaic kzinti from the map of kzin acolyte sat down bringing his arm in reach louis bound the thick wrist with his tie using his left hand and his teeth the blood slowed to a dribble the kzin rumbled who is my attacker tanj if i know but if i had to guess hello knobby man speak the hindmost and i we both guessed that a protector must be in the repair center youve been shooting down invading ships the timing made it obvious you were working from here the hindmost left stepping disks all over the place a protector might reprogram a disk to link with this one as soon as it was turned on yes then pop through just ahead of me finicky timing you needed me for a distraction and you counted on puppeteer reflexes thats interesting isnt it hindmost you had an instant to escape but you used it to kick that old argument very well i reflexively turned my back to fight you win louis grinned the pain wasnt so bad now but he was drunk on endorphins he said acolyte this is a protector look him over they all have that knobby look and theyre all brilliant and dangerous looked like just another hominid the kzin shook his great furry head how long did you watch me louis asked two days now i thought learn from you before i show myself wisdom father spoke of you he believes he learned what he has of wisdom from you and so can i but one of the scavengers saw me the boy yes you named him kazarp i talked to his father too the boy and i we talked his father was not far listening thinking he hides i spoke what i knew of you i dont know secrets worth hiding i did not speak of the hindmost how does he think we got to the ringworld then you mean arch i said you brought a ship i did not speak to kazarp of instant transportation didnt believe father when you linked the transfer booths stepping disks transfer booths are what we use in known space and the patriarchy theyre a lot less sophisticated stepping disks i jumped catch kazarp and his father by surprise leave them gaping surprise the kzin whispered and slumped his eyes closed hindmost ready bring him louis set his shoulder in acolytes armpit and lifted acolyte found the strength to stand wobbled to the surgery well and toppled in louis pulled his tourniquet loose and straightened the kzin a bit he found the kzins severed hand and the two useless halves of the heavy metal handgun hed carried he picked up the half hand the hindmost took it in his mouth close the lid he said and fed the hand into another aperture then he folded his legs and tucked his heads between his forelegs going into shock louis thought the knobby man said suicide one head came up i demonstrate helplessness this is surrender the hindmost said surrender good the kzin would likely be in there for days louis might have fainted for an instant agony snapped him awake the protectors knobby hands were moving the bones in louiss right wrist louiss other hand closed hard on the protectors arm he moaned and whimpered reality came in waves of pain not before the protector withdrew did louis think to look for the protectors weapons just as well the knobby mans vest bore an amazing variety of pockets and he saw the shape of the flash in one of those now what must he do before he fainted again contract he fished out his notepad and offered it to the puppeteer this is what youve agreed to you should read it aloud given that our companion has bound himself too the puppeteer took the pad his other head turned to the knobby man why did you do that i need allies who are not protectors protectors kill each other the knobby man said i can hold you to a formal promise made for mutual advantage read the hindmost read the knobby man or woman he was a bit shorter a bit more slender than teela brown had been after she turned protector the hairless leathery skin the swollen joints the triangular face and bulging skull all made it difficult to assign him a gender louis thought he could make out traces of male genitalia but he couldnt swear to that behind the impenetrable wall a million hologram puppeteers danced the hindmost must have thought hed be back among them before he missed a step if in his sole judgment the commission involves undue risk sole judgment louis smiled and shrugged undue damage clear violations of ethics sole judgment the protector asked hindmost will you bind yourself similarly the hindmost whistled indignantly you speak of enslavement how can you possibly compensate me what i offered louis wu was his life point taken i accept louis could hold back no longer he asked who are you i have not needed a name choose what you like whats your species vampire youre kidding no louis was about to faint hed found teela browns medkit welded to the top cargo plate long ago he had to stand up to reach it grinding his teeth against the pain he pushed his swollen right hand into the diagnosis well the pain went away a readout asked him questions yes he wanted to remain awake no he couldnt replenish supplies of various medicines an ominously long list his whole right arm seemed gone and nothing else really hurt his mind was lucid free to toy with the pieces of reality and try to put them back together he had bound himself to serve a protector hadnt he the protector had bound himself to louis to limitations on his power over louis wu and the puppeteer had bound himself and was himself bound to the protector by louiss contract he could hear what the others were saying but the words slipped through his ears and were gone require most urgently invaders beyond the arch arm and patriarchy ships louis said bet political entities would invade it was their nature he had described the ringworld for united nations records chmeee had spoken to the patriarch what other organizations would know of the ringworld fleet of worlds too so poorly designed so illprotected the puppeteer fluted those are not ours are these political entities dangerous the knobby man asked the puppeteer thought they were endlessly dangerous and said so louiss head was bubbling with chemicals he did not contribute are they likely to give up their plans no i can show you where their interstellar transports hide the hindmost said those wont participate in an invasion even your sunpowered superthermal laser wont reach the farthest targets the ships that land will be warships carrying no hyperdrive motors show me from my cabin louis laughed inside his head the unmarked stepping disk flicked only to the hindmosts cabin and it wouldnt pass aliens the hindmost would be behind an invulnerable wall what chance was there that the knobby man would permit that vampire protector louis made his mouth work what do you eat i make a vegetable mash i have not tasted blood in twentyeight falans the knobby man said my hunger is no risk to you good louis said and closed his eyes for a moment he heard hindmost you will only break your contract once show me all of the invader ships the hindmosts answer was a warbling whistling music with overtones in subsonic bass louiss eyes popped open to see the dancers disappear replaced by rotating threespace star maps the system looked nearly empty save for the ringworld and its shadow squares colorcoded lights blazed far from the ringworlds arc and scores of smaller sparks swarmed much nearer louis couldnt see motion on this scale but they seemed to be taking positions around the system as if just becoming aware of each other i must return to defend the arch the knobby man said you come the puppeteer shied but maps are only available here in hot needle of inquiry i have seen them now come louis was alone and the picture changed as they flicked out in the captains quarters was a threedimensional circuit diagram of some kind enough louis leaned his head against the stacked cargo plates and closed his eyes he dozed leaning against the stack of cargo plates with his arm in the medkit loss of balance snapped him awake from time to time behind the aft wall was the lander dock nearly empty since teela burned the lander louis couldnt quite remember what else was in there lockers for pressure suits and armor of course and a stack of stepping disks he had a vague impression that the hindmost had made changes eleven years worth of fiddling to ships port and ships starboard the walls were black needle was embedded in black basalt cooled magma a network of lines and dots floated beyond the forward wall like an ants nest seen by deepradar it teased at his mind dots there and there and there those two linked and those three here a network of ten way off in the distance one of the ten appeared to be two dots superimposed sketchy contours in the background might shape a map the hindmost must be trying to show him something when bladder pressure was stronger than his fear of pain louis pulled his hand free and wobbled to the toilet evidently he still had a medical problem afterward he drank a quart of water he ate a civilized caesar salad for the first time in eleven years lefthanded no more of eating whatever he could find that he would not mind giving up he examined his hand with meager satisfaction the swelling was down the bones seemed to be in place he left the machine twice more the pattern caught his eye again as he left the recycler stepping disks his subconscious must have been at work that map defined the stepping disks the hindmost had deployed several were scattered through the millions of cubic miles of repair center four in hot needle of inquiry itself one just outside the doublepoint must be the refueling probe in weaver town with one disk for transport and another for hydrogen the hindmost had left him this louis studied it fixing it in memory wondering at the puppeteers motives and it all popped back to dancing puppeteers as the knobby man flicked in the protector had something in his hand he blew into it watching louiss face music fluttered in the air a woodwind sound louiss reaction must have been unsatisfactory the protector put the thing away he examined louis as a primitive doctor would have probing here and there to see what hurt presently he said not much longer louis had had a notion he said my kitchen wall can be made to dispense blood will you drink first no i wont im not a vampire also the hindmost will have to rewrite the kitchen program no wait let me try something at the kitchen wall louis popped up a virtual keyboard for kzinti cuisine marked in dotsandcommas heros tongue louis knew a little of that he scanned through the extensive menu with the knobby man watching no not under that name try there under the planets kzinti name too many items try four times three were soups with as an ingredient and that left itself a bulb popped into the dispenser port filled with sluggish red fluid the knobby man took the bulb he took louiss jaw faster than he could flinch his grip was like iron you drink now he sad louis opened his mouth obedient the knobby man ejected a dollop of sticky red fluid into louiss mouth the taste was unfamiliar but louis recognized the smell he swallowed anyway the knobby man drank watching louis you surprise me why would you make blood for me for eleven years louis had been eating what he could catch or what unknown hominids would offer as food im not squeamish louis said yes you are in truth what he had smelled and tasted was making him nauseous he said i have kept to our contract which calls for me to act in your interest you are in violation i judge it wrong for me to drink human blood and i said so the knobby man said the medkit is through with you isnt it you put on your pressure suit come with me pressure suit where are we going the protector said nothing louis grinned he pointed through the transparent wall aft vacuum gear landing craft airlock anything chmeee and i might need to get out of this ship is in the lander bay i cant get there except by stepping disk the hindmost was holding us prisoner didnt you have a contract not then i learned how to use stepping disks come here the knobby man had lockpicking tools made of hardwood he knelt by the disk and lifted its edge louis couldnt see what he was doing the protectors fingers worked too fast he saw the stepping disk diagram appear in the hindmosts quarters and flicker then the protector set the disk in place pushed louis onto the stepping disk and followed with the lander destroyed the lander bay was mostly empty space there were suits for men and kzinti and puppeteers the transparent walls of the airlock opened into a tunnel that led through several cubic miles of magma undisturbed since the war with teela brown louis glanced at the weapons racks but did not approach them he pulled out a skintight pressure suit already zipped open along the torso sleeves and legs he wouldnt need the cummerbund he started to crawl into it and stopped with a gasp of pain before he could ask for help the protector was there easing his halfhealed hand and arm into the sleeve and glove then fashioning a sling from the tie that had been acolytes tourniquet he zipped up louiss suit screwed a helmet onto the neck ring and set an air rack on his back they waited for the suit to contract to louiss own shape the knobby man worked the controls of the big stepping disk the cargo disk louis began his checklist helmet camera airflow air recycler co and water vapor content the knobby man pulled him through chapter twenty brams tale repair center meteor defense ad the map of mars stood forty miles high above the great ocean a north polar projection at onetoone scale from the ringworlds underside there was no sign of the map of mars because the entire fortymilehigh pillbox was hollow louis had seen vast spaces inside the repair center but he had never been inside this one it was huge and dark skeletal chairs equipped with lap keyboards rode on long booms the ellipsoidal wall was a display screen thirty feet high the only light came from the screen a wraparound view of the local sky there were no planets or asteroids in ringworld system the ringworld engineers must have cleared all of that out or used it as building material the ringworlds nightshadowed rim showed pale against the black background lightamplified stars glared and four tiny green circles cursors i found four more the hindmost said he was at a wall of clumsy clunky lights and dials and switches now louis recognized where he was this was the system that twisted the suns magnetic field he had seen this array in a holo projection eleven years ago when the hindmost manipulated the meteor defense the air here must be soupy with treeoflife spores it was a tidy place except hmmm across that great width of floor a shadowshape was standing in near darkness a shape of motionless menace skewed from the human shape too thin and too pointy in spots bones bones mounted in a pose of attack in the shadows beyond those standing bones gear seemed scattered at random later louis said i should finish my checklist do you need me instantly the knobby man said no hindmost show me no belter would have yanked a man into a vacuum before he had checked his pressure suit that would be murderously rude had the protector read the readiness of his suit at a glance louis wondered was the protector testing his attitude his equipment his temper the hindmost was riding one of the cargo plates he lifted by a yard his heads dipped among the controls the skyview zoomed on an orange nearsphere marked in black dotsandcommas a kzinti ship probably centuries old and retrofitted with hyperdrive the view shrank and moved and expanded this next ship looked big a long slowly rotating lever with a bubble at the near end louis didnt recognize the type the view shrank and moved and expanded to show a gray and black object like a diseased potato seen through fog the hindmost said the ringworld engineers left only the most distant comets too many to destroy them all air reserve the knobby man said to replace air lost over the rim walls yes now note this a blinking green circle marked a crater on the protocomet the view expanded then shifted to deepradar with a blurred view of structure in the ice below the pock the knobby man asked what species built that i cant tell the hindmost said mining projects always have that look like the root system of a plant but here another rotating lever a ship of the same make viewed from the side familiar little stubbywinged aerospacecraft were strung all along its length these are united nations craft made by louiss species louis had finished his checklist the suit would keep him alive for weeks maybe months very good allow me the knobby man said he stepped on another cargo plate and rose his hands were dexterous where the puppeteers mouths had been unsure a second screen lit with a darkened view of the sun minutes passed then a bright plume began to rise twisting in magnetic fields louis said youre going to kill them i take it such are my directions they came as invaders the hindmost said so did we yes are you healthy louis wiggled his bound hand healing its a waste of time anyway if im going into your magic doc what have you been doing weve destroyed six carrier ships and a fleet of thirtytwo landers those were the ships closest to the sun the most vulnerable these last are so distant that we may do no more than enrage them im inclined to ignore the installation in the comet we would only boil ice i found an outsider ship on one of the farthest comets tanj knobby man you didnt shoot down an outsider did you the hindmost advised against good theyre very fragile but theyve got technology we cant even properly describe for that matter they dont want anything weve got and what they want they buy thered be no point to hurting an outsider do you like them that was a somewhat surprising question louis said yes what would they be doing here louis shrugged inside his suit the sky is full of planets theres only one ringworld outsiders are curious the solar plume was still rising observe and criticize the knobby man said to the hindmost fingers like strings of walnuts danced over the wall the puppeteer watched he said good it all seemed very leisurely the plume would take hours to form the superthermal laser effect would be propagating for minutes before it left the plume the targets looked to be hours away at lightspeed louis had already discarded the notion of a last minute rescue louis wu owed nothing at all to the united nations or the arm he wasnt obliged to protect kzinti ships either disarmed and injured he was no match for a protector of any species he knew hed be lucky to keep his life now that he was back in this dance of powers his contract didnt bind him to rescue the knobby mans prey and they had come as invaders i pointed out a monitor station too one of mine the hindmost was saying the conservatives will never miss it right knobby man im tempted to call you dracula dracula was the archetype of story vampires follow your whim no trite youre a protector a prime mover among vampires lets call you bram can you tell me what you want of me i want what is best for my species vampires face three threats and each threatens all beneath the arch including yourselves the knobby man watched louiss face as he spoke first if vampires become numerous we deplete our prey intelligent hominids might even find a way to exterminate us i dont want any species of vampire getting too much attention you dont want us spreading the vampire slayers were they yours no thats crazy theyre your own species no louis theyre not there must be a hundred separate species of vampire on the ringworld ah where do yours live bram ignored that louis i did not shape the shadow nest alliance their solution was elegant wasnt it yeah second these invaders from space threaten the ringworld structure itself louis nodded an interstellar warship can always use a meteoroid impact for a weapon watch for falling comets the third threat is protectors for the duels they fight louis asked just how many protectors have we got already three or more involved in repairing the rim wall installations each would seem to have its task but all will bear watching what species can you tell its an important question isnt it those who rule would be vampires any others would be servants drafted from local species louis one can argue how the tanj did the ringworld come to be infested with vampire protectors that is an intricate tale but why should i tell it louis had carefully not bound himself or the hindmost to reveal secrets how could he urge bram to reveal his he said its your call first decide what you want decide if we can give it to you then decide how much we need to know to do it right the knobby mans hand danced over the wall he said you keep secrets why should i tell mine you are bound to obey regardless try this youve been shooting down ships stet but suppose you miss one youve no way to judge what theyll do next we three i and acolyte and the hindmost are the only aliens at hand you expect to watch us and extrapolate what invaders would do but we dont react if we dont know anything the bright plume pulled from the sun had been arcing over but now it started to straighten to narrow bram said hindmost the prominence is nearly in place will you complete the maneuver destroy all four sources leave the comet louis how can you react properly if you know youre being watched when im being watched i watch back take it into account bram who are you how did a vampire get into the repair center i mapped my way in louis waited louis have you seen how hominids behave when they drink the fuel the machine people make ive done it myself i never have now you must imagine that you have drunk fuel beginning with your mothers milk tens of falans later you wake sober for the first time sober and buzzing with energy and ambition i was born i was shaped falans ago corpses lay all about me tens of my kind days dead and one strange shape that was all knobs i was all knobs too sexless and cold and hungry and gashed by fighting but i was solving the world like a great puzzle three others were waking changed like me louis asked you trapped a protector vampires arent that intelligent this one was born trapped made to be a servant made by go on the city stood on a vertical cliff and one great stilt i was born in its shadow we were always hungry a ramp wound up the stilt to the smell of prey but iron lace stung us when we tried to climb the ramp or the mountain face transport flew to and fro the ramp was never used after we became protectors we guessed at the reasons our lives ran as they did i think we were a defense moat monsters louis said invaders would have to face vampires before they reach the real guards plausible the knobby man said there came a famine when no more produce flowed into the city a lost war political games bandits on the roads who can tell we vampires knew only that the flow of garbage slowed to a trickle and water and sewage too what ate of the garbage went elsewhere and we who survived partly on scavengers blood began to starve many days later the iron lace barrier lifted and great boxes rolled down the ramp we tried to get them open get to the blood within their wheels rolled over us a fantastic warrior danced about the vehicles and killed all who came and stayed after the vehicles were gone killing all who would follow she would not heed our pleading pleading she was immune to our scent and ignored our body language that enraged us we had never seen a protector we were stupid and angry and hungry we brought the knobby one down at last swarmed her and took what blood she hadnt lost in the fight and were still hungry enough to drink from our fallen then others fell into a sleep like death and so did i when i woke i was changed but i remembered and that was already a new thing many of us tasted protector blood that day some died in their sleep four protectors woke by her scent one was my favored mate and so we knew each other i wondered vampires are monogamous say mate once no louis when a hominid doesnt have the scent that is prey i drink her veins empty while i rish her scent may mark a woman as my kind and make her safe but we were starving louis she and i my mate what shall i call her it surprised louis the fervor with which bram told a tale hed had to be goaded into was this the first time hed ever had listeners he said anne anne and i had the will to keep our mouths shut while we mated of course we never mated after we woke changed but we remembered that we trusted each other the memory took him by surprise and louis shuddered trust a vampire she had seemed an angel in rut supernaturally desirable the vampire who attacked louis wu twelve years ago his hands in her ashblond curls had found too much hair too little skull capacity it was not possible for another hominid to judge what a ringworld vampire really was louis could see the hindmost listening one head cocked toward bram and him while the other worked at the board he said stet go on we four explored with ten breeders too young to make the change my mind made maps as we went wedge city was a triangle the base supported by a mountain face the point resting on the great stilt the stilt rising farther to form a tower we battered down doors and smashed windows but the only hominids in the city were imprisoned in the tower when our breeders had been fed and the edge was off our hunger we followed a scent trail to a better protected place a place where two protectors had lived above a hidden store of yellow roots you know of these roots treeoflife we saw their nature anne and i we saw that the root was our blood now we would starve without it we killed the others that first protector i studied her body bram said she was smaller than me her jaw was massive specialized to chew tough branches that grew locally her tools were primitive she rescued breeders of her own local species fought to cover their passage out of the city and through the vampires and sacrificed her life in the act louis most life most animals most hominids can only survive in one locale imagine that your species is restricted to some one stretch of river clump of forest isolated valley or swamp or desert as a protector you become more flexible but everything you cherish is in one place a protector of a less restricted kind can destroy it all if you dont obey her commands did you see any sign of yes of course clues were everywhere they crawled up on our shoulders to bite our necks two protectors dwelt in the house of the roots one served the other we found bodies breeders of the servants species the master was of another kind near eighty thousand falans old protector of a species that has since changed or become extinct i knew the smell of him thousands of falans later the famine drove him from wedge city the servant stayed to rescue her species her blood made you a protector evidently bram agreed the virus the genechanging virus in treeoflife root its in the blood of protectors too louis found that amusing vampires become immortal by drinking an immortals blood but it did not amuse him to be at the mercy of a vampire protector now the plume from the sun stretched tens of millions of miles into space the hindmost rode a cargo plate near the rounded ceiling one head cocked to hear surely he was too far away unless a directional mike louis asked again how did you get into the repair center bram said roots to last a hundred falans we must find the source or die when we run out anne and i taught each other to read writings in wedge city guided us to cities with libraries we chose a cold climate so that we might hide ourselves under clothing they took us for visitors from afar we paid taxes bought land ultimately gained a citizens access to the library of the delta people there we learned something of the repair facilities beneath the map of mars we reached the great ocean and crossed it we had to make inflated cylinders to walk about the surface of the map of mars i prefer your pressure suits still we entered while still alive and you didnt kill each other no vampires have no minds louis wu a vampire protector starts fresh intelligent from birth bound by no preconceptions and no old loyalties or promises if a hominid cannot choose a protector of her own species a vampire must be her next best choice youd have killed each other for the last treeoflife root louis didnt say it he wasnt sure it was true you found the master protector how why did you fight we fought for who would best guard the arch and all beneath but his record was good wasnt it whole species must have evolved and died out during his time but civilizations rose and flourished until but we won anne and i bram turned away hindmost what progress louis looked toward a skeleton standing in dimness he had guessed who that must be how did you get to him he was eighty thousand falans old you said nearly a million ringworld rotations twenty thousand earth years all that time and then there was you he had to come hindmost the puppeteer called down i have played the meteor defense on three targets we will not see results for two hours three before the installation in the comet can observe and react any of the others have hours to move but who can dodge a beam of light your opinion my people prefer to achieve our aims by giving other species what they want the hindmost said louis wu react louis answered youve started something you cant stop youve attacked two war fleets three if you count the fleet of worlds political structures get old and die bram but information never gets lost anymore storage is too good somebody will be testing the ringworld defenses for as long as there are protons then the arch must have a protector for as long as there are protons at least one invaders wouldnt just take over territory theyd fiddle and test and maybe ruin something like the city builders did when they took the attitude jets on the rim wall to make interstellar ships the knobby man waited a vampire might be a mistake you have a vampire in place to fight him might be a far more expensive mistake when louis said nothing still chewing his thoughts bram fished something from his vest it was carved wood bigger than the flute hed played earlier the windsound was deeper richer with a drumbeat that was brams fingertips tapping the barrel of the thing soothing despite louiss irritation louis waited for the mournful tootling to stop he said you need a meteor watch in the plane of the ringworld i dont know how to do that the solar meteor defense cant fire on anything thats hiding under the ringworld floor come bram said hindmost come well return later to see what has escaped us the knobby mans hand felt like a handful of marbles and his pull on louiss good wrist was irresistible louis found himself walking rapidly away he looked back once at bones in a stance of attack then bram guided or pushed louis onto the stepping disk they flicked through into needles cargo space the knobby man helped louis strip the suit off inside out careful of his injured arm careful not to release spores that might have accreted on the surface where was the hindmost bram led louis onto the other disk flicked them both through into crew quarters at no time had louis considered resisting bram was just too futzy strong the protector knelt before a blank wall the puppeteer worked here to summon images into his own quarters let us see how well i observed him he produced wooden picklocks and went to work a diagram appeared the map of the stepping disks then a view of weaver town the hindmost flicked in lander bay then crew cabin forgive the delay he said were you testing my security hindmost wake the kzin now bram said afterward i want a better view of the rim wall where the protectors are working send your refueling probe the hindmost glanced at readouts in the autodoc lid touched something and danced back as the lid lifted the kzin stood in one fluid motion ready to take on an army now the knobby man was armed with flash and variableknife though louis hadnt seen him move bram waited to see acolyte relax then asked acolyte will you bind yourself to me according to the terms of louis wus contract the kzin turned his scars had disappeared and his hands looked fine louis wu shall i do that louis swallowed his reservations and said yes i accept your contract get out of the doc acolyte did bram led louis to the big doc and helped him in the hindmost was busy elsewhere colorcoded dots and rainbow arcs swirled and shifted in the captains cabin responding to the puppeteers music suddenly he whistled in discord the probe speak bram said look the stepping disk is dismounted from my refueling probe wait the puppeteer tapped at the wall the view from the partly submerged probe became a view from the cliffside webeye there look there it is the teleport device that had been mounted on the probes flank now lay flat on the riverbank beside the council house nobodys trying to hide it louis said the little disk in the nose with the deuterium filter is that still in place the hindmost looked yes its almost flattering someone wants me back theft yeah but leave it what youd better do is bring the probe here and mount another disk acolyte the hindmost will read you your contract dont harm either of these people wake me up when the doc is through with me the kitchen wall has settings to feed a kzin and bram here will be using it too will you be all right yes stet with no small trepidation louis lay down in the coffinshaped doc the lid closed chapter twentyone physics lessons air sled transfer station ad they saw it days ahead a black line against the vastly more distant starboard rim wall closer the line became a tremendous and artificial silhouette rising above the desert a raised platform with bumps clustered near the center closer yet the reds could see daylight under parts of the elevation by then warvia knew it was the night peoples goal and the sand peoples cemetery they were traveling through a dry land sand wasnt good for the motor there had been a hungry few days before they ran across the sand people the sand people went muffled in pastel robes small compact beasts drew their wagons in groups of twelve and served as meat animals too carnivores red herders and machine people rejoiced alike they made gifts of the cloth theyd taken from the shadow nest the sand people killed two of their beasts to make a feast the several species shared lore and stories as best they could only karker spoke the trade language well enough to be understood and everything had to be translated rishathra didnt require translation only gestures without their robes the sand people were small and compact as short as gleaners with broader torsos and lean arms and legs harpster and grieving tube kept to the payload shell the cruiser departed at halfdawn it made warvia uneasy to know that the ghouls below her driving bench were near starving but their goal was in sight they arrived in bright midafternoon an ancient road half covered with sand rose to the axis of the platform three arms splayed out from the center section at degree angles the arms were wedgeshaped platforms that floated unsupported the center section was a forest of mooring posts metal rails pulleys and ropes the roofed buildings on this structure looked like afterthoughts they were empty and sandblasted by time warehouses a banquet hall an inn running through the axis was a deep well with clean water at the bottom on one of the wide paths between buildings the sand people had laid out their dead it looked as if they had been doing that for generations there were hundreds of skeletons a double handful at the hub end were more mummy than bone a few were more recent yet just as karker said said sabarokaresh warvia did karker tell you warvia said karker told me how to find a shrieker village sand people dont eat shriekers but i told him we could you were guessing well what choice antispin of the funeral place warvia waved to antispin and then looked again not thirty paces paces away the smooth plains became a jumble of mounds it looked like a crumbling city in miniature we wont wake the ghouls sabarokaresh decided let them wake and follow their noses so they set their wagon on the cemetery heights not too close to the array of corpses and went out to look over the shrieker village it was not the strangest thing warvia had seen yet it was strange enough here on the flat plain were hundreds of squaredoff mounds it looked like a halfmelted city as built by people a foot high every mound had a door in it every door faced out from the center of the city when the vampire killers walked toward the mounds an army poured out of the holes and took up station the shriekers were of a size to make a days meal warvia thought their faces were blunt they came out on all fours then stood upright to display outsize claws intended more for digging than fighting and shrieked the high pitch hurt warvias ears sticks forn suggested tegger waved it off if we just wade in and start clubbing them theyll swarm us theres a forest of ropes where we left the wagon didnt i see a net there the guard took station again to defend their city barok and tegger threw the net it was of strong coarse weave intended to lift cargo most of the guard crawled out and attacked the reds and machine people ran then pulling the net behind them and paused to flip it over to trap the few remaining guards the other shriekers stopped shrieked at the invaders and returned to their stations four big ones remained caught the reds had eaten and the machine people were cooking their catch before shadow crossed the sun the night people emerged looked about them and followed their noses warvia and tegger crawled into the payload shell to sleep mummified most of them harpster told them at the following halfdawn too far gone even to carry as hardship rations most of them died old sand people seem to lead a good healthy life never mind there was a herder grieving tube finished for him killed by his own beasts i expect we rarely starve good warvia said the sliver of sun was already too bright for the night people they sat under an awning while the others soaked up sunlight and waited for the morning to warm we asked the sand people about this place foranayeedli said they grow up in its shadow but they know nothing of it except as a burial place its much more harpster said our need now is to mount the cruiser and moor it tight well need food for five days for all four of you sabarokaresh said we leave you here warvia and tegger had known this was coming warvia said we thank you for staying so long we would have looked peculiar red herders driving a machine people cruiser have your plans changed we return to port at our own pace well buy our passage with stories and lore well teach the tribes we pass among to make fuel barok squeezed his daughters arm when finally we reach machine people again well have enough of bounties to make forn a dowry for the lessons also thank you tegger said carefully the girl favored him with a lecherous smile you were easy to teach she glanced at her father oh there were things we never yet spoke of courting barok said yes remember how to court foranayeedli said most hominids have courting rituals dont try to guess what they are stick to your own it keeps you comfortable keeps them amused can you remember courting warvia said a little tegger said we court briefly and negotiate first i suppose other hominids consider us shy or cold hmm yes grieving tube said firmly time runs short we must mount the wagon barok forn youll help before you leave we will weve found livestock too what do you intend the wagon must sit solidly on the vehicle at the end of the starboard platform is that a vehicle it was one of three long floating platforms tegger might have taken it for a covered dance floor tournament field shooting range the roof was transparent the floor was flat and five times as big as the cruisers wheelbase sturdy aluminum loops as big as his torso were recessed into the floor they centered the cruiser on the platform harpster and grieving tube supervised from under the awning while the rest threaded rope through aluminum loops and over and around the iron payload shell they used pulleys to put tension on the ropes until it seemed no force beneath the arch would cause the wagon to shift they were done by midday barok and forn began to gear up for their own journey youll need food tegger said shall we smoke some shriekers good and i noticed something barok said he led them to his find a shallow tray three manheights long by two wide with lines trailing from holes at the corners he lifted it effortlessly warvia grinned brilliant you can tow it yes but first the shrieker guard emerged to form rank first the nets they scooped up most of the guard twisted the net and threw it aside then the four dipped the edge of their tray into the loose sandy dirt and pushed and wiggled and pushed until the tray slid in and under when they pulled at the ropes the corners of the tray came up they had a section of shrieker city on a tray the guard had been working their way free what they saw maddened them a swarm of them dug straight into the section of city on the tray frantic lest it escape the rest formed a crescent and screamed lifting it took all the strength of all four but they only had to carry it thirty paces then ropes and pulleys lifted it to the cemetery heights and sliding posts on rails took it the rest of the way they set it down aft of the cruiser and slid the tray out from under the dirt four shriekers still struggling in the net were pulled loose killed cleaned and smoked over wood barok pulled from a collapsed building the machine people drank as they worked as much water as their bellies could carry they left before halfnight warvia and tegger talked to the night people while they inspected the work truly we thought you too would leave us before now harpster said he was looking to spinward of port where foranayeedli and sabarokaresh were tiny shadows the sand people had mapped a path to other tribes traveling by night the city builders could bounce from one tent city to another until they were in green lands once again and where warvia wondered would two red herders be by then warvia explained red herders travel widely twenty daywalks is nothing where we settle rumor and questions will catch us up we make poor liars harpster we must go farther best to do without the questions tegger said in twenty daywalks weve had rishathra with machine people and dryland farmers and sand people warvia remembered that her own experience was wider yet nobody spoke that truth not even harpster he only gunned and said but not weed gatherers nor ghouls picky warvias eyes dropped she would rish but not with a ghoul and tegger wouldnt either but we acted without the encouragement of vampire musk tegger said there is a restlessness in us or me us warvia said firmly mated we are but no longer for each other alone i dont doubt that we can return to our custom but we must be far from the rumor of red herders who rished with every species along their path weve nearly left the machine people empire behind a little farther warvia said five days you said how does this thing move the ghouls were at work closing the aft end of the great crystal canopy warvia began to feel claustrophobic it bothered her how little she and tegger knew of where they were going she thought they would not answer and then harpster said like this he moved a lever that took both arms and a strong back the platform detached from the dock motion was hard to see it was so smooth but the platform was clearly drifting away how far are you going tegger asked oh easily farther than the rumors youre fleeing harpster grinned grieving tube strode around the bulk of the wagon is this baroks work he did well tegger warvia were going as far as the rim wall we can drop you off at the next stop if you like or you can come along and then leave us coming back tegger laughed incredulously youll be dead of old age before you get to the rim wall next stop then harpster said agreeably grieving tube chitterwhistled angrily harpster laughed and chittered back whistling ribaldsounding comments through his teeth grieving tube wants you he told the red herders she thinks we should travel with people who can look daylight in the face we only need to be outside machine people turf tegger said leave us when you like but think its serious work were doing were going up the spill mountains and farther yet no red herder has ever done anything so big youll have so much to tell when you finally settle that youll never remember to speak of rishathra the desert slid smoothly past warvia asked what are we riding its a builder thing ive only heard about them none of the night people would use an air sled unless the need was dire but we have permission and directions how fast does it go the landscape was moving faster yet the receding dockyard had become a dot a sound was rising as of wind heard through a sturdy stone wall fast well be below the spill mountains in five days no so i was told but the first stop is only three days away im frightened watching the world zip past was beginning to hurt warvias eyes warvia there are lines under the land in drawings they took like a honeycomb and they lift and move builder things we can only stop where the lines come together three days grieving tube repeated far across the desert a caravan of hominids and beasts popped up and was gone so quickly that warvia couldnt even identify the species the air sled was still accelerating the payload shell smelled of ghouls it hummed warvia huddled against tegger in the dark and didnt speak of what was happening outside they mated with an intensity backed by fear and for that time warvia entirely forgot where she was but then the whisper of motion was back and teggers voice in the darkness to drown it out what was karker like strong strange to hold strangely shaped down here no not here his body was broad shoulders and belly and hips i think every man is alike here and he was very eager to talk to try his skill at trade language you only talked warvia giggled we rished it was his first time imagine tegger i was his teacher did you tell him of course the only red herder woman who ever engaged in rishathra and all his for the night he loved it who were you with hen no han sheerv i made sure i got her name right she was the tall one almost my size warvia laughed at that and he said the old leaders widow though shes about my age of course we couldnt talk we tried to rish in the dark but we couldnt gesture that way so we went outside and did it by archlight i wonder if the night people were watching i wondered too tegger said and then the whisper of uncanny speed was in their ears and souls they dozed when each knew that the other couldnt sleep they mated again and tried to sleep again when the outline of the door was a white glow warvia asked are you hungry yes are you going out no the door opened on halfdawn light the ghouls shambled in the door closed were moving well along harpster said and tegger heard relief and fatigue in his voice warvia tegger are you all right scared warvia said tegger asked shouldnt someone be steering grieving tube said the air sled rides lines buried in the scrith we cant get lost tegger said if the air sled went astray it would kill us so fast that wed barely know it youll get used to it how do you know harpster growled grieving tube said let us sleep since theyd left the vampires behind the night people had been sleeping in the payload shell the smell was rich warvia huddled against her mate and tried not to think of the smell of ghouls or her hunger or the vibration in the iron around her she uncurled and stood up im going to hunt up a meal shall i bring you back something yes they had left the eternal clouds far behind the day was ablaze the land streamed past pulling warvias eyes with it warvia dropped from the cruiser and loped over to the piled sand keeping her gaze always toward her feet no shrieker guards came warvia found an entrance hole and tickled it with a stick a fat shrieker popped out and screamed at her she snatched it broke its neck and ate voraciously she couldnt keep from looking the land had become a vast forest the tops of huge trees were all far below all converging and disappearing behind the sky sled the motion threw her balance off making her dizzy she made herself circle the cargo tray and tickle another opening when a defender appeared she snatched it and wrapped it in her skirt she was stepping onto the running board when she heard a voice speak her name the shrieker fell and scampered free warvia jumped straight backward her spear poised to kill that wasnt tegger and the ghouls were fast asleep the deck was clear whatever had spoken must be aboard the cruiser or under it the space under there was black warvia adjusted her stance a bit farther from the cruiser had she imagined show yourself warvia i dare not its whisper whisper tegger called you a wayspirit he thought he imagined you the voice said i will not speak to tegger again warvia i hope you will not babble of me to tegger nor to the night people i could be killed and the arch itself may fall if anyone takes notice of me yes my mate said you were secretive whisper why tell me may we talk a little id rather be inside i know warvia were traveling at just under the speed of sound thats not very fast at all when an object strikes the world from outside it moves three hundred times as fast with ninety thousand times the energy really the thought was shattering but why had she thought the speed of sound was instantaneous light travels much faster than sound youve seen that yourself lightning then thunder the voice said it didnt occur to her to doubt a wayspirit anyone who could speak such things must really know what she was talking about she asked why not go faster than sound couldnt we hear each other its the speed of sound in air warvia if we make the air go with us the sound in the air goes with us too oh the air sled is doing what the universe says it must it can go to only one place and then it will touch softly as a feather warvia asked again why tell me when you know what is happening it cant frighten you of course there are exceptions but the sky sled isnt one it flies in a kind of invisible groove a pattern of magnetic fields it cannot lose its way pattern of i will teach you about magnets and gravity and inertia inertia is the force that pulls you against the inside of the spinning ring so that gravity will not pull you into the sun is that real too what the night people say the arch is a ring yes gravity is a force you need hardly notice but it holds the sun together so that it can burn magnets allow the suns rind to be manipulated to defend the arch against things falling from outside i will teach you more if you come in daylight why you and tegger are frightened if you understand whats happening here your fright will go away if you lose your fright so will tegger you will not go mad tegger she said and looked around her tegger must be starving she couldnt find the shrieker shed dropped she went back to the shrieker village holding her eyes to the deck nearly the speed of sound how fast was that in daywalks a shrieker came when she tickled a tunnel opening and she bagged it she climbed into the payload bay and no voice stopped her chapter twentytwo the net hot needle of inquiry ad coffin louis tried to push the lid away the lid didnt want to move that fast he pulled his knees up to set his feet and thrust upward then rolldived out from under the halfraised lid hit the floor kept rolling and stood up in a crouch not a coffin he remembered but he was on an adrenaline high with good reason to stay in motion what had been happening while he was in the box his ankle stung hed kicked something ignore it the strangest thing about his waking was the way he felt in their early twenties louis and a dozen friends had run an ancient martial arts teaching program a few dropped out when the computer had them hitting each other in the face louis had stuck with it playfighting for ten months then it all turned stale and two hundred years went by and it didnt feel like waking from steep or surgery he felt more like a fighter halfway through a yogatsu match he knows he can win absolutely charged up seething with adrenaline and energy great bring em on motion he whirled around his hands felt naked beyond the forward wall rocky rolling terrain flashed past on either side too fast for detail needle must be moving like a hypersonic shuttle at ground level and the view was toward the captains cabin only a picture none of those great rocks was about to mash him into jelly the black basalt walls to left and right the lander bay behind him were all quite motionless the thing hed kicked was a block of stone in the forwardstarboard corner of crew quarters hed never seen that before it looked completely inert and harmless a roughly dressed granite cube as tall as his knee he was alone louis understood why bram had left acolyte in an induced coma until he could attend to him waking alone a kzin might set traps and barriers or force the wardrobe and kitchen systems to produce weapons but louis did not understand why bram had left him to wake alone how fast did a protector learn bram had observed him for hmm up to three days if hed tapped into the webeye camera at weaver town could bram already know me well enough to trust me not likely bram hadnt done this the hindmost must have reset the doc to open when his treatment was finished now what was the hindmost trying to show him louis wondered did the protector know what kind of show the hindmost had running here the hologram view streamed past him distant trees flashed past an extensive forest of what looked like pines dead ahead mountains and cloud patterns seemed infinitely distant the hindmost could hide anything in the captains cabin and his crew would see nothing but this bounding lurching hologram projection maybe that was the point the bouncing lower rim was dark wood the front of an alcoholburning machine people cruiser under that a bit of a curved rim of gleaming metal or plastic the webeye camera that the ghouls had mounted on a machine people cruiser now rode something that flew blocks of rock protruded from fringes of forest the vehicle flew no more than two hundred feet up the speed subsonic but not by much what kind of hominids could tolerate such speed louis wondered even disney port didnt run rides this fast most ringworld hominids would die if they merely traveled beyond their local ecologies a ride like this would stop their hearts what was he supposed to do with this how much time did he have to play trapped in a bungalowsized box buried miles deep in cooled lava he was hardly a free agent stepping disks would get him out but they would only take him to where his masters waited louis knew that he was reacting instead of acting like a good dog trying to guess the will of his masters he was seething with new youth and he couldnt do anything sit down he told himself relax distract yourself eat the kitchen menu was running it showed kzinti script and a picture some kind of sea life alien sashimi better not louis reset it for human metabolism sol earth franais pain perdu added caf au lait and called it breakfast and while he waited hmmm using the stepping disk would lose him his options examining the stepping disk he lifted the rim as hed seen bram do the racing landscape blinked out replaced by an abstraction the diagram of the stepping disk network more links had been added several networks had merged into one the restricted flick from crew quarters to the captains cabin was still isolated and so were a few other pairs still the hindmost had given up some security for greater convenience bram must have made him do that the diagram measured distance on a logarithmic scale at and near needle detail was fine enough to discriminate between crew quarters and the lander bay there were flick points all through the repair center louis picked out weaver town hundreds of thousands of miles distant one point was far to starboard of needles position almost to the rim wall half a million miles away or more the most distant point must be a third of the way around the ringworlds arc hundreds of millions of miles brighter lines would indicate links that were currently open if he was reading this right open circuits ran from needles crew quarters to needles lander bay to the far point on the great ocean bram must be exploring had he taken the hindmost or had the hindmost returned to his cabin knowing that louis thought would tell him exactly how much trust was between the hindmost and bram in his cabin the hindmost would be next to invulnerable with general products hull material between him and any enemy locked off from his grooming aids he would grow scruffy and uncomfortable ding french toast with maple syrup coffee with foamy steamed milk appeared a moment later louis ate rapidly then he tried using the fork on the stepping disk controls the tines bent and broke humming louis dialed the hashi felt like wood they even had a grain he cracked one along the grain to get a point he began moving whatever would move in the stepping disk controls bright lines faded others brightened as links opened and closed a slide turned everything off moving the slide back the way it had come got him a blinking half brightness the system wanted instructions he kept playing presently he had a bent ring of seven bright lines and a virtual clock and weird music playing in the background he couldnt understand the musical puppeteer language and he couldnt read a fleet of worlds timepiece but he saw how to set it for fast if hed read this right the circuit would take him to the lander bay then to weaver town to see what had changed pick up a pressure suit in the lock or else hed be sniffing treeoflife when he flicked to the meteor defense room keep the suit on when he flicked to the surface of the map of mars and thence to the farthest point on the diagram which seemed to be on the rim wall on to the mystery point at the far shore of the great ocean and back to needle second thoughts this shouldnt take him more than a few minutes unless he found something interesting he set the sashimi plate on the stepping disk nothing happened of course not the rim of the stepping disk was still lifted exposing the controls louis pushed it down the sashimi plate flicked out the network blinked out too louis had to shy from sudden motion the racing landscape was back and mountains beyond spill mountains with the rim wall as backdrop they were nearby by ringworld measure a few tens of thousands of miles away louis thought of matters he would like to study if he could access the ships computer hed have to ask the hindmost later he must review what was known of protectors where was that sashimi plate running through a yoga set allowed him to curb his impatience how fast was fast fortyfive minutes later the plate hadnt come back his companions might be at one of these points probably were and acolyte might have snatched the sashimi still rethink the far point in the diagram had drifted a little drifted a little yeah louiss windpipe closed up he was wheezing two hundred million miles up the arch as measured on a logarithmic scale and drifting that point had to be moving like an interstellar slowboat at hundreds of miles per second it was the refueling probe of course they must have mounted a new stepping disk on its flank and set it orbiting along the rim wall as for the sashimi plate it must have burned as a meteor louis pulled the disk up to expose the controls he began to reset them swearing and talking himself through it trying to ignore the orchestra now this should reset that link tanj why not oh stet dark means off now try this he dialed up a loaf of bread and set it on the stepping disk flick an hour and ten since he had cut his associates off from needle hed cut them off from the entire repair center come to that it would be open war when they discovered that and breach of contract too then again what could they do about it the chuckle never reached his throat louis knew puppeteers the hindmost would have had auxiliary controls implanted surgically louis knew he should be wondering when to reset the stepping disks the hindmost might tolerate his fiddling but louis didnt want to face brams wrath the bread was back the cruiser was flying over water the mountains were to its left now drifting minutely to spinward the platform must have turned turned by sixty degrees louis let a slow grin form it was following the superconductor grid superconducting cable lay as a substrate beneath the ringworld floor forming hexagons fifty thousand miles across it guided the magnetic fields by which solar prominences could be manipulated evidently the cruiser was riding a magnetic levitation vehicle possibly something worked up by city builders more likely something as old as the ringworld itself did the hindmost know reacting he was still reacting and the bread was back worth the risk louis stepped on the disk pressure suits were missing from the lander bay one for the hindmost chmeees spare and a set meant for louis it need not mean that brams crew were in vacuum the protector might be showing caution using the suits for armor louis stepped off to tuck a pressure suit under his arm then a cummerbund helmet and air pack then on to weaver town louis flicked in off balance he stumbled and dropped everything he was carrying embarrassed he looked warily about him full daylight the stepping disk sat on the mud bank of the weavers bathing stream canted at an angle nobody was using the pool louis listened for childrens voices but he heard nothing hed stooped to examine the disk when a waspish voice spoke close behind him the fallen helmet said greeting what species are you louis stood up i am of the ball people he said kidada yes louis wus people the old weaver peered at louis uncertainly yes kidada how long since louis wu left youre louis wu made young yes kidadas gape and stare made louis uncomfortable he said kidada i have been in a long sleep are the weavers well we thrive we trade visitors come and go sawur took ill and died many days ago the sky has circled twentytwo times since sawur since the night you vanished with some hairy creature of legend just on your tail and only a ghoul child for witness yes sawur is dead i nearly died too and two children died sometimes visitors bring a sickness that kills others but not themselves i hoped to talk to her a gaunt smile but will she answer she advised me well dont wait until youre desperate sawur told me of your problem after you vanished i solved it i hope i solved it otherwise i am enslaved enslaved but with tens of falans to free yourself kidada sounded tired and bitter louis was becoming aware of how much he wanted to talk to sawur he would have stayed to mourn if he had the time time the sky had circled twentytwo times two falans plus one hundred sixtyfive of the ringworlds thirtyhour days theyd left him in that tank for more than half an earth year and he now was playing catchup kidada who moved our stepping disk i know not what you mean this it was here the morning you were gone weve left it alone the rim was muddy louis could see big fingerprints and scratch marks left by fingernails some visiting hominid not weavers who had smaller hands had been trying to alter the setting ghouls he might have known he was glad hed flicked in during daylight the night people wouldnt even know hed been here louis donned his pressure suit say hello to the children for me he said and he flicked out darkness louis turned on his helmet lamp and a halfseen skeleton was watching him he was in the meteor defense room the screens were dark his lamp was the only light these bones had been mounted for study they werent attached at the joints they barely touched a frame of thin metal rods held them in place the skeleton stood ten inches shorter than louis wu all of the bones had a rounded look weathered the ribs were improbably narrow the fingers nearly gone time had turned bone structure to dust weather in here couldnt be that erosive but the knuckles still showed large and all the joints were massive and greatly swollen those eroded projections in the massive jaw werent teeth they were later bone growth protector louis let his fingertips play over the face the bone was gritty with dust and smooth smoothed by time as surfaces turned gradually to dust this wasnt an erosive environment these bones must be a thousand years dead at least the right hip had been shattered the pieces mounted separately and the left shoulder and elbow and the neck all fractured or shattered he might have died in a fall or been beaten to death in combat the pak had had their origin somewhere in the galactic core a pak colony on earth had failed the treeoflife had failed leaving the colony with no protectors but pak breeders had spread over the earth from landing sites in africa and asia their bones were in museums under names such as homo habilis their descendants had evolved to intelligence a classic example of neoteny there was a mummified pak protector in the smithsonian institute it had been dug from under a desert on mars centuries ago louis had never seen it except as a hologram in a general biology course this creature might be a deformed pak he thought but there was that massive jaw protectors lost their teeth that was a pity because teeth could have told him a lot but the jaw was a bone cracker the torso was too long for a standard issue pak it was not quite a pak and it was also not quite a ghoul louis could guess when it had died but when had it been born the protector in the smithsonian had spent thirty thousand years and more crossing from the galactic core to earth gearing up for the expedition might have taken him that long again protectors could live a long time cronus was the oldest of the greek gods killer of his children until some escaped and killed him instead call this one cronus then a vampire horde had killed a protector who must have been cronuss abandoned servant bram and anne must have stalked the master for years afterward years centuries millennia pak breeders mans ancestors and the vampires too had been cursorial hunters before ever they left the galactic core old cronus might not have taken vampire protectors quite seriously vampires after all were mindless animals with disgusting sexual and dietary habits and cronus had been a superintelligent being with no distracting sex urge at all and so was bram it might give him a blind spot louis thought if he could find it the breaks at the right hip left arm and shoulder and a crack along the skull had been fresh at death louis found old healed breaks elsewhere cronus had broken his spine long before his death did a protectors spinal nerves grow back his right knee that old injury hadnt healed the knee was fused solid something else was strange about the spine but louis didnt understand until he returned to the skull the forehead bulged more the forehead bone and the crest at the top was smoother younger than the rest of the skull the jagged ridge of growth from the jawbone still had an appearance of worn teeth these things were recent growth the spine too was recent growth it had gone through a period of regeneration if cronus had won his last battle he would have healed again so think of it as a murder investigation i know the killer but to get a conviction in court i need every detail every nuance why did bram put these bones back together the enemy was dead there were none to avenge him or did bram and anne fear others like cronus a standing skeleton and a heap of gear in the shadows beyond bram hadnt let him near this stuff it had seemed scattered dropped at random it was and it wasnt stuff had been laid out neatly for study then something had swept through the pattern like a vampire protector kicking out in rage some of it had simply disintegrated some had left clear patterns this had been a wonderful fur coat and a belt to hold it closed it stank just a ghost of the stench of old hide and a ghoul who hadnt bathed in thousands of years on the inner surface the hide surface louis could see the traces of a score of leather pockets in a score of shapes all empty now there were weapons a knife of old metal turned to black rust slender and a foot long two knives made of horn each no bigger than a forefinger there were six throwing knives nearly identical though shaped from stone as lethal as the day they were made a slender pole of some durable metal alloy the ends sharpened to chisels patterns in the dust might once have been wooden shoes with heavy straps here were a fancy crossbow and a dozen bolts each slightly different this little box a firestarter louis tried but he couldnt get a flame started a stack of paper or parchment maps there was a telescope crude but very finely shaped and polished and set a little apart hello these next to it were toolworking tools pumice little knives bram and or anne had set up shop here to duplicate cronuss telescope a hard black lump the size of his fist louis bent low to sniff dried meat a thousand years beyond its date but jerky always did smell and taste a bit gamy maybe a ghoul would like that how long ago had cronus died ask louis knew he was playing catchup here hed learn more by asking but hed learn what bram chose to teach and time was constricting around him louis patted cronuss shoulder bones trust me he said and flicked out he was glareblind and way off balance he convulsed like a sea anemone reaching between his knees for anything solid eyes squinted shut against raw sunlight his gloved fingers brushed something and closed hard the badly tilted stepping disk slid under him by a foot or two he was gripping the rim of the disk itself he hoped he held very still his photosensitive faceplate turned smoky gray still crouched gripping the edge of the stepping disk he looked about him the map of mars wasnt a very good map he could see a hundred shades of red without moving but the sky was the dark blue of highaltitude earth the sun was too bright for mars nothing could be done about the gravity either maybe it didnt matter to martians they lived safe from sunlight beneath sand fine enough to behave like a viscous fluid perhaps the sand would even buoy them against ringworld gravity hed expected to be at mons olympus and it seemed he was he was a long way up the stepping disk rested near the top of a smooth fortyfivedegree slope of piled dust and it was starting to slide again what had the hindmost been thinking of to put it here yeah right martians theyd set a trap sliding faster now losing all stability it was a long way down miles dust must have piled here over millenia in a prevailing wind a great ocean stratospheric wind in a weather pattern huger than worlds another flaw in the accuracy of the map of mars louis squatted flattened himself against the stepping disk as it became a sled it picked up speed the disk was trying to bounce him off his hands had a deathgrip and he tried to grip with his boot toes too an arcologysized rock stood in his path he leaned left trying to steer nope it was going to swat him hard then he was elsewhere and his deathgrip became something more because he was falling into a black void he chopped off part of a shrill scream but i fixed it i fixed it i fixed it he was clinging to a stepping disk welded to a gracefully curved cigar shape the puppeteers refueling probe around him was black sky and a glare of stars the stepping disk the probes hull everything glowed there must be light behind him without losing anything of his toeandfinger grip louis twisted to look over his shoulder the ringworld was adrift behind and below him he could see fine detail rivers like twisted snakes undersea landscapes a straight black thread that might be a machine people highway the naked sun was trying to broil him no problem the suit was one he could sweat through night would be a greater threat he hadnt thought he would need an oversuit he was level with the top of the rim wall looking down at halfconical spill mountains and the rivers that ran from their bases a thousand miles up far ahead of him he could make out lacy lines sketching a long double cone an attitude jet he could see the twin toroids that hed thought made up a bussard ramjet but they were tiny forming the wasp waist of something far larger the ringworld attitude jet was made of wire so thin that it kept fading in and out of sight a cage to guide the flow of the solar wind this one wasnt mounted yet it wasnt pointed right louis hadnt felt fear like this in two hundred years but i got the bread back the probe was coasting was motionless while the ringworld rotated below at miles per second the system must have reset i took this one disk out of the link but it must have reset i dont understand the hindmosts programming language what else have i fouled up the sashimi that was easy the plate must have drifted too far from the disk the bread hadnt it was still in range when the disks cycled he hung on hung on and the disk bumped against his faceplate he clung with his eyes closed he was in no shape to confront anyone any creature in a few seconds hed be safe and alone aboard hot needle of inquiry a great clawed hand took him by the shoulder and rolled him over chapter twentythree the running lesson hidden patriarch ad the kzin pulled him to his feet louis was gasping shivering acolyte couldnt talk to him while his helmet was closed and louis was glad of that he was aboard hidden patriarch near the stern just another goddamn stunning surprise he had left the milelong sailing ship on the shenthy river what was it doing here acolyte was trying to ask him something the kzin was holding tanj dammit louis wrenched his helmet open acolyte said i was prowling around the stern when this popped up on the stepping disk your visitinggift louis preserved fish louis took the sashimi plate the sliced fish was puffy and crisp to the touch its been in vacuum he said did a loaf of bread come by i let it pass louis you stink of terror what am i doing here in a moment he could be safe aboard hot needle of inquiry floating between sleeping plates while he got through his shivering got his mind back and tried to digest what he had and hadnt learned acolyte had seen him if the kzin could be persuaded to shut up then yeah right the protector must have been observing acolytes body language for half an earth year the kzin couldnt hide anything from him louis said instead the dead could smell my terror he dropped his helmet and air pack and began opening zippers i thought i had the stepping disk controls figured out wrong oh and the martians set us a death trap that almost got me too an adolescents halfbald head popped into view above a hatch city builder the boys eyes widened in surprise and he dropped from view the kzin asked martians louis began stripping off his suit skip it ive got to burn some energy can you run the kzin bristled i outran my father after we fought ill race you to the bow acolyte yowled and bounded away louiss pressure suit was pooled around his ankles at the kzins howl his every muscle locked and he fell over that was a wonderful battle cry hissing ancient curses louis pulled the suit off rolled to his feet and ran acolyte was still in sight moving considerably faster than he was then the ship structure jogged and he was gone louis had lived aboard this ship for nearly two years he wasnt likely to get lost he ran hard competing only with himself he had a full mile to cover loueee the voice was faint and strange coming from high overhead from a piersons puppeteer perched in the aft crows nest louis bellowed hellooo wait the voice called cant he felt good a squarish shadow descended louis ran on it came alongside pacing him a repair center cargo plate with rails welded around it louis called stay clear im in a race i dont understand its not an intelligence test how do you feel wonderful disoriented alive hindmost dont use the olympus stepping disk why martians theyre alive set a trap louis drew a deep breath and blew it out salt air on his taste buds wonderful his breath was holding his legs were holding he pumped harder theyll set another two can play that game what if i dropped a disk in the sea and began flicking water to mons olympus you ask me dont exterminate anything you might need it later its the reason you didnt kill off the kzinti more or less the puppeteer acknowledged a oneeyed head dipped toward a puff of orange glimpsed far ahead along the top middeck acolyte louis your advent is opportune we have much to catch up on wheres bram cooking our dinner his heads were arced around to look into his own eyes was the hindmost joking maybe that was puppeteer laughter and maybe it wasnt bram has a sensitive nose the hindmost added louis asked how goes the dance the dance it proceeds without me im tanj sick of using your recycler louis i havent even had time to redesign it thank you for that keep it casual but if bram didnt trust the hindmost enough to let him take normal exercise or use a toilet and shower designed for puppeteers then the hindmost might be ready to take back his life the top middeck ended louis clambered through ladders and corridors kzinti ladders were heavily tilted and the rungs were too far apart but louis went up and down like an ape on steroids he kept expecting to pass acolyte worse he expected acolyte to leap out at him from some alcove he stayed to the heights in his mind he tried to map his way around the garden it would take too long at the end of a corridor he ran up a flight of hardwood steps to the top of a wall along the wall to avoid a thicket of big yellow puffballs with impressive thorns and dropped ten feet into dirt it had been a kzinti hunting park for two years louis and the city builders had tended these plants they had been growing wild when he arrived once they must have fed herds for kzinti sailors the herds were gone and he didnt expect to find animals now unless acolyte was about to leap out from some citrus thicket but he never saw the kzin there were eight tremendous main masts and uncountable sails and the winches that moved them could only be worked by a kzin or a protector this mast was the foremast with the fore crows nest at the top louis was blowing hard his legs felt like overcooked noodles someone was waiting in the bow louis cursed in his mind he didnt have breath to spare a moment later he recognized the protector shape louis slowed bram waited like a statue louis couldnt tell if he was breathing at all i think you win louis gasped were we racing bram wouldnt have known of an intruder until the city builder boy found him in the kitchen or until he heard feet pounding across the deck overhead he must have run louis said whatever i needed exercise before him was a mountain range an unearthly mountain range conical mountains spaced wide apart and varying in size ran left and right without a horizon he had no real grasp of their size most were tall enough to have icewhite peaks but below the ice they were all green patchwork then his eye mind perceived what loomed above them they were tiny wait now the rim was a thousand miles high of the twenty or thirty mountains he could pick out five or six were mere foothills leaning against the rim wall but two or three might match everest the hindmost drifted toward the bow behind him a puff of orange pulled itself into view the kzin plodded up he was done winded louis said thank you acolyte i really really needed that i was carrying enough adrenaline to run a war the kzin panted father let me win didnt want to kill me ah how did you pass me must have maybe in the garden how bram you must know about cursorial hunters i dont know the term the protector said stet acolyte most hunting creatures miss their jump eight times out of nine if the prey runs away they pick something slower only a few kinds of meat eaters pick their prey and follow it until they run it down wolves do that so do humans big cats arent cursorial hunters and kzinti arent either your ancestors learned that theyd better track down an enemy or hell turn up later but thats your brain talking your evolution hasnt caught up you knew you would win yeah the kzin blinked at him if we had run only as far as the garden you would have won thank you for the lesson thank you that was nicely phrased louis thought who had taught him that bram said louis look around you react react impressive all that green from the foothills to the frost line all green i shouldnt be surprised those mountains are all seabottom muck all fertilizer more some of the pipes have stopped delivering flup that would account for the lowest mountains whats left of them must be fairly hard rock by now the highest ones must have a lot of water ice in them at least at the peak i can see rivers running from the foothills those mountains will get the ringworlds only regular earthquakes a difficult environment i suppose bram we saw all this fifty falans ago have you seen signs of life in the mountains once around your world would mark the distance to those mountains but yes we have louis i have a meal to tend hindmost acolyte take him to the dining hall show him the hindmost had sprayed webeyes on all four walls of the dining hall one was not in use a mere bronze spiderweb a window shaped like a pool of spilled water looked out upon a row of dark green cones capped in white another showed the edge of the rim wall drifting slowly past a view from the refueling probe and one showed a score of muscular hairy men using ropes to guide a square plate big enough to be the floor plan of a sixroom bungalow the plate floated above them it might have been a big cargo plate or part of a floating building the men were pulling it toward louis toward the machine people cruiser and its stolen webeye i left you a record taken six days ago the hindmost said to watch when you woke but this is in present time what are they doing the kzin answered theyre approaching the rim wall any way they can why i dont know that yet bram might the kzin said while you were in treatment bram found your city builder friends and set them aboard hidden patriarch they obey bram as my fathers slaves obeyed their lord they had the ship moving to starboard within a day bram is studying the rim wall louis asked again why we were not told acolyte said the hindmost said i have never seen bram show fear yet i think he fears protectors louis saw the connection the attitude jets need replacing otherwise the ringworld slides off center any protector who sees that will be found mounting attitude jets on the rim wall right if the theory holds why isnt bram there the puppeteer made a short sharp sound as if a clarinet had sneezed if protectors knew that three offworld species have mounted invasions and a fourth is in wide orbit to study the effects they would swarm the map of mars instead give them decent telescopes no theyd still ah ah bram has to be on the rim wall too hes preparing the other protectors will kill him if they can the puppeteers eyes met he said in any case we have hidden patriarchs view of the local rim wall my refueling probe has been in solar orbit for more than a falan now skimming along the rim walls recording weve learned a great deal louis the hindmost whistled a brief trill all three views began a slow zoom from hidden patriarchs fore crows nest the spill mountains expanded until only one was in sight pale green and dark green grass and forest reached up to icewhite at the very peak a black thread dipped into a compact knot of black fog seabottom muck fell steadily from a spillpipe a thousand miles overhead from the probe the rim wall blurred past louis tried to keep his eyes off it from the stolen webeye louis began to laugh now the machine people cruiser was bobbing gently twenty feet up beyond the edge of the floating plate was rolling landscape hummocks like a thousand sleeping behemoths ropes were pulling the cargo plate thirtyodd men of a species unfamiliar to louis were pulling the ropes the men wore light packs but nothing else straight black hair covered their heads and their backs to below their buttocks perhaps hair was all they needed for warmth they were running uphill toward a ridge and toward thirty hairy women waiting below the ridge the women were waving yelling encouragement among them was a small red woman a red herder attempting to guide them with wide motions of her arms the way grew steeper the men werent running anymore as they neared the crest the women ran alongside them they were as hairy as the men more or less smoothly they added themselves to the ropes there was general laughter and brief conversations held in gasps the women pulled some were running backward they had strong legs louis noted as strong as the mens they were over the crest now and starting downhill the runners were behind the window now trying to slow the craft the red herder ran to snatch a rope and climb it the viewpoint moved faster and faster over the rounded land by now all the runners must have let go the hummocks grew larger ahead grew mountainous streams ran among them and converged ahead louis realized that he was looking at the foot of a spill mountain the swaying of the plate was making louis motionsick theyre going to get themselves wrecked he said acolyte yowled kzinti ridicule i dont consider them sane myself the hindmost said the view from hidden patriarchs bow was expanding too now the peak of the spill mountain was lost overhead a third of the way up the slopes louis began to see colored dots and blinking lights blinking lights heliographs very astute louis a ghoul child told me about this he thought he was being cryptic their whole empire must be linked by heliographs in the spill mountains how do you suppose they do it ghouls cant stand daylight at night they see flashing mirrors from daylit mountains easy enough but how do they send louis they must buy message services from locals somehow and bargain with the spill mountain people too somehow i bet they dont use rishathra they dont need many we only see the glitter from a handful of spill mountains a few thousands of message stations on the surface would be enough to knit their empire together what about the what are those balloons the hindmost trilled again the zoom stopped the mountains began to drift sideways a score of colored dots were adrift against the ice a mile to a mile and a half up louis saw more of them in the wide spaces between mountains hot gas balloons louis we see them flowing between the spill mountains everywhere we look how much variation harkabeeparolyn and kawaresksenjajok entered bearing platters and stopped in their tracks the hindmost whistled the hurtling rim wall and the bouncing foothills faded into bronze spiderwebs it was a wonder the city builders hadnt dropped everything and run screaming louis thought but harkabeeparolyn was still staring and kawaresksenjajok was watching her and grinning me louis said its still me ive had some medical work done harkabeeparolyn turned to her mate and spoke louiss translator said you knew zelz told me ill get you for this you little zilth but harkee was laughing and so was kawa they set their platters down a heap of brown and yellow roots and a bowl of pink fluid harkabeeparolyn settled into louiss lap and studied his face from an inch away weve been lonely she said it felt natural as if theyd been doing this forever it felt as if he had come home he said you werent lonely where i left you we were told to come she nodded at the kitchen they had obeyed a protector that too must have seemed very natural louis asked what were you told sail to starboard she shrugged from time to time he comes and looks about and alters our course or tells us of wind and water currents or ways to catch and cook fish or warmbloods or tend the garden he says we dont eat enough red meat that might be his ancestry speaking louis you look as young as kawa can you the puppeteer answered only for ball people and the ball kzinti to heal local hominids or local kzinti or any other species a thousand of my kind would need a lifetime of study and testing harkabeeparolyn scowled kawaresksenjajok and bram entered with more platters here were six big surpassingly ugly deepsea fish two were still twitching the others had been broiled with strange looking plants kzinti vegetables the bowl of raw vegetables was also from the kzinti hunting park louis looked at the other bowl and asked fish blood bram said whale blood and a vegetable puree it would not feed me long your kitchen was a wonderful find they sat kawaresksenjajok went and returned with a two or threeyearold child she had a full head of orangeblond hair louis wouldnt have taken her for a city builder the older boy was not in evidence brams cooking was good a little strange bram must have been cooking for city builder tastes using plants from the hunting park there would be crucial diet components missing or in short supply louis asked how long would this keep me alive bram said a falan before your behavior would begin to deteriorate he sipped decorously acolyte had already disposed of the raw fish louis asked him are you still hungry its enough one who satisfies his hunger grows fat and torpid the little girl was crawling toward the edge of the table louis pointed harkee turned the child reached the edge slipped and clung by her fingers she had a grip like a monkey or a hanging person thought shed fall hah the city builder woman was laughing at him wrong species abruptly she asked the protector may we keep louis for a time in the instant before he replied brams glance touched all their faces judging deciding he said you may have each other until midday tomorrow louis we should return to needle soon we can learn no more until we take the probe over the rim hindmost is that why you let louis wake of course ive had little chance to brief him again brams eyes took them all in he said i must know the spill mountains and the rim the protectors on the rim wall must not learn of me the central question is of protectors i must know where they are how many what species their intentions and methods and goals i have learned what i can without acting and avoided attention when i could the pilfered webeye moves ever closer to the rim wall the ghouls must intend to show us something kawaresksenjajok harkabeeparolyn you have shown me spill mountain activity far from the working site you of the ball people have brought me recordings made at one of the spaceports i know more of the rim wall now than i guessed was there to learn soon i must show myself advise me acolyte spoke if others see the probe they will guess at interstellar invaders you should prepare to defend the repair center yes but the probe implies the puppeteer not me i have prepared hindmost louis was thinking he chopped acolyte off pretty hard why is the kit taking it the hindmost didnt speak chmeees son come to me as my student bram has had too long to impress him maybe ive lost a student if id known i wanted the kits respect id have raced him and beat him hah whats my next step bram asked harkabeeparolyn what do you know of protectors she had been a teacher in the floating citys library where kawaresksenjajok had been a student she said i remember pictures of armor collected from tens of thousands of daywalks around us they all looked very different fitted for different species but all had the crested helm and oversized joints fanciful old tales tell of saviors and destroyers fearsome to see with faces like armor big shoulders knobby knees and elbows neither men nor women can fight them or tempt them bram do you want to hear old stories when i know what i must hear i can learn it bram said when i ask what have i forgotten i can only hope for a useful answer louis louis shrugged im still two falans behind the rest of you bram looked at them his hard face permitted little expression the hindmost and city builders watched him anxiously acolyte seemed relaxed perhaps bored bram picked up a chair and moved it to a skeletal structure in an unused corner tubes and metal domes and wires had been fixed to a wooden spine in a manner that seemed not quite useful not quite random there had been too many distractions but now that he came to look at it louis would have placed it as representing some brief ancient fad in sculpture it had that kind of esthetic unity but bram was moving it into place between his knees plucking the strings the hindmost asked did you finish the mozart requiem we shall see record the puppeteer whistled chords of programming music speaking to the fourth webeye louis shrugged his eyebrows at harkabeeparolyn sitting in his lap this nonsense was burning up time they might spend together but the city builder woman whispered listen the protectors fingers were suddenly everywhere and the air exploded with music acolyte strolled out the door and was gone the music was strange and rich and precise the puppeteer was singing accompaniment but bram held the structure of it louis couldnt remember where hed heard anything like it it was human music paced for human nerves no sound shaped by aliens could have done this to his central nervous system he felt a roaring optimism a godlike calm wistful longing the power to conquer worlds or move them the music he knew was shaped in computers not made by toenails softly kicking or stroking stretched surfaces or a bronze plate fingernails strumming wires a lipless mouth blowing into pipes with holes in them it was making him horny as tanj and harkabeeparolyn was half melted in his lap he thought you were right but he wouldnt interrupt even to whisper that in her ear instead he settled back and let the vibrations flood through him and when the sound had finally died away he sat stunned i think we have it bram decided he set the orchestral sculpture aside hindmost thank you louis can you describe the effects stunning i ah no im sorry bram its nonverbal might it be used as a tool of diplomacy louis shook his head tanj if i know bram had you thought of mounting a webeye in fistofgod crater why ah to point it down yeah down out for a view in the plane of the arch fistofgod is a hollow cone the size of a moon well big with a hole in the peak you could mount a sizable fortress in there if you could anchor it in the ringworld floor material the scrith scrith yeah a volume a tenth the size of the repair center and at least as well hidden defend the plane of the arch from inside fistofgod louis hesitated im sure you can do your spying from there defend any enemy is bound to think of hiding in the shadow of the ringworld im not sure you can defend that if you fight from the rim wall its the same problem the meteor defense cant fire through the scrith can it we cannot split our defense i must command the rim wall and its protectors too bram decided well put the refueling probe in place tomorrow louis when did this notion come to you just popped into my head maybe the music distracted me and my brain went on without me did your brain pop up anything else i dont know enough about protectors louis said there was a skeleton in the meteor defense room you didnt let me get close but that was a protector wasnt it i will show you tomorrow after we place the probe the machine people cruiser was an uncontrolled toboggan now running up the side of a green hill veering away hell of a ride the plates bobbing rim gave him glimpses up the higher more distant spill mountain louis saw blinking brilliance above the snow line the empire of the night people was here too chapter twentyfour these bones they flicked from cloudy daylight to the pinkish artificial light of needles lander bay thence to the crew cabin and a webeye view of the rim wall zipping past in vacuumharsh sunlight bram arrived last he set down his orchestral sculpture where louis had dropped his pressure suit components and went straight to the kitchen dispenser get us an update on the probe hindmost how long until we can dock the hindmost spoke orchestral chords equations wrote themselves across the air in interspeak symbols we could begin to decelerate now at two gee and dock in fifteen and a half hours youve told me the probe can take ten gee i prefer a margin of error hindmost the probes drive is a powerful conspicuous xray source well give an enemy minimal time to track it down wait then decelerate at ten gee at high thrust a fusion drive becomes brighter more conspicuous bram said nothing wait aye aye decelerate at ten gee beginning in six hours dock in just more than nine hours may i return to my cabin to eat and bathe and dance and sleep the protector sipped from a squeezebulb the kzins nose wrinkled though louis couldnt smell anything bram said you can do all of that here bram i must enter my cabin when the time comes to decelerate the probe let me go now show me your cabin the hindmost whistlechirped the rim wall faded out and they looked into the hindmosts cabin the light was yellow shading toward orange but the decor was the infinite greens of a cold weather forest there were no corners no edges floor and wall table space and storage space it was all curves bram instructed leave it thus bathe and sleep if you dance dance alone the hindmost snorted like an angry horn section if i see a hologram where i should see the hindmost i must act you want me to feel safe dont you bram stooped with bent knees above the granite block he lifted swung around and set it down oh the hindmost stepped where the granite had been and was on the far side of the bulkhead the contours of the cabin shifted as he moved a bowl formed from the floor and took on shades of peach the puppeteer stepped daintily into it it grew like a flower until it had almost closed above a highsided bathtub much like those used in lunar cities bram must have noted louiss rapt gaze what strikes you louis what struck louis was that the hindmost wasnt going to be much help to louis wu bram had had too much time to intimidate the puppeteer louis said instead i had an insight the hindmosts cabin what does it look like to you a womb perhaps how about the interior of an animal are we playing word games theres a difference it might matter female puppeteers dont have a womb a prey animal evolved into a symbiote so long ago that they think of it as the puppeteer female but it isnt nessus had an ovipositor bram get into the hindmosts records and see if he has a file on digger wasps digger wasps stet bram said we have some nine hours to play with you were going to lecture me about protectors louis asked shall we go look at bones lecture bram said louis complied our ancestor was the pak breeder the pak evolved on a planet near the galactic core say a hundred and thirty thousand falans from here at lightspeed thirty thousand lightyears and a bit some of them tried to set a colony on my planet on earth long ago there wasnt enough thallium to support the virus that grows in the yellow roots and thats what turns a breeder into a protector the protectors died off they may have cleared off some predators first to give the breeders room to expand the immature pak the breeders evolved on their own just like they did here they spread over earth from landing sites in africa and asia speculative we have bones of pak breeders from olduvai gorge and other sites theres a mummified pak protector in the smithsonian louis said they dug it out from under a desert on mars i never saw it myself even at my age you cant do everything but we studied a hologram of the thing in general biology how did you come by that he came to rescue the old colony thats hearsay evidence bram from a belter who ate the yellow roots but the hindmost probably has it in memory ship components brennans tale the dissected mummy chemical let us not disturb the hindmost but you studied this mummy yes let us look at bones the knobby mans hand felt like a handful of marbles and his pull on louiss wrist was irresistible acolyte followed suitless kzinti neednt fear the smell of treeoflife louis found himself walking rapidly toward a skeleton looming in amplified starlight bram brought them facetoface stepped back and said react acolyte circled the skeleton it died in combat he murmured he sniffed then followed his nose to cronuss array of tools and clothing louis ran his fingertips over the eroded edges where bone was broken would bram guess that hed been here before louis said well it looks thousands of falans old near seven thousand bram confirmed beaten to death you i and anne acolyte turned his ears up tell us the tale he challenged you here no we hid our existence how did you find him how did you lure him he had to come we waited the kzin waited but bram didnt speak again so louis said this could almost be a deformed pak protector still the jaws a bone cracker the skull doesnt have much brow ridge the torso i think its too long for a standard issue pak bram i think you have here a carrion eater back came acolyte to see what louis was talking about bram asked on what basis jaw built to crack bones a predator would have teeth to tear open big arteries or an abdomen the long torso gives him a gut long enough to deal with a difficult meal the missing brow ridge well he could be going out only at night or maybe he had bushy eyebrows for eyeshades but acolyte asked might he be a night people protector distort the skull expand the joints louis shook his head i saw a ghoul child at the weaver village i saw adults among the fearless vampire slayers and more adults in the fungus farm under a floating city once upon a time i would swear they were all the same species and this isnt it look the ghouls at the fungus farm were my height and a bit hes four inches shorter no teeth of course but look at the hands ghoul hands are bigger thicker they can tear anything apart more to the point acolyte the current species is identical across two hundred million miles of distance acolyte watched saying nothing it was rare to see a kzin so still but its obvious bram said patiently this is the old one the species that became the people of the night louis said cronus precursor god of the greeks louis was startled and showed it youve been studying tanj thats where he learned the music theyre meddlesome arent they these puppeteers the hindmost has a hundred generations of human literature kzinti oral history kdatlyno touchsculpture sequences even some trinoc vengeance tales from your nineteenth and twentieth centuries ive viewed entertainments based on bram stokers dracula including fred saberhagens and anne rices work but why not reserve the name cronus this individual cant have been the first louis shall i make blurry wordpictures for you eighty thousand falans ago there was a dead pak protector he might have been hundreds of falans old already for all we know he might have helped build the arch call him cronus archaic night people came and ate his flesh if the meat of a protector didnt bring on the change then they found yellow roots the protector carried they became protectors if there were many soon there was one louis slapped the dead protectors clavicle dust puffed bram this is the oldest protector well ever know anything about maybe there were gods before cronus that the greeks didnt know about bram nodded as you will cronus stet cronuss species might have been eating carrion for thousands of years after something like the fistofgod impact must you speak every trivial truth aloud ah you have a student acolyte do you see louiss point in truth i see something acolyte said the numbers are ridiculous unless something was guiding ghouls in one direction across large very large distances one empire ghouls must be the same along the entire two hundred million miles perhaps everywhere on the ring yes it was cronus tending his species like a herder bram doesnt a protector try to preserve his own genetic pattern the kzin jumped on it yes how could cronus guide his own descendants even a good change smells wrong wait what if he chose other similar carrion eaters no they would rule his own breed acolyte was learning how to solve puzzles bram said he was a ghoul a carrion eaters sense of smell is altered by evolution what to approach what to touch what to put in his mouth each is a conscious choice a ghoul may be more free than other protectors he may guide his kind toward what he sees as perfection they looked at the old skeleton he had to come bram had said near seven thousand falans hed said one thousand seven hundred years and if louiss dawning suspicion had any basis in fact hed best not ask directly try something indirect your mate is she still in here anne may be dead when we became aware that the arch is unstable in its plane that there must have been motors on the rim anne went to fix it i was able to track her for a time these others now at work on the rim wall may have killed her bram she would have had to make those other protectors anne felt no such urgency when she left me she would have worked alone these lateblooming protectors might be the work of the recent one the ball people protector teela teela brown your mate bram said the hindmost has records of her too were you here when teela came yes it was more difficult to hide from her than from the hindmost i watched her learn to use the meteor defense i was sure she intended what a protector must she would save the arch from impacting the sun what was her true intent louis teela was a protector i cant read a protectors mind bram asked if not hers then whose you saw the records teela was strange two came into the repair center bram said they ate of the root one died the other fell into the coma that leads to the protector state i had time to hide my presence and set up means to observe her your teela wandered the repair center it was a pleasure to watch her she discovered things i hadnt noticed and ultimately came here she played with the meteor defense and the telescope display then she left i was able to track her a little as she moved to the rim wall she used a magnetic transport system on the rim wall much faster than the system we used but she had an advanced pressure suit timing some extrasolar object impacted the sun twentytwo falans past storms of subatomic particles threw the arch off balance louis teela was in a great hurry twentytwo falans ago the ringworld began sliding off balance about five years before hot needle of inquirys return she was educated on earth louis said with a protectors brain and basic physics classes she must have seen the situation quick enough she went to fix the attitude jet system what would she find anne anne would hide bram said she would watch teela at the first sign of incompetence she would kill teela mmm you knew her as a woman bram nobody knew teela she was a statistical fluke a woman who was lucky every time luck was called for up until nessus drafted her for the ringworld expedition any kind of normal life must have been just out of her reach acolyte said my father speaks of teela sometimes he never knew what to make of her to the puppeteers she was part of a breeding program breeding for luck chmeee believed they succeeded no bram said louis said shes dead bram shes no threat to you but what might a protector leave behind to shape a future she desired we plan far ahead louis have you seen what you needed to see yeah bram flicked in calling hindmost wake but the hindmost was awake and dancing in his cabin dancing with three ghosts three puppeteers too translucent to hide him bram i thought of something cute i made a brief burn an hour ago to put the probe below the rim out of sight of invading ships numbers the hindmost whistled equations wrote rainbow lines bram studied them it was the first time louis had seen him freeze up like that but the equations looked complex far beyond his own abilities then bram said good begin deceleration now the hindmost chirped the racing rim wall opened behind him stet yes stet if it doesnt hide you from me rim wall moving at a blur its edge far above the tops of the spill mountains far below the probe must be about three hundred miles up louis thought the hindmost chirped louis looked for results but he couldnt see wait now nightshadowed the passing rim wall had picked up a blue highlight the reflection of a small fusion drive floating equations told it better some of the numbers were reeling down three ghosts still danced with the hindmost and louis knew them their hairstyles differed but they were all nessus acolyte was gnawing on something that dripped red it was not an appetizing sight but louis was suddenly starved he tapped at the kitchen wall with one eye for the holograms bram asked hindmost what do you know of teela brown the hindmost sang like a bronze bell a third hologram opened behind the hindmost a table of contents as best louis could tell the cabin was crowded with images bram flared in anger come here come here now the hindmost didnt hesitate he stepped and was beside them i intended no harm i prefer you here louis hindmost acolyte im trying to paint a picture of a protector in my mind i have my murky view of cronus and i knew anne intimately but teela brown is an alien protector soon we must face alien protectors hindmost what have you shown me these are records on the lucky human project my administration felt that human allies could do us good humans are lucky we would make them effective by making them luckier the experiment was local to one planet earth we added a lottery to the formal qualifications that earn a birthright we kept track of babies born through luck we financed a social network so that the children might meet and breed was she lucky louis wasnt listening definitely wasnt listening when hed fought free of the ringworld teela had stayed behind by her own choice louis had had forty years to avoid thinking about teela brown she was a sixthgeneration lottery winner but teela was not lucky for puppeteers nor for her associates i cannot think she was lucky for herself any creature seeks homeostasis teela lost her mate then her gender identity and shape then her life but luck is a thing of dubious interpretation acolyte spoke what if she sought a cause worth dying for louis gaped acolyte added or what if she only wanted to be more intelligent like my father like me luck gave her those things bram said louis maybe interesting interpretation forty years and hed never seen what was obvious to this elevenyearold cat anything further louis closed his eyes he could see her touch her a freak accident took her away from us luck when we found her shed found seeker big brawny explorer type a wonderful guide and i guess she was in love with him too was she your mate or his serial polygamy skip it she left you for him not just for seeker bram shed found this this huge toy it never would have occurred to teela that it was beyond her too big to play with that anything was beyond her she wanted to play with the arch without destroying it of course and only a protector can do that louis rubbed his eyes so you left her on the ringworld and then seeker must have led her to the map of mars or told her enough that she could guess the rest she knew going in that she was entering a strange place a place of secrets she lets see she wakes as a protector seekers dead teelas a protector in the repair center she plays around she finds out how to turn the sun into a superthermal laser blasts a few comets she did that she learns how to display telescope views with the meteor defense setup she notices that the ringworld has a wobble to it she finds attitude jets on the rim wall but most of them are gone any protector could predict the results of that she goes to the rim wall bram did she take roots with her roots and a flowering plant and thallium oxide she finds city builder ships built around the rim attitude jets anne may have replaced some of those yeah thats what your anne was doing intercept every city builder ship as it comes back from the stars tear out the bussard ramjets and mount them on the rim its just another thing halrloprillalar never told me she and her crew must have been evicted from their ship sent back through the rim wall by an angry protector bram waited poor tanj prill that could twist a persons mind waited so theres already a few attitude jets back in place but all teela sees is that the ship builders havent stolen them all yet she takes over annes job its urgent she turns some breeders into protectors she told me about those a spill mountain people a vampire a ghoul they all start pulling motors out of returning ships and remounting them they had twenty in place and no more ships in view and the motors didnt have enough power by themselves teela left the other protectors tending the motors she came back to the repair center she must have known what she was going to do next she didnt see hot needle of inquiry coming at her until she was using the repair center telescope again acolyte said she must have had a telescope on the rim louis sure and it must have been good enough to see the big city builder ships coming in needles much smaller would she recognize needle a general products numberthree hull sure bram asked how could needle affect her plans what did i tell you about reading a protectors mind bram but you must try louis didnt want to try heres what teela told me she just couldnt make herself kill a trillion people even to save thirty trillion protector intelligence and teela brown empathy she could feel their deaths she knew it had to be done and she knew wed figure out how me and chmeee and the hindmost and she couldnt let us do it either she was inviting us to kill her bram i watched her fight i could have fought better while dead yeah it was the fight of my life but nobody outfights a protector if she knew she couldnt play a plasma jet along the rim wall why did she return to the repair center silly question bram didnt wait for an answer what did she really want louis shook his head what do protectors want thats one thing we learned about you your motives are hardwired you protect your genetic line when the line dies out you stop eating and die teela didnt have children on the ringworld but there were hominids relatives if you close one eye and squint a little she had to save them why wait with the ringworld sliding off balance bram brushed it away she waited for hot needle of inquiry for puppeteerderived computer programs i watched you use them and was glad i had not interfered oh but why not just say so tanj dammit why the fight wait now bram did anne leave just after you killed cronus she took several days to prepare and that was just under seven thousand falans ago yes around twelve hundred ad my calendar did she take roots and does she have to come back for more anne took roots and a blooming plant and some thalium oxide she planted treeoflife but the crop failed after a time so she came back near five thousand falans ago she stayed with me for not long i havent seen her since either she grew a better garden or shes dead yeah teela had the same idea roots plants thallium oxide if theres a good place to plant all that then annes garden was in it teela would know what it was anne would hide it well you cant hide plants from sunlight she couldnt put it where any passing hominid would sniff it shed want it within her reach on a spill mountain in a place even hotair balloons couldnt invade a fissure a steep valley maybe and now we have to guess whether teela saw it and if she did louis sighed bram what have you got on living protectors hindmost show him i propose to bathe chapter twentyfive default option a hundred miles above the spill mountain tops the probe accelerated the ringworld raced toward and past it like a frozen river bigger than worlds but no longer at miles per second the probe was catching up louis asked the puppeteer are we in view of that comet installation you didnt blast yes its far enough above the ringworld plane but we will have landed before the light reaches the comet acolyte reclined huge and silent chmeee had sent him to learn and he had been learning from bram for these past falans teaching him wisdom would be a neat trick louis thought protectors had intelligence coming out of their ears but wisdom could a kzin see the difference and youve blasted everything else that can see us yes stet show us the rim i cant really show you protectors louis its what bram asked but i cannot magnify so greatly what have you got the hindmost had months falans of observing the rim wall and the spill mountains winking heliographs were everywhere not just on the rim wall several times the probe had caught daylit flashes from one presumed client species on the flatlands a village flashed past and the hindmost froze it for their eyes a thousand houses spreading out from one side of a magnificent waterfall eight to ten thousand feet high on the other side of the falls a dockyard for hot air balloons marked by a cliff splashed with bright orange paint below the dockyard clustered factories and warehouses ran down the ice and rocks to another orange boulder and a lower landing pad come in high or come in low travelers would find refuge the hindmost jumped the view to another village fifty million miles away a spread across a shallow green hillside houses with sloped sod roofs and a vertical row of industrial works with orangemarked landing pads above and below louis said acolyte youve seen a lot more of this than i have what am i likely to miss i cant guess what you might miss louis they have no more problem with garbage disposal than a school of fish they louis laughed widely white teeth showing acolyte waited it out their houses differ but their placement follows a pattern balloons and factories are alike everywhere bram and i surmise that the night people mirrors can relay designs maps weather alerts perhaps written music a trade in ideas trade between stars is like that the rim wall was a continuous sheet of scrith of ringworld floor material as strong as the force that held an atomic nucleus together even that force wasnt as strong as a meteoroid moving at ringworld speed and louis noted a punch hole high up on the rim wall a few million miles antispin from the other great ocean otherwise the great empty mountings stood three million miles apart along a featureless rim and a slender thread ran along the top for a third of its length theyd seen that eleven years ago a maglev track never finished twentythree of the mounts now held motors at highest magnification the tiny pairs of toroids were just visible here is what they look like firing the puppeteer jumped the view fastforward the change was not great hydrogen fusion radiates mostly x rays a fusion motor radiates visible light because it is hot or because working mass has been added to increase thrust when a rim wall motor was firing the wire outline glowed whitehot and flexed against the plasmas magnetic fields the toroids were the waspwaist constriction in an hourglass of whitehot wire and an indigo ghost flame ran down the axis twentytwo of those in a row the hindmost displayed successive views of work around the twentythird motor there were cranes and cables big enough to see and flatbed things that might be used for magnetic levitation but not a hope of seeing anything mansized and all louis could think of was his need to talk where bram couldnt hear the protector was using the bath setup in the crew cabin no doubt that equipment had kept chmeee and louis sane and harkabeeparolyn and kawaresksenjajok too still it was cramped and complicated and primitive they could hear the whisper of spray through the wall louis said testing given he bathes at all im surprised he didnt use your cabin louis i wish now that i could show you my cabin the dedicated stepping disk is hardwired it cannot move an alien the kzin rumbled you value your privacy greatly you know better i want company the hindmost said louis or even you if i cannot surround myself with my kind we follow our fears i followed my fear when i shaped this ship you persuaded bram of that i hope so its true the probe was an hour short of matching the ringworlds spin louis said were going to have to use pressure suits lets do something about them i keep my own wellmaintained the puppeteer said stet send me and acolyte to the lander bay i should come the hindmost said theres other equipment i should see to they flicked out we cannot be heard here the hindmost assured them acolyte snorted louis said suppose a protectorlevel intelligence really wanted to hear us no louis i intended to spy on you and chmeee and harkabeeparolyn hadnt made the cut i made this my listening post no entity could add a spy device in the lander bay without signaling me maybe hindmost arent you safe when youre in your own cabin bram has a way to attack me there can you block it i havent worked out what he has a good bluff brams had a long time to work on you he has you terrified the hindmosts gaze converged on louis binocular vision with a baseline of three feet you have never understood us the hidden protector frightened me from the first i remain frightened however you plan to circumvent bram i may accept the risk or reject it but only on the odds i do not turn my mind from danger i dont expect to break my contract excellent there were pressure suits and air racks designed for humans he and bram would need two of everything louis checked pressure zips on the suits and the racks he emptied waste recycler reservoirs and filled nutrient reservoirs flushed the interiors of the suits and the air and water tanks topped off the air charged the batteries acolyte was tending his own suit the hindmost was inspecting a stack of stepping disks louis said i know why teela brown died the hindmost said protectors die fairly easily when they no longer feel needed louis shook his head she found something maybe it was annes garden maybe just fingerprints on the rim wall motors whatever she knew there was a protector in the repair center she had to get needle into the map of mars but when she did that she made us hostages the only way to make us safe was to die but louis we dont have time what do you want of us i want to change the stepping disk pattern without bram knowing then i may want to change it back im not sure im right yet i need a default option the kzin asked default option the hindmost answered decide in advance what you will do if you dont have time to decide like the first move you learn in fighting with a kzin dagger a wtsai louis said if youre attacked too fast to think theres your training the disembowel whatever i just knew there must be one epees and handguns and handtohand and yogatsu it doesnt matter you train the moves into your reflex arcs so you dont have to make up something while youre being attacked likewise you instruct a computer on what to do if you dont tell it what to do clever notion said the kzin hindmost i dont quite understand your stepping disk network they discussed it the system wanted to know that you really meant the change youd whistled or typed in push the edge of the disk down stet now i can do this and you cannot notice we have deniability acolyte ill need a distraction see if you can describe it acolyte said i havent the faintest bloody idea i only need it for about two breaths as they flicked through to the cabin the hindmost was saying louis are you aware that you were dying louis smiled faintly tradition says that everyone is dying exceptions may be made for puppeteers and protectors hello bram any change bram was in a rage hindmost amplify the light and zoom the village the probe was moving through shadow but much closer than the distant oncoming band of daylight was a glimpse of pattern crusting the dim snowcolors of a passing spill mountain the hindmost sang flute and strings the pattern brightened and began to expand the spill mountain village looked like a great blotchy cross seen from almost overhead houses were white of a different shade from the snowfields sloped roofs under a snow blanket strung out along ledges on a background of naked rock and snow laced with dark paths sparsely patterned along twenty miles and more factories and warehouses crossed that band vertically much more closely clustered running from six to ten thousand feet high at top and bottom were angular blobs of bright orange and bits of other colors too brams temper was under tight control you were needed i feared the probe would pass before you returned can you see why that might be a concern not yes then louis saw too three bright silver squares three of the oversized cargo plates one was bare one was loaded with cargo hard to see for what it was the third a brown square with a bright rim the machine people cruiser still riding its cargo plate it was tethered at the upper dock next to a naked rock cliff painted bright orange and two patches of yellow and orange and cobalt blue deflated balloons that was a quick ride louis said daylight swept upon them at miles per second the view flashed bright then dimmed to truer colors acolyte reminded them they have their own webeye the hindmost popped up a window next to the probes four now they were now seeing through the bow of the cruiser here were red herders muffled in lovely furs striped gray and white louis only glimpsed red hands in long loose sleeves flat noses and dark eyes deep within hoods but who else could they be the fearless vampire slayers several larger furry shapes must be spill mountain people their hands were broad with thick stubby fingers glimpses of faces inside hoods were silvergray like the hands they panted out puffs of frost as they worked red hands and brown hands gripped the fuzzy edges of the window and the view wobbled the hindmost said the probe will be well past before we can slow shall i bring it back for another view bram said why we have our view hindmost were closing on the near end of the rim wall transport rail and possible witnesses take the probe over the rim when you can aye aye twelve minutes the probe was in full daylight now leaving the village far aft the dismounted webeye was in jerky motion carried along footholds and handholds chopped in stone windows overlaid on windows bram asked where have you been louis answered the time to check a pressure suit yes report is before youre breathing vacuum you used a checklist i use my mind and your first mistake will be memorable report i cant speak for a puppeteers suit ours will keep us alive for two falans we refilled and recharged everything fillable and chargeable the hindmost still has six stepping disks not in use and we can recycle some of what were using now we can put webeyes anywhere there arent any weapons in the lander bay i assume youve stored them somewhere you decide what you want us to be carrying we couldnt think of anything else to check bram said nothing hidden patriarchs crows nest showed no change and the hindmost whistlebonged that window off the refueling probe ran along a rim wall touched with violet the next window over rolled wobbling along a path that had become more than a rock climb downhill toward rectangular patches of snow the hindmost said you were dying did you see never mind louis said show me that medical report the puppeteer chimed louis wus medical record partly blocked both windows there its in interspeak chemical major restructure diverticulosis tanj you can get used to what age does to you hindmost old people used to say if you can wake up in the morning with nothing hurting anywhere its a sign that you have died in the night not funny but even an idiot might guess somethings wrong when he starts pissing gas with his urine i would have thought it rude to observe you at such a time i am much relieved even so would you have noticed louis read further diverticulosis thats little blowout patches on your colon my colon diverticuli can hurt you lots of ways mine seems to have extended far enough to attach itself to my bladder then it got infected and blew through that left a tube connecting my colon and my bladder a fistula what did you think i had the medkit it was giving me antibiotics for a couple of days i hoped well bacteria can get into a human bladder and make gas but antibiotics would have cleared that up so i knew i needed a plumber acolyte didnt usually stare directly into anyones eyes but he did now his ears were folded out of sight you were dying dying when you refused the hindmosts offers yes hindmost if youd known would you have accepted my contract not a serious question louis im expressing admiration you are a scary negotiator thank you bram said please restore our view from the probe thank you in six minutes well move up the rim wall and cross to the outside i trust we wont lose the signal hindmost scrith stops a percentage of neutrinos implied is some kind of nuclear reaction ongoing in the ringworld floor but the signal will dwindle predictably and i can compensate bram said good is my suit in order its my spare after all louis said take whichever suit feels lucky to you ill take the other the probe was slowing slowing now now chapter twentysix the dockyard high point ad the cruiser and its cargo plate rose through the night warvia and tegger clung to each other in the payload shell fear of heights was a terrible thing they both shrieked when they felt the bump then laughed because they were still alive leaving the protection of the payload shell was an ordeal they gasped and shivered in the thin cold air the sun was just peeping around a shadow square the ghouls blinked in the growing daylight and crawled into the payload shell to sleep harpster had brought them down at the higher of two orangesplashed cliffs alongside another floating plate and three baskets attached to collapsed balloons the village was stirring downslope and to the sides furred shapes moved out from snowroofed houses to forage in the tilted lands beyond even to a nomad like tegger this wasnt a large village then again it was nearly invisible the roofs were rectangles of snow on a snowfield you picked them out by their shadows five locals were trudging uphill to meet the visitors from below a raptorbeaked bird circled about them the red herders watched them come but they couldnt see anything inside their furs they carried water bags and more furs the water was heated it tasted wonderful warvia and tegger struggled into furs in frantic haste pulling them closed until only their noses showed that and their gasping seemed to amuse the spill mountain people na na its lovely day saron sang in a nearly impenetrable accent you walk in blizzard teach you respect mountain they walked around the wood and iron cruiser paying no attention to the floating plate it rode on the five spill mountain people looked like barrels sheathed in layers of white andgraystriped fur sarons fur was different striped white and greenishbrown with a hood that had been some ferocious creatures head her rank must be distinctive tegger thought and decided that saron was a woman she was the smallest of the five her voice gave no clue and her furs hid all details saron was studying the bronze spinnerweb and its stone backing she asked is this the eye warvia said yes saron we dont know what to do next we were told night people would come where are they sleeping it isnt night yet saron laughed my mother told me it was only a way of speaking they come out at night the reds nodded the bird hovered above them riding the wind then suddenly dropped far downslope it struck talons first and rose with something struggling in its beak deb asked what must the eye see tegger and warvia had no idea this must have been obvious and deb answered herself the mirror and the passage take the eye with us does it talk no how do you know it sees ask harpster and grieving tube warvia said im going to cover them they could freeze to death up here good jennawil said and they carried furs into the payload shell harreed and barraye were at work dismounting the bronze web and its backing tegger had decided they were men though they peered out of their hoods in frank astonishment at the red herders they were silent it seemed the women did all the talking tegger tried to help them as he scuttled sideways carrying one edge of the stonebacked web he found himself gasping suffocating deb and jennawil moved in to help tegger got out of their way fighting for breath youre feeble saron decided tegger tried to quiet his gasping we can walk your lungs dont find enough air you will be stronger tomorrow today you must rest the four picked up the web and began to climb angling downhill toward the snowroofed houses saron walked ahead to point out footholds to warvia and tegger ready to steady them if they slipped the bird dropped onto the leather pad that crossed debs shoulders deb staggered and swore at it in some alien language and it rose again spill mountain people seemed incredibly surefooted tegger and warvia walked with their arms around each other trying to stay upright theyd been in motion too long the mountain seemed to sway beneath them the wind searched out every tiniest gap in their furs tegger peeped out of his hood through slitted eyes blinking away tears he had some of his breath back he asked deb that was your own tongue yes how did you learn the trade speech debs vowels and consonants were distorted he had to catch the sense above the shrilling of the wind night people say tell you everything but you you tell the flatland vishnishtee nothing keep our secrets yes tegger didnt know the word but warvia caught it she told him vashnesht enunciating it properly and told the others yes vashnesht protectors keep secrets from the protectors from below the spill mountains yes said tegger deb said teela came from below from the flats a strange person all knobs could not resh you understand reshtra could not nothing there she let us look she taught us to speak we knew the speech of the mirrors but we spoke it wrong teela taught us then told us teach the people who ride the balloons then she went through the passage came back seventy falans later no change in her we thought she was a vishnishtee but now we knew they were passing houses now rectilinear houses made of wood that must have been imported from the forest below theyd picked up an entourage of curious children eyes peeking out from fur hoods and chattering that came in puffs of fog warvia was trying to answer them tegger asked may we speak to this teela teela went below again since forty falans or more deb said more saron said flatly jennawil asked what do you know of reshtra tegger looked at warvia warvia temporized how can you know of rishathra do you have other visitors from below the locals laughed even the men deb said not from below but from sideways folk visit from nearby mountains but theyre all spill mountain people arent they wairbeea the people of the mountains are not all one kind we are high point saron here a door tegger eased warvia in ahead of him the bird settled on debs shoulder as she entered this narrow space was not the house proper only a tiny anteroom supported by wooden beams and lines with hooks for furs doors at the far end opened opposite each other now the furs started to come off the two species stared at one another fiercely curious high point people were broad through the torso broad across the face with wide mouths and deepset eyes their hair and on the men beards were curly and dark beneath their furs was cloth enclosing their torsos to the elbows and knees and below the cuffs a good deal of curly hair deb was a strong woman in middle age the bird skreepu belonged to deb so did the identicallooking young men harreed and barraye they were her sons jennawil was a young woman mated to barraye and saron was a woman deep of voice old and deeply wrinkled something about her jaw her hands warvia asked are you of high point no from two peaks a balloon carried us to high point far past short one where we wanted to visit the wind blows wrong here we could not return the rest flew on exploring but i found my man makray persuasive he cannot have more children i have had mine why not while deb removed her fur and hung it skreepu clung to the leather patch when saron led the rest into the main house the great bird lifted and followed them the ceiling was high furniture was minimal there was a high perch for the bird two low tables no chairs this was half of the visitors house divided from the other half by the long anteroom tegger wondered if he would meet whatever visitors were living on the other side the men propped the bronze web against the wall then the high pointers settled crosslegged in a circle that left space for their visitors this is your place the visitors house saron said it is warm enough for most who come but you may want to sleep in fur jennawil waved about her we are high point next spinward call themselves eagle folk noses like beaks theyre smaller than we are and not as strong but their balloons are best we have seen and they sell balloons to other folk we can get children with them but so rarely that we resh with little risk to antispin are ice people they live higher and the cold hurts them less mazarestch got a boy by an ice people man the way she tells it their exertion moved mountain the boy jarth can forage higher than any of his peers visitors come from far spin and antispin we welcome them all and resh with them too but we get no children together they tell us it is the same for them reshtra is for different kinds mating is between two of a kind folk of near mountains can mate those from too far cannot teela told us that our foreparents must have traveled from mountain to mountain changing as we went and you warvia was laughing too hard to speak less amused than embarrassed tegger thought he tried to put an answer together on the flat land travel is easy we have all species mixed we see every possible way of rishathra we red herders travel with the animals we tend for all of our lives we cannot rish we only mate once he could not tell how they were reacting to that their faces were too unfamiliar he said but some kinds rish for pleasure some for trade contracts or to end a war or to postpone a child we hear of weed gatherers near mindless who rish very nicely convenient for ones who wont take the time to to court water people will rish with anyone who can hold his or her breath for long enough but few there are water people live under liquid water barraye i guess you dont have many of those laughter jennawil asked warvia you dont rish but only you listen what else is there for my kind when visitors come but youll want to speak to the night people when they wake tegger saw jennawil trying to keep a straight face please understand saron said we have only resh with species from near mountains spill mountain species all of us all very like each other even if we cannot get children you she searched for words and found none a bit strange very queer demons from below before the silence could grow yet less comfortable warvia said we hear that protectors can pierce any secret how can you hope to hide anything from flatland vishnishtee deb said saron explained vishnishtee are a danger teela told us so the night people tell us and the legends tell us too but the passage belongs to high point the passage is of interest to vishnishtee the passage pierces the rim wall they can go out of the world through the passage if they wear their balloon suits and helms with windows the night people dont like to draw attention from vishnishtee you have protectors here it seemed clear that saron was speaking for the bronze web as well as tegger and warvia three flatland vishnishtee rule the passage more they have taken some of us away older ones and some of those come back to us as vishnishtee when the death light shone the flatland vishnishtee showed us how to hide sod or rock is enough to stop the light that shines through fur and flesh but better was to hide in the passage itself makray was hunting when the death light shone saron said half a day from shelter and no vishnishtee to tell him he wanted it deb said many of us went to hunt or were caught out one of every three died odd and feeble children were born after all the mountains about tell the same tale and only we and the mountains nearby had vishnishtee to give warning flatland vishnishtee are not wholly evil tegger asked death light but none of the high pointers chose to hear and tegger didnt ask again saron said high point vishnishtee serve the flatland vishnishtee to keep us safe but they will not tell the flatland vishnishtee where we have the mirror and those will not learn of themselves they are good at knowing secrets but the mountains are not theirs warvia sighed the night people will be very glad of your answers weve traveled vastly to find them no doubt theyll have better questions and louis wu deb said or is he only a tale where did you hear it from message mirrors and from teela tegger said louis wu boiled an ocean the city builder halrloprillalar traded and rished with him louis wu is real but is he on the other side of that spinnerweb deb i need sleep warvia said yes jennawil expressed the others surprise it is the middle of the day we worked through the night breathing is labor warvia said let them sleep now saron ordered we go teegr wairbeea will you wake when the night people do tegger could hardly keep his thoughts together or his eyes apart we may hope food behind that door flup we forgot what do you eat freshly killed meat warvia said behind those little doors no never mind skreepu will find you something sleep well the high point people filed out they had to look behind the little doors and that let half the heat out of the house opening the little doors revealed food visitor food plants and old meat not red herder food and snowscape seen through wooden slats bars to keep away predators and the great outside to keep food cold warvia and tegger curled together fur beneath them fur above theyd set their clothes aside to air they were warm enough but tegger could feel the cold at his nose he could hear knocking behind the wall as the high pointers donned their furs he was near sleep when warvia said whisper would have better questions he said whisper was only my madness mine too whisper taught me things what warvia whispered in his ear she was with us on the air sled beneath the cruiser she taught me about speed so that our speed would not drive me mad she keeps herself a secret tegger i dont want the web to hear us theyd propped the web upright against a wall tegger looked at the web propped against a wall with a view of the whole room and laughed if the web is no more than a slice of stone we will all seem great fools what does whisper look like i never saw perhaps a wayspirit with no body at all what did she teach no dont tell me now we should sleep why did you say we cannot rish was it the way they look no theyre no stranger than sand people my mind saw me in jennawils arms gasping like a beached fish warvia laughed deliciously against his ear then i remembered that they talk with talk for the ghoul empire we would be famous did you want to settle somewhere someday where no red herder has heard of red herders who rish with every species under the arch we never did that tales grow in the telling they are mighty tellers the ghoul empire and these spill mountain people speak their words for them and you and i destroyed the biggest nest of vampires beneath the arch yes you were thinking they are new to this they have only rished with peoples very like them love would you like to teach rishathra if only once they slept chapter twentyseven lovecraft the probe tilted over and rose at ten gravities straight up closing on the rim wall the blue highlight converged then went out the probe coasted rising the ringworlds edge was narrow the probe rose a few hundred feet higher and arced over a puff of fusion flame hatted its fall and set it drifting toward the shadowed back of a black wall that seemed to reach to the heavens it slowed hovered the probe spat a window popped up to overlay the others it showed the probe hovering on indigo flame then the probe dropped away and it showed only starlight the hindmost said i give you a webeye window beyond the rim wall we need a view from the underside get us that bram commanded aye aye but the hindmost was doing nothing hindmost the probe already has my instructions motors off rotate i want a view the probe was turning as it fell the view turned black rim wall sunglare starscape a silver thread was shining against the starspattered black below the falling probe that louis said see it you need a burn or well hit it burn aye aye a burst of woodwinds then what is it not a spaceport ledge its too narrow they waited through the lightspeed delay the silver thread was growing larger clearer now it seemed banded like a silver earthworm eleven minutes the probes spin stopped window displays tremored the probe was thrusting flaring in xray light nova light blasted through the hologram window louis with his arms thrown over his eyes heard music from hell then a voice that had lost all human traits my fuel source is destroyed brams voice was cool my concern is for the enemy that fired on us we are challenged arm me and send me through a bestial bellow all madness acolytes idea of a distraction or are we locked in with a mad kzin let me through to my cabin the hindmost pleaded i must see what is still working what could be working your probe is destroyed and we are attacked we are known could an invader react so quickly or was that a protector the stepping disk at least should be safe louis opened his eyes why im not a fool the hindmost bleated i opened a stepping disk link as we crossed the rim a plasma blast kinetic weapons any threat should go straight through straight through to what louis blinked he was still seeing spots i linked it to the stepping disk at the map of mons olympus louis laughed it was probably too much to hope for that a thousand martians were setting a new trap when the stepping disk sprayed starhot plasma over them but heyyy big claws closed on his shoulders warm red meat breathed in his face we are at war louis wu this is not a time for distractions distractions stet acolyte go suit up get my suit and a webeye sprayer too and my cargo disk stack wherever bram bram dining hall aboard hidden patriarch bram said hindmost route him there first bram get him some weapons if we have a working stepping disk on the probe we should use it bram said go the hindmost rattled chimed bonged acolyte stepped and flicked out the hindmost stepped where the granite block had been and was gone was in his cabin his tongues licking out at what looked like an alien chess set but must be a virtual keyboard one head rose to say we have a link the stepping disk still operates try the webeye sprayer bram ordered spray what vacuum eleven minutes later the blackedout window lit again a revolving starscape with a slow ripple to it louis could picture a webeye falling free through vacuum spinning a little was the probe spinning too drifting gradually away from the probe and while the protector was worrying about the kzin and trying to watch the puppeteer and all four hologram windows louis knelt above the stepping disk and lifted the edge a tiny hologram of glowing sticks rose just above the disk itself the map of the stepping disk system a larger display would have given him away but the hindmost had fixed that louis tapped his changes in quickly and pushed the rim down do you see hindmost explain to see me how we could have missed that until now bram and the hindmost sure as tanj werent watching him louis turned as viewed through the freefalling webeye the silver thread had become a silver ribbon with raised edges a shallow trough not unlike a miniature of the ringworld itself slender toroids arced over it unmistakably it was the transport system the magnetic levitation track that ran along the top of the rim wall for a third of its length teelas repair crew must have led it over the rim wall and down the outside louis said well i havent been watching the rim wall for a good half year we should have looked closer the hindmost said the silver rail swept past now there was only starscape the fluttering webeye was below the ringworld floor falling into the universe louis said i might have guessed you too bram what else would teelas crew use to move their reclaimed ramjets the terminus is far to spinward perhaps on a spaceport ledge were in the wrong place to be looking for a factory stacked cargo plates flicked in with pressure gear and a webeye sprayer added to louiss clutter louis shouldered the floating mass aside to leave room for acolyte the kzin flicked in wearing full pressure gear concentric clear balloons and a fishbowl helmet he tipped back the helmet and asked are we ready louis gestured at a rippling starscape you dont want to flick into that unexpectedly the hindmost said the link is still open and has stopped moving louis said what bram snapped sprayed with plasma flame dropped for a thousand miles and it still works improbable louis took the webeye sprayer off the stacked cargo plates try it heads turned they didnt get it louis said hindmost i want to spray a webeye through the stepping disk link set me up well just see what it hits the hindmost whistled try he said louis sprayed a bronze net at the stepping disk and saw it vanish they waited acolyte used the time to take a shower thirtyfive degrees of ringworld arc five and a half minutes in transit and the same again before theyd see it arrive transfer booths didnt work faster than lightspeed and neither it seemed did stepping disks signal the hindmost said as his other tongue licked out a fifth window popped up they looked up at stars crossed by the rim wall a fuzzy bulk at the edge might be the probe a lousy view but the probe wasnt falling it had landed on a tiny target the maglev track bram said acolyte take the sprayer go through spray us a camera where we might see something interesting return instantly and report dont wait for danger we know its there too fast louis was just beginning to pull his suit on acolyte would be gone before he was ready he said hold it bram hes got to be armed against protectors already on site i prefer acolyte to be conspicuously unarmed acolyte go the kzin flicked out louis finished getting into his suit theyd have eleven minutes to wait did chmeee really think an old man like him louis wondered could restrain and protect an elevenyearold kzin male it had been four minutes and something was in view they watched a dark blur moving around the blurred edges of the window inspecting the probe at its leisure then suddenly it was clear and close an elegant alien pressure suit with a bubble helmet and a neartriangular face with a mouth that seemed to be all bone a single fingertip came closer yet and traced curves louis couldnt see it had found the webeye it snapped around quicksilverfast and still wasnt quick enough something fast and black brushed across it and leapt away out of range gone the elegant intruders suit was slashed wide along the left side it lifted a weapon like an oldfashioned chemical rocket motor violetwhite flame lashed after the attacker it must have missed the elegant one bounded after holding its suit almost closed with one hand firing with the other a ghosttrail of ice crystals followed it bram said that was anne which anne was the killer louis theyre both vampire protectors but i remember how anne moves how do we warn acolyte we cannot louis caught himself grinding his teeth acolyte was nowhere a signal a point an energy quantum moving at lightspeed toward where one protector had killed another and was ready for more your teela was too trusting bram said she made a vampire into a protector and that one must have changed others of his species before teela killed him but anne and i are of another species than theirs signal the hindmost said as his other tongue licked out now they had two windows placed on the maglev transport track acolyte had arrived had sprayed a webeye on louis couldnt tell on something above his head there was no sign of another intruder the kzin posed with the probe just behind him it looked half melted and somewhat battered and it was blocking the track any protector would have to remove that blockage acolyte get out the track receded into infinity it looked to be around two hundred feet across and geometrically straight acolyte was turning slowly taking it all in he sprayed another webeye then stepped back to the probe and was gone the hindmost said he flicked out well where is he do you assume i want fusion plasma spraying through my cabin wheres the link where did you flick him the hindmost didnt answer and louis knew mons olympus you freemother he lunged toward the stepping disk stopped himself and scrambled onto the stack of cargo plates instead he led a line through the handholds then around his tool belt a poor mans crash web chmeee will have my ears and guts he set the cargo plates aloft and eased them onto the stepping disk flick and the sky was half stars half black silver fractal filigree under his feet and stars showing through that marvelous he looked up and down the maglev track it was peaceful as hell nothing moved at all silver lace where had he seen this kind of fractal pattern hed expected the maglev track to be a solid trough but you could see stars through the mesh hah it was the pinwheel the old orbital tether they still used to transfer bulk cargos between earth and the moon and belt the fractal distributed the stresses better but never mind that bram hindmost the maglev track is lacework can you see it if i had the sprayer id put a webeye on it right now look through the lace and see whatever tries to hide in the ringworlds shadow theyd hear that in five and a half minutes hot needle of inquiry was that far away at lightspeed an ink blot pulled itself over the edge and walked toward louis a bulk like a sack of potatoes painted black with a flared bell held negligently in one hand louis touched the lift throttle the cargo plates didnt move there was a maglev track under him but it wasnt giving him enough lift im looking at an arm weapon louis said theyd hear him and know the rest arms must have landed on a spaceport ledge and found protectors there how do you activate stepping disks when you cant step off first ill be dead when they hear all this should have brought an orchestra or a recording of the command the protectorkiller examined louis wu with a proprietary air it anne she was a slender shape in an inflated suit designed for something a little taller recessed eyes peeped over the chin readouts and much wider flick he was upside down and falling through red light it was red rock all around him and below his head and hundreds of feet of smooth lava running down down the cargo plates surged upward and louis hung headdown over red rocks he could feel the ropes slipping in the moment before the plates inherent stability turned him upright louiss brain and belly and inner ears were whirling moments passed before his eyes could focus no martians were there to watch he was hovering alongside a glassysmooth stretch of lava that dropped almost straight for futz a thousand feet before it eased toward horizontal like a ski jump louis could see a splash of orange at the bottom acolyte in his translucent suit he might even have survived such a fall or not louis decided he neednt fear martians this time the martians had mounted their stepping disk upside down at the top of the highest cliff they could find then the flame that destroyed the hindmosts refueling probe had flooded through the stepping disk any martians watching the trap must have been crisped the cliff side had melted and flowed forming a slide louis landed the cargo plates loosed the lines and jumped down acolyte by at an angle on hot red rock louis got a shoulder under the kzin not enough and he pulled to roll the kzin over him acolyte was an inert mass louis could feel broken ribs shifting he could have used martian gravity about now he tightened his abdominal muscles knees and back grunt and lift lift a nearly grown male kzin pressure suit and all rose just high enough to roll onto the cargo plate louis crawled aboard tied the kzin down took the cargo plates up he used the little thruster to put him just under the stepping disk lifted until his shoulders touched flick they were upside down in needle with the cargo plates on top of them bram did the rest rolled the cargo plates off opened all the sealstrips that held the kzins suit together and pulled him out the kzins eyes blinked focused found louis otherwise he seemed unable to move bram eased louis out of his suit stretched him out next to acolyte and examined him that hurt youve torn some muscles and tendons he said you need the doc but the kzin needs it more he goes first louis said if acolyte died what would he say to chmeee bram lifted the kzin with no apparent effort rolled him into the doc and closed it an odd notion had bram been waiting for permission not so odd louis was starting to hurt in earnest now and it wouldnt do to let bram know louis was a hominid and acolyte wasnt and a protector might need a breeders permission to heal an alien first bram picked him up and set him on the cargo plates in one smooth motion pain flashed through him blocking his breath turning his scream to a squeak bram hooked up leads and tubes from teelas portable doc he said many of the reservoirs here need filling hindmost can your larger doc make medicines the kitchen has a pharmacy menu the port and starboard walls glowed with orange heat in another window he saw a black baggy shape roll over the rim of the maglev rail then nothing only a silver path receding to infinity the pain was receding louis knew he wouldnt be lucid much longer he felt lean and knobby arms around him hard fingertips probed him here and there a rib felt distant pain then eased his back cracked and again lower down and a hip joint and his right knee bram spoke near his ear but not to louis the night people went to some effort to show us a spill mountain village one out of tens of thousands why the hindmost replied didnt you see the way and louis was asleep chapter twentyeight the passage feel that yes said warvia the room was trembling a tiny vibration in all the walls and the rock below riding weird vehicles had left them dizzy and disoriented but theyd had hours to sleep that off this was something else tegger hadnt noticed at first now warvias breathing and the endless tremor were the only sensations in the dark room any idea seabottom mulch its pounding on the peak and we feel it all the way down here tegger stared at her in the dark pipes pump it up the back of the rim wall it falls fifty daywalks from the edge of the rim warvia said it falls on all the spill mountains its what makes the spill mountains without the pumps all the soil beneath the arch would end up in the seas whisper told me all about it you got more out of whisper than i ever did i wonder where she is now she fingers caressed his jaw im guessing i asked but she wouldnt say do you know what that seabottom muck is called what flup tegger bellylaughed what you mean all this time flup everyone i know thinks he knows what flup means seabottom this mountain is made of it pressure turns it into rock white light flooded them a voice said hello they leapt to their feet wrapping fur around them the high point people had left them a fur like sarons relic of a greenspotted sloth with a damaged head on warvia it looked quite lovely warvia had other concerns she whispered that was no high point accent hello you hear the voice of louis wu may we talk tegger blinked against the painful light details werent there but he could pick out a mans shape and something stranger you have invaded our privacy he said you were not sleeping ours is the spy device you carried for so long will you speak or shall we come another time something rapped on the wood beside the skin door a womans voice called teegr wairbeea flup come in tegger ordered through the skins came jennawil and barraye and a smell of blood we hear voices the young woman said else we would have left this in the anteroom its a gwill skreepu killed it for you the gwill was a big lizard its tail still twitched your timing is good tegger said he hefted the gwill its skin felt armored it would have to be skinned to the glare in the web and the monsters within he said you speak to jennawil and barraye of the high point people they know what we only guess jennawil barraye we meet louis wu at last dozing with his chin on the portable doc louis heard himself speaking you hear the voice of louis wu you see my associates bram and the web dweller we have kept silence because we have enemies we are warvia and tegger a highpitched alien voice said louiss eyes were open now and he recognized the redskinned vampire slayers why do you break silence now we must ask questions that was the voice of louis wu all right but it was coming from the hindmost a high point man said we are to show you the hidden mirror and the passage through the rim and anything else you desire thank you are you prepared to go through the passage jennawil jumped in shock no there are vishnishtee louiss translator hesitated an instant protectors moving constantly through the passage louis decided not to speak he was feeling mellow and foolish and pain lurked if he wanted to feel it he wouldnt make sense and what would they make of two voices of louis wu the hindmost said tell us what you know about protectors of two kinds they are protectors of our own kind would keep us safe but they obey flatland protectors may we speak to a high point protector i think not keeping secrets from flatland protectors is near impossible and protectors are conspicuous i can ask the puppeteer asked will whisper speak to us huh the red herders looked at each other the woman said firmly whisper will not what can you tell us of whisper nothing what ties beyond the passage barraye said poison we think jennawil explained protectors wear suits that cover every part of them when they go through the passage they carry a great bulk of tools back and forth rumors say they are building something out there something monstrous the red woman said louis wu it was the massed might of the night people that moved the eye here come night you may speak to them how long until night jennawil said two tenths the voice of louis wu said we wait and sang like a bass string quartet bram asked did you hear louis some of it good act hindmost but you need better makeup louis wu is vashnesht wizard he remains out of sight the hindmost said while his weird servitors speak for him stet whos whisper anne is whisper bram said ive seen your tapes of whisper guiding the red man she used the cruisers mission for concealment whisper fits her louis said the hindmost turned from the window louis what do you think where is whisper will she interfere louis was watching the people in the window there wasnt quite enough anesthetic in him to knock him out bram youre the only one who might guess what she wants yes im too groggy to think i think i want my voice back as you will said the hindmost warvia stripped the gwill with a knife tegger said red herders have to eat meat freshly killed watching may distress you warvia tore the gwill apart and gave part to tegger they ate the high point couple seemed fascinated and appalled tegger wondered why they were still here now that the window was only a bronze web again bones only tegger looked the question barraye pointed to a receptacle jennawil said tegger wairbeea we noted that you did not speak of reshtra until you saw what was under our furs ah our people mate once for life warvia said and looked at her mate something passed between them and she added a thing happened to us to change us but we dont need rishathra what changed was only that we have a choice tegger had thought it through barraye jennawil there are no tales of red herders who rish what if your talking mirrors spread that tale all across the flatlands where could we live who would mate to our children the high pointers looked at each other you saw the night people jennawil warvia said what if it is told that you rished with redskinned visitors from below what will the night people expect barraye nodded they would think to resh with us how curious are we my mate she was whacking his massive shoulder lightly and openhanded and laughing tegger suspected that was a no not their shape alone their smell barraye patted her rump reassuringly well then must keep yet another secret fun stuff louis watched in passive prurience a show like this would be a success he thought on pay channels on every world in known space and of course it was being recorded for that matter how many senses did the webeyes record not just sight and sound smell radar for a kinesthetic sense somewhere in there he fell asleep hours later it seemed he woke and stared in astonishment at himself looming above him no at his pressure suit angular like fractured bones where a human would be smooth bram tipped the helmet back and asked are you well im pretty sore the medkit was dripping stuff into him but he could feel where the pain was waiting two ribs were out of place i set them no bones are broken youve abused muscles torn ligaments and mesenteries slipped a spinal disk that i reset you would heal with no more than your own defenses and the portable medkit why are you wearing my suit reasons of strategy too complex for my tiny mind all right bram youll notice that we have more visitors if youll disconnect me the voice of louis wu can show a face the hindmost and bram waited to either side of louis and a little behind on the other side of the webeye window the reds huddled under a fur letting the ghouls take center stage the ghouls were shivering the lanky woman said its cold out there well i am grieving tube this is harpster is your box making sense of my voice yes its fine how did you know about my translator your companion tunesmith seems to have departed but his son kazarp spoke of your visit to weaver town my regards to kazarp grieving tube why did you move two manweight of poured stone over such a distance if you could have spoken to me through tunesmith the ghouls laughed showing way too much teeth spoken yes but what would we say the rim wall is in the wrong hands we dont know that you are you a vashnesht protector the translator said bram said yes tegger started to get up warvia held him back the ghouls too had flinched but harpster made himself speak to the protector we know enough to know our helplessness these are vampire protectors they take the high point folk as meat from a herd some return as protectors many simply disappear bram said they are repairing the arch do they do more good than harm yes there are too many and theyll fight when the repairs are done we hope we can improve the balance how do you expect to help we must know more tell us what you can harpster shrugged hugely you know what we know high point will show us more come dawn the hindmost fluted the window shrank to background size we wait he said louis we recorded earlier conversation they know much of protectors and something of teela brown or shall we serenade you bram was reaching for the instrument package hed brought from hidden patriarch a little dinner music would go nicely louis said politely and im starved louis was trying to do some stretching lifting acolyte had pulled some serious muscles and tendons brams attentions had helped but he had to move carefully many hours had passed now the window at high point was rotating bumpily across nightdarkened mountainscape a mixed bag of hominids were rolling the stolen webeye like a wheel over the worn paths of the village when they left the village and began moving uphill over rock the motion began to jar his stomach louis turned his back on the display trusting the others to alert him when the webeye got somewhere interesting what was taking the kzin so long anyplace in known space he could at least have used a doc the medkit wouldnt do anything for him except inject chemicals and hed need it again in a few minutes four high point people carried the web and its backing they climbed uphill in the charcoal night saron moved ahead of the red herders and night people to point out footholds for them the ghouls had tried to help carry but they were doing well just to catch their breath sunlight soon warvia said to the ghoul woman what will you do then i was told we would come to the passage shelter there were no roads here what paths there were were only scuff marks on hard dirt and rock the high village people moved up and up across a tilted land on and on miles above the infinite flatland to spin was the oncoming terminator line and daylight close up against the spill mountains the land below was a relief map like the map the ghouls had made for them outside the grass giants hall a view like this may have given them that notion farther away all detail was lost a thread of silver linked by puddles might have been the homeflow or any other body of water or something else entirely warvia may have been thinking similar thoughts the lands the red herders move through are they even big enough to see how will we ever find red herders again harpster said thats not the problem at all grieving tube said our people know the routes of the red herders theyll map forgive me she had to stop for breath theyll map a path for us by mirror speech youll find a new home as quickly as you came here oh good then warvia laughed your solution was extreme we didnt need to travel quite so far tegger wouldnt show weakness with warvia watching with dying strength he followed saron the old woman moved more slowly now he could hear the other high point people gasping as they carried the webs weight along the hill day swept toward them from spinward as the first edge of sun peeped around the shadow of night harpster pulled from his pack two rolledup hats with gigantic brims now only the night people walked in shadow we should be on the fringes of red herder turf warvia said as far as possible from stories that must have started already harpster said no warvia red herders arent all the same species why of course we are tegger said we woo our mates from other tribes at the feasts when the herds cross weve done it since before anyone can remember harpster said good idea but you dont always said grieving tube you and warvia you have the same accent yes we both were born into ginjerofers tribe but others mate across the lines some tribes have given it up some just dont push it like ginjerofers people tegger the farther you go from ginjerofers tribe the less likely your children will find mates who can give them children it wouldnt matter so much if you didnt mate for life flup tegger whispered something flashed at them as they rounded a barrier of crumbling rock tegger had tried to imagine what a mirror might look like now he couldnt see it what he saw was himself warvia the ghouls and high point people the sky and the rim wall a mirror was a flat window that showed what was behind the viewer it stood as high as a red herder man and three men wide they set the web and its backing carefully in place flat onto the mirror saron and the men went to the ends of the mirror and the night people went with them harpster began to talk spitting his consonants as if he were addressing a crowd the men began to tilt the mirror up and down it was mounted on hinges jennawil stood behind tegger and pointed along the rim toward the next spill mountain a highlight played on the mountains flank falling and rising as the men tilted the mirror tegger asked how does it work jennawil laughed ah the night people havent told you everything sun mirrors flash a code known to us and night people they carry news between mountains but also news of flatlands to mountains and back to flatlands that explained much the ghouls had always known too much about the weather the shadow nest the bronze spinnerweb itself the four took up the eye of louis wu again around this jut of rock saron said and up weve been discussing your problem grieving tube and i we think we have an answer harpster said tegger had been thinking too its like being crushed between two bulls if we go too far we doom our children if we settle too close to ginjerofers route well hear tales about ourselves were too conspicuous warvia said too easy to recognize when visitors tell of the vampire slayers who learned rishathra that will be us harpster was grinning with all his spade teeth suppose there was an old story harpster said once upon a time all hominids were monogamous no man looked at a woman who was not his mate and she would not look aside from him war happened when hominids met then came two heroes who saw that hominids could live otherwise they invented rishathra and ended a war they spread it like a ministry warvia cried harpster was there really such a tale not yet oh the night people are selective about whom we speak to but you must not think were silent youve seen the sun mirrors those are our voice you know that every priest must know how to dispose of his dead priests must talk to us the route had become steeper and they were all huffing now we can spread the tale from several directions grieving tube said only the old women remember the legend or the old men the tale tells of heroes of their own species who invented rishathra and ended war and it tells that their own species has practiced rishathra ever since details are different among different species when a variation appears in which the heroes were red herders who ended a war to gain allies against vampires its just a story tegger laughed he was starting to believe it would work only a story warvia maybe she said maybe its worth a try we can lie love as long as we dont have to lie to each other a rock as big as the tallest city building had split vertically and the high point people were leading them through the split ribbons of color ran through the rock ice did this deb said water soaks into rock freezes melts and freezes again the wind shrilled through icy tearing at any bit of exposed skin tearing at eyes tegger walked blind feeling his way following warvia though her eyes were closed too a big hand on his chest stopped him he opened his eyes into slits finally here it was a place to hide from the wind a rock tunnel into the mountain but theyd stopped within the cleft with the tunnels mouth barely in view from the cleft a slope of shattered rock ran up to a rough rock entrance barraye spoke for the first time teegr that is not shelter he asked why not monsters inside yes vishnishtee they set the web on its rim and propped it to face the opening barraye had gone silent again saron said louis wu can you see the bronze web spoke yeah barely how deep is that thing we think that this is passage through the high mountain none of us have gone that far youve been inside deb spoke most of high point and near a hundred of airborne visitors hid in the passage when the death light shone we could only hunt at night after the death light faded we were cast out and forbidden to return a breathy voice said describe the vishnishtee teggers eyes met warvias that voice from the web must be the vashnesht bram but it sounded very like whisper the vishnishtee cared for us deb said but none of us ever saw one what never but sometimes one of us would disappear there was a limit to how far we could go down the passage we knew there was death in the passage but there was death outside too couldnt you make your own shelters rock would stop radiation stop the death light we knew that hide in caves the vishnishtee said make houses of rock the mountain would shake rock down on our heads the voice of louis wu said my companions are showing me a picture taken from tens of daywalks above you its amazing how much detail you can see when youre far enough away deb the mountain you live on is kind of a flat cone but around that tunnel its like a sand castle piled against a wall with a pipe poking out of it they waited for louis wu to make better sense yeah what i mean is the passage is older than the mountain and a lot stronger made of scrith i bet the mountain gradually settles under its own weight but the passage stays right where it is and vishnishtee have to keep digging the entrance again can you take me through no said barraye and saron and jennawil deb said we were cast out if were seen we will die saron said we have stayed on broken rock we left no footprints and no scent if a vishnishtee learns that we have come bearing this we will die it was harpster who protested the eye of louis wu has come far to see so little that is as it is harreed stay behind if you find sign of us conceal it harpster are you strong enough to take harreeds place and a voice said leave the web nine hominids froze tegger could see no tenth and that was not the voice of whisper nor the protector bram either but it had the same breathy speech impediment the high point people were quietly moving back through the cleft in the rock and downslope tegger and warvia followed leading the ghouls who by now were nearly blind in the black shadows of their hats they left the bronze spinnerweb propped in the cleft and didnt look back chapter twentynine collier they were four in hot needle of inquirys crew cabin bram and the hindmost and louis wu and acolyte in a great black coffin where their exercise space used to be they all used the same shower and the same kitchen wall sleeping arrangements werent a problem the hindmost wanted the sleeping plates but that was all right theyd moved the cargo plates beside the water bed louis used that he was sitting crosslegged on the bouncing surface eating something crunchy and nutritionfree boredom had him eating too much he might be getting too much painkiller too bram didnt want him exercising alone in the lander bay louis had healed enough to want that he had offered to take bram along teach him yoga or even some fighting techniques bram refused he intended to be right here when what the futz was bram expecting louis wondered for most of two days hed watched the wreckage of the refueling probe it lay smashed on the maglev track in a window that overlaid six others five now and bram stood before it watching louis was getting cabin fever to ships port and starboard the glow of dying coals had faded to the black of cold basalt in space that would have been stars an infinite universe spread to either side futz he had stars one webeye lay on the maglev track looking down at the universe through the filigree surface another starscape from the webeye louis had sprayed onto the vacuum had fuzzed out only hours ago in another window the stolen webeye moved into a smoothbore tunnel stopped in what was clearly an airlock for several hours then moved on through several doors past piles of strange equipment vaguely glimpsed and stopped again louis had never seen what was carrying it nor heard that voice again the flight deck was windows overlaid on windows a perspective that could cross the eyes and twist them in their sockets one was a graph like a constantly wiggling mountain range purpose unknown three were replays high point mountain swept past the refueling probe the probe maneuvered until it was smashed by violet light a protector died his suit slashed open to vacuum nothing was happening where the ruined probe lay on the maglev track the window held bram like a dark dali silhouette say shades of night descending louis closed his eyes and sagged back on the water bed popped them open again hed seen bluewhite light flash from one of the windows the light was out now but the wrecked probe was glowing cherryred something tiny was coming down the maglev track from far away running straight into the window it came at astronomical speed a foot above the track something like a floating sledge it decelerated savagely something manlike dropped off the back and rolled out of view as the vehicle eased to a stop inches from the window the hindmost moved up beside bram the probe cooled to murky red darker black that wasnt a sled it was a shallow box the bottom was black like wrought iron the sides were so transparent as to be barely visible but louis could pick them out by the knobs embedded for tiedowns lines held tools against the sides of the box a wand with a handle maybe a line saw a widemouthed thing gun or rocket launcher or energy weapon a pry bar stacked boxes skeletal metal stuff a window behind it showed starscape and rising into view a nearly empty flat surface louis glared and looked away the stolen webeye had left the tunnel and entered some kind of open elevator at the worst possible time louis heard i do not understand war but i feel louis might even drugged ask louis are you awake of course im awake bram this is a duel among protectors medieval japanese louis said thickly despite what hed said the drugs had him wanting to doze hide and stab win any way you can they didnt duel like europeans yes you understand do you see why this second intruder is still alive no wait the newcomer moved in a crouched and jerky strut examining the slagged probe it was the knobby shape of a ringworld pressure suit and wide through the torso like the one whisper was wearing but it fit the newcomer found marks on the probe where a stepping disk had been attached its head snapped up and in a flash it was gone but louis had glimpsed its face spill mountain protector whisper must see that too its a slave stet bram there must be a master the protector in charge of the maglev track the master sent him a window lurched then rolled over and over showing the black underside of the ringworld then stars streaming past ringworld stars the protectors servant had cleared the maglev rail by rolling the ruined probe into space now the main window was backing up the spill mountain protector jumped free louis said the first one the one that died he left a maglev sled on the track acolyte sprayed his webeye on the sled thats what were watching somebody has to get the probe and the sled off the track so heres a spill mountain protector to dump the probe and hes sent the first sled back where it came from down to the spaceport ledge problem solved now hes boarding his own sled there it goes back up the track to wherever he came from bram said you do understand whispers started something she cant stop shes guessed that i sent the probe bram said she doesnt want my enemies to study it she cant know how many there are she might extrapolate begin with teela brown yeah it all begins with teela the pain had gone far away louis felt himself floating better disconnect himself from the medkit clear his head the webeye windows motion stopped then it too began gliding up the track whisper was using it to follow the other sled teela made protectors to help her mount motors bram said a spill mountain protector might be trusted because teela could hold his species at ransom a ghoul protector might consider that his species already owns all beneath the arch and act only to preserve it a vampire starts fresh a protector born with a blank mind and teela right there to teach you said that yes shall we call him dracula mary shelley why am i lecturing a drugstupefied breeder i think teela would pick a woman to be a protector three women bram shrugged widely stet i dont know the name but stet maryshelley made bloodchildren protectors of her own vampire species and hid them from teela when teela returned to the map of mars two protectors followed only the ghoul remained on the rim maryshelley must have known that her brood would kill and replace the ghoul she would rule the rim through them the spill mountain protector may have guessed that teela planned to bathe the rim in solar flame he fought to protect his kind but teela killed both now we must ask how many are maryshelleys brood the hindmost said manufacture acquisition transport mounting supply three i think bram said manufacture would use repair facilities already in place at a spaceport if a ship comes manufacture becomes acquisition as for supply no protector would allow another to control what he needs stet three lovecraft to build collier for transport king above them all to mount the motors louis smiled bram had remembered who mary shelley was the hindmost said my kind would be a hundred strong for the company alone and my kind bram said would each design his own domain to run without his help there were spill mountain people at hand let them build and move and mount while lovecraft and collier and king lurk to pounce louis asked you think they were expecting whisper whisper or each other or me or invaders from the stars do you think us too stupid to extrapolate planets from what we can see of the universe anne perceived protectors in place on the rim each ready to kill her wherever shes been or whatever shes done since shes reached the rim unnoticed by me or by them shes killed lovecraft already she makes a pretty good target for collier though hindmost can you read the back of a webeye camera louis i dont unde glass he sprayed it on glass a pipe organ cried in pain done but wait eleven minutes eleven minutes later the window suddenly faced back along the maglev track into the bed of the sled louis made out some dim shapes suggestive of tools nothing big enough to hide a protector where was whisper the picture reversed again and the first sled was slowing the second sled began to slow too louis heard woodwinds scream and saw the hindmosts heads jump bolt upright that wasnt the hindmosts song it was bram and his musical sculpture and he was already setting it aside he went to the stepping disk and flicked out louis said did you see that hes gone said the hindmost where why you tell me louis wu understands duels stet would you take food the hindmost stood beside him holding a flask louis took it and sipped broth thats good sanity check the granite block was back in place and the hindmost was in the crew cabin still trapped like louis himself louis said hes gone where hell need a pressure suit for now hes nowhere hindmost if you turned off the stepping desk system where would bram be safeties prevent me what if we just blast the system with a flashlightlaser tanj no hes got the flash and the variableknife the system is buried in the hull louis then shift his flick to mons olympus where does he think hes going anyway he may be there already summon up that map the hindmost made music nothing happened im locked out the hindmost said bram has learned my programming language hes wrested control of the stepping disks from me his legs folded under him his heads tucked under his forelegs louis tried lifting the edge of the stepping disk it wouldnt move bram had taken full control those tanj concerts werent entertainment they were bram practicing with his handmade instruments until he could duplicate the hindmosts musical speech something was happening the webeye window jittered and shook louis shouted hindmost turn the picture around its looking the wrong way the puppeteer didnt move the window skewed sideways hit the side of the track and bounced away spinning whatever had attacked the sled was having its effect the puppeteer was unfolding himself the maglev sled hit the other wall hard the picture juttered and slid when it came to a stop it was looking at nothing but silver filigree the puppeteer whistled and the picture reversed now starlight showed them walls of shattered crystal bullets had chewed the sled into lace and the tools in the bed had been showered with glass slivers most of these things had been unrecognizable now they were junk with one exception seeing acolyte and him flick in and out louis thought would have told whisper about stepping disks she must have ripped the stepping disk off the probe and tossed it into the sled for there it was unharmed three pressure suits leaped into the sled in the same instant two fired sprays of projectiles at anything big then hurled anything hurlable in a rapid search for a protector hiding in wreckage but whisper was nowhere two protectors picked up the stepping disk and held it on edge so that the third could inspect its underside they turned it to show the upper surface the vampire must have thought it more dangerous than useful because he adjusted his weapon and fired a bright narrow beam at it the beam lashed straight up out of the cabins main stepping disk and began to char the ceiling though louis couldnt remember jumping for cover he and the hindmost were now curled intimately behind the recycler wall the hindmost didnt look like he intended to uncurl louis poked his head around the vampire protector had picked up the stepping disk and was trying to hurl it over the edge of the track the disk was suddenly too heavy as an intruders weight slammed it down the intruder bram lashed out as the other leapt away the other vampire collier fell and separated cut in half by six feet of wire in a stasis field both ends of him spewed fog but colliers torso still had arms and one came around with the bulky lightweapon brams variableknife licked out again the lightweapon fell no telling where whisper had come from but she was there two spill mountain protectors faced two vampire protectors the puppeteer was still in something like a catatonic state louis tried to follow what was happening in the webeye window it wasnt simple the spill mountain protectors hadnt attacked whisper was wearing one of their suits shed be able to talk to them louis could hear brams breath huffing with recent exertion but he wasnt talking he wouldnt have the right kind of suit radio he was blinking his helmet lamp at whisper tanj that must be the ghouls heliograph language louis realized and now the others were using helmet lamps too it went on and on and presently an agreement was reached the spill mountain protectors picked up the ruined sled with some difficulty bram gave his weapon to whisper and helped them throw the sled over the rim and into space they dropped the stepping disk into the undamaged maglev sled the two vampire protectors got in then the spill mountain protectors the sled began to move back down the track as the sled began to pull away bram puffed a webeye onto the track then another onto the sled then bram sang the song of an orchestra being gunned down by terrorists he stepped on the disk and flicked out gone here as the light through the webeye window showed his going bram walked off the stepping disk lifting his helmet something like a fat burl flute was in his hard beak of a mouth when a puppeteer is upset he loses control not of speech but of emotional signals the hindmosts song was as pure as wind chimes youve learned my programming language bram put the flute away our contract does not preclude such a thing i am disturbed did you follow what you saw no of maryshelleys bloodchildren weve killed lovecraft and collier colliers servants tell us that lovecrafts servants are ready to load cargo we expect that they will aid us now only king remains when king is dead whisper will control the rim and i the repair center and then we may accomplish something the kitchen delivered a flask and bram drank deeply louis noticed he was carrying the big lightweapon that thing would probably kill everyone in the cabin if it was fired bram looked at him louis wu what would you do now well shes got to kill king too late for anything else me my suit would keep me alive for two falans so i dont have to board a sled and rev it up to seven hundred seventy miles per second and then let king shoot at me i might come back to this side of the rim then climb up the wall from here you would lose all surprise he still bram waved it away annes suit wont last that long mph cargo bram had said well if i had something king wanted i could put it on the sled with me of course hed have to know i had it what does king want never mind louis i thought it worth seeking a different viewpoint bram whistled at the stepping disk system then flicked out now wheres he gone hindmost are you still locked out i cant use stepping disks i can find him do it two windows showed moire patterns webeyes destroyed in the battle the hindmost sang them out then popped one up in their place it began flicking past other views weaver town hidden patriarch the foremast crows nest the hindmost sang flutes and percussion he said ive begun a search program if invaders come using familiar craft well know it in minutes good louis pointed at the window half obscured by that one i hope you were recording that yes the stolen webeye had reached the spaceport ledge tiny starlit pressure suits walked through vacuum toward a structure too huge to show its shape it took them forever to round the curve of it bigger yet a pair of golden toroids mounted on tall gantries it took louis a moment to see the rest of it cables were growing out of the toroids spreading like a growing plant narrowing at the ends to invisibly fine wire stet theyre actually making new motors the hindmost said ive wondered if the wire frames are an innovation my records show no more than the toroids interesting notion but maybe the city builders took just the toroids that wire frame could be awkward if you wanted to land a ship the shifting window showed hidden patriarchs aft crows nest then the kitchen and two adult city builders and three children where had the older children been hiding louis wondered that he hadnt met them but they were all moving out the door and now they came chattering back with bram between them bram had stripped off his suit he stretched out on a bench harkabeeparolyn and kawaresksenjajok began a massage bones and swollen joints and no fat anywhere he looks like a tanj skeleton now louis said bram seemed asleep if bram thinks theres time for that hes likely right hindmost lets get acolyte out of that box and me in the puppeteer whistled up a window louis the nanotech devices are still repairing damage to his spinal cord he should be free in a few hours tanj leave him yes louis curled up on the water bed im going to sleep chapter thirty king louis uncurled slowly pain is a great teacher still he moved more easily than he had these last four days the medkit had been giving him diet supplements but hed turned off the pain drip louis disengaged himself and went to the fore wall here in hidden patriarchs dining hall bram was speaking to the city builders the webeye windows in the walls were active and one was the same as this second window here the vast width of the spaceport ledge the nearly finished rim wall motor was gone completed and moved somewhere here passed a huge floating sledge with skeletal towers and alien waldos at the corners a tower with a spiral decor more than decor it was bending over like a silver tentacle and its tip was an infinite bifurcation it englobed the pickedover hull of a city builder starship and lifted beyond the edge of the ledge was a line of vertical rings the deceleration track for incoming ships here a blur of maglev track with stars showing faintly through whisper must have set her sled moving louis decided built up considerable speed too while he slept it had to be whisper who else would have sprayed a webeye here a sluggishly drifting starscape seen through a filigree maglev track and a tiny green blinking cursor i found a spacecraft the hindmost said show me the puppeteer sang and the view zoomed hugely to a blurred view of something more crowbar than ship little winged spacecraft ran its length like aphids on a twig at the near end a big drive cone and or plasma cannon drifted past another arm ship louis said good catch bram had left the dining hall the hindmost noticed motion along the maglev track he chimed the window reversed to show the other side of whispers webeye that wasnt the sled whisper had been using it was a vast dark plane cable rose in loops of varying thickness and varying curvatures branching like arteries reaching around and up and out of sight a slender pillar rose out of the center whispers handhold was on the narrowest of these loops she was floating in close foreground with one hand on a cable as thick as her fist it seemed a fantasy like some ancient book cover the only item louis could recognize was welded just behind whisper the stepping disk off the refueling probe louis realized that his mind wasnt tracking what he needed was breakfast muscles in his back groin right hamstring and some transverse muscles under his ribs protested when he moved to the kitchen wall lifting a kzin even a kzin not quite grown remember im a trained professional he muttered dont try this stunt in earth gravity he dialed up a pastiche omelet papaya grapefruit bread louis nothing is acolyte ready to come out the hindmost looked yes wait louis tapped an order lets pacify him with haunch of mammal acolyte sat up fast and found himself looking at a rack of beef ribs he took it and found the hindmost behind it he said your munificence as host must be legendary and began to tear ribs apart the hindmost said your father came to us as an ambassador hes taught you well acolyte waggled his ears and kept eating the puppeteer dialed up a big bowl of grassy stuff but it only stopped one mouth at a time for acolytes benefit he described the deaths on the maglev track singing up visual displays with louis filling in a word here and there the puppeteer didnt grasp strategy one thing acolyte wasnt hearing was that bram had begun treating his alien serfs as prisoners acolyte dropped a big white imitation bone into the recycler louis are you healthy im not ready to race you again not just yet you did well what it cost you you did well i think my main nerve trunk was broken shall i put you in the doc no no no its all coming to a head look louis waved through the webeye window at whisper floating motionless above an infinite field of superconductor his mind had had time to digest a little of that weird picture and he spoke for the puppeteer as well as the adolescent kzin whispers in free fall that means were looking at a vehicle moving at seven hundred seventy miles per second antispinward its a vehicle even if it has to stretch the full width of the maglev track two hundred feet wide and maybe longer than that those loops acolyte you were in the doc when bram was hinting around youre looking at the barest fringes of a rim wall ramjet lovecrafts team had one all ready to go whispers holding it hostage whisper was looking back watching the webeye bram must have told her what it was bram flicked in he was wearing louiss pressure suit with the helmet back he looked at his allies glanced into the windows then turned to the kitchen louis acolyte hindmost what news as you see the hindmost said an arm carrier vessel orbits a hundred million miles out from the ringworlds underside how will you deal with it not yet bram turned back to the windows now whisper was clinging like a frightened monkey to the loop of superconductor shes begun deceleration acolyte do you understand we hope that king will consider a rim ramjet and the large sled too valuable to destroy louis explained bram said whisper expects me what do you need of me before i go the puppeteer bleated give me access to the stepping disks not quite yet hindmost louis asked what kind of opposition king has a long supply line hell have a few spill mountain protectors he will rotate them frequently unless he prefers to watch them die they must scent their own kind to know whom they protect or else protect all beneath the arch king reserves that for himself not many then none it may be kings own hands may serve him the rim wall ramjet motors cannot be moved by muscle in any case i dont fear the high point protectors if they see a clear victory they will finish the loser the victor holds their people ransom louis said give us a hint if you and whisper are killed what do we do your contract protect all beneath the arch bram lowered his faceplate and fixed it in place he was gone a virtual particle in motion and the port and starboard walls were glowing bright orange with the heat of the momentum exchange tiny bottles popped into the kitchen well the hindmost inserted them one by one into the little medkit on the cargo plate stack antibiotics he said thanks hindmost i must have been clean out more bottles pain blockers whisper wasnt in sight on the barge shed been conspicuous enough until now shed shown herself to kings telescopes with kings treasure displayed vastly behind her what was she playing at now was she high in that cone of superconducting cable how well did vampires climb under the maglev barge the view ahead hadnt changed the track ran on and on the barge and its unwieldy cargo might be decelerating but even at high gee it would take awhile louis wondered if whisper was planning to ram the terminus king might be wondering the same thing nah in ten hours at miles second shed covered around twentyfour million miles but the track ran for two hundred million miles and where in that length was her target she couldnt give king that much time to shoot at her where for that matter was king the vampire protector could be anywhere if hed trained high point protectors to mount the ramjets for him what was that maglev sled the small variety almost lost on the vast track coming straight toward the window now veering from side to side and slowing matching speed with the barge contact and five matching pressure suits were past the webeye before louis could blink the hindmost whistlechimed the view reversed and gone they had already disappeared into the maze of coils five matching pressure suits would be five spill mountain protectors stet theyd guard the ramjet protect it from stray effects of a battle serving both sides for king they would also serve as a distraction and anyone who had ever watched a magic act might guess that one of the five was king himself his suit bulked out with additional weapons or armor where were they action far aft louis couldnt make it out this was going to be frustrating he thought he glanced at the kzin would acolyte freak out but he was watching with the patience of a cat at a mouse hole traces of motion distant flashes of light and two maglev sleds were weaving through the coils sporadic flashes of light followed them they dipped below view then rose one struck a coil and rebounded into an actinic blast crashed into another coil and was out over the edge of the track gone the other clever louis whispered and lowered his gaze to the bed of the barge but there was nothing to be seen the hindmost said louis whisper had the little sleds following the barge right aft where king couldnt see them i only saw two but maybe there were more all slaved to the one she was in and which one is that now shes dipped them and rolled clear and sent them up again for king to shoot at even if kings figured it out by now it puts her in two places and whisper knows where he is and i could be completely wrong the barge will stop soon then the dueling field expands stet louis ye gods youre right if bram flicked in light slashed where he had been but bram was among the superconductor loops and firing back with louiss flash light flared among the loops a storm of energy beams bram stood up holding his suit together with one hand the first beam hadnt missed it was hellishly intense having gotten through the laser shielding on louiss suit now two tiny manshapes were firing among the loops leaping firing chewing up the ramjet louis said i just and stopped share it acolyte spat light doesnt hurt a superconductor theyre all three using lightweapons if king had known bram would be dead if he didnt get to safety soon hed taken cover behind a thick loop of ramjet and was watching just watching likely bram had no better idea than he did louis thought as to which manshape was whisper which was king hed done what he could one combatant flared like a sun and dissolved the other flared brighter and was gone faster four shapes leaped like fleas a pincer closing on bram louis started to laugh bram ran for the stepping disk he blazed like a sun and then he was gone here off the stepping disk throwing back his helmet pulling in air in great gasps his pressure suit glowed dull red in spots he stripped it away keeping the gloves on until he was clear of the rest hurled the suit into the shower and turned it on louis was still laughing and acolyte seemed to be smiling widely but on a kzinti that was no smile he said one of you will tell me what happened whisper is dead and i am alone bram said is there more to know kings protector servants were to guard the ramjet and the barge while we fought but we three came to fight war on a superconducting field under superconducting coils we all chose energy weapons stet acolyte the arch lives by the rim ramjets we are protectors acolyte said stet four protector servants saw that none of us could harm the transport or the ramjet whisper and i thought they would kill the losers but they saw two dying and one unwary and they struck to free themselves from us entirely i must have seemed easy meat bram said witless ones if they saw me flick in couldnt they guess id flick out bram looked at the webeye windows glowing in the hindmosts cabin four protectors in high point pressure suits gathered around the stepping disk their helmet lights blinked heliograph patterns one looked up into the window then all four eased around out of view the window went to moire patterns that wont save them bram said and turned hindmost why was a link made between weaver town and the meteor defense room the puppeteer said ask louis wu louis one does not reproach a piersons puppeteer for cowardice louis barely glanced at the hindmost its the morals clause bram ive judged you unfit to rule the ringworld brams hand was a vise on louiss left shoulder lifting louis could see the kzin bristling trying to decide whether to interfere the protector said by what unjustifiable arrogance could a breeder its teela isnt it what she forced you to kill her she forced you to kill hundreds of millions of spill mountain folk in order to push the arch back into place of course she had to die to save the hostages she had given me of course the arch would have impacted the sun without plasma to feed the rim ramjets but why did she impose these tasks on you all right why bram had set louis on his feet but his grip hadnt relaxed ive read your record from the ships computer you open problems then abandon them louis believed he was prepared to die but this was turning weird what problems bram you found a dangerous alien species in interstellar space you opened negotiations you showed their way to your world then left professional ambassadors to try to deal with them teela brown you carried to the ringworld then left to anothers care tanj dammit bram she made her own choice halrloprillalar you brought to earth then allowed the arm to take her she died louis was silent despite teela still you have ignored your responsibility for fortythree falans only the fear of death brought you back here but you understood her message didnt you louis that is completely you must judge the ringworlds safety she trusted your wisdom louis and not her own she was half right half bright the hindmost spoke from safety behind the kitchen wall teela wasnt wise protectors are not wise their motives dont come from the forebrain louis she may have been just wise enough hindmost thats ridiculous louis said bram im naturally arrogant youre being too clever bright people do a lot of that what shall i do about the protectors who killed my mate well ask the high point people if we can please talk to a protector well tell them theyre in charge of the rim bram spill mountain protectors have every interest in protecting the ringworld from any danger anything that happens hurts the rim wall first and who should know that better than they do bram blinked he said yes next i have ruled in the repair center for more than seven thousand falans how do you judge me i know what you did the dates bram the dates you didnt even try to hide them you talk to too many kinds youve traveled too far how could i lie you might have learned i am acolyte said bewildered louis had nearly forgotten the kzin he said he and whisper searched for the mysterious master protector for how long bram hundreds of falans but it wasnt enough even using the telescope display in the repair center the ringworld is too big but if you know where a protector will be you can be there first a disaster lures protectors like bram youll have to do something about that arm carrier ship wont you bram yes whisper and bram found a large mass falling toward the ringworld that was all they needed cronus would have to do something about that hed come to the repair center whisper and bram would be ready stet bram silence maybe cronus knew how to stop the impact bram and whisper would have waited right see if he could do it but bram knew something was wrong louis we think it was his habit his first move was to set up defenses we we couldnt couldnt brams fingers were sinking into louiss shoulder drawing blood louis said you killed him before he could finish we moved almost too late he and we stalked each other he and we had mapped these vast spaces and set traps bram was speaking to acolyte now telling of a duel to one who loved such tales anne was crippled for a lifetime i still dont know how he shattered my leg and hip in the dark we killed him louis said and then he didnt know either louis we searched his tools he brought nothing whatever he had he never got to use it you and whisper you had no ideas at all bram said acolyte you let fistofgod hit the ringworld acolyte an enemy waits for me in the meteor defense room here is your wtsai go and kill my enemy yes acolyte said bram whistletrilled into his eccentric flute the kzin stepped forward and flicked out louis tried to follow but brams fingers were sunk deep in his shoulder louis said you bloodsucking freemother you know where i must be but i decide the rest come bram and louis were on the stepping disk and gone chapter thirtyone the ringworld throne they flicked into the gloom of the meteor defense and louis was flying hurled away he tried to land rolling he glimpsed bram flicking out in a burst of mad fluteoboe music something monstrous and shadowy was leaping at louis and something much faster scuttled toward them both louis landed on his right shoulder where a vampire protector had sunk dirty claws deep into the sinew and muscle louis cried out and kept rolling and the first attacker landed almost on top of him the second fended off a reflexive kick from an orangefurred leg and was at the stepping disk he played a snatch of fluteoboe music and was gone the first attacker swept him up and rolled them another ten feet into shadow louis louiss shoulder was screaming he pulled in great lungfuls of air his nose was full of the smell of kzin acolyte he said i intend to kill bram the kzin said he may be dead already smell of kzin and something else what did that other one try to kill you you were supposed to die to distract him so was i i think i didnt scent him until he leapt he must have judged me harmless are you offended louis where is bram anywhere bram controls the stepping disks there must be twenty or so scattered through the repair center yes he whistles them up but that other got through before bram could change the flick dont you think what im thinking louis said is that bram went through and then changed the flick to mons olympus or the rim or hell then the other one copied brams command and changed it back then were missing a fine battle what was he smelling flowers something flowery pulled at louiss attention and made it hard to think the kzins smell was far stronger and his fur had hard lumps wait now that was a throwing knife and that was a long metal pole with chiselsharpened ends louis said you probably cant kill bram for that matter wasnt he teaching you louis shouldnt i kill my teacher oh ill keep that in mind louis sat up no not you louis i came to you for wisdom but bram made me his servant i learned from bram by listening until i was ready to learn by freeing myself see i have these cronuss weapons louis said most appropriate but bram bram fell from the ceiling it was thirty feet to the floor and he landed hard rolled and came up with two feet of blade he tried to balance it on end as another manshape dropped toward him the others arms swung forward bram leapt away as sharp objects rattled across the floor shuriken the blade fell over brams enemy slammed down rolled and bounced to his feet he seemed made of knobs bigger than bram with one arm clutched against his chest and sharp metal in the other louiss mind was still trying to catch up bram must have turned a second stepping disk upside down and fixed it to the ceiling copying the martians now the vampire protector had nearly reached the first stepping disk with his larger attacker a long jump behind as acolyte surged from cover acolyte jabbed the iron pole at brams ribs bram didnt turn he braked for an instant the pole went past his navel and bram had the end he pulled and twisted the pole bent and the other end cracked acolyte across the forehead it slowed bram just enough the other was on him he chopped at brams wrist at the foot that came at his face elbow the other foot the other arm bram went down flopping with bones or tendons cut in all four limbs his attacker had vanished he spoke in the trade language as spoken around weaver town distorted by a protectors usual breathy speech impediment and louiss translator was only a moment behind furry people you must stay back for now you shall be satisfied but this seems a good time to talk acolyte was sitting up dazed louis if the other protector was still afraid of bram so was louis he couldnt see any way to drag acolyte to cover his own cover wasnt good but he stayed where he lay he called stay back acolyte i brought him here yes said brams attacker the walls reflected his voice masking its origin louis wu why have you done that bram sat in a spreading pool of blood he could have been trying to tie tourniquets but he wasnt hed left his weapons lying it came to louis that whatever was done for him bram would stop eating now and would be dead shortly thereafter protectors do that when they lose their reason to live louis called into the dark youd be tunesmith and youd be louis wu who boiled an ocean but why have you made tunesmith into this bram broke in my time runs short may i borrow yours come i swear youre safe louis tunesmith has asked my question why did you open a stepping disk for a ghoul whom you have never seen forgive me louis wu said he was having trouble concentrating that flowery smell he remained where he was on his side nursing his ruined shoulder he said bram you know why i judged you and anne unfit to hold the repair center i havent heard you say i was wrong we could argue before tunesmith and let him judge bram silence tunesmith did you examine the skeleton yes ive been calling him cronus cronus was your ancestor i think even bram saw the implication cronus had eighty thousand falans to breed his genetic line toward the traits he wanted he shaped an empire with communications that reach all the way around the arch ring its a ring said tunesmith cronus extended his breeding program through an area almost too vast to describe the night people must number tens of billions theyre all one species as the vampires are not he shaped you to be ideal protectors tunesmith said i see possible improvements so bram here is a vampire protector we have recordings of bram in better health and youll see them youre his clear superior bigger brain more versatile less reflex more choices bram bram said he beat me bigger brain he was intelligent as a breeder of course its bigger now louis he knows nothing invaders threaten you are obliged to train him i know bram contract violation or no you must teach him tunesmith trust his intent question his judgment learn from the web dweller but do not trust until he gives you a contract louis asked my turn speak tunesmith protectors do immense damage when they fight bram and his mate fixed a problem and the protectors in charge of the rim wall right now are a local spill mountain species we need them there ill show you why when we get the smell get back to the ship it was treeoflife get me out of here tunesmith i cant stay here louis wu youre much too young to respond to the smell of the roots its faint here too im too old the root would kill me louis rolled to his knees he couldnt use his right arm last time i smelled this i barely got away with acolytes help he was on his feet and he lurched toward the stepping disk he had beaten current addiction once the treeoflife smell had turned off his mind in a moment but he had beaten that too it had been much stronger eleven years ago only a reformed current addict could have walked away from it a hand like a fistful of walnuts had his wrist louis wu i heard him use three chords and i followed him through each time one leads to traps and a weapons cache one to a fall from the ceiling and the last flicks us to where we fought whole fields of treeoflife grow there where an artificial sun louis began to laugh the smell of treeoflife was in his brain and the way out led to where he had fought teela brown tunesmith watched him he said too old but something was done to you bram was trying to laugh it sounded awful i saw records nanotechnology experiment stolen from earth stolen again bought by general products from a thief on fafnir its the puppeteers autodoc louis his voice wasnt built for it and his lungs were collapsing but he laughed eighty falans louis ninety no more remember me tunesmith and acolyte were both looking at louis wu the scent was in his nose but it wasnt pulling him his mind was his own but that meant he told them i was very sick the autodoc must have healed me very thoroughly changed everything every cell bram was right twenty years twentyfive tops you could become a protector tunesmith said its only a choice bram was dead maybe a protector could will his heart to stop his last words were suspiciously apt its an option louis repeated the strength was draining out of him youre ill tunesmith said the kzin helped him lie down tunesmiths knobby hands probed him the portable medkit hadnt magically healed anything tendons mesentery a hamstring his shoulder was badly swollen around five deep puncture wounds tunesmiths arm was worse puffed out and immobile in a sling but the protector ignored it i dont know your kind i dont think you can walk and you may have a fever soon louis what would you normally do for medicine back to the ship into the doc heals everything tunesmith went away taking the kzin with him they were back quickly they lifted louis and set him down again he rose into the air lying flat this will carry you signal the magic door the ghoul protector had invented the stretcher no theyd gone for a cargo plate and rope to pull it louis said i cant sing the hindmosts programming language were trapped not quite they set him down tunesmith said louis what shall i do to find my son oh tanj i totally forgot kazarp in all this would he hang around the weavers does he have relatives in the area there were night people with us when i flicked in they can return him to his mother my fear is that he may have followed me aw futz no wait youd smell him knowing your own gene line is built into your brain tunesmith hell know me better send me dont go yourself i would terrify him louis shall i play random chords and test them how bram set traps tunesmith we dont need the stepping disks i led us back to needle once before on foot without the hindmosts help dug a tunnel thats still in place how long a few days youll have to tow me well need water and food theres water at the treeoflife farm tunesmith said food he and acolyte moved toward brams body and stopped tunesmith said i was taught that others should not see me eat hes not yet carrion acolyte said my teachers friend few there are who will discuss cuisine with the night people but i see you have an interest we can eat the freshly dead we often prefer it but some are too tough at first and this was a protector i could put him on a second cargo plate and pull him along with a longer rope im hungry now tunesmith i would not offend you by eating in your presence take what you need louis turned his back on what happened next but he couldnt help grinning the sounds told the story a kzinti kitten must have to fight for his food now acolyte was trying to wrench his hardwon portion from brams body now he used his wtsai thuk and retreated with whatever that got him tunesmith approached and settled crosslegged a childs habits arent easily broken will acolyte listen to me after this its a good start there is food for you too louis wu i see no risk in your eating boiled treeoflife root the thought made him flinch but yams and sweet potatoes are nearly the same species we roast them it means build a fire put the roots in the coals where its not too hot well find something to burn in the treeoflife farm tunesmith called toward sounds of grinding teeth and yowling rage the kzin was still trying to chew nourishment from the corpse of a protector acolyte there is prey in the treeoflife farm little animals and quick i dont think anyone but a night people protector will ever eat bram and then not today well let me hunt then youll need me to get back tunesmith fluted and they flicked away tunesmith come back with an armful of yellow roots acolyte hunts alone i whistled in the return flick to use when he wants it he set the roots in the fire how do you like your water clean any temperature really cold too sure tunesmith flicked out and back again with a slab of ice easier than choosing an appropriate container where did you get that miles above us where air is thin and cold he soaked a swatch of cloth in dripping ice water and draped it around louiss neck how long do you cook treeoflife an hour louis said and he showed tunesmith the timepiece in the skin of his hand this tells tides too not much use here this makes it a calculator this is a game you move the numbers around like tanj youre fast acolyte flicked in his mouth bloody something dripping from his hand he set to work with the wtsai i looked for anything from the map of earth nothing quite fit but this is much like a rabbit dont you think he cleaned the beast and skinned and splayed it butterfly fashion and perched it above the coals to roast louis said some fun huh acolyte thought it over yes but im not wounded acolytes forehead was swollen and the yellow fur was soaked with blood louis said were all wounded victors dont have to pay attention to that acolyte tell us a story you first you fought the lucky protector teela brown im not quite proud of that let me tell you how i boiled a sea he did then acolyte told his fathers tale his arrival at the map of earth with a kzinti assault boat and puppeteer tools the war friends and enemies the deaths the matings arranged to bind allies learning to talk to females chmeee had sired three children in his few weeks on the map of kzin a local lord had contracted to raise them when he could chmeee had retrieved his eldest son from kathakt amicably and brought him to the map of earth acolyte had seen his first human being at twelve falans the eldest son of a lord trained hard enemies and friends whom to watch whom to almost trust how to talk to possible mates dont talk to female diplomats theyll have your hide this grows boring tunesmith said acolyte said yes it grew boring until i wanted to scream one day i screamed challenge and fought my father he let me go ive been injured and ive starved and i was slaved to a vampire protector but that diplomatic flup is out of my life tell us a tale tunesmith ill sing it then we should sleep and after louis can lead us to safety tunesmith sang of a thing of fiery magic abandoned by louis wu who boiled a sea five night people greatly daring had dismounted a magical door they didnt know where it led and they couldnt make it work one night chime was gone the rest promised to hold his son from following and tunesmith went through the door alone a scent pulled him toward what he could only perceive as the promise of paradise he woke in the garden of treeoflife the woman who had gone through ahead lay dead beside him chime had been too old he explored he found the meteor defense and the telescope he created a physics to explain what he was seeing he and louis discussed that with acolyte listening tunesmith had deduced not just worlds but black holes too he had guessed at the existence and nature of other protectors what did you eat dead rabbits well chime of course but i havent been awake long enough to get very hungry louis tried to talk about what a protector needed to know immediately invader ships it was time to take some prisoners see what their policy actually was hidden patriarch and its crew there must be city builders everywhere easily found the children would need mates in not many years the web dweller a contract is an unambiguous promise stet louis but why should the web dweller offer me such a thing acolyte said through fear but he often reacts badly to fear better if you have something he wants said louis tunesmith what if you offered him the four hundred and first rim wall ramjet his own dinner was ready by now he explained while he ate bussard ramjet attitude jet hydrogen fusion tunesmith already understood the law of reaction and the ringworlds instability there are only four hundred mountings when you build the four hundred and first motor well mount hot needle of inquiry at the axis its a general products hull radiation cant touch it at sublight speed itll take the hindmost a thousand years or so to match with the fleet of worlds acolyte stalked away from the smell of politics louis said i dont expect thatll bother him the conservatives are in power in the fleet of worlds nothing will change they may even want him back anyway we can offer he likes power games does he stet let him play if he gains more power well offer him the two hundredth ramjet its clear we dont need them all acolyte do you wonder how you lived acolyte stalked back tunesmith sang of finding the skeleton and weapons of cronus clues there told him that he was challenged he chose his lurking spot and waked a monstrous shape of orange hair flicked in and surged away tunesmith stalked it but he sensed no harm in it it may be my kind hasnt grown up frightened of your kinds smell acolyte thought that over tunesmith said but now i knew my enemy would use others for bait when two hominids appeared and one threw the other flying the hindmost flicked in he squeaked like a smashed piano and was instantly gone but tunesmith was faster than that he went through with the kzin on his heels and louis screaming wait what if its mons olympus hed reached his feet but they were gone louis said idiots and limped to the stepping disk and flicked through anyway tunesmith was in some kind of weird weaving defense pose acolyte was not quite a safe distance away trying to talk him down tunesmith ignored the kzin i want to talk to your leader he said firmly thousands of threelegged twoheaded creatures were watching them through the forward wall we say hindmost one of them said im the hindmost speak your desire teach me the granite block had been set aside louis limped past kzin and protector the pain in his shoulder was a part of his anger he asked the hindmost now how did you do that i braced my forequarters against the wall and pushed with my hind leg bram felt the strength in my leg he should have known lucky for us where is bram dead at our hands tunesmith the teaching aids are all here aboard hot needle of inquiry those pictures especially theyre made by bronze webs like the one on the cliff at weaver town tunesmith said i follow brams advice web dweller teach me i am not to trust you until we have a contract ill print out my peoples standard contract for service only for my amusement i hope louis my son needs tunesmith looked again you into the doc now is that it acolyte was lifting him he was in the big box and tunesmith was examining the readouts doubtfully how long the ghoul protector asked the puppeteer said three days maybe less louis talked in haste dont anyone sign anything hindmost i dont know how to feed a night person try aged beef try cheese tunesmith i hope you wont destroy that last arm spacecraft unless they do something dreadful nearest possible mates in this universe well that too now the high point protectors hold the rim wall and at this point they may be scared out of their minds talk to them through that window with the black sky and the big strange shapes ghouls stole that web from a vampire nest carried it maybe two hundred thousand miles plus two miles straight up the sunlight network told us about it tell the spill mountain protectors theyre in charge of the rim mean it acolyte was closing the lid on the big box louis laughed suddenly hey remind you of anything he heard the voice of louis wu telling a hairless face with red skin wed like to talk to a protector please we want to propose a contract and the lid closed and he could rest the end
