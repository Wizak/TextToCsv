 part оne faustus was born in germany in a town called rhode his parents were not rich but the boy showed that he was very intelligent and ambitious he was sent to wittenberg university when he was a young man and soon made a reputation for himself he became famous in the university for his knowledge and his wit and it was not long before the university made him dr faustus his success meant very little to him however and he longed for excitement and glamour one night he was in his study thinking about the future his studies now seemed dull to him and he did not know what he should do he looked at the books lying on his desk and began to pick them up one by one the first book he picked up was a study of aristotle he turned the pages idly the purpose of logic is to argue well he read he threw the book back onto the desk impatiently ive learnt everything that was possible from logic i can argue and debate better than most of the professors here at the university he thought he picked up a second book from the desk and glanced at the title page the purpose of medicine is health he read again he threw the book back onto his desk impatiently im already famous for my medical skills he thought proudly i dont need to study medicine any more besides what can medicine do it cant make people live forever and it cant bring the dead back to life once again he reached for a book from the pile on his desk this time he picked up a volume about law law he thought scornfully that might be all right for someone who just wants to make money but law doesnt satisfy me finally dr faustus picked up a bible this is still the best subject to study he thought he turned the pages of the bible with interest and then read a passage if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and there is no truth in us he read but if thats true faustus suddenly thought were all sinners sinners go to hell when they die well all go to hell he concluded theres nothing we can do about it at all its just inevitable he pushed the bible away from him impatiently he reached out for another book ah he said excitedly a book of magic and spells thats what really interests me if i learnt the black arts just think what i could do id be more powerful than a king or emperor this is the subject i want to know more about dr faustus had made up his mind he was going to learn about magic and the black arts he thought about two friends he had in wittenberg valdes and cornelius they both studied magic and they had offered to teach faustus what they knew just at that moment faustus servant wagner came into the study go and find valdes and cornelius faustus instructed him ask them to come here to see me yes sir said wagner he left the room and went to look for his masters two friends faustus sat by the fire waiting for them to come suddenly he saw two angels in front of him a good angel and a bad angel dont do it faustus the good angel cried put that book about magic away read the bible and save your soul now the bad angel began to speak learn about magic faustus youll become rich powerful and famous faustus was excited at the decision he had made he imagined himself with spirits that he could command and he amused himself by thinking what he would tell them to do they could bring him gold from india they could bring him exotic food from anywhere in the world they could debate philosophy with him he spent the time waiting for his friends pleasantly daydreaming about the future at last valdes and cornelius arrived dr faustus greeted them keenly ive been thinking about what you said he told them and ive decided to accept your offer i want you to teach me everything you know about magic im tired of philosophy and law and medicine and divinity i want something new valdes was very pleased with faustus decision well show you everything he said the spirits will soon obey you and then you can do whatever you want the spirits will protect you and they can become any shape you want theyll do whatever you tell them to yes its true once you see what magic can do for you youll never want to study anything else faustus magic will make you rich and famous i promise you cornelius added come and dine with me tonight faustus said excitedly you can tell me everything then im determined to see what the spirits can do for me part two that evening two scholars from the university walked past dr faustus house i wonder whats happened to dr faustus one of the scholars said theres his servant the other scholar replied pointing to someone in the street lets ask him shall we the two men stopped wagner wheres your master one of them asked hes in the house having dinner with valdes and cornelius wagner replied one of the scholars sighed i was afraid of this he said sadly it looks as if faustus has decided to take up magic valdes and cornelius are famous for their love of magic lets talk to the rector of the university his friend suggested he may be able to warn faustus not to do it we can try but i dont think itll do any good the two scholars walked away sadly they did not like to think that their friend had taken up such a dangerous interest a while later valdes and cornelius came out of the house they had kept their promise they had told faustus everything they knew about magic and they had given him some books and spells after saying goodbye to the two men faustus ran eagerly back into his study he closed the door behind him he drew a circle on the floor of the study and wrote various magic names inside it he also drew stars on the floor he then picked up the book that valdes and cornelius had left behind and began to read aloud from it he was trying to make a spirit appear before him at first nothing happened then faustus heard a terrible noise of thunder he went on reading aloud and a devil suddenly appeared in the room faustus was so surprised that he nearly dropped the book he was thrilled at his success however and he decided to see if the devil would do what he ordered go away he commanded youre too ugly to appear in front of me go away and come back in the form of a franciscan friar the devil whose name was mephostophilis bowed courteously and disappeared a few minutes later he returned to the study once again he bowed politely to dr faustus what do you want me to do mephostophilis asked i command you to obey me during my life faustus ordered you must do whatever i tell you to i am lucifers servant mephostophilis replied i can only obey you if he tells me to this was not what faustus had expected but didnt lucifer send you to me just now he asked no mephostophilis said quietly i came here because i wanted to but i summoned you faustus said angrily you came because of my magic thats the truth isnt it i came because i heard you cursing god mephostophilis said when we devils hear someone doing that we always come its a chance for us you see a person who curses god is in danger of damnation tell me about lucifer faustus ordered he was an angel once wasnt he yes he was mephostophilis said quietly and god loved him but lucifer was proud you see and god threw him into hell what about you faustus wanted to know what about you and all the other devils we were angels too mephostophilis admitted we joined lucifer when he rebelled against god we are damned with lucifer in hell but youre not in hell now faustus objected youre free you can walk around mephostophilis smiled contemptuously at faustus this is hell he informed him i was an angel once and i saw the face of god i knew all the delights of heaven of course this is hell i have a message for lucifer faustus told mephostophilis go and tell him that i am ready to give him my soul tell him that he must give me twentyfour years of life in exchange for it during those twentyfour years lucifer must give me everything i ask for tell him that i want you to be my servant during those twentyfour years ill tell him mephostophilis agreed bring me his answer later tonight faustus commanded mephostophilis made a courteous bow before he disappeared faustus was very excited he could hardly wait for mephostophilis to come back he began dreaming about what he would do once lucifer had agreed to his offer how everybody would wonder at him if he could control the spirits what things he could learn he would astonish the whole world with his learning and his cleverness part three while faustus was waiting for mephostophilis to return he thought more closely about what he was doing one part of him was afraid he knew that he was turning away from god forever he knew that he would lose his soul but another part of him was thrilled at the thought of the power that lucifer would give him he struggled with his conscience as he was arguing with himself the good angel and bad angel came back into the study go forward faustus the bad angel whispered to him youll soon be famous and rich stop faustus the good angel cried youll lose your soul the two angels looked at him for a moment and then they left the study ill be rich faustus said to himself and mephostophilis will be my servant suddenly he put his doubts aside it was nearly midnight he stood inside the magic circle and raised his arms mephostophilis he cried come here mephostophilis suddenly appeared in the study what did lucifer say faustus asked impatiently did he agree to everything he agreed mephostophilis said quietly ill be your servant for twentyfour years and you will then give lucifer your soul but theres one condition he added softly lucifer wants a proper contract with you you must write the agreement in your own blood lucifer insists on it if you dont give him a proper contract ill go straight back to him and you wont see me any more ill do it faustus said faustus took a knife and cut his arm it was a deep cut and blood poured out now write the contract commanded mephostophilis sternly he handed faustus a pen faustus dipped the pen into his blood and began to write as he was writing the blood in the pen suddenly dried he shook the pen but it was blocked what does this mean he asked himself he felt afraid again why cant i write he asked mephostophilis anxiously dont worry mephostophilis said reassuringly ill heat the pen with some coal itll work then mephostophilis took the pen and warmed it over some coal the blood was soon flowing once more and faustus began to write the contract faustus shall be a spirit in body and soul mephostophilis will be his servant mephostophilis will do everything that faustus commands mephostophilis will be invisible when he comes to faustus house mephostophilis shall appear in the shape that faustus command at the bottom of this document faustus wrote i john faustus agree that lucifer and his servants can come and carry me away with them after twentyfour years then he signed his name on the contract its done he cried triumphantly but theres something written on my arm cried faustus in alarm homo fuge all his fear came back to him in a rush but where can i run to god will throw me down to hell mephostophilis could see that faustus was regretting what he had done he decided to offer him a little distraction from the terrible signing of the contract he made a discreet sign with his hand and a group of devils entered the study they were richly dressed and they began a ceremonial dance around the room whats this for faustus asked curiously its nothing i just thought it would amuse you mephostophilis said can i raise spirits like these when i want to faustus asked of course you can mephostophilis said you can do much more than that but give me the contract he ordered faustus handed it to him mephostophilis read it quickly there was a gleam in his eye as he folded the piece of paper away carefully then he turned to faustus with a smile now you can ask me anything you want he informed him faustus asked mephostophilis to tell him about hell where exactly is it he wanted to know hell is everywhere replied mephostophilis wherever we devils are that is hell its the place where we suffer and are tortured i dont believe in hell faustus announced firmly i think hells a fable wait until you get there mephostophilis said quietly then youll change your mind do you really think ill go to hell faustus asked uneasily of course you will mephostophilis told him ive got the contract youve promised to give lucifer your soul after twentyfour years its a fable faustus repeated then how do you explain me mephostophilis asked softly i am damned and i am in hell faustus laughed scornfully you can walk around and eat and enjoy yourself if you can do all of that in hell i dont mind being damned but lets not talk about that he decided bring me a wife mephostophilis i want the most beautiful girl in germany for my wife he said excitedly mephostophilis made another discreet sign and a female devil appeared she was old and terribly ugly faustus looked at her in disgust he shrank back against the wall mephostophilis watched faustus with amusement dont talk about wives he said marriage is just an empty ceremony ill bring you the most beautiful girl a different one each day but dont think about marriage if you want me to be your servant and now i have a present for you he said he gave faustus a book this book contains all kinds of magic spells he told him there are spells for gold spells for controlling the wind and all sorts of other magic faustus took the book gratefully he turned the pages quickly thanks mephostophilis he said part four the days after he signed the agreement with lucifer were busy ones for faustus mephostophilis organised a variety of entertainment and a lot of journeys for him they talked together about philosophy and science mephostophilis kept him amused and entertained although sometimes faustus noticed that his devil servant never fully answered the questions that he was asked at times faustus was very unhappy and he blamed mephostophilis for tempting him but mephostophilis mocked him it was your own doing he reminded him you wanted to learn about magic and to have power and money remember you wanted to astonish the world with your learning and your wit you signed the agreement with lucifer im going to give up magic faustus said i want to repent the good angel and the bad angel entered the study give up this magic and god will forgive you the good angel said you have become a devil the bad angel said god cannot forgive you even if i am a devil god can still forgive me faustus said god will forgive me if i repent you will never repent the bad angel told him the good and the bad angels left the study faustus was in terrible agony now he was terrified of what he had done and he tried to repent but it was no good he remembered the wonderful things that mephostophilis had showed him and the places he had seen he knew that the pleasures mephostophilis gave him would prevent him from repenting mephostophilis and faustus had many intellectual discussions together but faustus did not learn very much from them it seemed to him that mephostophilis did not give him any new knowledge he merely repeated things that faustus already knew and there were some questions that he refused to answer at all once they were having a discussion about the movement of the stars and planets faustus asked questions as usual and listened with irritation to the simple answers that his servant from hell gave him at last he expressed his impatience you only tell me things that anyone with some education could tell me he complained bitterly i didnt agree to give my soul to lucifer so that i could hear things that any student might tell me lets talk about something else tell me mephostophilis he asked who made the world mephostophilis was silent for a moment he avoided faustus eyes i wont tell you he said at last please faustus insisted answer my question dont ask me that again mephostophilis said menacingly suddenly faustus gave way to all the anger and frustration he had been feeling you promised to obey me he said angrily that was our agreement i promised to tell you everything that i could mephostophilis replied but this question is against the rules of hell i cant answer it dont think about it any more faustus youd be better to think about hell you are damned faustus was disappointed in mephostophilis and all his bitterness and rage made him determined to outrage his servant i wont think about hell cried faustus i want to think about god who made the world i want to save my soul go away from me you devil he shouted mephostophilis left the room angrily it cant be too late to save my soul faustus cried in misery the good angel and the bad angel entered the room when they heard these desperate words the bad angel who was the first to speak whispered softly it is too late faustus you cannot save your soul now youve gone too far its never too late faustus the good angel said repent faustus and save your soul if you repent faustus devils will come and tear you to pieces the bad angel threatened him repent and they will never touch you the good angel said the two angels left the room faustus decided to make one last effort to be free of lucifer and mephostophilis he began to pray christ help me help to save my soul he began suddenly there was a great crash in the room and lucifer beelzebub and mephostophilis stood in front of him they were angry and faustus was afraid of what they were going to do to him christ cant help you lucifer said coldly you belong to me now faustus who are you faustus asked he was trembling with fear because lucifer and his devils were about to kill him and drag him off to hell with them im lucifer and this is beelzebub faustus looked at lucifer in horror he thought he was going to die youve come to take my soul he cried youve come to carry me off to hell lucifer smiled reassuringly at faustus and shook his head weve come to talk to you he said thats all youre breaking the agreement faustus thats right beelzebub said you shouldnt be talking about god and christ you should be thinking about hell lucifer explained faustus gazed in panic at the three devils that were standing in front of him he was terrified ill never do it again he promised ill never mention god or christ again i promise weve come from hell to show you something amusing beelzebub announced sit down and well show you the seven deadly sins youll enjoy this i promise you mephostophilis bring them in commanded lucifer the seven deadly sins entered the room you can ask them anything beelzebub told faustus airily theyll tell you anything you want to know about them faustus looked at the first deadly sin who are you he asked tell me about yourself i am pride the deadly sin replied haughtily women love me sometimes they put me on their heads and admire themselves sometimes they hang me round their necks like a necklace they adore me the deadly sin paused and pulled an ugly face but whats that terrible smell in here he cried i wont stay here a moment longer unless you sprinkle perfume on the ground and give me the finest carpet to walk on faustus laughed delightedly youre proud all right i can see that he said but what about you he asked turning to the next deadly sin who are you im covetousness the deadly sin replied if i had my way youd all be turned to gold and id lock you in my chest gold gold gold thats what i love and what about you faustus asked the third deadly sin who are you im envy the deadly sin told him i cant read and so i want to burn every book in the world i hate to see other people happy and you faustus asked the fourth deadly sin who are you im wrath i was born in hell and i roam around the world with a sword faustus turned to the fifth deadly sin who are you he asked im gluttony the deadly sin replied my parents are dead and they left me just enough money for thirty meals and ten snacks a day will you ask me to stay for dinner faustus faustus laughed again and dismissed the deadly sin who are you he asked the sixth deadly sin im sloth i lie in the sun all day and i never do anything why have you disturbed me by bringing me here i wont say another word until you put me back in the place i came from and you the seventh asked faustus who are you im lechery the deadly sin told him all my pleasures are in the body thats enough lucifer now announced go away to hell he commanded the deadly sins left what a show said faustus but how i would love to see hell and come back again we can arrange that said lucifer before he left part five mephostophilis and faustus now set out on an eightday tour of the universe they flew around the stars together and faustus learned a great deal about astronomy faustus was delighted with this experience and soon started on another grand journey this time around the world he and mephostophilis finally travelled through the important cities of germany france and italy at last they arrived in rome they saw the historical sights of rome together and faustus was again delighted with the experience mephostophilis now told him that he had planned something special for him were going to the papal palace he announced faustus knew that pope adrian was about to celebrate his victory over the rival german pope bruno an important feast had been planned suddenly he decided that the feast would be a splendid occasion for him to show his powers this feast is a very important one for the pope he said to mephostophilis and id like to play some part in it can you devise some way that i can do that mephostophilis promised to organise something for faustus and the two of them hurried to the palace when they arrived they were just in time to see pope adrian his guest king raymond of hungary and the cardinals with their prisoner bruno the cardinals threw the rival pope to the ground and pope adrian walked over him to reach his throne bruno helps the rightful pope to climb into peters chair commented raymond that place is mine cried bruno bitterly i am the pope pope adrian sneered at brunos words youre my prisoner he told him and youll soon find out what your rightful place is he signalled to the cardinals of france and padua go and find out what the synod has decided to do with bruno he commanded the two cardinals hurried from the chamber faustus suddenly had an idea and began whispering hurriedly to mephostophilis you go with the cardinals he hissed make them fall asleep and then you and i will take their places well talk to the pope and well set bruno free he concluded boldly the rival pope meanwhile was trying to argue with pope adrian you know that i was appointed by the german emperor he said im going to punish the german emperor as well adrian said proudly first ill excommunicate him and then ill take his crown from him bruno tried once more to argue his case what about the promise that pope julius made to the german emperor sigismund he went on he promised that the popes of rome would always acknowledge the german emperor as their lord adrian dismissed the argument with a wave of the hand julius broke the rules of the church when he made that promise he said his decrees mean nothing the power of the whole world belongs to the pope not to emperors and kings just then faustus and mephostophilis entered the chamber disguised as the cardinals of france and padua well asked adrian what has the synod decided to do with bruno they have decided to punish bruno and the german emperor faustus replied solemnly they say that bruno should be executed if his actions were not forced by the emperor he should be burned at the stake pope adrian smiled cruelly take him away with you he ordered faustus and mephostophilis put him in prison and we will decide what to do with him tomorrow and take his crown with you he added put it in the papal treasury faustus and mephostophilis hurried away with bruno and the crown mephostophilis soon smuggled the rival pope away from the city now faustus wanted to attend the popes celebratory feast make me invisible mephostophilis he ordered i want to see what happens to the cardinals whose place we took earlier i wonder what pope adrian will do to them the guests were beginning to arrive for the feast when faustus reached the palace pope adrian was welcoming the cardinals would you like to know what the synod has decided to do with bruno one of the cardinals asked him the pope looked at him in surprise what are you talking about he asked impatiently youve already told me the synods decision that bruno and the german emperor should be punished you know im making my own decision about him tomorrow but we havent said anything the cardinal said in astonishment king raymond intervened angrily dont deny it he said sternly i was there i heard you tell pope adrian what the synod had decided you took bruno away to prison with you and you took his crown away with you as well youre mistaken cried the cardinal fearfully i dont know what youre talking about suddenly pope adrian got very angry take these two to prison he commanded his soldiers if they dont tell us where bruno and the crown are they will die for their sins soldiers suddenly appeared and removed the two terrified cardinals soon the pope and his guests moved to the table to eat faustus went with them moving unseen around the room he was determined to enjoy himself as much as he could every time the pope tried to lift some food to his mouth an invisible hand snatched it away when the pope tried to drink an invisible hand snatched his glass away the pope and his guests were astonished and some of them were frightened i think theres a ghost at the feast one of the archbishops said it must be the unhappy soul of some dead person who cannot find rest he has come here to ask for your blessing you may be right the pope agreed he ordered some priests to say prayers for the dead man then he crossed himself suddenly faustus struck a hard blow at the popes ear pope adrian jumped up from the table holding his ear he was furious at the insult i curse this soul he cried angrily what will you do now faustus mephostophilis asked the pope will ask the priests to curse you with bell book and candle part six faustus and mephostophilis returned to wittenberg after their lengthy travels his friends were happy to see faustus again and they were astonished at his new knowledge his reputation as a learned man grew and eventually he became famous throughout germany the emperor charles v heard of his extraordinary learning and sent for him not all of the emperors knights were happy that faustus had been invited to the palace benvolio in particular was very sceptical about the magic powers that faustus was rumoured to have arent you coming to see faustus the great magician asked his friend martino he says hes going to perform magic tricks never seen before in germany i was out drinking last night replied benvolio and ive got a terrible headache i cant be bothered to watch this magician i may look out of my window to see what happens but i wont come to the palace the emperor welcomed faustus very warmly he thanked him for rescuing bruno from pope adrian and he promised faustus his friendship faustus replied politely to the emperors greeting and assured him of his loyalty then he promised to use his magic powers to amuse the emperor i can make the dead appear he offered grandly then show me alexander the great and his mistress the emperor said show us what they really looked like and do it quickly benvolio muttered to himself as he looked out of the window of his house im tired already and if you dont do something now ill fall asleep faustus overheard benvolios rude comment ill do something dont worry my friend he said under his breath then he turned to charles v when alexander and his mistress appear he advised him you must not ask them anything or touch them they are spirits if you can bring alexander here ill be acteon and become a stag benvolio said sarcastically and ill give you the horns to play your part well faustus muttered after a short time alexander the great appeared in front of the emperor charles watched in astonishment as alexander killed darius and then moved towards his mistress alexander took darius crown and placed it on his mistress head then he turned towards charles and waved to him charles v moved forward as if he wanted to touch alexanders hand faustus put a hand on his shoulder youre forgetting that these are not real people sir he said theyre spirits youre right faustus they were so real i wanted to touch them the emperor said suddenly faustus pointed to the window where benvolio had been watching events everyone looked up benvolio was asleep at the window and there was a pair of horns on his head they gasped in astonishment at the cleverness of the trick benvolio wake up called the emperor whos disturbing me benvolio asked sleepily he put his hands to his head and rubbed it ive got such a headache he complained everyone laughed and pointed at the horns on the unfortunate mans head benvolio was horrified when he realised what faustus had done to him you deserve it faustus said to him remember what you said if you can bring alexander here ill be acteon and become a stag now you have the horns i think ill call some hounds to hunt you down benvolio was terrified now he begged faustus not to call the hounds the emperor asked faustus to remove the horns from the poor mans head faustus agreed to do so later that day several of the emperors knights met to talk about faustus benvolio wanted revenge for the trick that faustus had played on him he was determined to make faustus suffer think very carefully martino warned him faustus is dangerous he insulted me benvolio said if youre a real friend of mine youll help me to avenge that insult calm down frederick said well help you why dont we set an ambush for him he suggested well hide near the road and when faustus comes along well kill him he wont have a chance the three knights waited for faustus to come along they did not have to wait long soon they could see faustus walking by himself along the road they did not know that faustus was wearing a false head hes coming frederick cried in excitement quickly men attack him with your swords benvolio was the first man to take out his sword he ran up behind faustus and struck him on the head with his weapon faustus gave a terrible groan and fell to the ground benvolio cut off his head he wasnt so dangerous after all frederick commented wheres all his magic and power now when he really needs it im going to put some horns on his head and hang it from the window where i was standing earlier benvolio said gleefully the three knights began to talk excitedly about what they would do to hide faustus body they were not looking at him while they were talking faustus quietly climbed to his feet and faced them benvolio was the first to see the headless man stand up hes alive he screamed give him back his head frederick shouted faustus looked at the knights with contempt he smiled grimly at them fools he said dont you know that i was given twentyfour years of life by lucifer nothing can kill me during that time faustus called mephostophilis and some other devils they arrived immediately and stood waiting for his orders well make the world laugh at these men he decided take this one he said pointing at benvolio throw him into some filthy water then he pointed at frederick and drag this one through the woods until his face bleeds finally he pointed at martino take this one he commanded the devils and roll him down a steep cliff to break his bones the emperors court was astonished later in the day when three dirty bloodstained men entered the palace the three men were the emperors knights martino benvolio and frederick it soon became known that the three knights had horns on their heads that they could not remove what can we do frederick asked his friends we cant revenge ourselves on faustus hes too clever for us if we attack him again benvolio said hell just put asses ears on our heads everybody will laugh at us what can we do martino wanted to know we must hide away from everyone benvolio said sadly ive got a castle deep in the country lets go there where no one will see us and laugh at our misfortune part seven faustus increasingly used his magic powers to play a lot of tricks on people one day he was staying in an inn when he was approached by a horsedealer whose business was going badly the horsedealer offered to buy faustus horse which he had seen and admired ill give you forty dollars for the horse he offered faustus smiled at the man you cant buy a horse as good as this one for forty dollars he said im not even sure that i want to sell him but i might change my mind if you offered fifty dollars the horsedealer shook his head sadly i havent got fifty dollars he said bitterly ive lost a lot of money on horses recently please take forty dollars for yours all right faustus agreed ill take forty dollars for the horse but theres one thing youve got to know about this horse hes an excellent animal in every way you can ride him anywhere and hell always do what you want but you mustnt ride him into water do you understand me never take this horse into water whats the matter with him the horsedealer asked he drinks water doesnt he faustus smiled again oh yes he replied he drinks water all right but never ride him over water the horsedealer paid faustus forty dollars and rode the horse away he thought he had made a good bargain and he was a happy man faustus watched the man ride away suddenly he felt unbearably sad he knew that the twentyfour years he had agreed with lucifer were coming to an end he was tired and decided to sleep for a while the horsedealer meanwhile took the horse that faustus had sold him and rode him around for a while the horse was a good animal and very lively the horsedealer wondered why faustus had told him not to ride the animal into water and he decided to find out what would happen he rode the horse into a shallow river the animal suddenly disappeared and the poor man found himself sitting on a wet bundle of straw in the middle of the river faustus was sleeping when the horsedealer came back the man was wet and dirty and he was furious he began shouting and swearing he was looking for faustus and threw open the door of the room where the magician was sleeping he tried to wake him up by pulling his leg and suddenly faustus leg came off in the horsedealers hand what have i done the man cried in despair have i killed him faustus began to call for help murder help me good people im being murdered the horsedealer panicked and ran away faustus laughed to see the man running off ive got my leg back he joked to himself and hes got a bundle of wet straw for his forty dollars faustus was now so famous that important people were always inviting him to their houses so that he could show them his special powers one of the visits that he paid was to the duke of vanholt he showed the duke and his wife many wonderful sights including a castle that floated in the air the duke was very pleased with his guest and thanked him for what he had shown them faustus turned to the dukes wife who was expecting a child ive heard that women in your condition often have strange longings he told her is there any delicacy that i can fetch for you anything in the whole world the duchess thought for a moment and then she smiled there is one thing she told him softly its the middle of winter now and i keep dreaming of grapes i would love to eat some grapes thats an easy matter faustus told her with a smile he made a sign to mephostophilis mephostophilis disappeared and after a few minutes he came back he was carrying a large bunch of grapes in his hand faustus took the grapes and gave them to the duchess with a bow try these he said they should be good the duchess was astonished she took the grapes and ate some theyre delicious she told faustus the best grapes ive ever tasted but where do they come from asked the duke its winter here faustus explained but in other parts of the world its summer mephostophilis flew to another part of the world to pick these grapes for you part eight the twentyfour years of the contract were now nearly over faustus and mephostophilis returned to wittenberg once again faustus servant wagner sensed that a great change was coming but he did not understand what was really happening to his master we just knew that faustus had made a will hes left everything to me the servant said to himself in wonder but if he thinks hes going to die soon why does he go on entertaining people and laughing and joking the servant shook his head sadly there were things about faustus that he could not understand even after all these years of serving him one evening faustus invited two old friends from the university to dine with him the two scholars were delighted with the dinner he gave them and they were pleased to see that faustus had lost none of his old wit and intelligence soon the conversation turned to the great beauties of the classical world faustus said one of the scholars weve all read about helen of troy we know that she was the most beautiful woman of her time can you use your powers to make her appear before us wed like to see for ourselves this wonder of the ancient world faustus smiled at his old friends of course i can he said gently ill make her appear for you he gave a quick signal to mephostophilis and the room was suddenly full of music a few minutes passed and then they saw helen appear the two scholars were amazed i cant describe such beauty one of the scholars said im not surprised the greeks fought a tenyear war for this woman the other scholar said shes the most beautiful woman one could imagine soon afterwards the two scholars thanked faustus for his hospitality and went home he sat by himself for a while thinking about the agreement he had made with lucifer his thoughts were sombre and grim suddenly an old man entered the study give up this magic the old man said gently give it all up faustus and turn to god youve been a wicked man but if you continue youll become a devil give it up faustus and repent faustus looked at the old man in despair its too late be replied quietly my soul is damned i cant do anything about it now i can only die now mephostophilis handed faustus a dagger hell is calling me faustus went on my time is nearly finished faustus pointed the dagger at his heart stop the old man cried dont give in to despair you mustnt think youre too wicked for god to save you that sin of despair is the worst of all i can see an angel above your head faustus ask the angel for forgiveness its not too late the old mans words gave faustus hope let me think about what youve told me he said give me some time to think about my sins ill leave you then the old man agreed but im afraid for you faustus faustus sat in the study thinking hard he repented his agreement with lucifer but he knew there was one sin that he could not overcome the old man is right he told himself this despair of mine is just pride i know that but i cant change myself heaven and hell are fighting inside me suddenly mephostophilis became very angry and began threatening faustus youre going against our agreement he raged you should be thinking about hell and not about saving your soul ill tear you to pieces faustus faustus looked at mephostophilis in horror he was terrified of what lucifer and his devils would do to him if he made them angry forgive me mephostophilis he begged i wont do it again i promise mephostophilis did not say anything but continued glaring fiercely at faustus i didnt mean it really i didnt faustus cried desperately please tell lucifer i didnt mean it tell him ill even write another letter confirming our agreement ill write it in blood like i did before shall i perhaps you should mephostophilis agreed dont hurt me faustus pleaded hurt that old man who came here and talked to me about repentance hes the one to blame not me mephostophilis smiled at faustus the old man i cant do anything to hurt his soul because his faith is very strong but i can hurt his body faustus was very relieved that mephostophilis anger was turning away from him to another victim one last thing i ask of you old friend he now said make helen return here as my lover her beauty will stop these dark thoughts of mine mephostophilis grinned at faustus he knew that this latest wish was a terrible sin and he relished л the idea of faustus losing his soul soon the spirit of helen of troy appeared in the study faustus gazed at her in wonder and awe come to me helen he said and let me kiss you the spirit of helen embraced faustus your kisses take my immortal soul he breathed softly look where it flies away from me kiss me again and give me back my soul the old man entered the study again and stood watching faustus and helen sorrow fully now you are really damned faustus he said angrily youve driven heaven away from you by this wickedness some of lucifers devils now entered the study in terrifying shapes they stood around the old man trying to frighten him my faith is stronger than you the old man told them contemptuously you cant hurt me god will always protect me part nine at last the twentyfour years that lucifer had given faustus came to an end lucifer beelzebub and mephostophilis came up from hell to witness the death of the man who had given them his soul faustus is ours at midnight lucifer said triumphantly his soul is damned for ever the two scholars whom faustus had entertained happened to call on him during the evening and they found faustus in a gloomy mood why didnt i stay here in wittenberg with you faustus asked them sadly my life would have been different and i would not have been damned he must be ill one of the scholars said lets fetch a doctor for him its a moral sickness faustus said and theres no doctor in the world who can cure me if thats really true one of the scholars said pray to god for help faustus smiled grimly at the mention of god then he told his visitors about the secret of his life he explained about the agreement he had made with lucifer and how the twentyfour years were at an end he told them there could be no forgiveness for him pray to god the scholar repeated how can i pray to god faustus cried desperately when i turned away from him all those years ago god will never forgive me besides he went on they stop me praying they hold my hands when i want to pray who does faustus one of the scholars cried who stops you praying lucifer and mephostophilis stop me praying i gave them my soul for my cunning faustus said the two scholars were very sorry for their old friend they did not know what they could do to help him they promised to pray for him the time has nearly come faustus whispered you must go it might be dangerous for you to stay here the scholars did not want to leave him alone so they went into the room next to the study they began to pray for their friends soul when faustus was alone again in the study mephostophilis appeared he seemed very cheerful at the thought of faustus death its all your fault faustus told him you tempted me and i listened to you youve robbed me of the happiness i could have had in heaven its true mephostophilis admitted with a cruel smile i was there right from the start do you remember that evening you were looking through your books on the desk do you remember the page you opened in the bible if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and there is no truth in us it was me that turned the pages of the bible to find those lines it was i faustus the good angel and the bad angel now entered the study you should have listened to me faustus the good angel told him sadly you loved the pleasures of the world too much and now you must try the pains of hell the bad angel mocked him the clock struck eleven just one hour faustus thought with horror and then my soul goes to hell for ever if only the time would go slowly he thought i wish the sun would rise in the sky so that it would never be midnight the clock struck the halfhour time wont stand still for me faustus thought desperately then god dont let me stay in hell for ever a thousand years a hundred thousand years but save me in the end slowly the hands of the clock moved towards midnight at last the moment had come there was a crash of thunder outside the house and lucifer and his devils entered the study they moved towards him grinning and sneering at his suffering no lucifer no give me one more minute faustus cried in horror when the scholars came into faustus study a few hours later they were sure that something dreadful had happened to their friend they had heard the thunder during the night and they were nervous what they saw as they came into the study horrified them faustus had been torn to pieces by the devils the end
