the illustrated manthe illustrated man ray bradbury contents prologue the illustrated man the veldt kaleidoscope the other foot the highway the man the long rain the rocket man the fire balloons the last night of the world the exiles no particular night or morning the fox and the forest the visitor the concrete mixer marionettes inc the city zero hour the rocket epilogue prologue the illustrated man it was a warm afternoon in early september when i first met the illustrated man walking along an asphalt road i was or the final leg of a two weeks walking tour of wisconsin late in the afternoon i stopped ate some pork beans and a doughnut and was preparing to stretch out and read when the illustrated man walked over the hill and stood for a moment against the sky i didnt know he was illustrated then i only knew that he was tall once well muscled but now for some reason going to fat i recall that his arms were long and the hands thick but that his face was like a childs set upon a massive body he seemed only to sense my presence for he didnt look directly at me when he spoke his first words do you know where i can find a job im afraid not i said i havent had a job thats lasted in forty years he said though it was a hot late afternoon he wore his wool shirt buttoned tight about his neck his sleeves were rolled and buttoned down over his thick wrists perspiration was streaming from his face yet he made no move to open his shirt well he said at last this is as good a place as any to spend the night do you mind company i have some extra food youd be welcome to i said he sat down heavily grunting youll be sorry you asked me to stay he said everyone always is thats why im walking here it is early september the cream of the labor day carnival season i should be making money hand over fist at any small town side show celebration but here i am with no prospects he took off an immense shoe and peered at it closely i usually keep a job about ten days then something happens and they fire me by now every carnival in america wont touch me with a tenfoot pole what seems to be the trouble i asked for answer he unbuttoned his tight collar slowly with his eyes shut he put a slow hand to the task of unbuttoning his shirt all the way down he slipped his fingers in to feel his chest funny he said eyes still shut you cant feel them but theyre there i always hope that someday ill look and theyll be gone i walk in the sun for hours on the hottest days baking and hope that my sweatll wash them off the sunll cook them off but at sundown theyre still there he turned his head slightly toward me and exposed his chest are they still there now after a long while i exhaled yes i said theyre still there the illustrations another reason i keep my collar buttoned up he said opening his eyes is the children they follow me along country roads everyone wants to see the pictures and yet nobody wants to see them he took his shirt off and wadded it in his hands he was covered with illustrations from the blue tattooed ring about his neck to his belt line it keeps right on going he said guessing my thought all of me is illustrated look he opened his hand on his palm was a rose freshly cut with drops of crystal water among the soft pink petals i put my hand out to touch it but it was only an illustration as for the rest of him i cannot say how i sat and stared for he was a riot of rockets and fountains and people in such intricate detail and color that you could hear the voices murmuring small and muted from the crowds that inhabited his body when his flesh twitched the tiny mouths flickered the tiny greenandgold eyes winked the tiny pink hands gestured there were yellow meadows and blue rivers and mountains and stars and suns and planets spread in a milky way across his chest the people themselves were in twenty or more odd groups upon his arms shoulders back sides and wrists as well as on the flat of his stomach you found them in forests of hair lurking among a constellation of freckles or peering from armpit caverns diamond eyes aglitter each seemed intent upon his own activity each was a separate gallery portrait why theyre beautiful i said how can i explain about his illustrations if el greco had painted miniatures in his prime no bigger than your hand infinitely detailed with all his sulphurous color elongation and anatomy perhaps he might have used this mans body for his art the colors burned in three dimensions they were windows looking in upon fiery reality here gathered on one wall were all the finest scenes in the universe the man was a walking treasure gallery this wasnt the work of a cheap carnival tattoo man with three colors and whisky on his breath this was the accomplishment of a living genius vibrant clear and beautiful oh yes said the illustrated man im so proud of my illustrations that id like to burn them off ive tried sandpaper acid a knife the sun was setting the moon was already up in the east for you see said the illustrated man these illustrations predict the future i said nothing its all right in sunlight he went on i could keep a carnival day job but at nightthe pictures move the pictures change i must have smiled how long have you been illustrated in when i was twenty years old and working a carnival i broke my leg it laid me up i had to do something to keep my hand in so i decided to get tattooed but who tattooed you what happened to the artist she went back to the future he said i mean it she was an old woman in a little house in the middle of wisconsin here somewhere not far from this place a little old witch who looked a thousand years old one moment and twenty years old the next but she said she could travel in time i laughed now i know better how did you happen to meet her he told me he had seen her painted sign by the road skin illustration illustration instead of tattoo artistic so he had sat all night while her magic needles stung him wasp stings and delicate bee stings by morning he looked like a man who had fallen into a twentycolor print press and been squeezed out all bright and picturesque ive hunted every summer for fifty years he said putting his hands out on the air when i find that witch im going to kill her the sun was gone now the first stars were shining and the moon had brightened the fields of grass and wheat still the illustrated mans pictures glowed like charcoals in the half light like scattered rubies and emeralds with rouault colors and picasso colors and the long pressedout el greco bodies so people fire me when my pictures move they dont like it when violent things happen in my illustrations each illustration is a little story if you watch them in a few minutes they tell you a tale in three hours of looking you could see eighteen or twenty stories acted right on my body you could hear voices and think thoughts its all here just waiting for you to look but most of all theres a special spot on my body he bared his back see theres no special design on my right shoulder blade just a jumble yes when ive been around a person long enough that spot clouds over and fills in if im with a woman her picture comes there on my back in an hour and shows her whole lifehow shell live how shell die what shell look like when shes sixty and if its a man an hour later his pictures here on my back it shows him falling off a cliff or dying under a train so im fired again all the time he had been talking his hands had wandered over the illustrations as if to adjust their frames to brush away dustthe motions of a connoisseur an art patron now he lay back long and full in the moonlight it was a warm night there was no breeze and the air was stifling we both had our shirts off and youve never found the old woman never and you think she came from the future how else could she know these stories she painted on me he shut his eyes tiredly his voice grew fainter sometimes at night i can feel them the pictures like ants crawling on my skin then i know theyre doing what they have to do i never look at them any more i just try to rest i dont sleep much dont you look at them either i warn you turn the other way when you sleep i lay back a few feet from him he didnt seem violent and the pictures were beautiful otherwise i might have been tempted to get out and away from such babbling but the illustrations i let my eyes fill up on them any person would go a little mad with such things upon his body the night was serene i could hear the illustrated mans breathing in the moonlight crickets were stirring gently in the distant ravines i lay with my body sidewise so i could watch the illustrations perhaps half an hour passed whether the illustrated man slept i could not tell but suddenly i heard him whisper theyre moving arent they i waited a minute then i said yes the pictures were moving each in its turn each for a brief minute or two there in the moonlight with the tiny tinkling thoughts and the distant sea voices it seemed each little drama was enacted whether it took an hour or three hours for the dramas to finish it would be hard to say i only know that i lay fascinated and did not move while the stars wheeled in the sky eighteen illustrations eighteen tales i counted them one by one primarily my eyes focused upon a scene a large house with two people in it i saw a flight of vultures on a blazing flesh sky i saw yellow lions and i heard voices the first illustration quivered and came to life the veldt george i wish youd look at the nursery whats wrong with it i dont know well then i just want you to look at it is all or call a psychologist in to look at it what would a psychologist want with a nursery you know very well what hed want his wife paused in the middle of the kitchen and watched the stove busy humming to itself making supper for four its just that the nursery is different now than it was all right lets have a look they walked down the hall of their soundproofed happylife home which had cost them thirty thousand dollars installed this house which clothed and fed and rocked them to sleep and played and sang and was good to them their approach sensitized a switch somewhere and the nursery light flicked on when they came within ten feet of it similarly behind them in the halls lights went on and off as they left them behind with a soft automaticity well said george hadley they stood on the thatched floor of the nursery it was forty feet across by forty feet long and thirty feet high it had cost half again as much as the rest of the house but nothings too good for our children george had said the nursery was silent it was empty as a jungle glade at hot high noon the walls were blank and two dimensional now as george and lydia hadley stood in the center of the room the walls began to purr and recede into crystalline distance it seemed and presently an african veldt appeared in three dimensions on all sides in color reproduced to the final pebble and bit of straw the ceiling above them became a deep sky with a hot yellow sun george hadley felt the perspiration start on his brow lets get out of this sun he said this is a little too real but i dont see anything wrong wait a moment youll see said his wife now the hidden odorophonics were beginning to blow a wind of odor at the two people in the middle of the baked veldtland the hot straw smell of lion grass the cool green smell of the hidden water hole the great rusty smell of animals the smell of dust like a red paprika in the hot air and now the sounds the thump of distant antelope feet on grassy sod the papery rustling of vultures a shadow passed through the sky the shadow flickered on george hadleys upturned sweating face filthy creatures he heard his wife say the vultures you see there are the lions far over that way now theyre on their way to the water hole theyve just been eating said lydia i dont know what some animal george hadley put his hand up to shield off the burning light from his squinted eyes a zebra or a baby giraffe maybe are you sure his wife sounded peculiarly tense no its a little late to be sure be said amused nothing over there i can see but cleaned bone and the vultures dropping for whats left did you hear that scream she asked no about a minute ago sorry no the lions were coming and again george hadley was filled with admiration for the mechanical genius who had conceived this room a miracle of efficiency selling for an absurdly low price every home should have one oh occasionally they frightened you with their clinical accuracy they startled you gave you a twinge but most of the time what fun for everyone not only your own son and daughter but for yourself when you felt like a quick jaunt to a foreign land a quick change of scenery well here it was and here were the lions now fifteen feet away so real so feverishly and startlingly real that you could feel the prickling fur on your hand and your mouth was stuffed with the dusty upholstery smell of their heated pelts and the yellow of them was in your eyes like the yellow of an exquisite french tapestry the yellows of lions and summer grass and the sound of the matted lion lungs exhaling on the silent noontide and the smell of meat from the panting dripping mouths the lions stood looking at george and lydia hadley with terrible greenyellow eyes watch out screamed lydia the lions came running at them lydia bolted and ran instinctively george sprang after her outside in the hall with the door slammed he was laughing and she was crying and they both stood appalled at the others reaction george lydia oh my dear poor sweet lydia they almost got us walls lydia remember crystal walls thats all they are oh they look real i must admitafrica in your parlorbut its all dimensional superreactionary supersensitive color film and mental tape film behind glass screens its all odorophonics and sonics lydia heres my handkerchief im afraid she came to him and put her body against him and cried steadily did you see did you feel its too real now lydia youve got to tell wendy and peter not to read any more on africa of courseof course he patted her promise sure and lock the nursery for a few days until i get my nerves settled you know how difficult peter is about that when i punished him a month ago by locking the nursery for even a few hoursthe tantrum be threw and wendy too they live for the nursery its got to be locked thats all there is to it all right reluctantly he locked the huge door youve been working too hard you need a rest i dont knowi dont know she said blowing her nose sitting down in a chair that immediately began to rock and comfort her maybe i dont have enough to do maybe i have time to think too much why dont we shut the whole house off for a few days and take a vacation you mean you want to fry my eggs for me yes she nodded and darn my socks yes a frantic wateryeyed nodding and sweep the house yes yesoh yes but i thought thats why we bought this house so we wouldnt have to do anything thats just it i feel like i dont belong here the house is wife and mother now and nursemaid can i compete with an african veldt can i give a bath and scrub the children as efficiently or quickly as the automatic scrub bath can i cannot and it isnt just me its you youve been awfully nervous lately i suppose i have been smoking too much you look as if you didnt know what to do with yourself in this house either you smoke a little more every morning and drink a little more every afternoon and need a little more sedative every night youre beginning to feel unnecessary too am i he paused and tried to feel into himself to see what was really there oh george she looked beyond him at the nursery door those lions cant get out of there can they he looked at the door and saw it tremble as if something had jumped against it from the other side of course not he said at dinner they ate alone for wendy and peter were at a special plastic carnival across town and had televised home to say theyd be late to go ahead eating so george hadley bemused sat watching the diningroom table produce warm dishes of food from its mechanical interior we forgot the ketchup he said sorry said a small voice within the table and ketchup appeared as for the nursery thought george hadley it wont hurt for the children to be locked out of it awhile too much of anything isnt good for anyone and it was clearly indicated that the children had been spending a little too much time on africa that sun he could feel it on his neck still like a hot paw and the lions and the smell of blood remarkable how the nursery caught the telepathic emanations of the childrens minds and created life to fill their every desire the children thought lions and there were lions the children thought zebras and there were zebras sunsun giraffesgiraffes death and death that last he chewed tastelessly on the meat that the table bad cut for him death thoughts they were awfully young wendy and peter for death thoughts or no you were never too young really long before you knew what death was you were wishing it on someone else when you were two years old you were shooting people with cap pistols but thisthe long hot african veldtthe awful death in the jaws of a lion and repeated again and again where are you going he didnt answer lydia preoccupied be let the lights glow softly on ahead of him extinguish behind him as he padded to the nursery door he listened against it far away a lion roared he unlocked the door and opened it just before he stepped inside he heard a faraway scream and then another roar from the lions which subsided quickly he stepped into africa how many times in the last year had he opened this door and found wonderland alice the mock turtle or aladdin and his magical lamp or jack pumpkinhead of oz or dr doolittle or the cow jumping over a very realappearing moonall the delightful contraptions of a makebelieve world how often had he seen pegasus flying in the sky ceiling or seen fountains of red fireworks or heard angel voices singing but now this yellow hot africa this bake oven with murder in the heat perhaps lydia was right perhaps they needed a little vacation from the fantasy which was growing a bit too real for tenyearold children it was all right to exercise ones mind with gymnastic fantasies but when the lively child mind settled on one pattern it seemed that at a distance for the past month he had heard lions roaring and smelled their strong odor seeping as far away as his study door but being busy he had paid it no attention george hadley stood on the african grassland alone the lions looked up from their feeding watching him the only flaw to the illusion was the open door through which he could see his wife far down the dark hall like a framed picture eating her dinner abstractedly go away he said to the lions they did not go he knew the principle of the room exactly you sent out your thoughts whatever you thought would appear lets have aladdin and his lamp he snapped the veldtland remained the lions remained come on room i demand aladdin he said nothing happened the lions mumbled in their baked pelts aladdin he went back to dinner the fool rooms out of order he said it wont respond or or what or it cant respond said lydia because the children have thought about africa and lions and killing so many days that the rooms in a rut could be or peters set it to remain that way set it he may have got into the machinery and fixed something peter doesnt know machinery hes a wise one for ten that iq of his nevertheless hello mom hello dad the hadleys turned wendy and peter were coming in the front door cheeks like peppermint candy eyes like bright blue agate marbles a smell of ozone on their jumpers from their trip in the helicopter youre just in time for supper said both parents were full of strawberry ice cream and hot dogs said the children holding hands but well sit and watch yes come tell us about the nursery said george hadley the brother and sister blinked at him and then at each other nursery all about africa and everything said the father with false joviality i dont understand said peter your mother and i were just traveling through africa with rod and reel tom swift and his electric lion said george hadley theres no africa in the nursery said peter simply oh come now peter we know better i dont remember any africa said peter to wendy do you no run see and come tell she obeyed wendy come back here said george hadley but she was gone the house lights followed her like a flock of fireflies too late he realized he had forgotten to lock the nursery door after his last inspection wendyll look and come tell us said peter she doesnt have to tell me ive seen it im sure youre mistaken father im not peter come along now but wendy was back its not africa she said breathlessly well see about this said george hadley and they all walked down the hall together and opened the nursery door there was a green lovely forest a lovely river a purple mountain high voices singing and rima lovely and mysterious lurking in the trees with colorful flights of butterflies like animated bouquets lingering in her long hair the african veldtland was gone the lions were gone only rima was here now singing a song so beautiful that it brought tears to your eyes george hadley looked in at the changed scene go to bed he said to the children they opened their mouths you heard me he said they went off to the air closet where a wind sucked them like brown leaves up the flue to their slumber rooms george hadley walked through the singing glade and picked up something that lay in the corner near where the lions had been he walked slowly back to his wife what is that she asked an old wallet of mine he said he showed it to her the smell of hot grass was on it and the smell of a lion there were drops of saliva on it it had been chewed and there were blood smears on both sides he closed the nursery door and locked it tight in the middle of the night he was still awake and he knew his wife was awake do you think wendy changed it she said at last in the dark room of course made it from a veldt into a forest and put rima there instead of lions yes why i dont know but its staying locked until i find out how did your wallet get there i dont know anything he said except that im beginning to be sorry we bought that room for the children if children are neurotic at all a room like that its supposed to help them work off their neuroses in a healthful way im starting to wonder he stared at the ceiling weve given the children everything they ever wanted is this our rewardsecrecy disobedience who was it said children are carpets they should be stepped on occasionally weve never lifted a hand theyre insufferablelets admit it they come and go when they like they treat us as if we were offspring theyre spoiled and were spoiled theyve been acting funny ever since you forbade them to take the rocket to new york a few months ago theyre not old enough to do that alone i explained nevertheless ive noticed theyve been decidedly cool toward us since i think ill have david mcclean come tomorrow morning to have a look at africa but its not africa now its green mansions country and rima i have a feeling itll be africa again before then a moment later they heard the screams two screams two people screaming from downstairs and then a roar of lions wendy and peter arent in their rooms said his wife he lay in his bed with his beating heart no he said theyve broken into the nursery those screamsthey sound familiar do they yes awfully and although their beds tried very hard the two adults couldnt be rocked to sleep for another hour a smell of cats was in the night air father said peter yes peter looked at his shoes he never looked at his father any more nor at his mother you arent going to lock up the nursery for good are you that all depends on what snapped peter on you and your sister if you intersperse this africa with a little varietyoh sweden perhaps or denmark or china i thought we were free to play as we wished you are within reasonable bounds whats wrong with africa father oh so now you admit you have been conjuring up africa do you i wouldnt want the nursery locked up said peter coldly ever matter of fact were thinking of turning the whole house off for about a month live sort of a carefree oneforall existence that sounds dreadful would i have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it and brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath it would be fun for a change dont you think no it would be horrid i didnt like it when you took out the picture painter last month thats because i wanted you to learn to paint all by yourself son i dont want to do anything but look and listen and smell what else is there to do all right go play in africa will you shut off the house sometime soon were considering it i dont think youd better consider it any more father i wont have any threats from my son very well and peter strolled off to the nursery am i on time said david mcclean breakfast asked george hadley thanks had some whats the trouble david youre a psychologist i should hope so well then have a look at our nursery you saw it a year ago when you dropped by did you notice anything peculiar about it then cant say i did the usual violences a tendency toward a slight paranoia here or there usual in children because they feel persecuted by parents constantly but oh really nothing they walked down the ball i locked the nursery up explained the father and the children broke back into it during the night i let them stay so they could form the patterns for you to see there was a terrible screaming from the nursery there it is said george hadley see what you make of it they walked in on the children without rapping the screams had faded the lions were feeding run outside a moment children said george hadley no dont change the mental combination leave the walls as they are get with the children gone the two men stood studying the lions clustered at a distance eating with great relish whatever it was they had caught i wish i knew what it was said george hadley sometimes i can almost see do you think if i brought highpowered binoculars here and david mcclean laughed dryly hardly he turned to study all four walls how long has this been going on a little over a month it certainly doesnt feel good i want facts not feelings my dear george a psychologist never saw a fact in his life he only hears about feelings vague things this doesnt feel good i tell you trust my hunches and my instincts i have a nose for something bad this is very bad my advice to you is to have the whole damn room torn down and your children brought to me every day during the next year for treatment is it that bad im afraid so one of the original uses of these nurseries was so that we could study the patterns left on the walls by the childs mind study at our leisure and help the child in this case however the room has become a channel towarddestructive thoughts instead of a release away from them didnt you sense this before i sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now youre letting them down in some way what way i wouldnt let them go to new york what else ive taken a few machines from the house and threatened them a month ago with closing up the nursery unless they did their homework i did close it for a few days to show i meant business ah ha does that mean anything everything where before they had a santa claus now they have a scrooge children prefer santas youve let this room and this house replace you and your wife in your childrens affections this room is their mother and father far more important in their lives than their real parents and now you come along and want to shut it off no wonder theres hatred here you can feel it coming out of the sky feel that sun george youll have to change your life like too many others youve built it around creature comforts why youd starve tomorrow if something went wrong in your kitchen you wouldnt know how to tap an egg nevertheless turn everything off start new itll take time but well make good children out of bad in a year wait and see but wont the shock be too much for the children shutting the room up abruptly for good i dont want them going any deeper into this thats all the lions were finished with their red feast the lions were standing on the edge of the clearing watching the two men now im feeling persecuted said mcclean lets get out of here i never have cared for these damned rooms make me nervous the lions look real dont they said george hadley i dont suppose theres any way what that they could become real not that i know some flaw in the machinery a tampering or something no they went to the door i dont imagine the room will like being turned off said the father nothing ever likes to dieeven a room i wonder if it hates me for wanting to switch it off paranoia is thick around here today said david mcclean you can follow it like a spoor hello he bent and picked up a bloody scarf this yours no george hadleys face was rigid it belongs to lydia they went to the fuse box together and threw the switch that killed the nursery the two children were in hysterics they screamed and pranced and threw things they yelled and sobbed and swore and jumped at the furniture you cant do that to the nursery you cant now children the children flung themselves onto a couch weeping george said lydia hadley turn on the nursery just for a few moments you cant be so abrupt no you cant be so cruel lydia its off and it stays off and the whole damn house dies as of here and now the more i see of the mess weve put ourselves in the more it sickens me weve been contemplating our mechanical electronic navels for too long my god how we need a breath of honest air and he marched about the house turning off the voice clocks the stoves the heaters the shoe shiners the shoe lacers the body scrubbers and swabbers and massagers and every other machine be could put his hand to the house was full of dead bodies it seemed it felt like a mechanical cemetery so silent none of the humming hidden energy of machines waiting to function at the tap of a button dont let them do it wailed peter at the ceiling as if he was talking to the house the nursery dont let father kill everything he turned to his father oh i hate you insults wont get you anywhere i wish you were dead we were for a long while now were going to really start living instead of being handled and massaged were going to live wendy was still crying and peter joined her again just a moment just one moment just another moment of nursery they wailed oh george said the wife it cant hurt all rightall right if theyll just shut up one minute mind you and then off forever daddy daddy daddy sang the children smiling with wet faces and then were going on a vacation david mcclean is coming back in half an hour to help us move out and get to the airport im going to dress you turn the nursery on for a minute lydia just a minute mind you and the three of them went babbling off while he let himself be vacuumed upstairs through the air flue and set about dressing himself a minute later lydia appeared ill be glad when we get away she sighed did you leave them in the nursery i wanted to dress too oh that horrid africa what can they see in it well in five minutes well be on our way to iowa lord how did we ever get in this house what prompted us to buy a nightmare pride money foolishness i think wed better get downstairs before those kids get engrossed with those damned beasts again just then they heard the children calling daddy mommy come quickquick they went downstairs in the air flue and ran down the hall the children were nowhere in sight wendy peter they ran into the nursery the veldtland was empty save for the lions waiting looking at them peter wendy the door slammed wendy peter george hadley and his wife whirled and ran back to the door open the door cried george hadley trying the knob why theyve locked it from the outside peter he beat at the door open up he heard peters voice outside against the door dont let them switch off the nursery and the house he was saying mr and mrs george hadley beat at the door now dont be ridiculous children its time to go mr mccleanll be here in a minute and and then they heard the sounds the lions on three sides of them in the yellow veldt grass padding through the dry straw rumbling and roaring in their throats the lions mr hadley looked at his wife and they turned and looked back at the beasts edging slowly forward crouching tails stiff mr and mrs hadley screamed and suddenly they realized why those other screams had sounded familiar well here i am said david mcclean in the nursery doorway oh hello he stared at the two children seated in the center of the open glade eating a little picnic lunch beyond them was the water hole and the yellow veldtland above was the hot sun he began to perspire where are your father and mother the children looked up and smiled oh theyll be here directly good we must get going at a distance mr mcclean saw the lions fighting and clawing and then quieting down to feed in silence under the shady trees he squinted at the lions with his hand tip to his eyes now the lions were done feeding they moved to the water hole to drink a shadow flickered over mr mccleans hot face many shadows flickered the vultures were dropping down the blazing sky a cup of tea asked wendy in the silence the illustrated man shifted in his sleep he turned and each time he turned another picture came to view coloring his back his arm his wrist he flung a hand over the dry night grass the fingers uncurled and there upon his palm another illustration stirred to life he twisted and on his chest was an empty space of stars and blackness deep deep and something moving among those stars something falling in the blackness falling while i watched kaleidoscope the first concussion cut the rocket up the side with a giant can opener the men were thrown into space like a dozen wriggling silverfish they were scattered into a dark sea and the ship in a million pieces went on a meteor swarm seeking a lost sun barkley barkley where are you the sound of voices calling like lost children on a cold night woode woode captain hollis hollis this is stone stone this is hollis where are you i dont know how can i which way is up im falling good god im falling they fell they fell as pebbles fall down wells they were scattered as jackstones are scattered from a gigantic throw and now instead of men there were only voicesall kinds of voices disembodied and impassioned in varying degrees of tenor and resignation were going away from each other this was true hollis swinging head over heels knew this was true he knew it with a vague acceptance they were parting to go their separate ways and nothing could bring them back they were wearing their sealedtight space suits with the glass tubes over their pale faces but they hadnt had time to lock on their force units with them they could be small lifeboats in space saving themselves saving others collecting together finding each other until they were an island of men with some plan but without the force units snapped to their shoulders they were meteors senseless each going to a separate and irrevocable fate a period of perhaps ten minutes elapsed while the first terror died and a metallic calm took its place space began to weave its strange voices in and out on a great dark loom crossing recrossing making a final pattern stone to hollis how long can we talk by phone it depends on how fast youre going your way and im going mine an hour i make it that should do it said hollis abstracted and quiet what happened said hollis a minute later the rocket blew up thats all rockets do blow up which way are you going it looks like ill hit the moon its earth for me back to old mother earth at ten thousand miles per hour ill burn like a match hollis thought of it with a queer abstraction of mind he seemed to be removed from his body watching it fall down and down through space as objective as he had been in regard to the first falling snowflakes of a winter season long gone the others were silent thinking of the destiny that had brought them to this falling falling and nothing they could do to change it even the captain was quiet for there was no command or plan he knew that could put things back together again oh its a long way down oh its a long way down a long long long way down said a voice i dont want to die i dont want to die its a long way down whos that i dont know stimson i think stimson is that you its a long long way and i dont like it oh god i dont like it stimson this is hollis stimson you hear me a pause while they fell separate from one another stimson yes he replied at last stimson take it easy were all in the same fix i dont want to be here i want to be somewhere else theres a chance well be found i must be i must be said stimson i dont believe this i dont believe any of this is happening its a bad dream said someone shut up said hollis come and make me said the voice it was applegate he laughed easily with a similar objectivity come and shut me up hollis for the first time felt the impossibility of his position a great anger filled him for he wanted more than anything at this moment to be able to do something to applegate he had wanted for many years to do something and now it was too late applegate was only a telephonic voice falling falling falling now as if they had discovered the horror two of the men began to scream in a nightmare hollis saw one of them float by very near screaming and screaming stop it the man was almost at his fingertips screaming insanely he would never stop he would go on screaming for a million miles as long as he was in radio range disturbing all of them making it impossible for them to talk to one another hollis reached out it was best this way he made the extra effort and touched the man he grasped the mans ankle and pulled himself up along the body until he reached the head the man screamed and clawed frantically like a drowning swimmer the screaming filled the universe one way or the other thought hollis the moon or earth or meteors will kill him so why not now he smashed the mans glass mask with his iron fist the screaming stopped he pushed off from the body and let it spin away on its own course falling falling falling down space hollis and the rest of them went in the long endless dropping and whirling of silence hollis you still there hollis did not speak but felt the rush of heat in his face this is applegate again all right applegate lets talk we havent anything else to do the captain cut in thats enough of that weve got to figure a way out of this captain why dont you shut up said applegate what you heard me captain dont pull your rank on me youre ten thousand miles away by now and lets not kid ourselves as stimson puts it its a long way down see here applegate can it this is a mutiny of one i havent a damn thing to lose your ship was a bad ship and you were a bad captain and i hope you break when you hit the moon im ordering you to stop co on order me again applegate smiled across ten thousand miles the captain was silent applegate continued where were we hollis oh yes i remember i hate you too but you know that youve known it for a long time hollis clenched his lists helplessly i want to tell you something said applegate make you happy i was the one who blackballed you with the rocket company five years ago a meteor flashed by hollis looked down and his left hand was gone blood spurted suddenly there was no air in his suit he had enough air in his lungs to move his right hand over and twist a knob at his left elbow tightening the joint and sealing the leak it had happened so quickly that he was not surprised nothing surprised him any more the air in the suit came back to normal in an instant now that the leak was sealed and the blood that had flowed so swiftly was pressured as he fastened the knob yet tighter until it made a tourniquet all of this took place in a terrible silence on his part and the other men chatted that one man lespere went on and on with his talk about his wife on mars his wife on venus his wife on jupiter his money his wondrous times his drunkenness his gambling his happiness on and on while they all fell lespere reminisced on the past happy while he fell to his death it was so very odd space thousands of miles of space and these voices vibrating in the center of it no one visible at all and only the radio waves quivering and trying to quicken other men into emotion are you angry hollis no and he was not the abstraction had returned and he was a thing of dull concrete forever falling nowhere you wanted to get to the top all your life hollis you always wondered what happened i put the black mark on you just before i was tossed out myself that isnt important said hollis and it was not it was gone when life is over it is like a flicker of bright film an instant on the screen all of its prejudices and passions condensed and illumined for an instant on space and before you could cry out there was a happy day there a bad one there an evil face there a good one the film burned to a cinder the screen went dark from this outer edge of his life looking back there was only one remorse and that was only that he wished to go on living did all dying people feel this way as if they had never lived did life seem that short indeed over and done before you took a breath did it seem this abrupt and impossible to everyone or only to himself here now with a few hours left to him for thought and deliberation one of the other men lespere was talking well i had me a good time i had a wife on mars venus and jupiter each of them had money and treated me swell i got drunk and once i gambled away twenty thousand dollars but youre here now thought hollis i didnt have any of those things when i was living i was jealous of you lespere when i had another day ahead of me i envied you your women and your good times women frightened me and i went into space always wanting them and jealous of you for having them and money and as much happiness as you could have in your own wild way but now falling here with everything over im not jealous of you any more because its over for you as it is for me and right now its like it never was hollis craned his face forward and shouted into the telephone its all over lespere silence its just as if it never was lespere whos that lesperes faltering voice this is hollis he was being mean he felt the meanness the senseless meanness of dying applegate had hurt him now he wanted to hurt another applegate and space had both wounded him youre out here lespere its all over its just as if it had never happened isnt it no when anythings over its just like it never happened wheres your life any better than mine now now is what counts is it any better is it yes its better how because i got my thoughts i remember cried lespere far away indignant holding his memories to his chest with both hands and he was right with a feeling of cold water rusting through his head and body hollis knew he was right there were differences between memories and dreams he had only dreams of things he had wanted to do while lespere had memories of things done and accomplished and this knowledge began to pull hollis apart with a slow quivering precision what good does it do you he cried to lespere now when a things over its not good any more youre no better off than me im resting easy said lespere ive had my turn im not getting mean at the end like you mean hollis turned the word on his tongue he had never been mean as long as he could remember in his life he had never dared to be mean he must have saved it all of these years for such a time as this mean he rolled the word into the back of his mind he felt tears start into his eyes and roll down his face someone must have heard his gasping voice take it easy hollis it was of course ridiculous only a minute before he had been giving advice to others to stimson he had felt a braveness which he had thought to be the genuine thing and now he knew that it had been nothing but shock and the objectivity possible in shock now he was trying to pack a lifetime of suppressed emotion into an interval of minutes i know how you feel hollis said lespere now twenty thousand miles away his voice fading i dont take it personally but arent we equal he wondered lespere and i here now if a things over its done and what good is it you die anyway but he knew he was rationalizing for it was like trying to tell the difference between a live man and a corpse there was a spark in one and not in the otheran aura a mysterious element so it was with lespere and himself lespere had lived a good full life and it made him a different man now and he hollis had been as good as dead for many years they came to death by separate paths and in all likelihood if there were kinds of death their kinds would be as different as night from day the quality of death like that of life must be of an infinite variety and if one has already died once then what was there to look for in dying for good and all as he was now it was a second later that he discovered his right foot was cut sheer away it almost made him laugh the air was gone from his suit again he bent quickly and there was blood and the meteor had taken flesh and suit away to the ankle oh death in space was most humorous it cut you away piece by piece like a black and invisible butcher he tightened the valve at the knee his head whirling into pain fighting to remain aware and with the valve tightened the blood retained the air kept he straightened up and went on falling falling for that was all there was left to do hollis hollis nodded sleepily tired of waiting for death this is applegate again said the voice yes ive had time to think i listened to you this isnt good it makes us bad this is a bad way to die it brings all the bile out you listening hollis yes i lied a minute ago i lied i didnt blackball you i dont know why i said that guess i wanted to hurt you you seemed the one to hurt weve always fought guess im getting old fast and repenting fast i guess listening to you be mean made me ashamed whatever the reason i want you to know i was an idiot too theres not an ounce of truth in what i said to hell with you hollis felt his heart begin to work again it seemed as if it hadnt worked for five minutes but now all of his limbs began to take color and warmth the shock was over and the successive shocks of anger and terror and loneliness were passing he felt like a man emerging from a cold shower in the morning ready for breakfast and a new day thanks applegate dont mention it up your nose you bastard hey said stone what hollis called across space for stone of all of them was a good friend ive got myself into a meteor swarm some little asteroids meteors i think its the myrmidone cluster that goes out past mars and in toward earth once every five years im right in the middle its like a big kaleidoscope you get all kinds of colors and shapes and sizes god its beautiful all that metal silence im going with them said stone theyre taking me off with them ill be damned he laughed hollis looked to see but saw nothing there were only the great diamonds and sapphires and emerald mists and velvet inks of space with gods voice mingling among the crystal fires there was a kind of wonder and imagination in the thought of stone going off in the meteor swarm out past mars for years and coming in toward earth every five years passing in and out of the planets ken for the next million centuries stone and the myrmidone cluster eternal and unending shifting and shaping like the kaleidoscope colors when you were a child and held the long tube to the sun and gave it a twirl so long hollis stones voice very faint now so long good luck shouted hollis across thirty thousand miles dont be funny said stone and was gone the stars closed in now all the voices were fading each on his own trajectory some to mars others into farthest space and hollis himself he looked down he of all the others was going back to earth alone so long take it easy so long hollis that was applegate the many goodbys the short farewells and now the great loose brain was disintegrating the components of the brain which had worked so beautifully and efficiently in the skull case of the rocket ship firing through space were dying one by one the meaning of their life together was falling apart and as a body dies when the brain ceases functioning so the spirit of the ship and their long time together and what they meant to one another was dying applegate was now no more than a finger blown from the parent body no longer to be despised and worked against the brain was exploded and the senseless useless fragments of it were far scattered the voices faded and now all of space was silent hollis was alone falling they were all alone their voices had died like echoes of the words of god spoken and vibrating in the starred deep there went the captain to the moon there stone with the meteor swarm there stimson there applegate toward pluto there smith and turner and underwood and all the rest the shards of the kaleidoscope that had formed a thinking pattern for so long hurled apart and i thought hollis what can i do is there anything i can do now to make up for a terrible and empty life if only i could do one good thing to make up for the meanness i collected all these years and didnt even know was in me but theres no one here but myself and how can you do good all alone you cant tomorrow night ill hit earths atmosphere ill burn he thought and be scattered in ashes all over the continental lands ill be put to use just a little bit but ashes are ashes and theyll add to the land he fell swiftly like a bullet like a pebble like an iron weight objective objective all of the time now not sad or happy or anything but only wishing he could do a good thing now that everything was gone a good thing for just himself to know about when i hit the atmosphere ill burn like a meteor i wonder he said if anyonell see me the small boy on the country road looked up and screamed look mom look a falling star the blazing white star fell down the sky of dusk in illinois make a wish said his mother make a wish the illustrated man turned in the moonlight he turned again and again and again the other foot when they heard the news they came out of the restaurants and cafйs and hotels and looked at the sky they lifted their dark hands over their upturned white eyes their mouths hung wide in the hot noon for thousands of miles there were little towns where the dark people stood with their shadows under them looking up in her kitchen hattie johnson covered the boiling soup wiped her thin fingers on a cloth and walked carefully to the back porch come on ma hey ma come onyoull miss it hey mom three little negro boys danced around in the dusty yard yelling now and then they looked at the house frantically im coming said hattie and opened the screen door where you hear this rumor up at joness ma they say a rockets coming first one in twenty years with a white man in it whats a white man i never seen one youll find out said hattie yes indeed youll find out tell us about one ma tell like you did hattie frowned well its been a long time i was a little girl you see that was back in tell us about a white man mom she came and stood in the yard looking up at the blue clear martian sky with the thin white martian clouds and in the distance the martian hills broiling in the heat she said at last well first of all they got white hands white hands the boys joked slapping each other and they got white arms white arms hooted the boys and white faces white faces really white like this mom the smallest threw dust on his face sneezing this way whiter than that she said gravely and turned to the sky again there was a troubled thing in her eyes as if she was looking for a thundershower up high and not seeing it made her worry maybe you better go inside oh mom they stared at her in disbelief we got to watch we just got to nothings going to happen is it i dont know i got a feeling is all we just want to see the ship and maybe run down to the port and see that white man whats he like huh mom i dont know i just dont know she mused shaking her head tell us some more well the white people live on earth which is where we all come from twenty years ago we just up and walked away and came to mars and set down and built towns and here we are now were martians instead of earth people and no white menve come up here in all that time thats the story why didnt they come up mom well cause right after we got up here earth got in an atom war they blew each other up terribly they forgot us when they finished fighting after years they didnt have any rockets took them until recently to build more so here they come now twenty years later to visit she gazed at her children numbly and then began to walk you wait here im going down the line to elizabeth browns house you promise to stay we dont want to but we will all right then and she ran off down the road at the browns she arrived in time to see everybody packed into the family car hey there hattie come on along where you going she said breathlessly running up to see the white man thats right said mr brown seriously he waved at his load these children never saw one and i almost forgot what you going to do with that white man asked hattie do said everyone whyjust look at him is all you sure what else can we do i dont know said hattie i just thought there might be trouble what kind of trouble you know said hattie vaguely embarrassed you aint going to lynch him lynch him everyone laughed mr brown slapped his knee why bless you child no were going to shake his hand aint we everyone sure sure another car drove up from another direction and hattie gave a cry willie what you doing way down here wherere the kids shouted her husband angrily he glared at the others you going down like a bunch of fools to see that man come in that appears to be just right agreed mr brown nodding and smiling well take your guns along said willie im on my way home for mine right now willie you get in this car hattie he held the door open firmly looking at her until she obeyed without another word to the others he roared the car down the dusty road willie not so fast not so fast huh well see about that he watched the road tear under the car what right they got coming up here this late why dont they leave us in peace why didnt they blow themselves up on that old world and let us be willie that aint no christian way to talk im not feeling christian he said savagely gripping the wheel im just feeling mean after all them years of doing what they did to our folksmy mom and dad and your mom and dad you remember you remember how they hung my father on knockwood hill and shot my mother you remember or you got a memory thats short like the others i remember she said you remember dr phillips and mr burton and their big houses and my mothers washing shack and dad working when he was old and the thanks he got was being hung by dr phillips and mr button well said willie the shoes on the other foot now well see who gets laws passed against him who gets lynched who rides the back of streetcars who gets segregated in shows well just wait and see oh willie youre talking trouble everybodys talking everybodys thought on this day thinking itd never be thinking what kind of day would it be if the white man ever came up here to mars but heres the day and we cant run away aint you going to let the white people live up here sure he smiled but it was a wide mean smile and his eyes were mad they can come up and live and work here why certainly all they got to do to deserve it is live in their own small part of town the slums and shine our shoes for us and mop up our trash and sit in the last row in the balcony thats all we ask and once a week we hang one or two of them simple you dont sound human and i dont like it youll have to get used to it he said he braked the car to a stop before the house and jumped out find my guns and some rope well do this right oh willie she wailed and just sat there in the car while he ran up the steps and slammed the front door she went along she didnt want to go along but he rattled around in the attic cursing like a crazy man until he found four guns she saw the brutal metal of them glittering in the black attic and she couldnt see him at all he was so dark she heard only his swearing and at last his long legs came climbing down from the attic in a shower of dust and he stacked up bunches of brass shells and blew out the gun chambers and clicked shells into them his face stern and heavy and folded in upon the gnawing bitterness there leave us alone he kept muttering his hands flying away from him suddenly uncontrolled leave us blame alone why dont they willie willie you tooyou too and he gave her the same look and a pressure of his hatred touched her mind outside the window the boys gabbled to each other white as milk she said white as milk white as this old flower you see white as a stone like chalk you write with willie plunged out of the house you children come inside im locking you up you aint seeing no white man you aint talking about them you aint doing nothing come on now but daddy he shoved them through the door and went and fetched a bucket of paint and a stencil and from the garage a long thick hairy rope coil into which he fashioned a hangmans knot very carefully watching the sky while his hands felt their way at their task and then they were in the car leaving bolls of dust behind them down the road slow up willie this is no slowingup time he said this is a hurrying time and im hurrying all along the road people were looking up in the sky or climbing in their cars or riding in cars and guns were sticking up out of some cars like telescopes sighting all the evils of a world coming to an end she looked at the guns you been talking she accused her husband thats what i been doing he grunted nodding he watched the road fiercely i stopped at every house and i told them what to do to get their guns to get paint to bring rope and be ready and here we all are the welcoming committee to give them the key to the city yes sir she pressed her thin dark hands together to push away the terror growing in her now and she felt the car bucket and lurch around other ears she heard the voices yelling hey willie look and hands holding up ropes and guns as they rushed by and mouths smiling at them in the swift rushing here we are said willie and braked the car into dusty halting and silence he kicked the door open with a big foot and laden with weapons stepped out lugging them across the airport meadow have you thought willie thats all i done for twenty years i was sixteen when i left earth and i was glad to leave he said there wasnt anything there for me or you or anybody like us ive never been sorry i left weve had peace here the first time we ever drew a solid breath now come on he pushed through the dark crowd which came to meet him willie willie what we gonna do they said heres a gun he said heres a gun heres another he passed them out with savage jabs of his arms heres a pistol heres a shotgun the people were so close together it looked like one dark body with a thousand arms reaching out to take the weapons willie willie his wife stood tall and silent by him her fluted lips pressed shut and her large eyes wet and tragic bring the paint be said to her and she lugged a gallon can of yellow paint across the field to where at that moment a trolley car was pulling up with a freshpainted sign on its front to the white mans landing full of talking people who got off and ran across the meadow stumbling looking up women with picnic boxes men with straw hats in shirt sleeves the streetcar stood humming and empty willie climbed up set the paint cans down opened them stirred the paint tested a brush drew forth a stencil and climbed up on a seat hey there the conductor came around behind him his coin changer jangling what you think youre doing get down off there you see what im doing keep your shirt on and willie began the stenciling in yellow paint he dabbed on an f and an o and an r with terrible pride in his work and when he finished it the conductor squinted up and read the fresh glinting yellow words for whites rear section he read it again for whites he blinked rear section the conductor looked at willie and began to smile does that suit you asked willie stepping down said the conductor that suits me just fine sir hattie was looking at the sign from outside and holding her hands over her breasts willie returned to the crowd which was growing now taking size from every auto that groaned to a halt and every new trolley car which squealed around the bend from the nearby town willie climbed up on a packing box lets have a delegation to paint every streetcar in the next hour volunteers hands leapt up get going they went lets have a delegation to fix theater seats roped off the last two rows for whites more hands go on they ran off willie peered around bubbled with perspiration panting with exertion proud of his energy his hand on his wifes shoulder who stood under him looking at the ground with her downcast eyes lets see now he declared oh yes we got to pass a law this afternoon no intermarriages thats right said a lot of people all shoeshine boys quit their jobs today quittin right now some men threw down the rags they carried in their excitement all across town got to pass a minimum wage law dont we sure pay them white folks at least ten cents an hour thats right the mayor of the town hurried up now look here willie johnson get down off that box mayor i cant be made to do nothing like that youre making a mob willie johnson thats the idea the same thing you always hated when you were a kid youre no better than some of those white men you yell about this is the other shoe mayor and the other foot said willie not even looking at the mayor looking at the faces beneath him some of them smiling some of them doubtful others bewildered some of them reluctant and drawing away fearful youll be sorry said the mayor well have an election and get a new mayor said willie and he glanced off at the town where up and down the streets signs were being hung freshpainted limited clientele right to serve customer revokable at any time he grinned and slapped his hands lord and streetcars were being halted and sections being painted white in back to suggest their future inhabitants and theaters were being invaded and roped off by chuckling men while their wives stood wondering on the curbs and children were spanked into houses to be hid away from this awful time are we all ready called willie johnson the rope in his hands with the noose tied and neat ready shouted half the crowd the other half murmured and moved like figures in a nightmare in which they wished no participation here it comes called a small boy like marionette heads on a single string the heads of the crowd turned upward across the sky very high and beautiful a rocket burned on a sweep of orange fire it circled and came down causing all to gasp it landed setting the meadow afire here and there the fire burned out the rocket lay a moment in quiet and then as the silent crowd watched a great door in the side of the vessel whispered out a breath of oxygen the door slid back and an old man stepped out a white man a white man a white man the words traveled back in the expectant crowd the children speaking in each others ears whispering butting each other the words moving in ripples to where the crowd stopped and the streetcars stood in the windy sunlight the smell of paint coming out their opened windows the whispering wore itself away and it was gone no one moved the white man was tall and straight but a deep weariness was m his face he had not shaved this day and his eyes were as old as the eyes of a man can be and still be alive his eyes were colorless almost white and sightless with things he had seen in the passing years he was as thin as a winter bush his hands trembled and he had to lean against the portway of the ship as he looked out over the crowd he put out a hand and half smiled but drew his hand back no one moved he looked down into their faces and perhaps he saw but did not see the guns and the ropes and perhaps he smelled the paint no one ever asked him he began to talk he started very quietly and slowly expecting no interruptions and receiving none and his voice was very tired and old and pale it doesnt matter who i am he said id be just a name to you anyhow i dont know your names either thatll come later he paused closed his eyes for a moment and then continued twenty years ago you left earth thats a long long time its more like twenty centuries so much has happened after you left the war came he nodded slowly yes the big one the third one it went on for a long time until last year we bombed all of the cities of the world we destroyed new york and london and moscow and paris and shanghai and bombay and alexandria we ruined it all and when we finished with the big cities we went to the little cities and atombombed and burned them now he began to name cities and places and streets and as he named them a murmur rose up in his audience we destroyed natchez a murmur and columbus georgia another murmur we burned new orleans a sigh and atlanta still another and there was nothing left of greenwater alabama willie johnson jerked his head and his mouth opened hattie saw this gesture and the recognition coming into his dark eyes nothing was left said the old man in the port speaking slowly cotton fields burned oh said everyone cotton mills bombed out oh and the factories radioactive everything radioactive all the roads and the farms and the foods radioactive everything he named more names of towns and villages tampa thats my town someone whispered fulton thats mine someone else said memphis memphis did they burn memphis a shocked query memphis blown up fourth street in memphis all of it said the old man it was stirring them now after twenty years it was rushing back the towns and the places the trees and the brick buildings the signs and the churches and the familiar stores all of it was coming to the surface among the gathered people each name touched memory and there was no one present without a thought of another day they were all old enough for that save the children laredo i remember laredo new york city i had a store in harlem harlem bombed out the ominous words the familiar remembered places the struggle to imagine all of those places in ruins willie johnson murmured the words greenwater alabama thats where i was born i remember gone all of it gone the man said so the man continued so we destroyed everything and ruined everything like the fools that we were and the fools that we are we killed millions i dont think there are more than five hundred thousand people left in the world all kinds and types and out of all the wreckage we salvaged enough metal to build this one rocket and we came to mars in it this month to seek your help he hesitated and looked down among the faces to see what could be found there but he was uncertain hattie johnson felt her husbands arm tense saw his fingers grip the rope weve been fools said the old man quietly weve brought the earth and civilization down about our heads none of the cities are worth savingtheyll be radioactive for a century earth is over and done with its age is through you have rockets here which you havent tried to use to return to earth in twenty years now ive come to ask you to use them to come to earth to pick up the survivors and bring them back to mars to help us go on at this time weve been stupid before god we admit our stupidity and our evilness all the chinese and the indians and the russians and the british and the americans were asking to be taken in your martian soil has lain fallow for numberless centuries theres room for everyone its good soilive seen your fields from above well come and work it for you yes well even do that we deserve anything you want to do to us but dont shut us out we cant force you to act now if you want ill get into my ship and go back and that will be all there is to it we wont bother you again but well come here and well work for you and do the things you did for usclean your houses cook your meals shine your shoes and humble ourselves in the sight of god for the things we have done over the centuries to ourselves to others to you he was finished there was a silence of silences a silence you could hold in your hand and a silence that came down like a pressure of a distant storm over the crowd their long arms hung like dark pendulums in the sunlight and their eyes were upon the old man and he did not move now but waited willie johnson held the rope in his hands those around him watched to see what he might do his wife hattie waited clutching his arm she wanted to get at the hate of them all to pry at it and work at it until she found a little chink and then pull out a pebble or a stone or a brick and then a part of the wall and once started the whole edifice might roar down and be done away with it was teetering now but which was the keystone and how to get at it how to touch them and get a thing started in all of them to make a ruin of their hate she looked at willie there in the strong silence and the only thing she knew about the situation was him and his life and what had happened to him and suddenly he was the keystone suddenly she knew that if he could be pried loose then the thing in all of them might be loosened and torn away mister she stepped forward she didnt even know the first words to say the crowd stared at her back she felt them staring mister the man turned to her with a tired smile mister she said do you know knockwood hill in greenwater alabama the old man spoke over his shoulder to someone within the ship a moment later a photographic map was handed out and the man held it waiting you know the big oak on top of that hill mister the big oak the place where willies father was shot and hung and found swinging in the morning wind yes is that still there asked hattie its gone said the old man blown up the hills all gone and the oak tree too you see he touched the photograph let me see that said willie jerking forward and looking at the map hattie blinked at the white man heart pounding tell me about greenwater she said quickly what do you want to know about dr phillips is he still alive a moment in which the information was found in a clicking machine within the rocket killed in the war and his son dead what about their house burned like all the other houses what about that other big tree on knockwood hill all the trees wentburned that tree went youre sure said willie yes willies body loosened somewhat and what about that mr burtons house and mr burton no houses at all left no people you know mrs johnsons washing shack my mothers place the place where she was shot thats gone too everythings gone here are the pictures you can see for yourself the pictures were there to be held and looked at and thought about the rocket was full of pictures and answers to questions any town any building any place willie stood with the rope in his hands he was remembering earth the green earth and the green town where he was born and raised and he was thinking now of that town gone to pieces to ruin blown up and scattered all of the landmarks with it all of the supposed or certain evil scattered with it all of the hard men gone the stables the ironsmiths the curio shops the soda founts the gin mills the river bridges the lynching trees the buckshotcovered hills the roads the cows the mimosas and his own house as well as those bigpillared houses down near the long river those white mortuaries where the women as delicate as moths fluttered in the autumn light distant far away those houses where the cold men rocked with glasses of drink in their hands guns leaned against the porch newels sniffing the autumn airs and considering death gone all gone gone and never coming back now for certain all of that civilization ripped into confetti and strewn at their feet nothing nothing of it left to hatenot an empty brass gun shell or a twisted hemp or a tree or even a hill of it to hate nothing but some alien people in a rocket people who might shine his shoes and ride in the back of trolleys or sit far up in midnight theaters you wont have to do that said willie johnson his wife glanced at his big hands his fingers were opening the rope released fell and coiled upon itself along the ground they ran through the streets of their town and tore down the new signs so quickly made and painted out the fresh yellow signs on streetcars and they cut down the ropes in the theater balconies and unloaded their guns and stacked their ropes away a new start for everyone said hattie on the way home in their car yes said willie at last the lords let us come through a few here and a few there and what happens next is up to all of us the time for being fools is over we got to be something else except fools i knew that when he talked i knew then that now the white mans as lonely as weve always been hes got no home now just like we didnt have one for so long now everythings even we can start all over again on the same level he stopped the car and sat in it not moving while hattie went to let the children out they ran down to see their father you see the white man you see him they cried yes sir said willie sitting behind the wheel rubbing his face with his slow fingers seems like for the first time today i really seen the white mani really seen him clear the highway the cooling afternoon rain had come over the valley touching the corn in the tilled mountain fields tapping on the dry grass roof of the hut in the rainy darkness the woman ground corn between cakes of lava rock working steadily in the wet lightlessness somewhere a baby cried hernando stood waiting for the rain to cease so he might take the wooden plow into the field again below the river boiled brown and thickened in its course the concrete highway another river did not flow at all it lay shining empty a car had not come along it in an hour this was in itself of unusual interest over the years there had not been an hour when a car had not pulled up someone shouting hey there can we take your picture someone with a box that clicked and a coin in his hand if he walked slowly across the field without his hat sometimes they called oh we want you with your hat on and they waved their hands rich with gold things that told time or identified them or did nothing at all but winked like spiders eyes in the sun so he would turn and go back to get his hat his wife spoke something is wrong hernando sн the road something big has happened something big to make the road so empty this way he walked from the hut slowly and easily the rain washing over the twined shoes of grass and thick tire rubber he wore he remembered very well the incident of this pair of shoes the tire had come into the hut with violence one night exploding the chickens and the pots apart it had come alone rolling swiftly the car off which it had come had rushed on as far as the curve and hung a moment headlights reflected before plunging into the river the car was still there one might see it on a good day when the river ran slow and the mud cleared deep under shining its metal long and low and very rich lay the car but then the mud came in again and you saw nothing the following day he had carved the shoe soles from the tire rubber he reached the highway now and stood upon it listening to the small sounds it made in the rain then suddenly as if at a signal the cars came hundreds of them miles of them rushing and rushing as he stood by and by him the big long black cars heading north toward the united states roaring taking the curves at too great a speed with a ceaseless blowing and honking and there was something about the faces of the people packed into the cars something which dropped him into a deep silence he stood back to let the cars roar on he counted them until he tired five hundred a thousand cars passed and there was something in the faces of all of them but they moved too swiftly for him to tell what this thing was finally the silence and emptiness returned the swift long low convertible cars were gone he heard the last horn fade the road was empty again it had been like a funeral cortege but a wild one racing hair out screaming to some ceremony ever northward why he could only shake his head and rub his fingers softly at his sides now all alone a final car there was something very very final about it down the mountain road in the thin cool rain fuming up great clouds of steam came an old ford it was traveling as swiftly as it might he expected it to break apart any instant when this ancient ford saw hernando it pulled up caked with mud and rusted the radiator bubbling angrily may we have some water please seсor a young man perhaps twentyone was driving he wore a yellow sweater an opencollared white shirt and gray pants in the topless car the rain fell upon him and five young women packed so they could not move in the interior they were all very pretty and they were keeping the rain from themselves and the driver with old newspapers but the rain got through to them soaking their bright dresses soaking the young man his hair was plastered with rain but they did not seem to care none complained and this was unusual always before they complained of rain of heat of time of cold of distance hernando nodded ill bring you water oh please hurry one of the girls cried she sounded very high and afraid there was no impatience in her only an asking out of fear for the first time hernando ran when a tourist asked always before he had walked slower at such requests he returned with a hub lid full of water this too had been a gift from the highway one afternoon it had sailed like a flung coin into his field round and glittering the car to which it belonged had slid on oblivious to the fact that it had lost a silver eye until now he and his wife had used it for washing and cooking it made a fine bowl as he poured the water into the boiling radiator hernando looked up at their stricken faces oh thank you thank you said one of the girls you dont know what this means hernando smiled so much traffic in this hour it all goes one way north he did not mean to say anything to hurt them but when he looked up again there all of them sat in the rain and they were crying they were crying very hard and the young man was trying to stop them by laying his hands on their shoulders and shaking them gently one at a time but they held their papers over their heads and their mouths moved and their eyes were shut and their faces changed color and they cried some loud some soft hernando stood with the halfempty lid in his fingers i did got mean to say anything seсor he apologized thats all right said the driver what is wrong seсor havent you heard replied the young man turning holding tightly to the wheel with one hand leaning forward its happened this was bad the others at this cried still harder holding onto each other forgetting the newspapers letting the rain fall and mingle with their tears hernando stiffened he put the rest of the water into the radiator he looked at the sky which was black with storm he looked at the river rushing he felt the asphalt under his shoes he came to the side of the car the young man took his hand and gave him a peso no hernando gave it back it is my pleasure thank you youre so kind said one of the girls still sobbing oh mama papa oh i want to be home i want to be home oh mama dad and others held her i did not hear seсor said hernando quietly the war shouted the young man as if no one could hear its come the atom war the end of the world seсor seсor said hernando thank you thank you for your help goodby said the young man goodby they all said in the rain not seeing him he stood while the car engaged its gears and rattled off down fading away through the valley finally it was gone with the young women in it the last car the newspapers held and fluttered over their heads hernando did not move for a long time the rain ran very cold down his cheeks and along his fingers and into the woven garment on his legs he held his breath waiting tight and tensed he watched the highway but it did not move again he doubted that it would move much for a very long time the rain stopped the sky broke through the clouds in ten minutes the storm was gone like a bad breath a sweet wind blew the smell of the jungle up to him he could hear the river moving gently and easily on its way the jungle was very green everything was fresh he walked down through the field to his house and picked up his plow with his hands on it he looked at the sky beginning to burn hot with the sun his wife called out from her work what happened hernando it is nothing he replied he set the plow in the furrow he called sharply to his burro burrrrrrro and they walked together through the rich field under the clearing sky on their tilled land by the deep river what do they mean the world he said the man captain hart stood in the door of the rocket why dont they come he said who knows said martin his lieutenant do i know captain what kind of a place is this anyway the captain lighted a cigar he tossed the match out into the glittering meadow the grass started to burn martin moved to stamp it out with his boot no ordered captain hart let it burn maybe theyll come see whats happening then the ignorant fools martin shrugged and withdrew his foot from the spreading fire captain hart examined his watch an hour ago we landed here and does the welcoming committee rush out with a brass band to shake our hands no indeed here we ride millions of miles through space and the fine citizens of some silly town on some unknown planet ignore us he snorted tapping his watch well ill just give them five more minutes and then and then what asked martin ever so politely watching the captains jowls shake well fly over their damned city again and scare hell out of them his voice grew quieter do you think martin maybe they didnt see us land they saw us they looked up as we flew over then why arent they running across the field are they hiding are they yellow martin shook his head no take these binoculars sir see for yourself everybodys walking around theyre not frightened theywell they just dont seem to care captain hart placed the binoculars to his tired eyes martin looked up and had time to observe the lines and the grooves of irritation tiredness nervousness there hart looked a million years old he never slept he ate little and drove himself on on now his mouth moved aged and drear but sharp under the held binoculars really martin i dont know why we bother we build rockets we go to all the trouble of crossing space searching for them and this is what we get neglect look at those idiots wander about in there dont they realize how big this is the first space flight to touch their provincial land how many times does that happen are they that blasй martin didnt know captain hart gave him back the binoculars wearily why do we do it martin this space travel i mean always on the go always searching our insides always tight never any rest maybe were looking for peace and quiet certainly theres none on earth said martin no theres not is there captain hart was thoughtful the fire damped down not since darwin eh not since everything went by the board everything we used to believe in eh divine power and all that and so you think maybe thats why were going out to the stars eh martin looking for our lost souls is that it trying to get away from our evil planet to a good one perhaps sir certainly were looking for something captain hart cleared his throat and tightened back into sharpness well right now were looking for the mayor of that city there run in tell them who we are the first rocket expedition to planet fortythree in star system three captain hart sends his salutations and desires to meet the mayor on the double yes sir martin walked slowly across the meadow hurry snapped the captain yes sir martin trotted away then he walked again smiling to himself the captain had smoked two cigars before martin returned martin stopped and looked up into the door of the rocket swaying seemingly unable to focus his eyes or think well snapped hart what happened are they coming to welcome us no martin had to lean dizzily against the ship why not its not important said martin give me a cigarette please captain his fingers groped blindly at the rising pack for he was looking at the golden city and blinking he lighted one and smoked quietly for a long time say something cried the captain arent they interested in our rocket martin said what oh the rocket he inspected his cigarette no theyre not interested seems we came at an inopportune time inopportune time martin was patient captain listen something big happened yesterday in that city its so big so important that were secondratesecond fiddle ive got to sit down he lost his balance and sat heavily gasping for air the captain chewed his cigar angrily what happened martin lifted his head smoke from the burning cigarette in his fingers blowing in the wind sir yesterday in that city a remarkable man appearedgood intelligent compassionate and infinitely wise the captain glared at his lieutenant whats that to do with us its hard to explain but he was a man for whom theyd waited a long timea million years maybe and yesterday he walked into their city thats why today sir our rocket landing means nothing the captain sat down violently who was it not ashley he didnt arrive in his rocket before us and steal my glory did he he seized martins arm his face was pale and dismayed not ashley sir then it was burton i knew it burton stole in ahead of us and ruined my landing you cant trust anyone any more not burton either sir said martin quietly the captain was incredulous there were only three rockets we were in the lead this man who got here ahead of us what was his name he didnt have a name he doesnt need one it would be different on every planet sir the captain stared at his lieutenant with hard cynical eyes well what did he do that was so wonderful that nobody even looks at our ship for one thing said martin steadily he healed the sick and comforted the poor he fought hypocrisy and dirty politics and sat among the people talking through the day is that so wonderful yes captain i dont get this the captain confronted martin peered into his face and eyes you been drinking eh he was suspicious he backed away i dont understand martin looked at the city captain if you dont understand theres no way of telling you the captain followed his gaze the city was quiet and beautiful and a great peace lay over it the captain stepped forward taking his cigar from his lips he squinted first at martin then at the golden spires of the buildings you dont meanyou cant mean that man youre talking about couldnt be martin nodded thats what i mean sir the captain stood silently not moving he drew himself up i dont believe it he said at last at high noon captain hart walked briskly into the city accompanied by lieutenant martin and an assistant who was carrying some electrical equipment every once in a while the captain laughed loudly put his hands on his hips and shook his head the mayor of the town confronted him martin set up a tripod screwed a box onto it and switched on the batteries are you the mayor the captain jabbed a finger out i am said the mayor the delicate apparatus stood between them controlled and adjusted by martin and the assistant instantaneous translations from any language were made by the box the words sounded crisply on the mild air of the city about this occurrence yesterday said the captain it occurred it did you have witnesses we have may we talk to them talk to any of us said the mayor we are all witnesses in an aside to martin the captain said mass hallucination to the mayor what did this manthis strangerlook like that would be hard to say said the mayor smiling a little why would it opinions might differ slightly id like your opinion sir anyway said the captain record this he snapped to martin over his shoulder the lieutenant pressed the button of a hand recorder well said the mayor of the city he was a very gentle and kind man he was of a great and knowing intelligence yesyes i know i know the captain waved his fingers generalizations i want something specific what did he look like i dont believe that is important replied the mayor its very important said the captain sternly i want a description of this fellow if i cant get it from you ill get it from others to martin im sure it must have been burton pulling one of his practical jokes martin would not look him in the face martin was coldly silent the captain snapped his fingers there was something or othera healing many healings said the mayor may i see one you may said the mayor my son he nodded at a small boy who stepped forward he was afflicted with a withered arm now look upon it at this the captain laughed tolerantly yes yes this isnt even circumstantial evidence you know i didnt see the boys withered arm i see only his arm whole and well thats no proof what proof have you that the boys arm was withered yesterday and today is well my word is my proof said the mayor simply my dear man cried the captain you dont expect me to go on hearsay do you oh no im sorry said the mayor looking upon the captain with what appeared to be curiosity and pity do you have any pictures of the boy before today asked the captain after a moment a large oil portrait was carried forth showing the son with a withered arm my dear fellow the captain waved it away anybody can paint a picture paintings lie i want a photograph of the boy there was no photograph photography was not a known art in their society well sighed the captain face twitching let me talk to a few other citizens were getting nowhere he pointed at a woman you she hesitated yes you come here ordered the captain tell me about this wonderful man you saw yesterday the woman looked steadily at the captain he walked among us and was very fine and good what color were his eyes the color of the sun the color of the sea the color of a flower the color of the mountains the color of the night thatll do the captain threw up his hands see martin absolutely nothing some charlatan wanders through whispering sweet nothings in their ears and please stop it said martin the captain stepped back what you heard what i said said martin i like these people i believe what they say youre entitled to your opinion but keep it to yourself sir you cant talk to me this way shouted the captain ive had enough of your highhandedness replied martin leave these people alone theyve got something good and decent and you come and foul up the nest and sneer at it well ive talked to them too ive gone through the city and seen their faces and theyve got something youll never havea little simple faith and theyll move mountains with it you youre boiled because someone stole your act got here ahead and made you unimportant ill give you five seconds to finish remarked the captain i understand youve been under a strain martin months of traveling in space nostalgia loneliness and now with this thing happening i sympathize martin i overlook your petty insubordination i dont overlook your petty tyranny replied martin im stepping out im staying here you cant do that cant i try and stop me this is what i came looking for i didnt know it but this is it this is for me take your filth somewhere else and foul up other nests with your doubt and yourscientific method he looked swiftly about these people have had an experience and you cant seem to get it through your head that its really happened and we were lucky enough to almost arrive in time to be in on it people on earth have talked about this man for twenty centuries after he walked through the old world weve all wanted to see him and hear him and never had the chance and now today we just missed seeing him by a few hours captain hart looked at martins cheeks youre crying like a baby stop it i dont care well i do in front of these natives were to keep up a front youre overwrought as i said i forgive you i dont want your forgiveness you idiot cant you see this is one of burtons tricks to fool these people to bilk them to establish his oil and mineral concerns under a religious guise you fool martin you absolute fool you should know earthmen by now theyll do anythingblaspheme lie cheat steal kill to get their ends anything is fine if it works the true pragmatist thats burton you know him the captain scoffed heavily come off it martin admit it this is the sort of scaly thing burton might carry off polish up these citizens and pluck them when theyre ripe no said martin thinking of it the captain put his hand up thats burton thats him thats his dirt thats his criminal way i have to admire the old dragon flaming in here in a blaze and a halo and a soft word and a loving touch with a medicated salve here and a healing ray there thats burton all right no martins voice was dazed he covered his eyes no i wont believe it you dont want to believe captain hart kept at it admit it now admit it its just the thing burton would do stop daydreaming martin wake up its morning this is a real world and were real dirty peopleburton the dirtiest of us all martin turned away there there martin said hart mechanically patting the mans back i understand quite a shock for you i know a rotten shame and all that that burton is a rascal you go take it easy let me handle this martin walked off slowly toward the rocket captain hart watched him go then taking a deep breath he turned to the woman he had been questioning well tell me some more about this man as you were saying madam later the officers of the rocket ship ate supper on card tables outside the captain correlated his data to a silent martin who sat redeyed and brooding over his meal interviewed three dozen people all of them full of the same milk and hogwash said the captain its burtons work all right im positive hell be spilling back in here tomorrow or next week to consolidate his miracles and beat us out in our contracts i think ill stick on and spoil it for him martin glanced up sullenly ill kill him he said now now martin there there boy ill kill himso help me i will well put an anchor on his wagon you have to admit hes clever unethical but clever hes dirty you must promise not to do anything violent captain hart checked his figures according to this there were thirty miracles of healing performed a blind man restored to vision a leper cured oh burtons efficient give him that a gong sounded a moment later a man ran up captain sir a report burtons ship is coming down also the ashley ship sir see captain hart beat the table here come the jackals to the harvest they cant wait to feed wait till i confront them ill make them cut me in on this feasti will martin looked sick he stared at the captain business my dear boy business said the captain everybody looked up two rockets swung down out of the sky when the rockets landed they almost crashed whats wrong with those fools cried the captain jumping up the men ran across the meadowlands to the steaming ships the captain arrived the airlock door popped open on burtons ship a man fell out into their arms whats wrong cried captain hart the man lay on the ground they bent over him and he was burned badly burned his body was covered with wounds and scars and tissue that was inflamed and smoking he looked up out of puffed eyes and his thick tongue moved in his split lips what happened demanded the captain kneeling down shaking the mans arm sir sir whispered the dying man fortyeight hours ago back in space sector seventynine dfs off planet one in this system our ship and ashleys ship ran into a cosmic storm sir liquid ran gray from the mans nostrils blood trickled from his mouth wiped out all crew burton dead ashley died an hour ago only three survivals listen to me shouted hart bending over the bleeding man you didnt come to this planet before this very hour silence answer me cried hart the dying man said no storm burton dead two days ago this first landing on any world in six months are you sure shouted hart shaking violently gripping the man in his hands are you sure sure sure mouthed the dying man burton died two days ago youre positive yes yes whispered the man his head fell forward the man was dead the captain knelt beside the silent body the captains face twitched the muscles jerking involuntarily the other members of the crew stood back of him looking down martin waited the captain asked to be helped to his feet finally and this was done they stood looking at the city that means that means said martin were the only ones whove been here whispered captain hart and that man what about that man captain asked martin the captains face twitched senselessly he looked very old indeed and gray his eyes were glazed he moved forward in the dry grass come along martin come along hold me up for my sake hold me im afraid ill fall and hurry we cant waste time they moved stumbling toward the city in the long dry grass in the blowing wind several hours later they were sitting in the mayors auditorium a thousand people had come and talked and gone the captain had remained seated his face haggard listening listening there was so much light in the faces of those who came and testified and talked he could not bear to see them and all the while his hands traveled on his knees together on his belt jerking and quivering when it was over captain hart turned to the mayor and with strange eyes said but you must know where he went he didnt say where he was going replied the mayor to one of the other nearby worlds demanded the captain i dont know you must know do you see him asked the mayor indicating the crowd the captain looked no then he is probably gone said the mayor probably probably cried the captain weakly ive made a horrible mistake and i want to see him now why it just came to me this is a most unusual thing in history to be in on something like this why the chances are one in billions wed arrived at one certain planet among millions of planets the day after he came you must know where hes gone each finds him in his own way replied the mayor gently youre hiding him the captains face grew slowly ugly some of the old hardness returned in stages he began to stand up no said the mayor you know where be is then the captains fingers twitched at the leather holster on his right side i couldnt tell you where he is exactly said the mayor i advise you to start talking and the captain took out a small steel gun theres no way said the mayor to tell you anything liar an expression of pity came into the mayors face as he looked at hart youre very tired he said youve traveled a long way and you belong to a tired people whove been without faith a long time and you want to believe so much now that youre interfering with yourself youll only make it harder if you kill youll never find him that way whered he go he told you you know come on tell me the captain waved the gun the mayor shook his head tell me tell me the gun cracked once twice the mayor fell his arm wounded martin leaped forward captain the gun flashed at martin dont interfere on the floor holding his wounded arm the mayor looked up put down your gun youre hurting yourself youve never believed and now that you think you believe you hurt people because of it i dont need you said hart standing over him if i missed him by one day here ill go on to another world and another and another ill miss him by half a day on the next planet maybe and a quarter of a day on the third planet and two hours on the next and an hour on the next and half an hour on the next and a minute on the next but after that one day ill catch up with him do you hear that he was shouting now leaning wearily over the man on the floor he staggered with exhaustion come along martin he let the gun hang in his hand no said martin im staying here youre a fool stay if you like but im going on with the others as far as i can go the mayor looked up at martin ill be all right leave me others will tend my wounds ill be back said martin ill walk as far as the rocket they walked with vicious speed through the city one could see with what effort the captain struggled to show all the old iron to keep himself going when he reached the rocket he slapped the side of it with a trembling hand he holstered his gun he looked at martin well martin martin looked at him well captain the captains eyes were on the sky sure you wontcome withwith me eh no sir itll be a great adventure by god i know ill find him you are set on it now arent you sir asked martin the captains face quivered and his eyes closed yes theres one thing id like to know what sir when you find himif you find him asked martin what will you ask of him why the captain faltered opening his eyes his hands clenched and unclenched he puzzled a moment and then broke into a strange smile why ill ask him for a littlepeace and quiet he touched the rocket its been a long time a long long time sincesince i relaxed did you ever just try captain i dont understand said hart never mind so long captain goodby mr martin the crew stood by the port out of their number only three were going on with hart seven others were remaining behind they said with martin captain hart surveyed them and uttered his verdict fools he last of all climbed into the airlock gave a brisk salute laughed sharply the door slammed the rocket lifted into the sky on a pillar of fire martin watched it go far away and vanish at the meadows edge the mayor supported by several men beckoned hes gone said martin walking up yes poor man hes gone said the mayor and hell go on planet after planet seeking and seeking and always and always he will be an hour late or a half hour late or ten minutes late or a minute late and finally he will miss out by only a few seconds and when he has visited three hundred worlds and is seventy or eighty years old he will miss out by only a fraction of a second and then a smaller fraction of a second and he will go on and on thinking to find that very thing which he left behind here on this planet in this city martin looked steadily at the mayor the mayor put out his hand was there ever any doubt of it he beckoned to the others and turned come along now we mustnt keep him waiting they walked into the city the long rain the rain continued it was a hard rain a perpetual rain a sweating and steaming rain it was a mizzle a downpour a fountain a whipping at the eyes an undertow at the ankles it was a rain to drown all rains and the memory of rains it came by the pound and the ton it hacked at the jungle and cut the trees like scissors and shaved the grass and tunneled the soil and molted the bushes it shrank mens hands into the hands of wrinkled apes it rained a solid glassy rain and it never stopped how much farther lieutenant i dont know a mile ten miles a thousand arent you sure how can i be sure i dont like this rain if we only knew how far it is to the sun dome id feel better another hour or two from here you really think so lieutenant of course or are you lying to keep us happy im lying to keep you happy shut up the two men sat together in the rain behind them sat two other men who were wet and tired and slumped like clay that was melting the lieutenant looked up he had a face that once had been brown and now the rain had washed it pale and the rain had washed the color from his eyes and they were white as were his teeth and as was his hair he was all white even his uniform was beginning to turn white and perhaps a little green with fungus the lieutenant felt the rain on his cheeks how many million years since the rain stopped raining here on venus dont be crazy said one of the two other men it never stops raining on venus it just goes on and on ive lived here for ten years and i never saw a minute or even a second when it wasnt pouring its like living under water said the lieutenant and rose up shrugging his guns into place well wed better get going well find that sun dome yet or we wont find it said the cynic its an hour or so now youre lying to me lieutenant no now im lying to myself this is one of those times when youve got to lie i cant take much more of this they walked down the jungle trail now and then looking at their compasses there was no direction anywhere only what the compass said there was a gray sky and rain falling and jungle and a path and far back behind them somewhere a rocket in which they had ridden and fallen a rocket in which lay two of their friends dead and dripping rain they walked in single file not speaking they came to a river which lay wide and flat and brown flowing down to the great single sea the surface of it was stippled in a billion places by the rain all right simmons the lieutenant nodded and simmons took a small packet from his back which with a pressure of hidden chemical inflated into a large boat the lieutenant directed the cutting of wood and the quick making of paddles and they set out into the river paddling swiftly across the smooth surface in the rain the lieutenant felt the cold rain on his cheeks and on his neck and on his moving arms the cold was beginning to seep into his lungs he felt the rain on his ears on his eyes on his legs i didnt sleep last night he said who could who has when how many nights have we slept thirty nights thirty days who can sleep with rain slamming their head banging away id give anything for a hat anything at all just so it wouldnt hit my head any more i get headaches my head is sore it hurts all the time im sorry i came to china said one of the others first time i ever heard venus called china sure china chinese water cure remember the old torture rope you against a wall drop one drop of water on your head every halfhour you go crazy waiting for the next one well thats venus but on a big scale were not made for water you cant sleep you cant breathe right and youre crazy from just being soggy if wed been ready for a crash wed have brought waterproofed uniforms and hats its this beating rain on your head gets you most of all its so heavy its like bb shot i dont know how long i can take it boy me for the sun dome the man who thought them up thought of something they crossed the river and in crossing they thought of the sun dome somewhere ahead of them shining in the jungle rain a yellow house round and bright as the sun a house fifteen feet high by one hundred feet in diameter in which was warmth and quiet and hot food and freedom from rain and in the center of the sun dome of course was a sun a small floating free globe of yellow fire drifting in space at the top of the building where you could look at it from where you sat smoking or reading a book or drinking your hot chocolate crowned with marshmallow dollops there it would be the yellow sun just the size of the earth sun and it was warm and continuous and the rain world of venus would be forgotten as long as they stayed in that house and idled their time the lieutenant turned and looked back at the three men using their oars and gritting their teeth they were as white as mushrooms as white as lie was venus bleached everything away in a few months even the jungle was an immense cartoon nightmare for how could the jungle be green with no sun with always rain falling and always dusk the white white jungle with the pale cheesecolored leaves and the earth carved of wet camembert and the tree boles like immense toadstoolseverything black and white and how often could you see the soil itself wasnt it mostly a creek a stream a puddle a pool a lake a river and then at last the sea here we are they leaped out on the farthest shore splashing and sending up showers the boat was deflated and stored in a cigarette packet then standing on the rainy shore they tried to light up a few smokes for themselves and it was five minutes or so before shuddering they worked the inverted lighter and cupping their hands managed a few drags upon cigarettes that all too quickly were limp and beaten away from their lips by a sudden slap of rain they walked on wait just a moment said the lieutenant i thought i saw something ahead the sun dome im not sure the rain closed in again simmons began to run the sun dome come back simmons the sun dome simmons vanished in the rain the others ran after him they found him in a little clearing and they stopped and looked at him and what he had discovered the rocket ship it was lying where they had left it somehow they had circled back and were where they had started in the ruin of the ship green fungus was growing up out of the mouths of the two dead men as they watched the fungus took flower the petals broke away in the rain and the fungus died how did we do it an electrical storm must be nearby threw our compasses off that explains it youre right whatll we do now start out again good lord were not any closer to anywhere lets try to keep calm about it simmons calm calm this rains driving me wild weve enough food for another two days if were careful the rain danced on their skin on their wet uniforms the rain streamed from their noses and ears from their fingers and knees they looked like stone fountains frozen in the jungle issuing forth water from every pore and as they stood from a distance they heard a roar and the monster came out of the rain the monster was supported upon a thousand electric blue legs it walked swiftly and terribly it struck down a leg with a driving blow everywhere a leg struck a tree fell and burned great whiffs of ozone filled the rainy air and smoke blew away and was broken up by the rain the monster was a half mile wide and a mile high and it felt of the ground like a great blind thing sometimes for a moment it had no legs at all and then in an instant a thousand whips would fall out of its belly whiteblue whips to sting the jungle theres the electrical storm said one of the men theres the thing ruined our compasses and its coming this way lie down everyone said the lieutenant run cried simmons dont be a fool lie down it hits the highest points we may get through unhurt lie down about fifty feet from the rocket it may very well spend its force there and leave us be get down the men flopped is it coming they asked each other after a moment coming is it nearer two hundred yards off nearer here she is the monster came and stood over them it dropped down ten blue bolts of lightning which struck the rocket the rocket flashed like a beaten gong and gave off a metal ringing the monster let down fifteen more bolts which danced about in a ridiculous pantomime feeling of the jungle and the watery soil no no one of the men jumped up get down yon fool said the lieutenant no the lightning struck the rocket another dozen times the lieutenant turned his head on his arm and saw the blue blazing flashes he saw trees split and crumple into ruin he saw the monstrous dark cloud turn like a black disk overhead and hurl down a hundred other poles of electricity the man who had leaped up was now running like someone in a great hall of pillars he ran and dodged between the pillars and then at last a dozen of the pillars slammed down and there was the sound a fly makes when landing upon the grill wires of an exterminator the lieutenant remembered this from his childhood on a farm and there was a smell of a man burned to a cinder the lieutenant lowered his head dont look up he told the others he was afraid that he too might run at any moment the storm above them flashed down another series of bolts and then moved on away once again there was only the rain which rapidly cleared the air of the charred smell and in a moment the three remaining men were sitting and waiting for the beat of their hearts to subside into quiet once more they walked over to the body thinking that perhaps they could still save the mans life they couldnt believe that there wasnt some way to help the man it was the natural act of men who have not accepted death until they have touched it and turned it over and made plans to bury it or leave it there for the jungle to bury in an hour of quick growth the body was twisted steel wrapped in burned leather it looked like a wax dummy that had been thrown into an incinerator and pulled out after the wax had sunk to the charcoal skeleton only the teeth were white and they shone like a strange white bracelet dropped half through a clenched black fist he shouldnt have jumped up they said it almost at the same time even as they stood over the body it began to vanish for the vegetation was edging in upon it little vines and ivy and creepers and even flowers for the dead at a distance the storm walked off on blue bolts of lightning and was gone they crossed a river and a creek and a stream and a dozen other rivers and creeks and streams before their eyes rivers appeared rushing new rivers while old rivers changed their coursesrivers the color of mercury rivers the color of silver and milk they came to the sea the single sea there was only one continent on venus this land was three thousand miles long by a thousand miles wide and about this island was the single sea which covered the entire raining planet the single sea which lay upon the pallid shore with little motion this way the lieutenant nodded south im sure there are two sun domes down that way while they were at it why didnt they build a hundred more therere a hundred and twenty of them now arent there one hundred and twentysix as of last month they tried to push a bill through congress back on earth a year ago to provide for a couple dozen more but oh no you know how that is theyd rather a few men went crazy with the rain they started south the lieutenant and simmons and the third man pickard walked in the rain in the rain that fell heavily and lightly heavily and lightly in the rain that poured and hammered and did not stop falling upon the land and the sea and the walking people simmons saw it first there it is theres what the sun dome the lieutenant blinked the water from his eyes and raised his hands to ward off the stinging blows of the rain at a distance there was a yellow glow on the edge of the jungle by the sea it was indeed the sun dome the men smiled at each other looks like you were right lieutenant luck brother that puts muscle in me just seeing it come on last one theres a sonofabitch simmons began to trot the others automatically fell in with this gasping tired but keeping pace a big pot of coffee for me panted simmons smiling and a pan of cinnamon buns by god and just lie there and let the old sun hit you the guy that invented the sun domes he should have got a medal they ran faster the yellow glow grew brighter guess a lot of men went crazy before they figured out the cure think itd be obvious right off simmons panted the words in cadence to his running rain rain years ago found a friend of mine out in the jungle wandering around in the rain saying over and over dont know enough to come in outta the rain dont know enough to come in outta the rain dont know enough on and on like that poor crazy bastard save your breath they ran they all laughed they reached the door of the sun dome laughing simmons yanked the door wide hey he yelled bring on the coffee and buns there was no reply they stepped through the door the sun dome was empty and dark there was no synthetic yellow sun floating in a high gaseous whisper at the center of the blue ceiling there was no food waiting it was cold as a vault and through a thousand holes which had been newly punctured in the ceiling water streamed the rain fell down soaking into the thick rugs and the heavy modern furniture and splashing on the glass tables the jungle was growing up like a moss in the room on top of the bookcases and the divans the rain slashed through the holes and fell upon the three mens faces pickard began to laugh quietly shut up pickard ye gods look whats here for usno food no sun nothing the venusiansthey did it of course simmons nodded with the rain funneling down on his face the water ran in his silvered hair and on his white eyebrows every once in a while the venusians come up out of the sea and attack a sun dome they know if they ruin the sun domes they can ruin us but arent the sun domes protected with guns sure simmons stepped aside to a place that was relatively dry but its been five years since the venusians tried anything defense relaxes they caught this dome unaware where are the bodies the venusians took them all down into the sea i hear they have a delightful way of drowning you it takes about eight hours to drown the way they work it really delightful i bet there isnt any food here at all pickard laughed the lieutenant frowned at him nodded at him so simmons could see simmons shook his head and went back to a room at one side of the oval chamber the kitchen was strewn with soggy loaves of bread and meat that had grown a faint green fur rain came through a hundred holes in the kitchen roof brilliant the lieutenant glanced up at the holes i dont suppose we can plug up all those holes and get snug here without food sir simmons snorted i notice the sun machines torn apart our best bet is to make our way to the next sun dome how far is that from here not far as i recall they built two rather close together here perhaps if we waited here a rescue mission from the other might its probably been here and gone already some days ago theyll send a crew to repair this place in about six months when they get the money from congress i dont think wed better wait all right then well eat whats left of our rations and get on to the next dome pickard said if only the rain wouldnt hit my head just for a few minutes if i could only remember what its like not to be bothered he put his hands on his skull and held it tight i remember when i was in school a bully used to sit in back of me and pinch me and pinch me and pinch me every five minutes all day long he did that for weeks and months my arms were sore and black and blue all the time and i thought id go crazy from being pinched one day i must have gone a little mad from being hurt and hurt and i turned around and took a metal trisquare i used in mechanical drawing and i almost killed that bastard i almost cut his lousy head off i almost took his eye out before they dragged me out of the room and i kept yelling why dont he leave me alone why dont he leave me alone brother his hands clenched the bone of his head shaking tightening his eyes shut but what do i do now who do i hit who do i tell to lay off stop bothering me this damn rain like the pinching always on you thats all you hear thats all you feel well be at the other sun dome by four this afternoon sun dome look at this one what if all the sun domes on venus are gone what then what if there are holes in all the ceilings and the rain coming in well have to chance it im tired of chancing it all i want is a roof and some quiet i want to be alone thats only eight hours off if you hold on dont worry ill hold on all right and pickard laughed not looking at them lets eat said simmons watching him they set off down the coast southward again after four hours they had to cut inland to go around a river that was a mile wide and so swift it was not navigable by boat they had to walk inland six miles to a place where the river boiled out of the earth suddenly like a mortal wound in the rain they walked on solid ground and returned to the sea ive got to sleep said pickard at last he slumped havent slept in four weeks tried but couldnt sleep here the sky was getting darker the night of venus was setting in and it was so completely black that it was dangerous to move simmons and the lieutenant fell to their knees also and the lieutenant said all right well see what we can do weve tried it before but i dont know sleep doesnt seem one of the things you can get in this weather they lay out full propping their heads up so the water wouldnt come to their mouths and they closed their eyes the lieutenant twitched he did not sleep there were things that crawled on his skin things grew upon him in layers drops fell and touched other drops and they became streams that trickled over his body and while these moved down his flesh the small growths of the forest took root in his clothing he felt the ivy cling and make a second garment over him he felt the small flowers bud and open and petal away and still the rain pattered on his body and on his head in the luminous nightfor the vegetation glowed in the darknesshe could see the other two men outlined like logs that had fallen and taken upon themselves velvet coverings of grass and flowers the rain hit his face he covered his face with his hands the rain hit his neck he turned over on his stomach in the mud on the rubbery plants and the rain hit his back and hit his legs suddenly he leaped up and began to brush the water from himself a thousand hands were touching him and he no longer wanted to be touched he no longer could stand being touched he floundered and struck something else and knew that it was simmons standing up in the rain sneezing moisture coughing and choking and then pickard was up shouting running about wait a minute pickard stop it stop it pickard screamed he fired off his gun six times at the night sky in the flashes of powdery illumination they could see armies of raindrops suspended as in a vast motionless amber for an instant hesitating as if shocked by the explosion fifteen billion droplets fifteen billion tears fifteen billion ornaments jewels standing out against a white velvet viewing board and then with the light gone the drops which had waited to have their pictures taken which had suspended their downward rush fell upon them stinging in an insect cloud of coldness and pain stop it stop it pickard but pickard was only standing now alone when the lieutenant switched on a small hand lamp and played it over pickards wet face the eyes of the man were dilated and his mouth was open his face turned up so the water hit and splashed on his tongue and hit and drowned the wide eyes and bubbled in a whispering froth on the nostrils pickard the man would not reply he simply stood there for a long while with the bubbles of rain breaking out in his whitened hair and manacles of rain jewels dripping from his wrists and his neck pickard were leaving were going on follow us the rain dripped from pickards ears do you hear me pickard it was like shouting down a well pickard leave him alone said simmons we cant go on without him whatll we do carry him simmons spat hes no good to us or himself you know what hell do hell just stand here and drown what you ought to know that by now dont you know the story hell just stand here with his head up and let the rain come in his nostrils and his mouth hell breathe the water thats how they found general mendt that time sitting on a rock with his head back breathing the rain his lungs were full of water the lieutenant turned the light back to the unblinking face pickards nostrils gave off a tiny whispering wet sound pickard the lieutenant slapped the face he cant even feel you said simmons a few days in this rain and you dont have any face or any legs or hands the lieutenant looked at his own hand in horror he could no longer feel it but we cant leave pickard here ill show you what we can do simmons fired his gun pickard fell into the raining earth simmons said dont move lieutenant ive got my gun ready for you too think it over he would only have stood or sat there and drowned its quicker this way the lieutenant blinked at the body but you killed him yes because hed have killed us by being a burden you saw his face insane after a moment the lieutenant nodded all right they walked off into the rain it was dark and their hand lamps threw a beam that pierced the rain for only a few feet after a half hour they had to stop and sit through the rest of the night aching with hunger waiting for the dawn to come when it did come it was gray and continually raining as before and they began to walk again weve miscalculated said simmons no another hour speak louder i cant hear you simmons stopped and smiled by christ he said and touched his ears my ears theyve gone out on me all the rain pouring finally numbed me right down to the bone cant you hear anything said the lieutenant what simmonss eyes were puzzled nothing come on i think ill wait here you go on ahead you cant do that i cant hear you you go on im tired i dont think the sun dome is down this way and if it is its probably got holes in the roof like the last one i think ill just sit here get up from there so long lieutenant you cant give up now ive got a gun here that says im staying i just dont give a damn any more im not crazy yet but im the next thing to it i dont want to go out that way as soon as you get out of sight im going to use this gun on myself simmons you said my name i can read that much off your lips simmons look its a matter of time either i die now or in a few hours waitll you get to that next dome if you ever get there and find rain coming in through the roof wont that be nice the lieutenant waited and then splashed off in the rain he turned and called back once but simmons was only sitting there with the gun in his hands waiting for him to get out of sight he shook his head and waved the lieutenant on the lieutenant didnt even hear the sound of the gun he began to eat the flowers as he walked they stayed down for a time and werent poisonous neither were they particularly sustaining and he vomited them up sickly a minute or so later once he took some leaves and tried to make himself a hat but he had tried that before the rain melted the leaves from his head once picked the vegetation rotted quickly and fell away into gray masses in his fingers another five minutes he told himself another five minutes and then ill walk into the sea and keep walking we werent made for this no earthman was or ever will be able to take it your nerves your nerves he floundered his way through a sea of slush and foliage and came to a small hill at a distance there was a faint yellow smudge in the cold veils of water the next sun dome through the trees a long round yellow building far away for a moment he only stood swaying looking at it he began to run and then he slowed down for he was afraid he didnt call out what if its the same one what if its the dead sun dome with no sun in it he thought he slipped and fell lie here he thought its the wrong one lie here its no use drink all you want but he managed to climb to his feet again and crossed several creeks and the yellow light grew very bright and he began to run again his feet crashing into mirrors and glass his arms flailing at diamonds and precious stones he stood before the yellow door the printed letters over it said the sun dome he put his numb hand up to feel it then he twisted the doorknob and stumbled in he stood for a moment looking about behind him the rain whirled at the door ahead of him upon a low table stood a silver pot of hot chocolate steaming and a cup full with a marshmallow in it and beside that on another tray stood thick sandwiches of rich chicken meat and freshcut tomatoes and green onions and on a rod just before his eyes was a great thick green turkish towel and a bin in which to throw wet clothes and to his right a small cubicle in which heat rays might dry you instantly and upon a chair a fresh change of uniform waiting for anyonehimself or any lost oneto make use of it and farther over coffee in steaming copper urns and a phonograph from which music was playing quietly and books bound in red and brown leather and near the books a cot a soft deep cot upon which one might lie exposed and bare to drink in the rays of the one great bright thing which dominated the long room he put his hands to his eyes he saw other men moving toward him but said nothing to them he waited and opened his eyes and looked the water from his uniform pooled at his feet and he felt it drying from his hair and his face and his chest and his arms and his legs he was looking at the sun it hung in the center of the room large and yellow and warm it made not a sound and there was no sound in the room the door was shut and the rain only a memory to his tingling body the sun hung high in the blue sky of the room warm hot yellow and very fine he walked forward tearing off his clothes as he went the rocket man the electrical fireflies were hovering above mothers dark hair to light her path she stood in her bedroom door looking out at me as i passed in the silent hall you will help me keep him here this time wont you she asked i guess so i said please the fireflies cast moving bits of light on her white face this time he mustnt go away again all right i said after standing there a moment but it wont do any good its no use she went away and the fireflies on their electric circuits fluttered after her like an errant constellation showing her how to walk in darkness i heard her say faintly weve got to try anyway other fireflies followed me to my room when the weight of my body cut a circuit in the bed the fireflies winked out it was midnight and my mother and i waited our rooms separated by darkness in bed the bed began to rock me and sing to me i touched a switch the singing and rocking stopped i didnt want to sleep i didnt want to sleep at all this night was no different from a thousand others in our time we would wake nights and feel the cool air turn hot feel the fire in the wind or see the walls burned a bright color for an instant and then we knew his rocket was over our househis rocket and the oak trees swaying from the concussion and i would lie there eyes wide panting and mother in her room her voice would come to me over the interroom radio did you feel it and i would answer that was him all right that was my fathers ship passing over our town a small town where space rockets never came and we would lie awake for the next two hours thinking now dads landed in springfield now hes on the tarmac now hes signing the papers now hes in the helicopter now hes over the river now the hills now hes settling the helicopter in at the little airport at green village here and the night would be half over when in our separate cool beds mother and i would be listening listening now hes walking down bell street he always walks never takes a cab now across the park now turning the corner of oakhurst and now i lifted my head from my pillow far down the street coming closer and closer smartly quickly brisklyfootsteps now turning in at our house up the porch steps and we were both smiling in the cool darkness mom and i when we heard the front door open in recognition speak a quiet word of welcome and shut downstairs three hours later i turned the brass knob to their room quietly holding my breath balancing in a darkness as big as the space between the planets my hand out to reach the small black case at the foot of my parents sleeping bed taking it i ran silently to my room thinking he wont tell me he doesnt want me to know and from the opened case spilled his black uniform like a black nebula stars glittering here or there distantly in the material i kneaded the dark stuff in my warm hands i smelled the planet mars an iron smell and the planet venus a green ivy smell and the planet mercury a scent of sulphur and fire and i could smell the milky moon and the hardness of stars i pushed the uniform into a centrifuge machine id built in my ninthgrade shop that year set it whirling soon a fine powder precipitated into a retort this i slid under a microscope and while my parents slept unaware and while our house was asleep all the automatic bakers and servers and robot cleaners in an electric slumber i stared down upon brilliant motes of meteor dust comet tail and loam from far jupiter glistening like worlds themselves which drew me down the tube a billion miles into space at terrific accelerations at dawn exhausted with my journey and fearful of discovery i returned the boxed uniform to their sleeping room then i slept only to waken at the sound of the horn of the drycleaning car which stopped in the yard below they took the black uniform box with them its good i didnt wait i thought for the uniform would be back in an hour clean of all its destiny and travel i slept again with the little vial of magical dust in my pajama pocket over my beating heart when i came downstairs there was dad at the breakfast table biting into his toast sleep good doug he said as if he had been here all the time and hadnt been gone for three months all right i said toast he pressed a button and the breakfast table made me four pieces golden brown i remember my father that afternoon digging and digging in the garden like an animal after something it seemed there he was with his long dark arms moving swiftly planting tamping fixing cutting pruning his dark face always down to the soil his eyes always down to what he was doing never up to the sky never looking at me or mother even unless we knelt with him to feel the earth soak up through the overalls at our knees to put our hands into the black dirt and not look at the bright crazy sky then he would glance to either side to mother or me and give us a gentle wink and go on bent down face down the sky staring at his back that night we sat on the mechanical porch swing which swung us and blew a wind upon us and sang to us it was summer and moonlight and we had lemonade to drink and we held the cold glasses in our hands and dad read the stereonewspapers inserted into the special hat you put on your head and which turned the microscopic page in front of the magnifying lens if you blinked three times in succession dad smoked cigarettes and told me about how it was when he was a boy in the year after a while he said as he had always said why arent you out playing kickthecan doug i didnt say anything but mom said he does on nights when youre not here dad looked at me and then for the first time that day at the sky mother always watched him when he glanced at the stars the first day and night when he got home he wouldnt look at the sky much i thought about him gardening and gardening so furiously his face almost driven into the earth but the second night he looked at the stars a little more mother wasnt afraid of the sky in the day so much but it was the night stars that she wanted to turn off and sometimes i could almost see her reaching for a switch in her mind but never finding it and by the third night maybe dadd be out here on the porch until way after we were all ready for bed and then id hear mom call him in almost like she called me from the street at times and then i would hear dad fitting the electriceye door lock in place with a sigh and the next morning at breakfast id glance down and see his little black case near his feet as he buttered his toast and mother slept late well be seeing you doug hed say and wed shake hands in about three months right and hed walk away down the street not taking a helicopter or beetle or bus just walking with his uniform hidden in his small underarm case he didnt want anyone to think he was vain about being a rocket man mother would come out to eat breakfast one piece of dry toast about an hour later but now it was tonight the first night the good night and he wasnt looking at the stars much at all lets go to the television carnival i said fine said dad mother smiled at me and we rushed off to town in a helicopter and took dad through a thousand exhibits to keep his face and head down with us and not looking anywhere else and as we laughed at the funny things and looked serious at the serious ones i thought my father goes to saturn and neptune and pluto but he never brings me presents other boys whose fathers go into space bring back bits of ore from callisto and hunks of black meteor or blue sand but i have to get my own collection trading from other boys the martian rocks and mercurian sands which filled my room but about which dad would never comment on occasion i remembered he brought something for mother he planted some martian sunflowers once in our yard but after he was gone a month and the sunflowers grew large mom ran out one day and cut them all down without thinking as we paused at one of the threedimensional exhibits i asked dad the question i always asked whats it like out in space mother shot me a frightened glance it was too late dad stood there for a full half minute trying to find an answer then he shrugged its the best thing in a lifetime of best things then he caught himself oh its really nothing at all routine you wouldnt like it he looked at me apprehensively but you always go back habit wherere you going next i havent decided yet ill think it over he always thought it over in those days rocket pilots were rare and he could pick and choose work when he liked on the third night of his homecoming you could see him picking and choosing among the stars come on said mother lets go home it was still early when we got home i wanted dad to put on his uniform i shouldnt have askedit always made mother unhappybut i could not help myself i kept at him though he had always refused i had never seen him in it and at last he said oh all right we waited in the parlor while he went upstairs in the air flue mother looked at me dully as if she couldnt believe that her own son could do this to her i glanced away im sorry i said youre not helping at all she said at all there was a whisper in the air flue a moment later here i am said dad quietly we looked at him in his uniform it was glossy black with silver buttons and silver rims to the heels of the black boots and it looked as if someone had cut the arms and legs and body from a dark nebula with little faint stars glowing through it it fit as close as a glove fits to a slender long hand and it smelled like cool air and metal and space it smelled of fire and time father stood smiling awkwardly in the center of the room turn around said mother her eyes were remote looking at him when he was gone she never talked of him she never said anything about anything but the weather or the condition of my neck and the need of a washcloth for it or the fact that she didnt sleep nights once she said the light was too strong at night but theres no moon this week i said theres starlight she said i went to the store and bought her some darker greener shades as i lay in bed at night i could hear her pull them down tight to the bottom of the windows it made a long rustling noise once i tried to mow the lawn no mom stood in the door put the mower away so the grass went three months at a time without cutting dad cut it when he came home she wouldnt let me do anything else either like repairing the electrical breakfast maker or the mechanical book reader she saved everything up as if for christmas and then i would see dad hammering or tinkering and always smiling at his work and mother smiling over him happy no she never talked of him when he was gone and as for dad he never did anything to make a contact across the millions of miles he said once if i called you id want to be with you i wouldnt be happy once dad said to me your mother treats me sometimes as if i werent hereas if i were invisible i had seen her do it she would look just beyond him over his shoulder at his chin or hands but never into his eyes if she did look at his eyes her eyes were covered with a film like an animal going to sleep she said yes at the right times and smiled but always a half second later than expected im not there for her said dad but other days she would be there and he would be there for her and they would hold hands and walk around the block or take rides with moms hair flying like a girls behind her and she would cut off all the mechanical devices in the kitchen and bake him incredible cakes and pies and cookies looking deep into his face her smile a real smile but at the end of such days when he was there to her she would always cry and dad would stand helpless gazing about the room as if to find the answer but never finding it dad turned slowly in his uniform for us to see turn around again said mom the next morning dad came rushing into the house with handfuls of tickets pink rocket tickets for california blue tickets for mexico come on he said well buy disposable clothes and burn them when theyre soiled look we take the noon rocket to la the twooclock helicopter to santa barbara the nineoclock plane to ensenada sleep overnight and we went to california and up and down the pacific coast for a day and a half settling at last on the sands of malibu to cook wieners at night dad was always listening or singing or watching things on all sides of him holding onto things as if the world were a centrifuge going so swiftly that he might be flung off away from us at any instant the last afternoon at malibu mom was up in the hotel room dad lay on the sand beside me for a long time in the hot sun ah he sighed this is it his eyes were gently closed he lay on his back drinking the sun you miss this he said he meant on the rocket of course but he never said the rocket or mentioned the rocket and all the things you couldnt have on the rocket you couldnt have a salt wind on the rocket or a blue sky or a yellow sun or moms cooking you couldnt talk to your fourteenyearold boy on a rocket lets hear it he said at last and i knew that now we would talk as we had always talked for three hours straight all afternoon we would murmur back and forth in the lazy sun about my school grades how high i could jump how fast i could swim dad nodded each time i spoke and smiled and slapped my chest lightly in approval we talked we did not talk of rockets or space but we talked of mexico where we had driven once in an ancient car and of the butterflies we had caught in the rain forests of green warm mexico at noon seeing the hundred butterflies sucked to our radiator dying there beating their blue and crimson wings twitching beautiful and sad we talked of such things instead of the things i wanted to talk about and he listened to me that was the thing he did as if he was trying to fill himself up with all the sounds he could hear he listened to the wind and the falling ocean and my voice always with a rapt attention a concentration that almost excluded physical bodies themselves and kept only the sounds he shut his eyes to listen i would see him listening to the lawn mower as he cut the grass by hand instead of using the remotecontrol device and i would see him smelling the cut grass as it sprayed up at him behind the mower in a green fount doug be said about five in the afternoon as we were picking up our towels and heading back along the beach near the surf i want you to promise me something what dont ever be a rocket man i stopped i mean it he said because when youre out there you want to be here and when youre here you want to be out there dont start that dont let it get hold of you but you dont know what it is every time im out there i think if i ever get back to earth ill stay there ill never go out again but i go out and i guess ill always go out ive thought about being a rocket man for a long time i said he didnt hear me i try to stay here last saturday when i got home i started trying so damned hard to stay here i remembered him in the garden sweating and all the traveling and doing and listening and i knew that he did this to convince himself that the sea and the towns and the land and his family were the only real things and the good things but i knew where he would be tonight looking at the jewelry in orion from our front porch promise me you wont be like me he said i hesitated awhile okay i said he shook my hand good boy he said the dinner was fine that night mom had run about the kitchen with handfuls of cinnamon and dough and pots and pans tinkling and now a great turkey fumed on the table with dressing cranberry sauce peas and pumpkin pie in the middle of august said dad amazed you wont be here for thanksgiving so i wont he sniffed it he lifted each lid from each tureen and let the flavor steam over his sunburned face he said ah to each he looked at the room and his hands he gazed at the pictures on the wall the chairs the table me and mom he cleared his throat i saw him make up his mind lilly yes mom looked across her table which she had set like a wonderful silver trap a miraculous gravy pit into which like a struggling beast of the past caught in a tar pool her husband might at last be caught and held gazing out through a jail of wishbones safe forever her eyes sparkled lilly said dad go on i thought crazily say it quick say youll stay home this time for good and never go away say it just then a passing helicopter jarred the room and the windowpane shook with a crystal sound dad glanced at the window the blue stars of evening were there and the red planet mars was rising in the east dad looked at mars a full minute then he put his hand out blindly toward me may i have some peas he said excuse me said mother im going to get some bread she rushed out into the kitchen but theres bread on the table i said dad didnt look at me as he began his meal i couldnt sleep that night i came downstairs at one in the morning and the moonlight was like ice on all the housetops and dew glittered in a snow field on our grass i stood in the doorway in my pajamas feeling the warm night wind and then i knew that dad was sitting in the mechanical porch swing gliding gently i could see his profile tilted back and he was watching the stars wheel over the sky his eyes were like gray crystal there the moon in each one i went out and sat beside him we glided awhile in the swing at last i said how many ways are there to die in space a million name some the meteors hit you the air goes out of your rocket or comets take you along with them concussion strangulation explosion centrifugal force too much acceleration too little the heat the cold the sun the moon the stars the planets the asteroids the planetoids radiation and do they bury you they never find you where do you go a billion miles away traveling graves they call them you become a meteor or a planetoid traveling forever through space i said nothing one thing he said later its quick in space death its over like that you dont linger most of the time you dont even know it youre dead and thats it we went up to bed it was morning standing in the doorway dad listened to the yellow canary singing in its golden cage well ive decided he said next time i come home im home to stay dad i said tell your mother that when she gets up he said you mean it he nodded gravely see you in about three months and there he went off down the street carrying his uniform in its secret box whistling and looking at the tall green trees and picking chinaberries off the chinaberry bush as he brushed by tossing them ahead of him as he walked away into the bright shade of early morning i asked mother about a few things that morning after father had been gone a number of hours dad said that sometimes you dont act as if you hear or see him i said and then she explained everything to me quietly when he went off into space ten years ago i said to myself hes dead or as good as dead so think of him dead and when he comes back three or four times a year its not him at all its only a pleasant little memory or a dream and if a memory stops or a dream stops it cant hurt half as much so most of the time i think of him dead but other times other times i cant help myself i bake pies and treat him as if he were alive and then it hurts no its better to think he hasnt been here for ten years and ill never see him again it doesnt hurt as much didnt he say next time hed settle down she shook her head slowly no hes dead im very sure of that hell come alive again then i said ten years ago said mother i thought what if he dies on venus then well never be able to see venus again what if he dies on mars well never be able to look at mars again all red in the sky without wanting to go in and lock the door or what if he died on jupiter or saturn or neptune on those nights when those planets were high in the sky we wouldnt want to have anything to do with the stars i guess not i said the message came the next day the messenger gave it to me and i read it standing on the porch the sun was setting mom stood in the screen door behind me watching me fold the message and put it in my pocket mom i said dont tell me anything i dont already know she said she didnt cry well it wasnt mars and it wasnt venus and it wasnt jupiter or saturn that killed him we wouldnt have to think of him every time jupiter or saturn or mars lit up the evening sky this was different his ship had fallen into the sun and the sun was big and fiery and merciless and it was always in the sky and you couldnt get away from it so for a long time after my father died my mother slept through the days and wouldnt go out we had breakfast at midnight and lunch at three in the morning and dinner at the cold dim hour of am we went to allnight shows and went to bed at sunrise and for a long while the only days we ever went out to walk were the days when it was raining and there was no sun the fire balloons fire exploded over summer night lawns you saw sparkling faces of uncles and aunts skyrockets fell up in the brown shining eyes of cousins on the porch and the cold charred sticks thumped down in dry meadows far away the very reverend father joseph daniel peregrine opened his eyes what a dream he and his cousins with their fiery play at his grandfathers ancient ohio home so many years ago he lay listening to the great hollow of the church the other cells where other fathers lay had they too on the eve of the flight of the rocket crucifix lain with memories of the fourth of july yes this was like those breathless independence dawns when you waited for the first concussion and rushed out on the dewy sidewalks your hands full of loud miracles so here they were the episcopal fathers in the breathing dawn before they pinwheeled off to mars leaving their incense through the velvet cathedral of space should we go at all whispered father peregrine shouldnt we solve our own sins on earth arent we running from our lives here he arose his fleshy body with its rich look of strawberries milk and steak moving heavily or is it sloth he wondered do i dread the journey he stepped into the needlespray shower but i shall take you to mars body he addressed himself leaving old sins here and on to mars to find new sins a delightful thought almost sins no one had ever thought of oh he himself had written a little book the problem of sin on other worlds ignored as somehow not serious enough by his episcopal brethren only last night over a final cigar he and father stone had talked of it on mars sin might appear as virtue we must guard against virtuous acts there that later might be found to be sins said father peregrine beaming how exciting its been centuries since so much adventure has accompanied the prospect of being a missionary i will recognize sin said father stone bluntly even on mars oh we priests pride ourselves on being litmus paper changing color in sins presence retorted father peregrine but what if martian chemistry is such we do not color at all if there are new senses on mars you must admit the possibility of unrecognizable sin if there is no malice aforethought there is no sin or punishment for samethe lord assures us that father stone replied on earth yes but perhaps a martian sin might inform the subconscious of its evil telepathically leaving the conscious mind of man free to act seemingly without malice what then what could there be in the way of new sins father peregrine leaned heavily forward adam alone did not sin add eve and you add temptation add a second man and you make adultery possible with the addition of sex or people you add sin if men were armless they could not strangle with their hands you would not have that particular sin of murder add arms and you add the possibility of a new violence amoebas cannot sin because they reproduce by fission they do not covet wives or murder each other add sex to amoebas add arms and legs and you would have murder and adultery add an arm or leg or person or take away each and you add or subtract possible evil on mars what if there are five new senses organs invisible limbs we cant conceive ofthen mightnt there be five new sins father stone gasped i think you enjoy this sort of thing i keep my mind alive father just alive is all your minds always juggling isnt itmirrors torches plates yes because sometimes the church seems like those posed circus tableaus where the curtain lifts and men white zincoxide talcumpowder statues freeze to represent abstract beauty very wonderful but i hope there will always be room for me to dart about among the statues dont you father stone father stone had moved away i think wed better go to bed in a few hours well be jumping up to see your new sins father peregrine the rocket stood ready for the firing the fathers walked from their devotions in the chilly morning many a fine priest from new york or chicago or los angelesthe church was sending its bestwalking across town to the frosty field walking father peregrine remembered the bishops words father peregrine you will captain the missionaries with father stone at your side having chosen you for this serious task i find my reasons deplorably obscure father but your pamphlet on planetary sin did not go unread you are a flexible man and mars is like that uncleaned closet we have neglected for millenniums sin has collected there like bricabrac mars is twice earths age and has had double the number of saturday nights liquor baths and eyepoppings at women as naked as white seals when we open that closet door things will fall on us we need a quick flexible manone whose mind can dodge anyone a little too dogmatic might break in two i feel youll be resilient father the job is yours the bishop and the fathers knelt the blessing was said and the rocket given a little shower of holy water arising the bishop addressed them i know you will go with god to prepare the martians for the reception of his truth i wish you all a thoughtful journey they filed past the bishop twenty men robes whispering to deliver their hands into his kind hands before passing into the cleansed projectile i wonder said father peregrine at the last moment if mars is hell only waiting for our arrival before it bursts into brimstone and fire lord be with us said father stone the rocket moved coming out of space was like coming out of the most beautiful cathedral they had ever seen touching mars was like touching the ordinary pavement outside the church five minutes after having really known your love for god the fathers stepped gingerly from the steaming rocket and knelt upon martian sand while father peregrine gave thanks lord we thank thee for the journey through thy rooms and lord we have reached a new land so we must have new eyes we shall hear new sounds and must needs have new ears and there will he new sins for which we ask the gift of better and firmer and purer hearts amen they arose and here was mars like a sea under which they trudged in the guise of submarine biologists seeking life here the territory of hidden sin oh how carefully they must all balance like gray feathers in this new element afraid that walking itself might be sinful or breathing or simple fasting and here was the mayor of first town come to meet them with outstretched hand what can i do for you father peregrine wed like to know about the martians for only if we know about them can we plan our church intelligently are they ten feet tall we will build large doors are their skins blue or red or green we must know when we put human figures in the stained glass so we may use the right skin color are they heavy we will build sturdy seats for them father said the mayor i dont think you should worry about the martians there are two races one of them is pretty well dead a few are in hiding and the second racewell theyre not quite human oh father peregrines heart quickened theyre round luminous globes of light father living in those hills man or beast who can say but they act intelligently i hear the mayor shrugged of course theyre not men so i dont think youll care on the contrary said father peregrine swiftly intelligent you say theres a story a prospector broke his leg in those hills and would have died there the blue spheres of light came at him when he woke he was down on a highway and didnt know how he got there drunk said father stone thats the story said the mayor father peregrine with most of the martians dead and only these blue spheres i frankly think youd be better off in first city mars is opening up its a frontier now like in the old days on earth out west and in alaska men are pouring up here therere a couple thousand black irish mechanics and miners and day laborers in first town who need saving because therere too many wicked women came with them and too much tencenturyold martian wine father peregrine was gazing into the soft blue hills father stone cleared his throat well father father peregrine did not hear spheres of blue fire yes father ah father peregrine sighed blue balloons father stone shook his head a circus father peregrine felt his wrists pounding he saw the little frontier town with raw freshbuilt sin and he saw the hills old with the oldest and yet perhaps an even newer sin mayor could your black irish laborers cook one more day in hellfire id turn and baste them for you father father peregrine nodded to the hills then thats where well go there was a murmur from everyone it would be so simple explained father peregrine to go into town i prefer to think that if the lord walked here and people said here is the beaten path he would reply show me the weeds i will make a path but father stone think how it would weigh upon us if we passed sinners by and did not extend our hands but globes of fire i imagine man looked funny to other animals when we first appeared yet he has a soul for all his homeliness until we prove otherwise let us assume that these fiery spheres have souls all right agreed the mayor but youll be back to town well see first some breakfast then you and i father stone will walk alone into the hills i dont want to frighten those fiery martians with machines or crowds shall we have breakfast the fathers ate in silence at nightfall father peregrine and father stone were high in the hills they stopped and sat upon a rock to enjoy a moment of relaxation and waiting the martians had not as yet appeared and they both felt vaguely disappointed i wonder father peregrine mopped his face do you think if we called hello they might answer father peregrine wont you ever be serious not until the good lord is oh dont look so terribly shocked please the lord is not serious in fact it is a little hard to know just what else he is except loving and love has to do with humor doesnt it for you cannot love someone unless you put up with him can you and you cannot put up with someone constantly unless you can laugh at him isnt that true and certainly we are ridiculous little animals wallowing in the fudge bowl and god must love us all the more because we appeal to his humor i never thought of god as humorous said father stone the creator of the platypus the camel the ostrich and man oh come now father peregrine laughed but at this instant from among the twilight hills like a series of blue lamps lit to guide their way came the martians father stone saw them first look father peregrine turned and the laughter stopped in his mouth the round blue globes of fire hovered among the twinkling stars distantly trembling monsters father stone leaped up but father peregrine caught him wait we shouldve gone to town no listen look pleaded father peregrine im afraid dont be this is gods work the devils no now quiet father peregrine gentled him and they crouched with the soft blue light on their upturned faces as the fiery orbs drew near and again independence night thought father peregrine tremoring he felt like a child back in those july fourth evenings the sky blowing apart breaking into powdery stars and burning sound the concussions jingling house windows like the ice on a thousand thin ponds the aunts uncles cousins crying as to some celestial physician the summer sky colors and the fire balloons lit by an indulgent grandfather steadied in his massively tender hands oh the memory of those lovely fire balloons softly lighted warmly billowed bits of tissue like insect wings lying like folded wasps in boxes and last of all after the day of riot and fury at long last from their boxes delicately unfolded blue red white patrioticthe fire balloons he saw the dim faces of dear relatives long dead and mantled with moss as grandfather lit the tiny candle and let the warm air breathe up to form the balloon plumply luminous in his hands a shining vision which they held reluctant to let it go for once released it was yet another year gone from life another fourth another bit of beauty vanished and then up up still up through the warm summer night constellations the fire balloons had drifted while redwhiteandblue eyes followed them wordless from family porches away into deep illinois country over night rivers and sleeping mansions the fire balloons dwindled forever gone father peregrine felt tears in his eyes above him the martians not one but a thousand whispering fire balloons it seemed hovered any moment he might find his longdead and blessed grandfather at his elbow staring up at beauty but it was father stone lets go please father i must speak to them father peregrine rustled forward not knowing what to say for what had he ever said to the fire balloons of time past except with his mind you are beautiful you are beautiful and that was not enough now he could only lift his heavy arms and call upward as he had often wished to call after the enchanted fire balloons hello but the fiery spheres only burned like images in a dark minor they seemed fixed gaseous miraculous forever we come with god said father peregrine to the sky silly silly silly father stone chewed the back of his hand in the name of god father peregrine stop but now the phosphorescent spheres blew away into the hills in a moment they were gone father peregrine called again and the echo of his last cry shook the hills above turning he saw an avalanche shake out dust pause and then with a thunder of stone wheels crash down the mountain upon them look what youve done cried father stone father peregrine was almost fascinated then horrified he turned knowing they could run only a few feet before the rocks crushed them into ruins he had time to whisper oh lord and the rocks fell father they were separated like chaff from wheat there was a blue shimmering of globes a shift of cold stars a roar and then they stood upon a ledge two hundred feet away watching the spot where their bodies should have been buried under tons of stone the blue light evaporated the two fathers clutched each other what happened the blue fires lifted us we ran that was it no the globes saved us they couldnt they did the sky was empty there was a feel as if a great bell had just stopped tolling reverberations lingered in their teeth and marrows lets get away from here youll have us killed i havent feared death for a good many years father stone weve proved nothing those blue lights ran off at the first cry its useless no father peregrine was suffused with a stubborn wonder somehow they saved us that proves they have souls it proves only that they might have saved us everything was confused we might have escaped ourselves they are not animals father stone animals do not save lives especially of strangers there is mercy and compassion here perhaps tomorrow we may prove more prove what how father stone was immensely tired now the outrage to his mind and body showed on his stiff face follow them in helicopters reading chapter and verse theyre not human they havent eyes or ears or bodies like ours but i feel something about them replied father peregrine i know a great revelation is at hand they saved us they think they had a choice let us live or die that proves free will father stone set to work building a fire glaring at the sticks in his hands choking on the gray smoke i myself will open a convent for nursling geese a monastery for sainted swine and i shall build a miniature apse in a microscope so that paramecium can attend services and tell their beads with their flagella oh father stone im sorry father stone blinked redly across the fire but this is like blessing a crocodile before he chews you up youre risking the entire missionary expedition we belong in first town washing liquor from mens throats and perfume off their hands cant you recognize the human in the inhuman id much rather recognize the inhuman in the human but if i prove these things sin know sin know a moral life have free will and intellect father stone that will take much convincing the night grew rapidly cold and they peered into the fire to find their wildest thoughts while eating biscuits and berries and soon they were bundled for sleep under the chiming stars and just before turning over one last time father stone who had been thinking for many minutes to find something to bother father peregrine about stared into the soft pink charcoal bed and said no adam and eve on mars no original sin maybe the martians live in a state of gods grace then we can go back down to town and start work on the earthmen father peregrine reminded himself to say a little prayer for father stone who got so mad and who was now being vindictive god help him yes father stone but the martians killed some of our settlers thats sinful there must have been an original sin and a martian adam and eve well find them men are men unfortunately no matter what their shape and inclined to sin but father stone was pretending sleep father peregrine did not shut his eyes of course they couldnt let these martians go to hell could they with a compromise to their consciences could they go back to the new colonial towns those towns so full of sinful gullets and women with scintilla eyes and white oyster bodies rollicking in beds with lonely laborers wasnt that the place for the fathers wasnt this trek into the hills merely a personal whim was he really thinking of gods church or was he quenching the thirst of a spongelike curiosity those blue round globes of st anthonys firehow they burned in his mind what a challenge to find the man behind the mask the human behind the inhuman wouldnt he be proud if he could say even to his secret self that he had converted a rolling huge pool table full of fiery spheres what a sin of pride worth doing penance for but then one did many prideful things out of love and he loved the lord so much and was so happy at it that he wanted everyone else to be happy too the last thing he saw before sleep was the return of the blue fires like a flight of burning angels silently singing him to his worried rest the blue round dreams were still there in the sky when father peregrine awoke in the early morning father stone slept like a stiff bundle quietly father peregrine watched the martians floating and watching him they were humanhe knew it but he must prove it or face a drymouthed dryeyed bishop telling him kindly to step aside but how to prove humanity if they hid in the high vaults of the sky how to bring them nearer and provide answers to the many questions they saved us from the avalanche father peregrine arose moved off among the rocks and began to climb the nearest hill until he came to a place where a cliff dropped sheerly to a floor two hundred feet below he was choking from his vigorous climb in the frosty air he stood getting his breath if i fell from here it would surely kill me he let a pebble drop moments later it clicked on the rocks below the lord would never forgive me he tossed another pebble it wouldnt be suicide would it if i did it out of love he lifted his gaze to the blue spheres but first another try he called to them hello hello the echoes tumbled upon each other but the blue fires did not blink or move he talked to them for five minutes when he stopped he peered down and saw father stone still indignantly asleep below in the little camp i must prove everything father peregrine stepped to the cliff rim i am an old man i am not afraid surely the lord will understand that i am doing this for him he drew a deep breath all his life swam through his eyes and he thought in a moment shall i die i am afraid that i love living much too much but i love other things more and thinking thus he stepped off the cliff he fell fool he cried he tumbled end over end you were wrong the rocks rushed up at him and he saw himself dashed on them and sent to glory why did i do this thing but he knew the answer and an instant later was calm as he fell the wind roared around him and the rocks hurtled to meet him and then there was a shift of stars a glimmering of blue light and he felt himself surrounded by blueness and suspended a moment later he was deposited with a gentle bump upon the rocks where he sat a full moment alive and touching himself and looking up at those blue lights that had withdrawn instantly you saved me he whispered you wouldnt let me die you knew it was wrong he rushed over to father stone who still lay quietly asleep father father wake up he shook him and brought him round father they saved me who saved you father stone blinked and sat up father peregrine related his experience a dream a nightmare go back to sleep said father stone irritably you and your circus balloons but i was awake now now father calm yourself there now you dont believe me have you a gun yes there let me have it what are you going to do father stone handed over the small pistol they had brought along for protection against snakes or other similar and unpredictable animals father peregrine seized the pistol ill prove it he pointed the pistol at his own hand and fired stop there was a shimmer of light and before their eyes the bullet stood upon the air poised an inch from his open palm it hung for a moment surrounded by a blue phosphorescence then it fell hissing into the dust father peregrine fired the gun three timesat his hand at his leg at his body the three bullets hovered glittering and like dead insects fell at their feet you see said father peregrine letting his arm fall and allowing the pistol to drop after the bullets they know they understand they are not animals they think and judge and live in a moral climate what animal would save me from myself like this there is no animal would do that only another man father now do you believe father stone was watching the sky and the blue lights and now silently he dropped to one knee and picked up the warm bullets and cupped them in his hand he closed his hand tight the sun was rising behind them i think we had better go down to the others and tell them of this and bring them back up here said father peregrine by the time the sun was up they were well on their way back to the rocket father peregrine drew the round circle in the center of the blackboard this is christ the son of the father he pretended not to hear the other fathers sharp intake of breath this is christ in all his glory he continued it looks like a geometry problem observed father stone a fortunate comparison for we deal with symbols here christ is no less christ you must admit in being represented by a circle or a square for centuries the cross has symbolized his love and agony so this circle will be the martian christ this is how we shall bring him to mars the fathers stirred fretfully and looked at each other you brother mathias will create in glass a replica of this circle a globe filled with bright fire it will stand upon the altar a cheap magic trick muttered father stone father peregrine went on patiently on the contrary we are giving them god in an understandable image if christ had come to us on earth as an octopus would we have accepted him readily he spread his hands was it then a cheap magic trick of the lords to bring us christ through jesus in mans shape after we bless the church we build here and sanctify its altar and this symbol do you think christ would refuse to inhabit the shape before us you know in your hearts he would not refuse but the body of a soulless animal said brother mathias weve already gone over that many times since we returned this morning brother mathias these creatures saved us from the avalanche they realized that selfdestruction was sinful and prevented it time after time therefore we must build a church in the hills live with them to find their own special ways of sinning the alien ways and help them to discover god the fathers did not seem pleased at the prospect is it because they are so odd to the eye wondered father peregrine but what is a shape only a cup for the blazing soul that god provides us all if tomorrow i found that sea lions suddenly possessed free will intellect knew when not to sin knew what life was and tempered justice with mercy and life with love then i would build an undersea cathedral and if the sparrows should miraculously with gods will gain everlasting souls tomorrow i would freight a church with helium and take after them for all souls in any shape if they have free will and are aware of their sins will burn in hell unless given their rightful communions i would not let a martian sphere burn in hell either for it is a sphere only in mine eyes when i close my eyes it stands before me an intelligence a love a souland i must not deny it but that glass globe you wish placed on the altar protested father stone consider the chinese replied father peregrine imperturbably what sort of christ do christian chinese worship an oriental christ naturally youve all seen oriental nativity scenes how is christ dressed in eastern robes where does he walk in chinese settings of bamboo and misty mountain and crooked tree his eyelids taper his cheekbones rise each country each race adds something to our lord i am reminded of the virgin of guadalupe to whom all mexico pays its love her skin have you noticed the paintings of her a dark skin like that of her worshipers is this blasphemy not at all it is not logical that men should accept a god no matter how real of another color i often wonder why our missionaries do well in africa with a snowwhite christ perhaps because white is a sacred color in albino or any other form to the african tribes given time mightnt christ darken there too the form does not matter content is everything we cannot expect these martians to accept an alien form we shall give them christ in their own image theres a flaw in your reasoning father said father stone wont the martians suspect us of hypocrisy they will realize that we dont worship a round globular christ but a man with limbs and a head how do we explain the difference by showing there is none christ will fill any vessel that is offered bodies or globes he is there and each will worship the same thing in a different guise what is more we must believe in this globe we give the martians we must believe in a shape which is meaningless to us as to form this spheroid will be christ and we must remember that we ourselves and the shape of our earth christ would be meaningless ridiculous a squander of material to these martians father peregrine laid aside his chalk now let us go into the hills and build our church the fathers began to pack their equipment the church was not a church but an area cleared of rocks a plateau on one of the low mountains its soil smoothed and brushed and an altar established whereon brother mathias placed the fiery globe he had constructed at the end of six days of work the church was ready what shall we do with this father stone tapped an iron bell they had brought along what does a bell mean to them i imagine i brought it for our own comfort admitted father peregrine we need a few familiarities this church seems so little like a church and we feel somewhat absurd hereeven i for it is something new this business of converting the creatures of another world i feel like a ridiculous play actor at times and then i pray to god to lend me strength many of the fathers are unhappy some of them joke about all this father peregrine i know well put this bell in a small tower for their comfort anyway what about the organ well play it at the first service tomorrow but the martians i know but again i suppose for our own comfort our own music later we may discover theirs they arose very early on sunday morning and moved through the coldness like pale phantoms rime tinkling on their habits covered with chimes they were shaking down showers of silver water i wonder if it is sunday here on mars mused father peregrine but seeing father stone wince he hastened on it might be tuesday or thursdaywho knows but no matter my idle fancy its sunday to us come the fathers walked into the flat wide area of the church and knelt shivering and bluelipped father peregrine said a little prayer and put his cold fingers to the organ keys the music went up like a flight of pretty birds he touched the keys like a man moving his hands among the weeds of a wild garden startling up great soarings of beauty into the hills the music calmed the air it smelled the fresh smell of morning the music drifted into the mountains and shook down mineral powders in a dusty rain the fathers waited well father peregrine father stone eyed the empty sky where the sun was rising furnacered i dont see our friends let me try again father peregrine was perspiring he built an architecture of each stone by exquisite stone raising a music cathedral so vast that its furthest chancels were in nineveh its furthest dome at st peters left hand the music stayed and did not crash in ruin when it was over but partook of a series of white clouds and was carried away among other lands the sky was still empty theyll come but father peregrine felt the panic in his chest very small growing let us pray let us ask them to come they read minds they know the fathers lowered themselves yet again in rustlings and whispers they prayed and to the east out of the icy mountains of seven oclock on sunday morning or perhaps thursday morning or maybe monday morning on mars came the soft fiery globes they hovered and sank and filled the area around the shivering priests thank you oh thank you lord father peregrine shut his eyes tight and played the music and when it was done he turned and gazed upon his wondrous congregation and a voice touched his mind and the voice said we have come for a little while you may stay said father peregrine for a little while only said the voice quietly we have come to tell you certain things we should have spoken sooner but we had hoped that you might go on your way if left alone father peregrine started to speak but the voice hushed him we are the old ones the voice said and it entered him like a blue gaseous flare and burned in the chambers of his head we are the old martians who left our marble cities and went into the hills forsaking the material life we had lived so very long ago we became these things that we now are once we were men with bodies and legs and arms such as yours the legend has it that one of us a good man discovered a way to free mans soul and intellect to free him of bodily ills and melancholies of deaths and transfigurations of ill humors and senilities and so we took on the look of lightning and blue fire and have lived in the winds and skies and hills forever after that neither prideful nor arrogant neither rich nor poor passionate nor cold we have lived apart from those we left behind those other men of this world and how we came to be has been forgotten the process lost but we shall never die nor do harm we have put away the sins of the body and live in gods grace we covet no other property we have no property we do not steal nor kill nor lust nor hate we live in happiness we cannot reproduce we no not eat or drink or make war all the sensualities and childishnesses and sins of the body were stripped away when our bodies were put aside we have left sin behind father peregrine and it is burned like the leaves in the autumn and it is gone like the soiled snow of an evil winter and it is gone like the sexual flowers of a redandyellow spring and it is gone like the panting nights of hottest summer and our season is temperate and our clime is rich in thought father peregrine was standing now for the voice touched him at such a pitch that it almost shook him from his senses it was an ecstasy and a fire washing through him we wish to tell you that we appreciate your building this place for us but we have no need of it for each of us is a temple unto himself and needs no place wherein to cleanse himself forgive us for not coming to you sooner but we are separate and apart and have talked to no one for ten thousand years nor have we interfered in any way with the life of this planet it has come into your mind now that we are the lilies of the field we toil not neither do we spin you are right and so we suggest that you take the parts of this temple into your own new cities and there cleanse others for rest assured we are happy and at peace the fathers were on their knees in the vast blue light and father peregrine was down too and they were weeping and it did not matter that their time had been wasted it did not matter to them at all the blue spheres murmured and began to rise once more on a breath of cool air may icried father peregrine not daring to ask eyes closedmay i come again someday that i may learn from you the blue fires blazed the air trembled yes someday he might come again someday and then the fire balloons blew away and were gone and he was like a child on his knees tears streaming from his eyes crying to himself come back come back and at any moment grandfather might lift him and carry him upstairs to his bedroom in a longgone ohio town they filed down out of the hills at sunset looking back father peregrine saw the blue fires burning no he thought we couldnt build a church for the likes of you youre beauty itself what church could compete with the fireworks of the pure soul father stone moved in silence beside him and at last he spoke the way i see it is theres a truth on every planet all parts of the big truth on a certain day theyll all fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw this has been a shaking experience ill never doubt again father peregrine for this truth here is as true as earths truth and they lie side by side and well go on to other worlds adding the sum of the parts of the truth until one day the whole total will stand before us like the light of a new day thats a lot coming from you father stone im sorry now in a way were going down to the town to handle our own kind those blue lights now when they settled about us and that voice father stone shivered father peregrine reached out to take the others arm they walked together and you know said father stone finally fixing his eyes on brother mathias who strode ahead with the glass sphere tenderly carried in his arms that glass sphere with the blue phosphorous light glowing forever inside it you know father peregrine that globe there yes its him it is him after all father peregrine smiled and they walked down out of the hills toward the new town the last night of the world what would you do if you knew that this was the last night of the world what would i do you mean seriously yes seriously i dont know i hadnt thought he poured some coffee in the background the two girls were playing blocks on the parlor rug in the light of the green hurricane lamps there was an easy clean aroma of the brewed coffee in the evening air well better start thinking about it he said you dont mean it he nodded a war he shook his head not the hydrogen or atom bomb no or germ warfare none of those at all he said stirring his coffee slowly but just lets say the closing of a book i dont think i understand no nor do i really its just a feeling sometimes it frightens me sometimes im not frightened at all but at peace he glanced in at the girls and their yellow hair shining in the lamplight i didnt say anything to you it first happened about four nights ago what a dream i had i dreamed that it was all going to be over and a voice said it was not any kind of voice i can remember but a voice anyway and it said things would stop here on earth i didnt think too much about it the next day but then i went to the office and caught stan willis looking out the window in the middle of the afternoon and i said a penny for your thoughts stan and he said i had a dream last night and before he even told me the dream i knew what it was i could have told him but he told me and i listened to him it was the same dream the same i told stan i had dreamed it too he didnt seem surprised he relaxed in fact then we started walking through the office for the hell of it it wasnt planned we didnt say lets walk around we just walked on our own and everywhere we saw people looking at their desks or their hands or out windows i talked to a few so did stan and they all had dreamed all of them the same dream with no difference do you believe in it yes ive never been more certain and when will it stop the world i mean sometime during the night for us and then as the night goes on around the world thatll go too itll take twentyfour hours for it all to go they sat awhile not touching their coffee then they lifted it slowly and drank looking at each other do we deserve this she said its not a matter of deserving its just that things didnt work out i notice you didnt even argue about this why not i guess ive a reason she said the same one everyone at the office had she nodded slowly i didnt want to say anything it happened last night and the women on the block talked about it among themselves today they dreamed i thought it was only a coincidence she picked up the evening paper theres nothing in the paper about it everyone knows so theres no need he sat back in his chair watching her are you afraid no i always thought i would be but im not wheres that spirit called selfpreservation they talk so much about i dont know you dont get too excited when you feel things are logical this is logical nothing else but this could have happened from the way weve lived we havent been too bad have we no nor enormously good i suppose thats the troublewe havent been very much of anything except us while a big part of the world was busy being lots of quite awful things the girls were laughing in the parlor i always thought people would be screaming in the streets at a time like this i guess not you dont scream about the real thing do you know i wont miss anything but you and the girls i never liked cities or my work or anything except you three i wont miss a thing except perhaps the change in the weather and a glass of ice water when its hot and i might miss sleeping how can we sit here and talk this way because theres nothing else to do thats it of course for if there were wed be doing it i suppose this is the first time in the history of the world that everyone has known just what they were going to do during the night i wonder what everyone else will do now this evening for the next few hours go to a show listen to the radio watch television play cards put the children to bed go to bed themselves like always in a way thats something to be proud oflike always they sat a moment and then he poured himself another coffee why do you suppose its tonight because why not some other night in the last century or five centuries ago or ten maybe its because it was never october ever before in history and now it is and thats it because this date means more than any other date ever meant because its the year when things are as they are all over the world and thats why its the end there are bombers on their schedules both ways across the ocean tonight thatll never see land thats part of the reason why well he said getting up what shall it be wash the dishes they washed the dishes and stacked them away with special neatness at eightthirty the girls were put to bed and kissed good night and the little lights by their beds turned on and the door left open just a trifle i wonder said the husband coming from the bedroom and glancing back standing there with his pipe for a moment what if the door will be shut all the way or if itll be left just a little ajar so some light comes in i wonder if the children know no of course not they sat and read the papers and talked and listened to some radio music and then sat together by the fireplace watching the charcoal embers as the clock struck tenthirty and eleven and eleventhirty they thought of all the other people in the world who had spent their evening each in his own special way well he said at last he kissed his wife for a long time weve been good for each other anyway do you want to cry he asked i dont think so they moved through the house and turned out the lights and went into the bedroom and stood in the night cool darkness undressing and pushing back the covers the sheets are so clean and nice im tired were all tired they got into bed and lay back just a moment she said he heard her get out of bed and go into the kitchen a moment later she returned i left the water running in the sink she said something about this was so very funny that he had to laugh she laughed with him knowing what it was that she had done that was funny they stopped laughing at last and lay in their cool night bed their hands clasped their heads together good night he said after a moment good night she said the exiles their eyes were fire and the breath flamed out the witches mouths as they bent to probe the caldron with greasy stick and bony finger when shall we three meet again in thunder lightning or in rain they danced drunkenly on the shore of an empty sea fouling the air with their three tongues and burning it with their cats eyes malevolently aglitter round about the cauldron go in the poisond entrails throw double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble they paused and cast a glance about wheres the crystal where the needles here good is the yellow wax thickened yes pour it in the iron mold is the wax figure done they shaped it like molasses adrip on their green hands shove the needle through the heart the crystal the crystal fetch it from the tarot bag dust it off have a look they bent to the crystal their faces white see see see a rocket ship moved through space from the planet earth to the planet mars on the rocket ship men were dying the captain raised his head tiredly well have to use the morphine but captain you see yourself this mans condition the captain lifted the wool blanket and the man restrained beneath the wet sheet moved and groaned the air was full of sulphurous thunder i saw iti saw it the man opened his eyes and stared at the port where there were only black spaces reeling stars earth far removed and the planet mars rising large and red i saw ita bat a huge thing a bat with a mans face spread over the front port fluttering and fluttering fluttering and fluttering pulse asked the captain the orderly measured it one hundred and thirty he cant go on with that use the morphine come along smith they moved away suddenly the floor plates were laced with bone and white skulls that screamed the captain did not dare look down and over the screaming he said is this where perse is turning in at a hatch a whitesmocked surgeon stepped away from a body i just dont understand it how did perse die we dont know captain it wasnt his heart his brain or shock he justdied the captain felt the doctors wrist which changed to a hissing snake and bit him the captain did not flinch take care of yourself youve a pulse too the doctor nodded perse complained of painsneedles he saidin his wrists and legs said he felt like wax melting he fell i helped him up he cried like a child said he had a silver needle in his heart he died here he is we can repeat the autopsy for you everythings physically normal thats impossible he died of something the captain walked to a port he smelled of menthol and iodine and green soap on his polished and manicured hands his white teeth were dentifriced and his ears scoured to a pinkness as were his cheeks his uniform was the color of new salt and his boots were black mirrors shining below him his crisp crewcut hair smelled of sharp alcohol even his breath was sharp and new and clean there was no spot to him he was a fresh instrument honed and ready still hot from the surgeons oven the men with him were from the same mold one expected huge brass keys spiraling slowly from their backs they were expensive talented welloiled toys obedient and quick the captain watched the planet mars grow very large in space well be landing in an hour on that damned place smith did you see any bats or have other nightmares yes sir the month before our rocket took off from new york sir white rats biting my neck drinking my blood i didnt tell i was afraid you wouldnt let me come on this trip never mind sighed the captain i had dreams too in all of my fifty years i never had a dream until that week before we took off from earth and then every night i dreamed i was a white wolf caught on a snowy hill shot with a silver bullet buried with a stake in my heart he moved his head toward mars do you think smith they know were coming we dont know if there are martian people sir dont we they began frightening us off eight weeks ago before we started theyve killed perse and reynolds now yesterday they made crenville go blind how i dont know bats needles dreams men dying for no reason id call it witchcraft in another day but this is the year smith were rational men this all cant be happening but it is whoever they are with their needles and their bats theyll try to finish us all he swung about smith fetch those books from my file i want them when we land two hundred books were piled on the rocket deck thank you smith have you glanced at them think im insane perhaps its a crazy hunch at that last moment i ordered these books from the historical museum because of my dreams twenty nights i was stabbed butchered a screaming bat pinned to a surgical mat a thing rotting underground in a black box bad wicked dreams our whole crew dreamed of witchthings and werethings vampires and phantoms things they couldnt know anything about why because books on such ghastly subjects were destroyed a century ago by law forbidden for anyone to own the grisly volumes these books you see here are the last copies kept for historical purposes in the locked museum vaults smith bent to read the dusty titles tales of mystery and imagination by edgar allan poe dracula by brain stoker frankenstein by mary shelley the turn of the screw by henry james the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving rappaccinis daughter by nathaniel hawthorne an occurrence at owl creek bridge by ambrose bierce alice in wonderland by lewis carroll the willows by algernon blackwood the wizard of oz by l frank baum the weird shadow over innsmouth by h p lovecraft and more books by walter de la mare wakefield harvey wells asquith huxleyall forbidden authors all burned in the same year that halloween was outlawed and christmas was banned but sir what good are these to us on the rocket i dont know sighed the captain yet the three bags lifted the crystal where the captains image flickered his tiny voice tinkling out of the glass i dont know sighed the captain yet the three witches glared redly into one anothers faces we havent much time said one better warn them in the city theyll want to know about the books it doesnt look good that fool of a captain in an hour theyll land their rocket the three bags shuddered and blinked up at the emerald city by the edge of the dry martian sea in its highest window a small man held a bloodred drape aside he watched the wastelands where the three witches fed their caldron and shaped the waxes farther along ten thousand other blue fires and laurel incenses black tobacco smokes and fir weeds cinnamons and bone dusts rose soft as moths through the martian night the man counted the angry magical fires then as the three witches stared he turned the crimson drape released fell causing the distant portal to wink like a yellow eye mr edgar allan poe stood in the tower window a faint vapor of spirits upon his breath hecates friends are busy tonight he said seeing the witches far below a voice behind him said i saw will shakespeare at the shore earlier whipping them on all along the sea shakespeares army alone tonight numbers thousands the three witches oberon hamlets father puckall all of themthousands good lord a regular sea of people good william poe turned he let the crimson drape fall shut he stood for a moment to observe the raw stone room the blacktimbered table the candle flame the other man mr ambrose bierce sitting very idly there lighting matches and watching them burn down whistling under his breath now and then laughing to himself well have to tell mr dickens now said mr poe weve put it off too long its a matter of hours will you go down to his home with me bierce bierce glanced up merrily ive just been thinkingwhatll happen to us if we cant kill the rocket men off frighten them away then well have to leave of course well go on to jupiter and when they come to jupiter well go on to saturn and when they come to saturn well go to uranus or neptune and then on out to pluto where then mr poes face was weary there were fire coals remaining fading in his eyes and a sad wildness in the way he talked and a uselessness of his hands and the way his hair fell lankly over his amazing white brow he was like a satan of some lost dark cause a general arrived from a derelict invasion his silky soft black mustache was worn away by his musing lips he was so small his brow seemed to float vast and phosphorescent by itself in the dark room we have the advantages of superior forms of travel he said we can always hope for one of their atomic wars dissolution the dark ages come again the return of superstition we could go back then to earth all of us in one night mr poes black eyes brooded under his round and luminant brow he gazed at the ceiling so theyre coming to ruin this world too they wont leave anything undefiled will they does a wolf pack stop until its killed its prey and eaten the guts it should be quite a war i shall sit on the side lines and be the scorekeeper so many earthmen boiled in oil so many mss found in bottles burnt so many earthmen stabbed with needles so many red deaths put to flight by a battery of hypodermic syringesha poe swayed angrily faintly drunk with wine what did we do be with us bierce in the name of god did we have a fair trial before a company of literary critics no our books were plucked up by neat sterile surgeons pliers and flung into vats to boil to be killed of all their mortuary germs damn them all i find our situation amusing said bierce they were interrupted by a hysterical shout from the tower stair mr poe mr bierce yes yes were coming poe and bierce descended to find a man gasping against the stone passage wall have you heard the news he cried immediately clawing at them like a man about to fall over a cliff in an hour theyll land theyre bringing books with themold books the witches said whatre you doing in the tower at a time like this why arent you acting poe said were doing everything we can blackwood youre new to all this come along were going to mr charles dickens place to contemplate our doom our black doom said mr bierce with a wink they moved down the echoing throats of the castle level after dim green level down into mustiness and decay and spiders and dreamlike webbing dont worry said poe his brow like a huge white lamp before them descending sinking all along the dead sea tonight ive called the others your friends and mine blackwoodbierce theyre all there the animals and the old women and the tall men with the sharp white teeth the traps are waiting the pits yes and the pendulums the red death here he laughed quietly yes even the red death i never thoughtno i never thought the time would come when a thing like the red death would actually be but they asked for it and they shall have it but are we strong enough wondered blackwood how strong is strong they wont be prepared for us at least they havent the imagination those clean young rocket men with their antiseptic bloomers and fishbowl helmets with their new religion about their necks on gold chains scalpels upon their heads a diadem of microscopes in their holy fingers steaming incense urns which in reality are only germicidal ovens for steaming out superstition the names of poe bierce hawthorne blackwoodblasphemy to their clean lips outside the castle they advanced through a watery space a tarn that was not a tarn which misted before them like the stuff of nightmares the air filled with wing sounds and a whirring a motion of winds and blacknesses voices changed figures swayed at campfires mr poe watched the needles knitting knitting knitting in the firelight knitting pain and misery knitting wickedness into wax marionettes clay puppets the caldron smells of wild garlic and cayenne and saffron hissed up to fill the night with evil pungency get on with it said poe ill be back all down the empty seashore black figures spindled and waned grew up and blew into black smoke on the sky bells rang in mountain towers and licorice ravens spilled out with the bronze sounds and spun away to ashes over a lonely moor and into a small valley poe and bierce hurried and found themselves quite suddenly on a cobbled street in cold bleak biting weather with people stomping up and down stony courtyards to warm their feet foggy withal and candles flaring in the windows of offices and shops where hung the yuletide turkeys at a distance some boys all bundled up snorting their pale breaths on the wintry air were trilling god rest ye merry gentlemen while the immense tones of a great clock continuously sounded midnight children dashed by from the bakers with dinners all asteam in their grubby fists on trays and under silver bowls at a sign which read scrooge marley and dickens poe gave the marleyfaced knocker a rap and from within as the door popped open a few inches a sudden gust of music almost swept them into a dance and there beyond the shoulder of the man who was sticking a him goatee and mustaches at them was mr fezziwig clapping his hands and mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile dancing and colliding with other merrymakers while the fiddle chirped and laughter ran about a table like chandelier crystals given a sudden push of wind the large table was heaped with brawn and turkey and holly and geese with mince pies suckling pigs wreaths of sausages oranges and apples and there was bob cratchit and little dorrit and tiny tim and mr fagin himself and a man who looked as if he might be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potatowho else but mr marley chains and all while the wine poured and the brown turkeys did their excellent best to steam what do you want demanded mr charles dickens weve come to plead with you again charles we need your help said poe help do you think i would help you fight against those good men coming in the rocket i dont belong here anyway my books were burned by mistake im no supernaturalist no writer of horrors and terrors like you poe you bierce or the others ill have nothing to do with you terrible people you are a persuasive talker reasoned poe you could go to meet the rocket men lull them lull their suspicions and thenthen we would take care of them mr dickens eyed the folds of the black cape which hid poes hands from it smiling poe drew forth a black cat for one of our visitors and for the others poe smiled again well pleased the premature burial you are a grim man mr poe i am a frightened and an angry man i am a god mr dickens even as you are a god even as we all are gods and our inventionsour people if you wishhave not only been threatened but banished and burned torn up and censored ruined and done away with the worlds we created are falling into ruin even gods must fight so mr dickens tilted his head impatient to return to the party the music the food perhaps you can explain why we are here how did we come here war begets war destruction begets destruction on earth a century ago in the year they outlawed our books oh what a horrible thingto destroy our literary creations that way it summoned us out ofwhat death the beyond i dont like abstract things i dont know i only know that our worlds and our creations called us and we tried to save them and the only saving thing we could do was wait out the century here on mars hoping earth might overweight itself with these scientists and their doubtings but now theyre coming to clean us out of here us and our dark things and all the alchemists witches vampires and werethings that one by one retreated across space as science made inroads through every country on earth and finally left no alternative at all but exodus you must help us you have a good speaking manner we need you i repeat i am not of you i dont approve of you and the others cried dickens angrily i was no player with witches and vampires and midnight things what of a christmas carol ridiculous one story oh i wrote a few others about ghosts perhaps but what of that my basic works had none of that nonsense mistaken or not they grouped you with us they destroyed your booksyour worlds too you must hate them mr dickens i admit they are stupid and rude but that is all good day let mr marley come at least no the door slammed as poe turned away down the street skimming over the frosty ground the coachman playing a lively air on a bugle came a great coach out of which cherryred laughing and singing piled the pickwickians banging on the door shouting merry christmas good and loud when the door was opened by the fat boy mr poe hurried along the midnight shore of the dry sea by fires and smoke he hesitated to shout orders to check the bubbling caldrons the poisons and the chalked pentagrams good he said and ran on fine he shouted and ran again people joined him and ran with him here were mr coppard and mr machen running with him now and there were hating serpents and angry demons and fiery bronze dragons and spitting vipers and trembling witches like the barbs and nettles and thorns and all the vile flotsam and jetsam of the retreating sea of imagination left on the melancholy shore whining and frothing and spitting mr machen stopped he sat like a child on the cold sand he began to sob they tried to soothe him but he would not listen i just thought he said what happens to us on the day when the last copies of our books are destroyed the air whirled dont speak of it we must wailed mr machen now now as the rocket comes down you mr poe you coppard you bierceall of you grow faint like wood smoke blowing away your faces melt death real death for all of us we exist only through earths sufferance if a final edict tonight destroyed our last few works wed be like lights put out coppard brooded gently i wonder who i am in what earth mind tonight do i exist in some african hut some hermit reading my tales is he the lonely candle in the wind of time and science the flickering orb sustaining me here in rebellious exile is it him or some boy in a discarded attic finding me only just in time oh last night i felt ill ill ill to the marrows of me for there is a body of the soul as well as a body of the body and this soul body ached in all of its glowing parts and last night i felt myself a candle guttering when suddenly i sprang up given new light as some child sneezing with dust in some yellow garret on earth once more found a worn timespecked copy of me and so im given a short respite a door banged wide in a little hut by the shore a thin short man with flesh hanging from him in folds stepped out and paying no attention to the others sat down and stared into his clenched fists theres the one im sorry for whispered blackwood look at him dying away he was once more real than we who were men they took him a skeleton thought and clothed him in centuries of pink flesh and snow beard and red velvet suit and black boot made him reindeers tinsel holly and after centuries of manufacturing him they drowned him in a vat of lysol you might say the men were silent what must it be on earth wondered poe without christmas no hot chestnuts no tree no ornaments or drums or candlesnothing nothing but the snow and wind and the lonely factual people they all looked at the thin little old man with the scraggly beard and faded red velvet suit have you heard his story i can imagine it the glittereyed psychiatrist the clever sociologist the resentful frothmouthed educationalist the antiseptic parents a regrettable situation said fierce smiling for the yuletide merchants who toward the last there as i recall were beginning to put up holly and sing noel the day before halloween with any luck at all this year they might have started on labor day bierce did not continue he fell forward with a sigh as he lay upon the ground he had time to say only how interesting and then as they all watched horrified his body burned into blue dust and charred bone the ashes of which fled through the air in black tatters bierce berce gone his last book gone someone on earth just now burned it god rest him nothing of him left now for what are we but books and when those are gone nothings to be seen a rushing sound filled the sky they cried out terrified and looked up in the sky dazzling it with sizzling fire clouds was the rocket around the men on the seashore lanterns bobbed there was a squealing and a bubbling and an odor of cooked spells candleeyed pumpkins lifted into the cold clear air thin fingers clenched into fists and a witch screamed from her withered mouth ship ship break fall ship ship burn all crack flake shake melt mummy dust cat pelt time to go murmured blackwood on to jupiter on to saturn or pluto run away shouted poe in the wind never im a tired old man poe gazed into the old mans face and believed him he climbed atop a huge boulder and faced the ten thousand gray shadows and green lights and yellow eyes on the hissing wind the powders he shouted a thick hot smell of bitter almond civet cumin wormseed and orris the rocket came downsteadily down with the shriek of a damned spirit poe raged at it he flung his fists up and the orchestra of heat and smell and hatred answered in symphony like stripped tree fragments bats flew upward burning hearts flung like missiles burst in bloody fireworks on the singed air down down relentlessly down like a pendulum the rocket came and poe howled furiously and shrank back with every sweep and sweep of the rocket cutting and ravening the air all the dead sea seemed a pit in which trapped they waited the sinking of the dread machinery the glistening ax they were people under the avalanche the snakes screamed poe and luminous serpentines of undulant green hurtled toward the rocket but it came down a sweep a fire a motion and it lay panting out exhaustions of red plumage on the sand a mile away at it shrieked poe the plans changed only one chance run at it at it drown them with our bodies kill them and as if he had commanded a violent sea to change its course to suck itself free from primeval beds the whirls and savage gouts of fire spread and ran like wind and rain and stark lightning over the sea sands down empty river deltas shadowing and screaming whistling and whining sputtering and coalescing toward the rocket which extinguished lay like a clean metal torch in the farthest hollow as if a great charred caldron of sparkling lava had been overturned the boiling people and snapping animals churned down the dry fathoms kill them screamed poe running the rocket men leaped out of their ship guns ready they stalked about sniffing the air like hounds they saw nothing they relaxed the captain stepped forth last he gave sharp commands wood was gathered kindled and a fire leapt up in an instant the captain beckoned his men into a half circle about him a new world he said forcing himself to speak deliberately though he glanced nervously now and again over his shoulder at the empty sea the old world left behind a new start what more symbolic than that we here dedicate ourselves all the more firmly to science and progress he nodded crisply to his lieutenant the books firelight limned the faded gilt titles the willows the outsider behold the dreamer dr jekyll and mr hyde the land of oz pellucidar the land that time forgot a midsummer nights dream and the monstrous names of machen and edgar allan poe and cabell and dunsany and blackwood and lewis carroll the names the old names the evil names a new world with a gesture we burn the last of the old the captain ripped pages from the books leaf by seared leaf he fed them into the fire a scream leaping back the men stared beyond the firelight at the edges of the encroaching and uninhabited sea another scream a high and wailing thing like the death of a dragon and the thrashing of a bronzed whale left gasping when the waters of a leviathans sea drain down the shingles and evaporate it was the sound of air rushing in to fill a vacuum where a moment before there had been something the captain neatly disposed of the last book by putting it into the fire the air stopped quivering silence the rocket men leaned and listened captain did you hear it no like a wave sir on the sea bottom i thought i saw something over there a black wave big running at us you were mistaken there sir what see it there the city way over that green city near the lake its splitting in half its falling the men squinted and shuffled forward smith stood trembling among them he put his hand to his head as if to find a thought there i remember yes now i do a long time back when i was a child a book i read a story oz i think it was yes oz the emerald city of oz oz never heard of it yes oz thats what it was i saw it just now like in the story i saw it fall smith yes sir report for psychoanalysis tomorrow yes sir a brisk salute be careful the men tiptoed guns alert beyond the ships aseptic light to gaze at the long sea and the low hills why whispered smith disappointed theres no one here at all is there no one here at all the wind blew sand over his shoes whining no particular night or morning he had smoked a packet of cigarettes in two hours how far out in space are we a billion miles a billion miles from where said hitchcock it all depends said clemens not smoking at all a billion miles from home you might say then say it home earth new york chicago wherever you were from i dont even remember said hitchcock i dont even believe there is an earth now do you yes said clemens i dreamt about it this morning there is no morning in space during the night then its always night said hitchcock quietly which night do you mean shut up said clemens irritably let me finish hitchcock lit another cigarette his hand did not shake but it looked as if inside the sunburned flesh it might be tremoring all to itself a small tremor in each hand and a large invisible tremor in his body the two men sat on the observation corridor floor looking out at the stars clemenss eyes flashed but hitchcocks eyes focused on nothing they were blank and puzzled i woke up at hours myself said hitchcock as if he were talking to his right hand and i heard myself screaming where am i where am i and the answer was nowhere and i said whereve i been and i said earth whats earth i wondered where i was born i said but it was nothing and worse than nothing i dont believe in anything i cant see or hear or touch i cant see earth so why should i believe in it its safer this way not to believe theres earth clemens pointed smiling that point of light there thats not earth thats our sun you cant see earth from here i can see it i have a good memory its not the same you fool said hitchcock suddenly there was a touch of anger in his voice i mean see it ive always been that way when im in boston new york is dead when im in new york boston is dead when i dont see a man for a day hes dead when he comes walking down the street my god its a resurrection i do a dance almost im so glad to see him i used to anyway i dont dance any more i just look and when the man walks off hes dead again clemens laughed its simply that your mind works on a primitive level you cant hold to things youve got no imagination hitchcock old man youve got to learn to hold on why should i hold onto things i cant use said hitchcock his eyes wide still staring into space im practical if earth isnt here for me to walk on you want me to walk on a memory that hurts memories as my father once said are porcupines to hell with them stay away from them they make you unhappy they ruin your work they make you cry im walking on earth right now said clemens squinting to himself blowing smoke youre kicking porcupines later in the day you wont be able to eat lunch and youll wonder why said hitchcock in a dead voice and itll be because youve got a footful of quills aching in you to hell with it if i cant drink it pinch it punch it or lie on it then i say drop it in the sun im dead to earth its dead to me theres no one in new york weeping for me tonight shove new york there isnt any season here winter and summer are gone so is spring and autumn it isnt any particular night or morning its space and space the only thing right now is you and me and this rocket ship and the only thing im positive of is me thats all of it clemens ignored this im putting a nickel in the phone slot right now he said pantomiming it with a slow smile and calling my girl in evanston hello barbara the rocket sailed on through space the lunch bell rang at hours the men ran by on soft rubber sneakers and sat at the cushioned tables clemens wasnt hungry see what did i tell you said hitchcock you and your damned porcupines leave them alone like i told you look at me shoveling away food he said this with a mechanical slow and unhumorous voice watch me he put a big piece of pie in his mouth and felt it with his tongue he looked at the pie on his plate as if to see the texture he moved it with his fork he felt the fork handle he mashed the lemon filling and watched it jet up between the tines then he touched a bottle of milk all over and poured out half a quart into a glass listening to it he looked at the milk as if to make it whiter he drank the milk so swiftly that he couldnt have tasted it he had eaten his entire lunch in a few minutes cramming it in feverishly and now he looked around for more but it was gone he gazed out the window of the rocket blankly those arent real either he said what asked clemens the stars whos ever touched one i can see them sure but whats the use of seeing a thing thats a million or a billion miles away anything that far off isnt worth bothering with why did you come on this trip asked clemens suddenly hitchcock peered into his amazingly empty milk glass and clenched it tight then relaxed his hand and clenched it again i dont know he ran his tongue on the glass rim i just had to is all how do you know why you do anything in this life you liked the idea of space travel going places i dont know yes no it wasnt going places it was being between hitchcock for the first time tried to focus his eyes upon something but it was so nebulous and far off that his eyes couldnt make the adjustment though he worked his face and hands mostly it was space so much space i liked the idea of nothing on top nothing on the bottom and a lot of nothing in between and me in the middle of the nothing i never heard it put that way before i just put it that way i hope you listened hitchcock took out his cigarettes and lit up and began to suck and blow the smoke again and again clemens said what sort of childhood did you have hitchcock i was never young whoever i was then is dead thats more of your quills i dont want a hide full thanks ive always figured it that you die each day and each day is a box you see all numbered and neat but never go back and lift the lids because youve died a couple of thousand times in your life and thats a lot of corpses each dead a different way each with a worse expression each of those days is a different you somebody you dont know or understand or want to understand youre cutting yourself off that way why should i have anything to do with that younger hitchcock he was a fool and he was yanked around and taken advantage of and used his father was no good and he was glad when his mother died because she was the same should i go back and see his face on that day and gloat over it he was a fool were all fools said clemens all the time its just were a different kind each day we think im not a fool today ive learned my lesson i was a fool yesterday but not this morning then tomorrow we find out that yes we were a fool today too i think the only way we can grow and get on in this world is to accept the fact were not perfect and live accordingly i dont want to remember imperfect things said hitchcock i cant shake hands with that younger hitchcock can i where he can you find him for me hes dead so to hell with him i wont shape what i do tomorrow by some lousy thing i did yesterday youve got it wrong let me have it then hitchcock sat finished with his meal looking out the port the other men glanced at him do meteors exist asked hitchcock you know damn well they do in our radar machinesyes as streaks of light in space no i dont believe in anything that doesnt exist and act in my presence sometimeshe nodded at the men finishing their foodsometimes i dont believe in anyone or anything but me he sat up is there an upstairs to this ship yes ive got to see it immediately dont get excited you wait here ill be right back hitchcock walked out swiftly the other men sat nibbling their food slowly a moment passed one of the men raised his head how longs this been going on i mean hitchcock just today he acted funny the other day too yes but its worse today has anyone told the psychiatrist we thought hed come out of it everyone has a little touch of space the first time out ive had it you get wildly philosophical then frightened you break into a sweat then you doubt your parentage you dont believe in earth you get drunk wake up with a hangover and thats it but hitchcock dont get drunk said someone i wish he would howd he ever get past the examining board howd we all get past they need men space scares the hell out of most people so the board lets a lot of borderlines through that man isnt a borderline said someone hes a falloffacliffandnobottomtohit they waited for five minutes hitchcock didnt come back clemens finally got up and went out and climbed the circular stair to the flight deck above hitchcock was there touching the wall tenderly its here he said of course it is i was afraid it might not be hitchcock peered at clemens and youre alive i have been for a long time no said hitchcock now just now this instant while youre here with me youre alive a moment ago you werent anything i was to me said the other thats not important you werent here with me said hitchcock only thats important is the crew down below yes can you prove it look hitchcock youd better see dr edwards i think you need a little servicing no im all right whos the doctor anyway can you prove hes on this ship i can all i have to do is call him no i mean standing here in this instant you cant prove hes here can you not without moving i cant you see you have no mental evidence thats what i want a mental evidence i can feel i dont want physical evidence proof you have to go out and drag in i want evidence that you can carry in your mind and always touch and smell and feel but theres no way to do that in order to believe in a thing youve got to carry it with you you cant carry the earth or a man in your pocket i want a way to do that carry things with me always so i can believe in them how clumsy to have to go to all the trouble of going out and bringing in something terribly physical to prove something i hate physical things because they can be left behind and become impossible to believe in then those are the rules of the game i want to change them wouldnt it be fine if we could prove things with our mind and know for certain that things are always in their place id like to know what a place is like when im not there id like to be sure thats not possible you know said hitchcock i first got the idea of coming out into space about five years ago about the time i lost my job did you know i wanted to be a writer oh yes one of those men who always talk about writing but rarely write and too much temper so i lost my good job and left the editorial business and couldnt get another job and went on down hill then my wife died you see nothing stays where you put ityou cant trust material things i had to put my boy in an aunts trust and things got worse then one day i had a story published with my name on it but it wasnt me i dont get you hitchcocks face was pale and sweating i can only say that i looked at the page with my name under the title by joseph hitchcock but it was some other man there was no way to proveactually prove really provethat that man was me the story was familiari knew i had written itbut that name on the paper still was not me it was a symbol a name it was alien and then i realized that even if i did become successful at writing it would never mean a thing to me because i couldnt identify myself with that name it would be soot and ashes so i didnt write any more i was never sure anyway that the stories i had in my desk a few days later were mine though i remembered typing them there was always that gap of proof that gap between doing and having done what is done is dead and is not proof for it is not an action only actions are important and pieces of paper were remains of actions done and over and now unseen the proof of doing was over and done nothing but memory remained and i didnt trust my memory could i actually prove id written these stories no can any author i mean proof i mean action as proof no not really not unless someone sits in the room while you type and then maybe youre doing it from memory and once a thing is accomplished there is no proof only memory so then i began to find gaps between everything i doubted i was married or had a child or ever had a job in my life i doubted that i had been born in illinois and had a drunken father and swinish mother i couldnt prove anything oh yes people could say you are thus and so and such and such but that was nothing you should get your mind off stuff like that said clemens i cant all the gaps and spaces and thats how i got to thinking about the stars i thought how id like to be in a rocket ship in space in nothing in nothing going on into nothing with just a thin something a thin eggshell of metal holding me going on away from all the somethings with gaps in them that couldnt prove themselves i knew then that the only happiness for me was space when i get to aldebaran ii ill sign up to return on the fiveyear journey to earth and so go back and forth like a shuttlecock all the rest of my life have you talked about this to the psychiatrist so he could try to mortar up the gaps for me fill in the gulfs with noise and warm water and words and hands touching me and all that no thanks hitchcock stopped im getting worse arent i i thought so this morning when i woke up i thought im getting worse or is it better he paused again and cocked an eye at clemens are you there are you really there go on prove it clemens slapped him on the arm hard yes said hitchcock rubbing his arm looking at it very thoroughly wonderingly massaging it you were there for a brief fraction of an instant but i wonder if you arenow see you later said clemens he was on his way to find the doctor he walked away a bell rang two bells three bells rang the ship rocked as if a hand had slapped it there was a sucking sound the sound of a vacuum cleaner turned on clemens heard the screams and felt the air thin the air hissed away about his ears suddenly there was nothing in his nose or lungs he stumbled and then the hissing stopped he heard someone cry a meteor another said its patched and this was true the ships emergency spider running over the outside of the hull had slapped a hot patch on the hole in the metal and welded it tight someone was talking and talking and then beginning to shout at a distance clemens ran along the corridor through the freshening thickening air as he turned in at a bulkhead he saw the hole in the steel wall freshly sealed he saw the meteor fragments lying about the room like bits of a toy he saw the captain and the members of the crew and a man lying on the floor it was hitchcock his eyes were closed and he was crying it tried to kill me he said over and over it tried to kill me they got him on his feet it cant do that said hitchcock thats not how it should be things like that cant happen can they it came in after me why did it do that all right all right hitchcock said the captain the doctor was bandaging a small cut on hitchcocks arm hitchcock looked up his face pale and saw clemens there looking at him it tried to kill me he said i know said clemens seventeen hours passed the ship moved on in space clemens stepped through a bulkhead and waited the psychiatrist and the captain were there hitchcock sat on the floor with his legs drawn up to his chest arms wrapped tight about them hitchcock said the captain no answer hitchcock listen to me said the psychiatrist they turned to clemens youre his friend yes do you want to help us if i can it was that damned meteor said the captain this might not have happened if it hadnt been for that it wouldve come anyway sooner or later said the doctor to clemens you might talk to him clemens walked quietly over and crouched by hitchcock and began to shake his arm gently calling in a low voice hey there hitchcock no reply hey its me me clemens said clemens look im here he gave the arm a little slap he massaged the rigid neck gently and the back of the bentdown head he glanced at the psychiatrist who sighed very softly the captain shrugged shock treatment doctor the psychiatrist nodded well start within the hour yes thought clemens shock treatment play a dozen jazz records for him wave a bottle of fresh green chlorophyll and dandelions under his nose put grass under his feet squirt chanel on the air cut his hair clip his fingernails bring him a woman shout bang and crash at him fry him with electricity fill the gap and the gulf but wheres your proof you cant keep proving to him forever you cant entertain a baby with rattles and sirens all night every night for the next thirty years sometime youve got to stop when you do that hes lost again that is if he pays any attention to you at all hitchcock he cried as loud as he could almost frantically as if he himself were falling over a cliff its me its your pal hey clemens turned and walked away out of the silent room twelve hours later another alarm bell rang after all of the running had died down the captain explained hitchcock snapped out of it for a minute or so he was alone he climbed into a space suit he opened an airlock then he walked out into spacealone clemens blinked through the immense glass port where there was a blur of stars and distant blackness hes out there now yes a million miles behind us wed never find him first time i knew he was outside the ship was when his helmet radio came in on our controlroom beam i heard him talking to himself what did he say something like no more space ship now never was any no people no people in all the universe never were any no planets no stars thats what he said and then he said something about his hands and feet and legs no hands he said i havent any hands any more never had any no feet never had any cant prove it no body never had any no lips no face no head nothing only space only space only the gap the men turned quietly to look from the glass port out into the remote and cold stars space thought clemens the space that hitchcock loved so well space with nothing on top nothing on the bottom a lot of empty nothings between and hitchcock falling in the middle of the nothing on his way to no particular night and no particular morning the fox and the forest there were fireworks the very first night things that you should be afraid of perhaps for they might remind you of other more horrible things but these were beautiful rockets that ascended into the ancient soft air of mexico and shook the stars apart in blue and white fragments everything was good and sweet the air was that blend of the dead and the living of the rains and the dusts of the incense from the church and the brass smell of the tubas on the bandstand which pulsed out vast rhythms of la paloma the church doors were thrown wide and it seemed as if a giant yellow constellation had fallen from the october sky and lay breathing fire upon the church walls a million candles sent their color and fumes about newer and better fireworks scurried like tightrope walking comets across the coolfiled square banged against adobe cafй walls then rushed on hot wires to bash the high church tower in which boys naked feet alone could be seen kicking and rekicking clanging and tilting and retilting the monster bells into monstrous music a flaming bull blundered about the plaza chasing laughing men and screaming children the year is said william travis standing by his wife on the edge of the yelling crowd smiling a good year the bull rushed upon them ducking the couple ran with fire balls pelting them past the music and riot the church the band under the stars clutching each other laughing the bull passed carried lightly on the shoulders of a charging mexican a framework of bamboo and sulphurous gunpowder ive never enjoyed myself so much in my life susan travis had stopped for her breath its amazing said william it will go on wont it all night no i mean our trip he frowned and patted his breast pocket ive enough travelers checks for a lifetime enjoy yourself forget it theyll never find us never never now someone was setting off giant crackers hurling them from the great belltolling tower of the church in a sputter of smoke while the crowd below fell back under the threat and the crackers exploded in wonderful concussions among their dancing feet and flailing bodies a wondrous smell of frying tortillas hung all about and in the cafйs men sat at tables looking out mugs of beer in their brown hands the bull was dead the fire was out of the bamboo tubes and he was expended the laborer lifted the framework from his shoulders little boys clustered to touch the magnificent papiermвchй head the real horns lets examine the bull said william as they walked past the cafй entrance susan saw the man looking out at them a white man in a saltwhite suit with a blue tie and blue shirt and a thin sunburned face his hair was blond and straight and his eyes were blue and he watched them as they walked she would never have noticed him if it had not been for the bottles at his immaculate elbow a fat bottle of crиme de menthe a clear bottle of vermouth a flagon of cognac and seven other bottles of assorted liqueurs and at his finger tips ten small halffilled glasses from which without taking his eyes off the street he sipped occasionally squinting pressing his thin mouth shut upon the savor in his free hand a thin havana cigar smoked and on a chair stood twenty cartons of turkish cigarettes six boxes of cigars and some packaged colognes bill whispered susan take it easy he said hes nobody i saw him in the plaza this morning dont look back keep walking examine the papiermвchй bull here thats it ask questions do you think hes from the searchers they couldnt follow us they might what a nice bull said william to the man who owned it he couldnt have followed us back through two hundred years could he watch yourself for gods sake said william she swayed he crushed her elbow tightly steering her away dont faint he smiled to make it look good youll be all right lets go right in that cafй drink in front of him so if he is what we think he is he wont suspect no i couldnt weve got to come on now and so i said to david thats ridiculous this last in a loud voice as they went up the cafй steps we are here thought susan who are we where are we going what do we fear start at the beginning she told herself holding to her sanity as she felt the adobe floor underfoot my name is ann kristen my husbands name is roger we were born in the year ad and we lived in a world that was evil a world that was like a great black ship pulling away from the shore of sanity and civilization roaring its black horn in the night taking two billion people with it whether they wanted to go or not to death to fall over the edge of the earth and the sea into radioactive flame and madness they walked into the cafй the man was staring at them a phone rang the phone startled susan she remembered a phone ringing two hundred years in the future on that blue april morning in and herself answering it ann this is rene have you heard i mean about travel in time incorporated trips to rome in bc trips to napoleons waterlooany time any place rene youre joking no clinton smith left this morning for philadelphia in travel in time inc arranges everything costs money but thinkto actually see the burning of rome kubla khan moses and the red sea youve probably got an ad in your tube mail now she had opened the suction mail tube and there was the metal foil advertisement rome and the borgias the wright brothers at kitty hawk travel in time inc can costume you put you in a crowd during the assassination of lincoln or caesar we guarantee to teach you any language you need to move freely in any civilization in any year without friction latin greek ancient american colloquial take your vacation in time as well as place renes voice was buzzing on the phone tom and i leave for tomorrow theyre arranging for tom to sail with columbus isnt it amazing yes murmured ann stunned what does the government say about this time machine company oh the police have an eye on it afraid people might evade the draft run off and hide in the past everyone has to leave a security bond behind his house and belongings to guarantee return after all the wars on yes the war murmured ann the war standing there holding the phone she had thought here is the chance my husband and i have talked and prayed over for so many years we dont like this world of we want to run away from his work at the bomb factory i from my position with diseaseculture units perhaps there is a chance for us to escape to run for centuries into a wild country of years where they will never find and bring us back to burn our books censor our thoughts scald our minds with fear march us scream at us with radios they were in mexico in the year she looked at the stained cafй wall good workers for the future state were allowed vacations into the past to escape fatigue and so she and her husband had moved back into a room in new york city and enjoyed the theaters and the statue of liberty which still stood green in the harbor and on the third day they had changed their clothes their names and had flown off to hide in mexico it must be him whispered susan looking at the stranger seated at the table those cigarettes the cigars the liquor they give him away remember our first night in the past a month ago their first night in new york before their flight drinking all the strange drinks savoring and buying odd foods perfumes cigarettes of ten dozen rare brands for they were rare in the future where war was everything so they had made fools of themselves rushing in and out of stores salons tobacconists going up to their room to get wonderfully ill and now here was this stranger doing likewise doing a thing that only a man from the future would do who had been starved for liquors and cigarettes for many years susan and william sat and ordered a drink the stranger was examining their clothes their hair their jewelrythe way they walked and sat sit easily said william under his breath look as if youve worn this clothing style all your life we should never have tried to escape my god said william hes coming over let me do the talking the stranger bowed before them there was the faintest tap of heels knocking together susan stiffened that military soundunmistakable as that certain ugly rap on your door at midnight mr roger kristen said the stranger you did not pull up your pant legs when you sat down william froze he looked at his hands lying on either leg innocently susans heart was beating swiftly youve got the wrong person said william quickly my names not krisler kristen corrected the stranger im william travis said william and i dont see what my pant legs have to do with you sorry the stranger pulled up a chair let us say i thought i knew you because you did not pull your trousers up everyone does if they dont the trousers bag quickly i am a long way from home mrtravis and in need of company my name is simms mr simms we appreciate your loneliness but were tired were leaving for acapulco tomorrow a charming spot i was just there looking for some friends of mine they are somewhere i shall find them yet oh is the lady a bit sick good night mr simms they started out the door william holding susans arm firmly they did not look back when mr simms called oh just one other thing he paused and then slowly spoke the words ad susan shut her eyes and felt the earth falter under her she kept going into the fiery plaza seeing nothing they locked the door of their hotel room and then she was crying and they were standing in the dark and the room tilted under them far away firecrackers exploded and there was laughter in the plaza what a damned loud nerve said william him sitting there looking us up and down like animals smoking his damn cigarettes drinking his drinks i should have killed him then his voice was nearly hysterical he even had the nerve to use his real name to us the chief of the searchers and the thing about my pant legs my god i should have pulled them up when i sat its an automatic gesture of this day and age when i didnt do it it set me off from the others it made him think heres a man who never wore pants a man used to breech uniforms and future styles i could kill myself for giving us away no no it was my walkthese high heelsthat did it our haircutsso new so fresh everything about us odd and uneasy he turned on the light hes still testing us hes not positive of usnot completely we cant run out on him then we cant make him certain well go to acapulco leisurely maybe he is sure of us but is just playing i wouldnt put it past him hes got all the time in the world he can daily here if he wants and bring us back to the future sixty seconds after we left it he might keep us wondering for days laughing at us susan sat on the bed wiping the tears from her face smelling the old smell of charcoal and incense they wont make a scene will they they wont dare theyll have to get us alone to put us in that time machine and send us back theres a solution then she said well never be alone well always be in crowds well make a million friends visit markets sleep in the official palaces in each town pay the chief of police to guard us until we find a way to kill simms and escape disguise ourselves in new clothes perhaps as mexicans footsteps sounded outside their locked door they turned out the light and undressed in silence the footsteps went away a door closed susan stood by the window looking down at the plaza in the darkness so that building there is a church yes ive often wondered what a church looked like its been so long since anyone saw one can we visit it tomorrow of course come to bed they lay in the dark room half an hour later their phone rang she lifted the receiver hello the rabbits may hide in the forest said a voice but a fox can always find them she replaced the receiver and lay back straight and cold in the bed outside in the year a man played three tunes upon a guitar one following another during the night she put her hand out and almost touched the year she felt her fingers slide over cool spaces of time as over a corrugated surface and she heard the insistent thump of marching feet a million bands playing a million military tunes and she saw the fifty thousand rows of disease cultures in their aseptic glass tubes her hand reaching out to them at her work in that huge factory in the future the tubes of leprosy bubonic typhoid tuberculosis and then the great explosion she saw her hand burned to a wrinkled plum felt it recoil from a concussion so immense that the world was lifted and let fall and all the buildings broke and people hemorrhaged and lay silent great volcanoes machines winds avalanches slid down to silence and she awoke sobbing in the bed in mexico many years away in the early morning drugged with the single hours sleep they had finally been able to obtain they awoke to the sound of loud automobiles in the street susan peered down from the iron balcony at a small crowd of eight people only now emerging chattering yelling from trucks and cars with red lettering on them a crowd of mexicans had followed the trucks quй pasa susan called to a little boy the boy replied susan turned back to her husband an american motionpicture company here on location sounds interesting william was in the shower lets watch them i dont think wed better leave today well try to lull simms watch the films being made they say the primitive film making was something get our minds off ourselves ourselves thought susan for a moment in the bright sun she had forgotten that somewhere in the hotel waiting was a man smoking a thousand cigarettes it seemed she saw the eight loud happy americans below and wanted to call to them save me hide me help me color my hair my eyes clothe me in strange clothes i need your help im from the year but the words stayed in her throat the functionaries of travel in time inc were not foolish in your brain before you left on your trip they placed a psychological bloc you could tell no one your true time or birthplace nor could you reveal any of the future to those in the past the past and the future must be protected from each other only with this psychological bloc were people allowed to travel unguarded through the ages the future must be protected from any change brought about by her people traveling in the past even if she wanted to with all her heart she could not tell any of those happy people below in the plaza who she was or what her predicament had become what about breakfast said william breakfast was being served in the immense dining room ham and eggs for everyone the place was full of tourists the film people entered all eight of themsix men and two women giggling shoving chairs about and susan sat near them feeling the warmth and protection they offered even when mr simms came down the lobby stairs smoking his turkish cigarette with great intensity he nodded at them from a distance and susan nodded back smiling because he couldnt do anything to them here in front of eight film people and twenty other tourists those actors said william perhaps i could hire two of them say it was a joke dress them in our clothes have them drive off in our car when simms is in such a spot where he cant see their faces if two people pretending to be us could lure him off for a few hours we might make it to mexico city itd take him years to find us there hey a fat man with liquor on his breath leaned on their table american tourists he cried im so sick of seeing mexicans i could kiss you he shook their hands come on eat with us misery loves company im misery this is miss gloom and mr and mrs dowehatemexico we all hate it but were here for some preliminary shots for a damn film the rest of the crew arrives tomorrow my names joe melton im a director and if this aint a hell of a country funerals in the streets people dying come on move over join the party cheer us up susan and william were both laughing am i funny mr melton asked the immediate world wonderful susan moved over mr simms was glaring across the dining room at them she made a face at him mr simms advanced among the tables mr and mrs travis he called i thought we were breakfasting together alone sorry said william sit down pal said mr melton any friend of theirs is a pal of mine mr simms sat the film people talked loudly and while they talked mr simms said quietly i hope you slept well did you im not used to spring mattresses replied mr simms wryly but there are compensations i stayed up half the night trying new cigarettes and foods odd fascinating a whole new spectrum of sensation these ancient vices we dont know what youre talking about said susan always the play acting simms laughed its no use nor is this stratagem of crowds ill get you alone soon enough im immensely patient say mr melton broke in his face flushed is this guy giving you any trouble its all right say the word and ill give him the bums rush melton turned back to yell at his associates in the laughter mr simms went on let us come to the point it took me a month of tracing you through towns and cities to find you and all of yesterday to be sure of you if you come with me quietly i might be able to get you off with no punishment if you agree to go back to work on the hydrogenplus bomb science this guy talks at breakfast observed mr melton half listening simms went on imperturbably think it over you cant escape if you kill me others will follow you we dont know what youre talking about stop it cried simms irritably use your intelligence you know we cant let you get away with this escape other people in the year might get the same idea and do what youve done we need people to fight your wars said william at last bill its all right susan well talk on his terms now we cant escape excellent said simms really youve both been incredibly romantic running away from your responsibilities running away from horror nonsense only a war what are you guys talking about asked mr melton susan wanted to tell him but you could only speak in generalities the psychological bloc in your mind allowed that generalities such as simms and william were now discussing only the war said william half the world dead of leprosy bombs nevertheless simms pointed out the inhabitants of the future resent you two hiding on a tropical isle as it were while they drop off the cliff into hell death loves death not life dying people love to know that others die with them it is a comfort to learn you are not alone in the kiln in the grave i am the guardian of their collective resentment against you two look at the guardian of resentments said mr melton to his companions the longer you keep me waiting the harder it will go for you we need you on the bomb project mr travis return nowno torture later well force you to work and after youve finished the bomb well try a number of complicated new devices on you sir ive a proposition said william ill come back with you if my wife stays here alive safe away from that war mr simms considered it all right meet me in the plaza in ten minutes pick me up in your car drive me to a deserted country spot ill have the travel machine pick us up there bill susan held his arm tightly dont argue he looked over at her its settled to simms one thing last night you could have gotten in our room and kidnaped us why didnt you shall we say that i was enjoying myself replied mr simms languidly sucking his new cigar i hate giving up this wonderful atmosphere this sun this vacation i regret leaving behind the wine and the cigarettes oh how i regret it the plaza then in ten minutes your wife will be protected and may stay here as long as she wishes say your goodbys mr simms arose and walked out there goes mr big talk yelled mr melton at the departing gentleman he turned and looked at susan hey someones crying breakfasts no time for people to cry now is it at ninefifteen susan stood on the balcony of their room gazing down at the plaza mr simms was seated there his neat legs crossed on a delicate bronze bench biting the tip from a cigar he lit it tenderly susan heard the throb of a motor and far up the street out of a garage and down the cobbled hill slowly came william in his car the car picked up speed thirty now forty now fifty miles an hour chickens scattered before it mr simms took off his white panama hat and mopped his pink forehead put his hat back on and then saw the car it was rushing sixty miles an hour straight on for the plaza william screamed susan the car hit the low plaza curb thundering it jumped up sped across the tiles toward the green bench where mr simms now dropped his cigar shrieked flailed his hands and was hit by the car his body flew up and up in the air and down and down crazily into the street on the far side of the plaza one front wheel broken the car stopped people were running susan went in and closed the balcony doors they came down the official palace steps together arm in arm their faces pale at twelve noon adiуs seсor said the mayor behind them seсora they stood in the plaza where the crowd was pointing at the blood will they want to see you again asked susan no we went over and over it it was an accident i lost control of the car i wept for them god knows i had to get my relief out somewhere i felt like weeping i hated to kill him ive never wanted to do anything like that in my life they wont prosecute you they talked about it but no i talked faster they believe me it was an accident its over where will we go mexico city uruapan the cars in the repair shop itll be ready at four this afternoon then well get the hell out will we be followed was simms working alone i dont know well have a little head start on them i think the film people were coming out of the hotel as they approached mr melton hurried up scowling hey i heard what happened too bad everything okay now want to get your minds off it were doing some preliminary shots up the street you want to watch youre welcome come on do you good they went they stood on the cobbled street while the film camera was being set up susan looked at the road leading down and away and the highway going to acapulco and the sea past pyramids and ruins and little adobe towns with yellow walls blue walls purple walls and flaming bougainvillea and she thought we shall take the roads travel in clusters and crowds in markets in lobbies bribe police to sleep near keep double locks but always the crowds never alone again always afraid the next person who passes may be another simms never knowing if weve tricked and lost the searchers and always up ahead in the future theyll wait for us to be brought back waiting with their bombs to burn us and disease to rot us and their police to tell us to roll over turn around jump through the hoop and so well keep running through the forest and well never ever stop or sleep well again in our lives a crowd gathered to watch the film being made and susan watched the crowd and the streets seen anyone suspicious no what time is it three oclock the car should be almost ready the test film was finished at three fortyfive they all walked down to the hotel talking william paused at the garage the carll be ready at six he said coming out worried but no later than that itll be ready dont worry in the hotel lobby they looked around for other men traveling alone men who resembled mr simms men with new haircuts and too much cigarette smoke and cologne smell about them but the lobby was empty going up the stairs mr melton said well its been a long hard day whod like to put a header on it you folks martini beer maybe one the whole crowd pushed into mr meltons room and the drinking began watch the time said william time thought susan if only they had time all she wanted was to sit in the plaza all of a long bright day in october with not a worry or a thought with the sun on her face and arms her eyes closed smiling at the warmth and never move just sleep in the mexican sun and sleep warmly and easily and slowly and happily for many many days mr melton opened the champagne to a very beautiful lady lovely enough for films be said toasting susan i might even give you a test she laughed i mean it said melton youre very nice i could make you a movie star and take me to hollywood cried susan get the hell out of mexico sure susan glanced at william and he lifted an eyebrow and nodded it would be a change of scene clothing locale name perhaps and they would be traveling with eight other people a good shield against any interference from the future it sounds wonderful said susan she was feeling the champagne now the afternoon was slipping by the party was whirling about her she felt safe and good and alive and truly happy for the first time in many years what kind of film would my wife be good for asked william refilling his glass melton appraised susan the party stopped laughing and listened well id like to do a story of suspense said melton a story of a man and wife like yourselves go on sort of a war story maybe said the director examining the color of his drink against the sunlight susan and william waited a story about a man and wife who live in a little house on a little street in the year maybe said melton this is ad lib understand but this man and wife are faced with a terrible war superplus hydrogen bombs censorship death in that year andheres the gimmickthey escape into the past followed by a man who they think is evil but who is only trying to show them what their duty is william dropped his glass to the floor mr melton continued and this couple take refuge with a group of film people whom they learn to trust safety in numbers they say to themselves susan felt herself slip down into a chair everyone was watching the director he took a little sip of wine ah thats a fine wine well this man and woman it seems dont realize how important they are to the future the man especially is the keystone to a new bomb metal so the searchers lets call them spare no trouble or expense to find capture and take home the man and wife once they get them totally alone in a hotel room where no one can see strategy the searchers work alone or in groups of eight one trick or another will do it dont you think it would make a wonderful film susan dont you bill he finished his drink susan sat with her eyes straight ahead of her have a drink said mr melton williams gun was out and fired three times and one of the men fell and the others ran forward susan screamed a hand was clamped to her mouth now the gun was on the floor and william was struggling held mr melton said please standing there where he had stood blood showing on his fingers lets not make matters worse someone pounded on the hall door let me in the manager said mr melton dryly he jerked his head everyone lets move let me in ill call the police susan and william looked at each other quickly and then at the door the manager wishes to come in said mr melton quick a camera was carried forward from it shot a blue light which encompassed the room instantly it widened out and the people of the party vanished one by one quickly outside the window in the instant before she vanished susan saw the green land and the purple and yellow and blue and crimson walls and the cobbles flowing down like a river a man upon a burro riding into the warm hills a boy drinking orange crush she could feel the sweet liquid in her throat a man standing under a cool plaza tree with a guitar she could feel her hand upon the strings and far away the sea the blue and tender sea she could feel it roll her over and take her in and then she was gone her husband was gone the door burst wide open the manager and his staff rushed in the room was empty but they were just here i saw them come in and nowgone cried the manager the windows are covered with iron grating they couldnt get out that way in the late afternoon the priest was summoned and they opened the room again and aired it out and had him sprinkle holy water through each corner and give it his blessing what shall we do with these asked the charwoman she pointed to the closet where there were bottles of chartreuse cognac crиme de cacao absinthe vermouth tequila cartons of turkish cigarettes and yellow boxes of fiftycent pure havanafiller cigars the visitor saul williams awoke to the still morning he looked wearily out of his tent and thought about how far away earth was millions of miles he thought but then what could you do about it your lungs were full of the blood rust you coughed all the time saul arose this particular morning at seven oclock he was a tall man lean thinned by his illness it was a quiet morning on mars with the dead sea bottomflat and silentno wind on it the sun was clear and cool in the empty sky he washed his face and ate breakfast after that he wanted very much to be back on earth during the day he tried every way that it was possible to be in new york city sometimes if he sat right and held his hands a certain way he did it he could almost smell new york most of the time though it was impossible later in the morning saul tried to die he lay on the sand and told his heart to stop it continued beating he imagined himself leaping from a cliff or cutting his wrists but laughed to himselfhe knew he lacked the nerve for either act maybe if i squeeze tight and think about it enough ill just sleep and never wake he thought he tried it an hour later he awoke with a mouth full of blood he got up and spat it out and felt very sorry for himself this blood rustit filled your mouth and your nose it ran from your ears your fingernails and it took a year to kill you the only cure was shoving you in a rocket and shooting you out to exile on mars there was no known cure on earth and remaining there would contaminate and kill others so here he was bleeding all the time and lonely sauls eyes narrowed in the distance by an ancient city ruin he saw another man lying on a filthy blanket when saul walked up the man on the blanket stirred weakly hello saul he said another morning said saul christ im lonely it is an affliction of the rusted ones said the man on the blanket not moving very pale and as if he might vanish if you touched him i wish to god said saul looking down at the man that you could at least talk why is it that intellectuals never get the blood rust and come up here it is a conspiracy against you saul said the man shutting his eyes too weary to keep them open once i had the strength to be an intellectual now it is a job to think if only we could talk said saul williams the other man merely shrugged indifferently come tomorrow perhaps ill have enough strength to talk about aristotle then ill try really i will the man sank down under the worn tree he opened one eye remember once we did talk on aristotle six months ago on that good day i had i remember said saul not listening he looked at the dead sea i wish i were as sick as you then maybe i wouldnt worry about being an intellectual then maybe id get some peace youll get just as bad as i am now in about six months said the dying man then you wont care about anything but sleep and more sleep sleep will be like a woman to you youll always go back to her because shes fresh and good and faithful and she always treats you kindly and the same you only wake up so you can think about going hack to sleep its a nice thought the mans voice was a bare whisper now it stopped and a light breathing took over saul walked off along the shores of the dead sea like so many emptied bottles flung up by some longgone wave were the huddled bodies of sleeping men saul could see them all down the curve of the empty sea one two threeall of them sleeping alone most of them worse off than he each with his little cache of food each grown into himself because social converse was weakening and sleep was good at first there had been a few nights around mutual campfires and they had all talked about earth that was the only thing they talked about earth and the way the waters ran in town creeks and what homemade strawberry pie tasted like and how new york looked in the early morning coming over on the jersey ferry in the salt wind i want earth thought saul i want it so bad it hurts i want something i can never have again and they all want it and it hurts them not to have it more than food or a woman or anything i just want earth this sickness puts women away forever theyre not things to be wanted but earth yes thats a thing for the mind and not the weak body the bright metal flashed on the sky saul looked up the bright metal flashed again a minute later the rocket landed on the sea bottom a valve opened a man stepped out carrying his luggage with him two other men in protective germicide suits accompanied him bringing out vast cases of food setting up a tent for him another minute and the rocket returned to the sky the exile stood alone saul began to run he hadnt run in weeks and it was very tiring but he ran and yelled hello hello the young man looked saul up and down when he arrived hello so this is mars my names leonard mark im saul williams they shook hands leonard mark was very youngonly eighteen very blond pinkfaced blueeyed and fresh in spite of his illness how are things in new york said saul like this said leonard mark and he looked at saul new york grew up out of the desert made of stone and filled with march winds neons exploded in electric color yellow taxis glided in a still night bridges rose and tugs chanted in the midnight harbors curtains rose on spangled musicals saul put his hands to his head violently hold on hold on he cried whats happening to me whats wrong with me im going crazy leaves sprouted from trees in central park green and new on the pathway saul strolled along smelling the air stop it stop it you fool saul shouted at himself he pressed his forehead with his hands this cant be it is said leonard mark the new york towers faded mars returned saul stood on the empty sea bottom staring limply at the young newcomer you he said putting his hand out to leonard mark you did it you did it with your mind yes said leonard mark silently they stood facing each other finally trembling saul seized the other exiles hand and wrung it again and again saying oh but im glad youre here you cant know how glad i am they drank their rich brown coffee from the tin cups it was high noon they had been talking all through the warm morning time and this ability of yours said saul over his cup looking steadily at the young leonard mark its just something i was born with said mark looking into his drink my mother was in the blowup of london back in i was born ten months later i dont know what youd call my ability telepathy and thought transference i suppose i used to have an act i traveled all around the world leonard mark the mental marvel they said on the billboards i was pretty well off most people thought i was a charlatan you know what people think of theatrical folks only i knew i was really genuine but i didnt let anybody know it was safer not to let it get around too much oh a few of my close friends knew about my real ability i had a lot of talents that will come in handy now that im here on mars you sure scared the hell out of me said saul his cup rigid in his hand when new york came right up out of the ground that way i thought i was insane its a form of hypnotism which affects all of the sensual organs at onceeyes ears nose mouth skinall of them what would you like to be doing now most of all saul put down his cup he tried to hold his hands very steady he wet his lips id like to be in a little creek i used to swim in in mellin town illinois when i was a kid id like to be starknaked and swimming well said leonard mark and moved his head ever so little saul fell back on the sand his eyes shut leonard mark sat watching him saul lay on the sand from time to time his hands moved twitched excitedly his mouth spasmed open sounds issued from his tightening and relaxing throat saul began to make slow movements of his arms out and back out and back gasping with his head to one side his arms going and coming slowly on the warm air stirring the yellow sand under him his body turning slowly over leonard mark quietly finished his coffee while he drank he kept his eyes on the moving whispering saul lying there on the dead sea bottom all right said leonard mark saul sat up rubbing his face after a moment he told leonard mark i saw the creek i ran along the bank and i took off my clothes he said breathlessly his smile incredulous and i dived in and swam around im pleased said leonard mark here saul reached into his pocket and drew forth his last bar of chocolate this is for you whats this leonard mark looked at the gift chocolate nonsense im not doing this for pay im doing it because it makes you happy put that thing back in your pocket before i turn it into a rattlesnake and it bites you thank you thank you saul put it away you dont know how good that water was he fetched the coffeepot more pouring the coffee saul shut his eyes a moment ive got socrates here he thought socrates and plato and nietzsche and schopenhauer this man by his talk is a genius by his talent hes incredible think of the long easy days and the cool nights of talk well have it wont be a bad year at all not half he spilled the coffee whats wrong nothing saul himself was confused startled well be in greece he thought in athens well be in rome if we want when we study the roman writers well stand in the parthenon and the acropolis it wont be just talk but itll be a place to be besides this man can do it he has the power to do it when we talk the plays of racine he can make a stage and players and all of it for me by christ this is better than life ever was how much better to be sick and here than well on earth without these abilities how may people have ever seen a greek drama played in a greek amphitheater in the year bc and if i ask quietly and earnestly will this man take on the aspect of schopenhauer and darwin and bergson and all the other thoughtful men of the ages yes why not to sit and talk with nietzsche in person with plato himself there was only one thing wrong saul felt himself swaying the other men the other sick ones along the bottom of this dead sea in the distance men were moving walking toward them they had seen the rocket flash land dislodge a passenger now they were coming slowly painfully to greet the new arrival saul was cold look he said mark i think wed better head for the mountains why see those men coming some of them are insane really yes isolation and all make them that way yes thats it wed better get going they dont look very dangerous they move slowly youd be surprised mark looked at saul youre trembling whys that theres no time to talk said saul getting up swiftly come on dont you realize whatll happen once they discover your talent theyll fight over you theyll kill each otherkill youfor the right to own you oh but i dont belong to anybody said leonard mark he looked at saul no not even you saul jerked his head i didnt even think of that didnt you now mark laughed we havent time to argue answered saul eyes blinking cheeks blazing come on i dont want to im going to sit right here until those men show up youre a little too possessive my lifes my own saul felt an ugliness in himself his face began to twist you heard what i said how very quickly you changed from a friend to an enemy observed mark saul hit at him it was a neat quick blow coming down mark ducked aside laughing no you dont they were in the center of times square cars roared hooting upon them buildings plunged up hot into the blue air its a lie cried saul staggering under the visual impact for gods sake dont mark the men are coming youll be killed mark sat there on the pavement laughing at his joke let them come i can fool them all new york distracted saul it was meant to distractmeant to keep his attention with its unholy beauty after so many months away from it instead of attacking mark he could only stand drinking in the alien but familiar scene he shut his eyes no and fell forward dragging mark with him horns screamed in his ears brakes hissed and caught violently he smashed at marks chin silence mark lay on the sea bottom taking the unconscious man in his arms saul began to run heavily new york was gone there was only the wide soundlessness of the dead sea the men were closing in around him he headed for the hills with his precious cargo with new york and green country and fresh springs and old friends held in his arms he fell once and struggled up he did not stop running night filled the cave the wind wandered in and out tugging at the small fire scattering ashes mark opened his eyes he was tied with ropes and leaning against the dry wall of the cave facing the fire saul put another stick on the fire glancing now and again with a catlike nervousness at the cave enhance youre a fool saul started yes said mark youre a fool theyll find us if they have to hunt for six months theyll find us they saw new york at a distance like a mirage and us in the center of it its too much to think they wont be curious and follow our trail ill move on with you then said saul staring into the fire and theyll come after shut up mark smiled is that the way to speak to your wife you heard me oh a fine marriage this isyour greed and my mental ability what do you want to see now shall i show you a few more of your childhood scenes saul felt the sweat coming out on his brow he didnt know if the man was joking or not yes he said all right said mark watch flame gushed out of the rocks sulphur choked him pits of brimstone exploded concussions rocked the cave heaving up saul coughed and blundered burned withered by hell hell went away the cave returned mark was laughing saul stood over him you he said coldly bending down what else do you expect cried mark to be tied up toted off made the intellectual bride of a man insane with lonelinessdo you think i enjoy this ill untie you if you promise not to run away i couldnt promise that im a free agent i dont belong to anybody saul got down on his knees but youve got to belong do you hear youve got to belong i cant let you go away my dear fellow the more you say things like that the more remote i am if youd had any sense and done things intelligently wed have been friends id have been glad to do you these little hypnotic favors after all theyre no trouble for me to conjure up fun really but youve botched it you wanted me all to yourself you were afraid the others would take me away from you oh how mistaken you were i have enough power to keep them all happy you could have shared me like a community kitchen id have felt quite like a god among children being kind doing favors in return for which you might bring me little gifts special tidbits of food im sorry im sorry saul cried but i know those men too well are you any different hardly go out and see if theyre coming i thought i heard a noise saul ran in the cave entrance he cupped his hands peering down into the nightfilled gully dim shapes stirred was it only the wind blowing the roving clumps of weeds he began to tremblea fine aching tremble i dont see anything he came back into an empty cave he stared at the fireplace mark mark was gone there was nothing but the cave filled with boulders stones pebbles the lonely fire flickering the wind sighing and saul standing there incredulous and numb mark mark come back the man had worked free of his bonds slowly carefully and using the ruse of imagining he heard other men approaching had gonewhere the cave was deep but ended in a blank wall and mark could not have slipped past him into the night how then saul stepped around the fire he drew his knife and approached a large boulder that stood against the cave wall smiling he pressed the knife against the boulder smiling he tapped the knife there then he drew his knife back to plunge it into the boulder stop shouted mark the boulder vanished mark was there saul suspended his knife the fire played on his cheeks his eyes were quite insane it didnt work he whispered he reached down and put his hands on marks throat and closed his fingers mark said nothing but moved uneasily in the grip his eyes ironic telling things to saul that saul knew if you kill me the eyes said where will all your dreams be if you kill me where will all the streams and brook trout be kill me kill plato kill aristotle kill einstein yes kill all of us go ahead strangle me i dare you sauls fingers released the throat shadows moved into the cave mouth both men turned their heads the other men were there five of them haggard with travel panting waiting in the outer rim of light good evening called mark laughing come in come in gentlemen by dawn the arguments and ferocities still continued mark sat among the glaring men rubbing his wrists newly released from his bonds he created a mahoganypaneled conference hall and a marble table at which they all sat ridiculously bearded evilsmelling sweating and greedy men eyes bent upon their treasure the way to settle it said mark at last is for each of you to have certain hours of certain days for appointments with me ill treat you all equally ill be city property free to come and go thats fair enough as for saul here hes on probation when hes proved he can be a civil person once more ill give him a treatment or two until that time ill have nothing more to do with him the other exiles grinned at saul im sorry saul said i didnt know what i was doing im all right now well see said mark lets give ourselves a month shall we the other men grinned at saul saul said nothing he sat staring at the floor of the cave lets see now said mark on mondays its your day smith smith nodded on tuesdays ill take peter there for an hour or so peter nodded on wednesdays ill finish up with johnson holtzman and jim here the last three men looked at each other the rest of the week im to be left strictly alone do you hear mark told them a little should be better than nothing if you dont obey i wont perform at all maybe well make you perform said johnson he caught the other mens eye look were five against his one we can make him do anything we want if we cooperate weve got a great thing here dont be idiots mark warned the other men let me talk said johnson hes telling us what hell do why dont we tell him are we bigger than him or not and him threatening not to perform well just let me get a sliver of wood under his toenails and maybe burn his fingers a bit with a steel file and well see if he performs why shouldnt we have performances i want to know every night in the week dont listen to him said mark hes crazy he cant be depended on you know what hell do dont you hell get you all off guard one by one and kill you yes kill all of you so that when hes done hell be alonejust him and me thats his sort the listening men blinked first at mark then at johnson for that matter observed mark none of you can trust the others this is a fools conference the minute your back is turned one of the other men will murder you i dare say at the weeks end youll all be dead or dying a cold wind blew into the mahogany room it began to dissolve and became a cave once more mark was tired of his joke the marble table splashed and rained and evaporated the men gazed suspiciously at each other with little bright animal eyes what was spoken was true they saw each other in the days to come surprising one another killinguntil that last lucky one remained to enjoy the intellectual treasure that walked among them saul watched them and felt alone and disquieted once you have made a mistake how hard to admit your wrongness to go back start fresh they were all wrong they had been lost a long time now they were worse than lost and to make matters very bad said mark at last one of you has a gun all the rest of you have only knives but one of you i know has a gun everybody jumped up search said mark find the one with the gun or youre all dead that did it the men plunged wildly about not knowing whom to search first their hands grappled they cried out and mark watched them in contempt johnson fell back feeling in his jacket all right he said we might as well have it over now here you smith and he shot smith through the chest smith fell the other men yelled they broke apart johnson aimed and fired twice more stop cried mark new york soared up around them out of rock and cave and sky sun glinted on high towers the elevated thundered tugs blew in the harbor the green lady stared across the bay a torch in her hand look you fools said mark central park broke out constellations of spring blossoms the wind blew freshcut lawn smells over them in a wave and in the center of new york bewildered the men stumbled johnson fired his gun three times more saul ran forward he crashed against johnson bore him down wrenched the gun away it fired again the men stopped milling they stood saul lay across johnson they ceased struggling there was a terrible silence the men stood watching new york sank down into the sea with a hissing bubbling sighing with a cry of ruined metal and old time the great structures leaned warped flowed collapsed mark stood among the buildings then like a building a neat red hole drilled into his chest wordless he fell saul lay staring at the men at the body he got up the gun in his hand johnson did not movewas afraid to move they all shut their eyes and opened them again thinking that by so doing they might reanimate the man who lay before them the cave was cold saul stood up and looked remotely at the gun in his hand he took it and threw it far out over the valley and did not watch it fall they looked down at the body as if they could not believe it saul bent down and took hold of the limp hand leonard he said softly leonard he shook the hand leonard leonard mark did not move his eyes were shut his chest had ceased going up and down he was getting cold saul got up weve killed him he said not looking at the men his mouth was filling with a raw liquor now the only one we didnt want to kill we killed he put his shaking hand to his eyes the other men stood waiting get a spade said saul bury him he turned away ill have nothing to do with you somebody walked off to find a spade saul was so weak he couldnt move his legs were grown into the earth with roots feeding deep of loneliness and fear and the cold of the night the fire had almost died out and now there was only the double moonlight riding over the blue mountains there was the sound of someone digging in the earth with a spade we dont need him anyhow said somebody much too loudly the sound of digging went on saul walked off slowly and let himself slide down the side of a dark tree until he reached and was sitting blankly on the sand his hands blindly in his lap sleep he thought well all go to sleep now we have that much anyway go to sleep and try to dream of new york and all the rest he closed his eyes wearily the blood gathering in his nose and his mouth and in his quivering eyes how did he do it he asked in a tired voice his head fell forward on his chest how did he bring new york up here and make us walk around in it lcts try it shouldnt be too hard think think of new york he whispered falling down into sleep new york and central park and then illinois in the spring apple blossoms and green grass it didnt work it wasnt the same new york was gone and nothing he could do would bring it back he would rise every morning and walk on the dead sea looking for it and walk forever around mars looking for it and never find it and finally lie too tired to walk trying to find new york in his head but not finding it the last thing he heard before he slept was the spade rising and falling and digging a hole into which with a tremendous crash of metal and golden mist and odor and color and sound new york collapsed fell and was buried he cried all night in his sleep the concrete mixer he listened to the drygrass rustle of the old witches voices beneath his open window ettil the coward ettil the refuser ettil who will not wage the glorious war of mars against earth speak on witches he cried the voices dropped to a murmur like that of water in the long canals under the martian sky ettil the father of a son who must grow up in the shadow of this horrid knowledge said the old wrinkled women they knocked their slyeyed heads gently together shame shame his wife was crying on the other side of the room her tears were as rain numerous and cool on the tiles oh ettil how can you think this way ettil laid aside his metal book which at his beckoning had been singing him a story all morning from its thin goldenwired frame ive tried to explain he said this is a foolish thing mars invading earth well be destroyed utterly outside a banging crashing boom a surge of brass a drum a cry marching feet pennants and songs through the stone sheets the army fire weapons to shoulder stamped children skipped after old women waved dirty flags i shall remain on mars and read a book said ettil a blunt knock on the door tylla answered fatherinlaw stormed in whats this i hear about my soninlaw a traitor yes father youre not fighting in the martian army no father gods the old father turned very red a plague on your name youll be shot shoot me then and have it over who ever heard of a martian not invading who nobody it is i admit quite incredible incredible husked the witch voices under the window father cant you reason with him demanded tylla reason with a dung heap cried father eyes blazing he came and stood over ettil bands playing a fine day women weeping children jumping everything right men marching bravely and you sit here oh shame shame sobbed the faraway voices in the hedge get the devil out of my house with your inane chatter said ettil exploding take your medals and your drums and run he shoved fatherinlaw past a screaming wife only to have the door thrown wide at this moment as a military detail entered a voice shouted ettil vrye yes you are under arrest goodby my dear wife i am off to the wars with these fools shouted ettil dragged through the door by the men in bronze mesh goodby goodby said the town witches fading away the cell was neat and clean without a book ettil was nervous he gripped the bars and watched the rockets shoot up into the night air the stars were cold and numerous they seemed to scatter when every rocket blasted up among them fools whispered ettil fools the cell door opened one man with a kind of vehicle entered full of books books here there everywhere in the chambers of the vehicle behind him the military assignor loomed ettil vrye we want to know why you had these illegal earth books in your house these copies of wonder stories scientific tales fantastic stories explain the man gripped ettils wrist ettil shook him free if youre going to shoot me shoot me that literature from earth is the very reason why i wont try to invade them its the reason why your invasion will fail how so the assignor scowled and turned to the yellowed magazines pick any copy said ettil any one at all nine out of ten stories in the years to earth calendar have every martian invasion successfully invading earth ah the assignor smiled nodded and then said ettil failing thats treason owning such literature so be it if you wish but let me draw a few conclusions invariably each invasion is thwarted by a young man usually lean usually irish usually alone named mick or rick or jick or bannon who destroys the martians you dont believe that no i dont believe earthmen can actually do thatno but they have a background understand assignor of generations of children reading just such fiction absorbing it they have nothing but a literature of invasions successfully thwarted can you say the same for martian literature well no i guess not you know not we never wrote stories of such a fantastic nature now we rebel we attack and we shall die i dont see your reasoning on that where does this tie in with the magazine stories morale a big thing the earthmen know they cant fail it is in them like blood beating in their veins they cannot fail they will repel each invasion no matter how well organized their youth of reading just such fiction as this has given them a faith we cannot equal we martians we are uncertain we know that we might fail our morale is low in spite of the banged drums and tooted horns i wont listen to this treason cried the assignor this fiction will be burned as you will be within the next ten minutes you have a choice ettil vrye join the legion of war or burn it is a choice of deaths i choose to burn men he was hustled out into the courtyard there he saw his carefully hoarded reading matter set to the torch a special pit was prepared with oil five feet deep in it this with a great thunder was set afire into this in a minute he would be pushed on the far side of the courtyard in shadow he noticed the solemn figure of his son standing alone his great yellow eyes luminous with sorrow and fear he did not put out his hand or speak but only looked at his father like some dying animal a wordless animal seeking rescue ettil looked at the flaming pit he felt the rough hands seize him strip him push him forward to the hot perimeter of death only then did ettil swallow and cry out wait the assignors face bright with the orange fire pushed forward in the trembling air what is it i will join the legion of war replied ettil good release him the hands fell away as he turned he saw his son standing far across the court waiting his son was not smiling only waiting in the sky a bronze rocket leaped across the stars ablaze and now we bid goodby to these stalwart warriors said the assignor the band thumped and the wind blew a fine sweet rain of tears gently upon the sweating army the children cavorted in the chaos ettil saw his wife weeping with pride his son solemn and silent at her side they marched into the ship everybody laughing and brave they buckled themselves into their spiderwebs all through the tense ship the spiderwebs were filled with lounging lazy men they chewed on bits of food and waited a great lid slammed shut a valve hissed off to earth and destruction whispered ettil what asked someone off to glorious victory said ettil grimacing the rocket jumped space thought ettil here we are banging across black inks and pink lights of space in a brass kettle here we are a celebratory rocket heaved out to fill the earthmens eyes with fear flames as they look up to the sky what is it like being far far away from your home your wife your child here and now he tried to analyze his trembling it was like tying your most secret inward working organs to mars and then jumping out a million miles your heart was still on mars pumping glowing your brain was still on mars thinking crenulated like an abandoned torch your stomach was still on mars somnolent trying to digest the final dinner your lungs were still in the cool blue wine air of mars a soft folded bellows screaming for release one part of you longing for the rest for here you were a meshless cogless automaton a body upon which officials had performed clinical autopsy and left all of you that counted back upon the empty seas and strewn over the darkened hills here you were bottleempty fireless chill with only your hands to give death to earthmen a pair of hands is all you are now he thought in cold remoteness here you lie in the tremendous web others are about you but they are wholewhole hearts and bodies but all of you that lives is back there walking the desolate seas in evening winds this thing here this cold clay thing is already dead attack stations attack stations attack ready ready ready up out of the webs quick ettil moved somewhere before him his two cold hands moved how swift it has all been he thought a year ago one earth rocket reached mars our scientists with their incredible telepathic ability copied it our workers with their incredible plants reproduced it a hundredfold no other earth ship has reached mars since then and yet we know their language perfectly all of us we know their culture their logic and we shall pay the price of our brilliance guns on the ready right sights reading by miles ten thousand attack a humming silence a silence of insects throbbing in the walls of the rocket the insect singing of tiny bobbins and levers and whirls of wheels silence of waiting men silence of glands emitting the slow steady pulse of sweat under arm on brow under staring pale eyes wait ready ettil hung onto his sanity with his fingernails hung hard and long silence silence silence waiting teeeeeee whats that earth radio cut them in theyre trying to reach us call us cut them in eeeee here they are listen calling martian invasion fleet the listening silence the insect hum pulling back to let the sharp earth voice crack in upon the rooms of waiting men this is earth calling this is william sommers president of the association of united american producers ettil held tight to his station bent forward eyes shut welcome to earth what the men in the rocket roared what did he say yes welcome to earth its a trick ettil shivered opened his eyes to stare in bewilderment at the unseen voice from the ceiling source welcome welcome to green industrial earth declared the friendly voice with open arms we welcome you to turn a bloody invasion into a time of friendships that will last through all of time a trick hush listen many years ago we of earth renounced war destroyed our atom bombs now unprepared as we are there is nothing for us but to welcome you the planet is yours we ask only mercy from you good and merciful invaders it cant be true a voice whispered it must be a trick land and be welcomed all of you said mr william sommers of earth land anywhere earth is yours we are all brothers ettil began to laugh everyone in the room turned to see him the other martians blinked hes gone mad he did not stop laughing until they hit him the tiny fat man in the center of the hot rocket tarmac at green town california jerked out a clean white handkerchief and touched it to his wet brow he squinted blindly from the fresh plank platform at the fifty thousand people restrained behind a fence of policemen arm to arm everybody looked at the sky there they are a gasp no just sea gulls a disappointed grumble im beginning to think it would have been better to have declared war on them whispered the mayor then we could all go home shh said his wife there the crowd roared out of the sun came the martian rockets everybody ready the mayor glanced nervously about yes sir said miss california yes said miss america who had come rushing up at the last minute as a substitute for miss america who was ill at home yes siree said mr biggest grapefruit in san fernando valley eagerly ready band the band poised its brass like so many guns ready the rockets landed go the band played california here i come ten times from noon until one oclock the mayor made a speech shaking his hands in the direction of the silent apprehensive rockets at onefifteen the seals of the rockets opened the band played oh you golden state three times ettil and fifty other martians leaped out guns at the ready the mayor ran forward with the key to earth in his hands the band played santa claus is coming to town and a full chorus of singers imported from long beach sang different words to it something about martians are coming to town seeing no weapons about the martians relaxed but kept their guns out from onethirty until twofifteen the mayor made the same speech over for the benefit of the martians at twothirty miss america of volunteered to kiss all the martians if they lined up at twothirty and ten seconds the band played how do you do everybody to cover up the confusion caused by miss americas suggestion at two thirtyfive mr biggest grapefruit presented the martians with a twoton truck full of grapefruit at two thirtyseven the mayor gave them all free passes to the elite and majestic theaters combining this gesture with another speech which lasted until after three the band played and the fifty thousand people sang for they are jolly good fellows it was over at four oclock ettil sat down in the shadow of the rocket two of his fellows with him so this is earth i say kill the filthy rats said one martian i dont trust them theyre sneaky whats their motive for treating us this way he held up a box of something that rustled whats this stuff they gave me a sample they said he read the label blix the new sudsy soap the crowd had drifted about was mingling with the martians like a carnival throng everywhere was the buzzing murmur of people fingering the rockets asking questions ettil was cold he was beginning to tremble even more now dont you feel it he whispered the tenseness the evilness of all this somethings going to happen to us they have some plan something subtle and horrible theyre going to do something to usi know i say kill every one of them how can you kill people who call you pal and buddy asked another martian ettil shook his head theyre sincere and yet i feel as if we were in a big acid vat melting away away im frightened he put his mind out to touch among the crowd yes theyre really friendly hailfellowswellmet one of their terms one huge mass of common men loving dogs and cats and martians equally and yetand yet the band played roll out the barrel free beer was being distributed through the courtesy of hagenback beer fresno california the sickness came the men poured out fountains of slush from their mouths the sound of sickness filled the land gagging ettil sat beneath a sycamore tree a plot a plota horrible plot he groaned holding his stomach what did you eat the assignor stood over him something that they called popcorn groaned ettil and and some sort of long meat on a bun and some yellow liquid in an iced vat and some sort of fish and something called pastrami sighed ettil eyelids flickering the moans of the martian invaders sounded all about kill the plotting snakes somebody cried weakly hold on said the assignor its merely hospitality they overdid it up on your feet now men into the town weve got to place small garrisons of men about to make sure all is well other ships are landing in other cities weve our job to do here the men gained their feet and stood blinking stupidly about forward march one two three four one two three four the white stores of the little town lay dreaming in shimmering heat heat emanated from everythingpoles concrete metal awnings roofs tar papereverything the sound of martian feet sounded on the asphalt careful men whispered the assignor they walked past a beauty shop from inside a furtive giggle look a coppery head bobbed and vanished like a doll in the window a blue eye glinted and winked at a keyhole its a plot whispered ettil a plot i tell you the odors of perfume were fanned out on the summer air by the whirling vents of the grottoes where the women hid like undersea creatures under electric cones their hair curled into wild whorls and peaks their eyes shrewd and glassy animal and sly their mouths painted a neon red fans were whirring the perfumed wind issuing upon the stillness moving among green trees creeping among the amazed martians for gods sake screamed ettil his nerves suddenly breaking loose lets get in our rocketsgo home theyll get us those horrid things in there see them those evil undersea things those women in their cool little caverns of artificial rock shut up look at them in there he thought drifting their dresses like cool green gills over their pillar legs he shouted someone shut his mouth theyll rush out on us hurling chocolate boxes and copies of kleig love and holly pickture shrieking with their red greasy mouths inundate us with banality destroy our sensibilities look at them being electrocuted by devices their voices like hums and chants and murmurs do you dare go in there why not asked the other martians theyll fry you bleach you change you crack you flake you away until youre nothing but a husband a working man the one with the money who pays so they can come sit in there devouring their evil chocolates do you think you could control them yes by the gods from a distance a voice drifted a high and shrill voice a womans voice saying aint that middle one there cute martians aint so bad after all gee theyre just men said another fading hey there yoohoo martians hey yelling ettil ran he sat in a park and trembled steadily he remembered what he had seen looking up at the dark night sky he felt so far from home so deserted even now as he sat among the still trees in the distance he could see martian warriors walking the streets with the earth women vanishing into the phantom darknesses of the little emotion palaces to hear the ghastly sounds of white things moving on gray screens with little frizzhaired women beside them wads of gelatinous gum working in their jaws other wads under the seats hardening with the fossil imprints of the womens tiny cat teeth forever imbedded therein the cave of windsthe cinema hello he jerked his head in terror a woman sat on the bench beside him chewing gum lazily dont run off i dont bite she said oh he said like to go to the pictures she said no aw come on she said everybody else is no he said is that all you do in this world all aint that enough her blue eyes widened suspiciously what you want me to dosit home read a book ha ha thats rich

bighearted mister thats why just remember that bighearted she walked off to look for someone else gathering courage to himself ettil began to write a letter to his wife moving the pen carefully over the paper on his knee dear tylla but again he was interrupted a smalllittlegirlofanoldwoman with a pale round wrinkled little face shook her tambourine in front of his nose forcing him to glance up brother she cried eyes blazing have you been saved am i in danger ettil dropped his pen jumping terrible danger she wailed clanking her tambourine gazing at the sky you need to be saved brother in the worst way im inclined to agree he said trembling we saved lots already today i saved three myself of you mars people aint that nice she grinned at him i guess so she was acutely suspicious she leaned

letter dear tylla to think that in my naпvetй i imagined that the earthmen would have to counterattack with guns and bombs no no i was sadly wrong there is no rick or mick or jick or bannonthose lever fellows who save worlds no there are blond robots with pink rubber bodies real but somehow unreal alive but somehow automatic in all responses living in caves all of their lives their derriиres are incredible in girth their eyes are fixed and motionless from an endless time of staring at picture screens the only muscles they have occur in their jaws from their ceaseless chewing of gum and it is not only these my dear tylla but the entire civilization into which we have been dropped like a shovelful of seeds into a large concrete mixer nothing of us will survive we will be killed not by the gun but by the gladhand we will be destroyed not by the rocket but by the automobile somebody screamed a crash another crash silence ettil leaped up from his letter outside on the street two ears had crashed one full of martians another with earthmen ettil returned to his letter dear dear tylla a few statistics if you will allow fortyfive thousand people killed every year on this continent of america made into jelly right in the can as it were in the automobiles red blood jelly with white marrow bones like sudden thoughts ridiculous horror thoughts transfixed in the immutable jelly the cars roll up in tight neat sardine rollsall sauce all silence blood manure for green buzzing summer flies all over the highways faces made into halloween masks by sudden stops halloween is one of their holidays i think they worship the automobile on that nightsomething to do with death anyway you look out your window and see two people lying atop each other in friendly fashion who a moment ago had never met before dead i foresee our army mashed diseased trapped in cinemas by witches and gum sometime in the next day i shall try to escape back to mars before it is too late somewhere on earth tonight my tylla there is a man with a lever which when he pulls it will save the world the man is now unemployed his switch gathers dust he himself plays pinochle the women of this evil planet are drowning us in a tide of banal sentimentality misplaced romance and one last fling before the makers of glycerin boil them down for usage good night tylla wish me well for i shall probably die trying to escape my love to our child weeping silently he folded the letter and reminded himself to mail it later at the rocket post he left the park what was there to do escape but how return to the post late tonight steal one of the rockets alone and go back to mars would it be possible he shook his head he was much too confused all that he really knew was that if he stayed here he would soon be the property of a lot of things that buzzed and snorted and hissed that gave off fumes or stenches in six months he would be the owner of a large pink trained ulcer a blood pressure of algebraic dimensions a myopia this side of blindness and nightmares as deep as oceans and infested with improbable lengths of dream intestines through which he must violently force his way each night no no he looked at the haunted faces of the earthmen drifting violently along in their mechanical death boxes soonyes very soonthey would invent an auto with six silver handles on it hey there an auto horn a large long hearse of a car black and ominous pulled to the curb a man leaned out you a martian yes just the man i gotta see hop in quickthe chance of a lifetime hop in take you to a real nice joint

feelings heres my card be at the studio in hollywood tomorrow morning at nine oclock theyll show you your office ill arrive at eleven and see you then be sure you get there at nine oclock its a strict rule why gallagher youre a queer oyster but i love you good night happy invasion the car drove off ettil blinked after it incredulous then rubbing his brow with the palm of his hand he walked slowly along the street toward the rocket port well what are you going to do he asked himself aloud the rockets lay gleaming in the moonlight silent from the city came the sounds of distant revelry in the medical compound an extreme case of nervous breakdown was being tended to a young martian who by his screams had seen too much drunk too much heard too many songs on the little redandyellow boxes in the drinking places and had been chased around innumerable tables by a large elephantlike woman he kept murmuring cant breathe crushed trapped the sobbing faded ettil came out of the shadows and moved on across a wide avenue toward the ships far over he could see the guards lying about drunkenly he listened from the vast city came the faint sounds of cars and music and sirens and he imagined other sounds too the insidious whir of malt machines stirring malts to fatten the warriors and make them lazy and forgetful the narcotic voices of the cinema caverns lulling and lulling the martians fast fast into a slumber through which all of their remaining lives they would sleepwalk a year from now how many martians dead of cirrhosis of the liver bad kidneys high blood pressure suicide he stood in the middle of the empty avenue two blocks away a car was rushing toward him he had a choice stay here take the studio job report for work each morning as adviser on a picture and in time come to agree with the producer that yes indeed there were massacres on mars yes the women were tall and blond yes there were tribal dances and sacrifices yes yes yes or he could walk over and get into a rocket ship and alone return to mars but what about next year he said the blue canal night club brought to mars the ancient city gambling casino built right inside yes right inside a real martian ancient city neons racing forms blowing in the old cities picnic lunches in the ancestral graveyardsall of it all of it but not quite yet in a few days he could be home tylla would be waiting with their son and then for the last few years of gentle life he might sit with his wife in the blowing weather on the edge of the canal reading his good gentle books sipping a rare and light wine talking and living out their short time until the neon bewilderment fell from the sky and then perhaps he and tylla might move into the blue mountains and hide for another year or two until the tourists came to snap their cameras and say how quaint things were he knew just what he would say to tylla war is a bad thing but peace can be a living horror he stood in the middle of the wide avenue turning it was with no surprise that he saw a car bearing down upon him a car full of screaming children these boys and girls none older than sixteen were swerving and ricocheting their opentop car down the avenue he saw them point at him and yell he heard the motor roar louder the car sped forward at sixty miles an hour he began to run yes yes he thought tiredly with the car upon him how strange how sad it sounds so much like a concrete mixer marionettes inc they walked slowly down the street at about ten in the evening talking calmly they were both about thirtyfive both eminently sober but why so early said smith because said braling your first night out in years and you go home at ten oclock nerves i suppose what i wonder is how you ever managed it ive been trying to get you out for ten years for a quiet drink and now on the one night you insist on turning in early mustnt crowd my luck said braling what did you do put sleeping powder in your wifes coffee no that would be unethical youll see soon enough they turned a corner honestly braling i hate to say this but you have been patient with her you may not admit it to me but marriage has been awful for you hasnt it i wouldnt say that its got around anyway here and there how she got you to marry her that time back in when you were going to rio dear rio i never did see it after all my plans and how she tore her clothes and rumpled her hair and threatened to call the police unless you married her she always was nervous smith understand it was more than unfair you didnt love her you told her as much didnt you i recall that i was quite firm on the subject but you married her anyhow i had my business to think of as well as my mother and father a thing like that would have killed them and its been ten years yes said braling his gray eyes steady but i think perhaps it might change now i think what ive waited for has come about look here he drew forth a long blue ticket why its a ticket for rio on the thursday rocket yes im finally going to make it but how wonderful you do deserve it but wont she object cause trouble braling smiled nervously she wont know im gone ill be back in a month and no one the wiser except you smith sighed i wish i were going with you poor smith your marriage hasnt exactly been roses has it not exactly married to a woman who overdoes it i mean after all when youve been married ten years you dont expect a woman to sit on your lap for two hours every evening call you at work twelve times a day and talk baby talk and it seems to me that in the last month shes gotten worse i wonder if perhaps she isnt just a little simpleminded ah smith always the conservative well heres my house now would you like to know my secret how i made it out this evening will you really tell look up there said braling they both stared up through the dark air in the window above them on the second floor a shade was raised a man about thirtyfive years old with a touch of gray at either temple sad gray eyes and a small thin mustache looked down at them why thats you cried smith shhh not so loud braling waved upward the man in the window gestured significantly and vanished i must be insane said smith hold on a moment they waited the street door of the apartment opened and the tall spare gentleman with the mustache and the grieved eyes came out to meet them hello braling he said hello braling said braling they were identical smith stared is this your twin brother i never knew no no said braling quietly bend close put your ear to braling twos chest smith hesitated and then leaned forward to place his head against the uncomplaining ribs ticktickticktickticktickticktick oh no it cant be it is let me listen again ticktickticktickticktickticktick smith staggered back and fluttered his eyelids appalled he reached out and touched the warm hands and the cheeks of the thing whered you get him isnt he excellently fashioned incredible where give the man your card braling two braling two did a magic trick and produced a white card marionettes inc duplicate self or friends new humanoid plastic models guaranteed against all physical wear from to our de luxe model no said smith yes said braling naturally said braling two how long has this gone on ive had him for a month i keep him in the cellar in a toolbox my wife never goes downstairs and i have the only lock and key to that box tonight i said i wished to take a walk to buy a cigar i went down cellar and took braling two out of his box and sent him back up to sit with my wife while i came on out to see you smith wonderful he even smells like you bond street and melachrinos it may be splitting hairs but i think it highly ethical after all what my wife wants most of all is me this marionette is me to the hairiest detail ive been home all evening i shall be home with her for the next month in the meantime another gentleman will be in rio after ten years of waiting when i return from rio braling two here will go back in his box smith thought that over a minute or two will he walk around without sustenance for a month he finally asked for six months if necessary and hes built to do everythingeat sleep perspireeverything natural as natural is youll take good care of my wife wont you braling two your wife is rather nice said braling two ive grown rather fond of her smith was beginning to tremble how long has marionettes inc been in business secretly for two years could ii mean is there a possibility smith took his friends elbow earnestly can you tell me where i can get one a robot a marionette for myself you will give me the address wont you here you are smith took the card and turned it round and round thank you he said you dont know what this means just a little respite a night or so once a month even my wife loves me so much she cant bear to have me gone an hour i love her dearly you know but remember the old poem love will fly if held too lightly love will die if held too tightly i just want her to relax her grip a little bit youre lucky at least that your wife loves you hates my problem not so easy oh nettie loves me madly it will be my task to make her love me comfortably good luck to you smith do drop around while im in rio it will seem strange if you suddenly stop calling by to my wife youre to treat braling two here just like me right goodby and thank you smith went smiling down the street braling and braling two turned and walked into the apartment hall on the crosstown bus smith whistled softly turning the white card in his fingers clients must be pledged to secrecy for while an act is pending in congress to legalize marionettes inc it is still a felony if caught to use one well said smith clients must have a mold made of their body and a color index check of their eyes lips hair skin etc clients must expect to wait for two months until their model is finished not so long thought smith two months from now my ribs will have a chance to mend from the crushing theyve taken two months from now my hand will heal from being so constantly held two months from now my bruised underlip will begin to reshape itself i dont mean to sound ungrateful he flipped the card over marionettes inc is two years old and has a fine record of satisfied customers behind it our motto is no strings attached address south wesley drive the bus pulled to his stop he alighted and while humming up the stairs he thought nettie and i have fifteen thousand in our joint bank account ill just slip eight thousand out as a business venture you might say the marionette will probably pay back my money with interest in many ways nettie neednt know he unlocked the door and in a minute was in the bedroom there lay nettie pale huge and piously asleep dear nettie he was almost overwhelmed with remorse at her innocent face there in the semidarkness if you were awake you would smother me with kisses and coo in my ear really you make me feel like a criminal you have been such a good loving wife sometimes it is impossible for me to believe you married me instead of that bud chapman you once liked it seems that in the last month you have loved me more wildly than ever before tears came to his eyes suddenly he wished to kiss her confess his love tear up the card forget the whole business but as he moved to do this his hand ached and his ribs cracked and groaned he stopped with a pained look in his eyes and turned away he moved out into the hall and through the dark rooms humming he opened the kidney desk in the library and filched the bankbook just take eight thousand dollars is all he said no more than that he stopped wait a minute he rechecked the bankbook frantically hold on here he cried ten thousand dollars is missing he leaped up theres only five thousand left whats she done whats nettie done with it more hats more clothes more perfume or waiti know she bought that little house on the hudson shes been talking about for months without so much as a by your leave he stormed into the bedroom righteous and indignant what did she mean taking their money like this he bent over her nettie he shouted nettie wake up she did not stir whatve you done with my money he bellowed she stirred fitfully the light from the street flushed over her beautiful cheeks there was something about her his heart throbbed violently his tongue dried he shivered his knees suddenly turned to water he collapsed nettie nettie he cried whatve you done with my money and then the horrid thought and then the terror and the loneliness engulfed him and then the fever and disillusionment for without desiring to do so he bent forward and yet forward again until his fevered ear was resting firmly and irrevocably upon her round pink bosom nettie he cried tickticktickticktickticktickticktickticktick as smith walked away down the avenue in the night braling and braling two turned in at the door to the apartment im glad hell be happy too said braling yes said braling two abstractedly well its the cellar box for you btwo braling guided the other creatures elbow down the stairs to the cellar thats what i want to talk to you about said braling two as they reached the concrete floor and walked across it the cellar i dont like it i dont like that toolbox ill try and fix up something more comfortable marionettes are made to move not lie still how would you like to lie in a box most of the time well you wouldnt like it at all i keep running theres no way to shut me off im perfectly alive and i have feelings itll only be a few days now ill be off to rio and you wont have to stay in the box you can live upstairs braling two gestured irritably and when you come back from having a good time back in the box i go braling said they didnt tell me at the marionette shop that id get a difficult specimen theres a lot they dont know about us said braling two were pretty new and were sensitive i hate the idea of you going off and laughing and lying in the sun in rio while were stuck here in the cold but ive wanted that trip all my life said braling quietly he squinted his eyes and could see the sea and the mountains and the yellow sand the sound of the waves was good to his inward mind the sun was fine on his bared shoulders the wine was most excellent ill never get to go to rio said the other man have you thought of that no i and another thing your wife what about her asked braling beginning to edge toward the door ive grown quite fond of her im glad youre enjoying your employment braling licked his lips nervously im afraid you dont understand i thinkim in love with her braling took another step and froze youre what and ive been thinking said braling two how nice it is in rio and how ill never get there and ive thought about your wife andi think we could be very happy tthats nice braling strolled as casually as he could to the cellar door you wont mind waiting a moment will you i have to make a phone call to whom braling two frowned no one important to marionettes incorporated to tell them to come get me no nonothing like that he tried to rush out the door a metalfirm grip seized his wrists dont run take your hands off no did my wife put you up to this no did she guess did she talk to you does she know is that it he screamed a hand clapped over his mouth youll never know will you braling two smiled delicately youll never know braling struggled she must have guessed she must have affected you braling two said im going to put you in the box lock it and lose the key then ill buy another rio ticket for your wife now now wait a minute hold on dont be rash lets talk this over goodby braling braling stiffened what do you mean goodby ten minutes later mrs braling awoke she put her hand to her cheek someone had just kissed it she shivered and looked up whyyou havent done that in years she murmured well see what we can do about that someone said the city the city waited twenty thousand years the planet moved through space and the flowers of the fields grew up and fell away and still the city waited and the rivers of the planet rose and waned and turned to dust still the city waited the winds that had been young and wild grew old and serene and the clouds of the sky that had been ripped and torn were left alone to drift in idle whitenesses still the city waited the city waited with its windows and its black obsidian walls and its sky towers and its unpennanted turrets with its untrod streets and its untouched doorknobs with not a scrap of paper or a fingerprint upon it the city waited while the planet arced in space following its orbit about a bluewhite sun and the seasons passed from ice to fire and back to ice and then to green fields and yellow summer meadows it was on a summer afternoon in the middle of the twenty thousandth year that the city ceased waiting in the sky a rocket appeared the rocket soared over turned came back and landed in the shale meadow fifty yards from the obsidian wall there were booted footsteps in the thin grass and calling voices from men within the rocket to men without ready all right men careful into the city jensen you and hutchinson patrol ahead keep a sharp eye the city opened secret nostrils in its black walls and a steady suction vent deep in the body of the city drew storms of air back through channels through thistle filters and dust collectors to a fine and tremblingly delicate series of coils and webs which glowed with silver light again and again the immense suctions occurred again and again the odors from the meadow were borne upon warm winds into the city fire odor the scent of a fallen meteor hot metal a ship has come from another world the brass smell the dusty fire smell of burned powder sulphur and rocket brimstone this information stamped on tapes which sprocketed into slots slid down through yellow cogs into further machines clickchakkchakkchakk a calculator made the sound of a metronome five six seven eight nine nine men an instantaneous typewriter inked this message on tape which slithered and vanished clicketyclickchakkchakk the city awaited the soft tread of their rubberoid boots the great city nostrils dilated again the smell of butter in the city air from the stalking men faintly the aura which wafted to the great nose broke down into memories of milk cheese ice cream butter the effluvium of a dairy economy clickclick careful men jones get your gun out dont be a fool the citys dead why worry you cant tell now at the barking talk the ears awoke after centuries of listening to winds that blew small and faint of hearing leaves strip from trees and grass grow softly in the time of melting snows now the ears oiled themselves in a selflubrication drew taut great drums upon which the heartbeat of the invaders might pummel and thud delicately as the tremor of a gnats wing the ears listened and the nose siphoned up great chambers of odor the perspiration of frightened men arose there were islands of sweat under their arms and sweat in their hands as they held their guns the nose sifted and worried this air like a connoisseur busy with an ancient vintage chikkchikkchakkclick information rotated down on parallel check tapes perspiration chlorides such and such per cent sulphates soandso urea nitrogen ammonia nitrogen thus creatinine sugar lactic acid there bells rang small totals jumped up the nose whispered expelling the tested air the great ears listened i think we should go back to the rocket captain i give the orders mr smith yes sir you up there patrol see anything nothing sir looks like its been dead a long time you see smith nothing to fear i dont like it i dont know why you ever feel youve seen a place before well this citys too familiar nonsense this planetary systems billions of miles from earth we couldnt possiblyve been here ever before ours is the only lightyear rocket in existence thats how i feel anyway sir i think we should get out the footsteps faltered there was only the sound of the intruders breath on the still air the ear heard and quickened rotors glided liquids glittered in small creeks through valves and blowers a formula and a concoctionone followed another moments later responding to the summons of the ear and nose through giant holes in the city walls a fresh vapor blew out over the invaders smell that smith ahh green grass ever smell anything better by god i just like to stand here and smell it invisible chlorophyll blew among the standing men ahh the footsteps continued nothing wrong with that eh smith come on the ear and nose relaxed a billionth of a fraction the countermove had succeeded the pawns were proceeding forward now the cloudy eyes of the city moved out of fog and mist captain the windows what those house windows there i saw them move i didnt see it they shifted they changed color from dark to light look like ordinary square windows to me blurred objects focused in the mechanical ravines of the city oiled shafts plunged balance wheels dipped over into green oil pools the window frames flexed the windows gleamed below in the street walked two men a patrol followed at a safe interval by seven more their uniforms were white their faces as pink as if they had been slapped their eyes were blue they walked upright upon hind legs carrying metal weapons their feet were booted they were males with eyes ears mouths noses the windows trembled the windows thinned they dilated imperceptibly like the irises of numberless eyes i tell you captain its the windows get along im going back sir what im going back to the rocket mr smith im not falling into any trap afraid of an empty city the others laughed uneasily go on laugh the street was stonecobbled each stone three inches wide six inches long with a move unrecognizable as such the street settled it weighed the invaders in a machine cellar a red wand touched a numeral pounds each man weighed registered and the record spooled down into a correlative darkness now the city was fully awake now the vents sucked and blew air the tobacco odor from the invaders mouths the green soap scent from their hands even their eyeballs had a delicate odor the city detected it and this information formed totals which scurried down to total other totals the crystal windows glittered the ear tautened and skinned the drum of its hearing tight tighterall of the senses of the city swarming like a fall of unseen snow counting the respiration and the dim hidden heartbeats of the men listening watching tasting for the streets were like tongues and where the men passed the taste of their heels ebbed down through stone pores to be calculated on litmus this chemical totality so subtly collected was appended to the now increasing sums waiting the final calculation among the whirling wheels and whispering spokes footsteps running come back smith no blast you get him men footsteps rushing a final test the city having listened watched tasted felt weighed and balanced must perform a final task a trap flung wide in the street the captain unseen to the others running vanished hung by his feet a razor drawn across his throat another down his chest his carcass instantly emptied of its entrails exposed upon a table under the street in a hidden cell the captain died great crystal microscopes stared at the red twines of muscle bodiless fingers probed the still pulsing heart the flaps of his sliced skin were pinned to the table while hands shifted parts of his body like a quick and curious player of chess using the red pawns and the red pieces above on the street the men ran smith ran men shouted smith shouted and below in this curious room blood flowed into capsules was shaken spun shoved on smear slides under further microscopes counts made temperatures taken heart cut in seventeen sections liver and kidneys expertly halved brain was drilled and scooped from bone socket nerves pulled forth like the dead wires of a switchboard muscles plucked for elasticity while in the electric subterrene of the city the mind at last totaled out its grandest total and all of the machinery ground to a monstrous and momentary halt the total these are men these are men from a far world a certain planet and they have certain eyes certain ears and they walk upon legs in a specified way and carry weapons and think and fight and they have particular hearts and all such organs as are recorded from long ago above men ran down the street toward the rocket smith ran the total these are our enemies these arc the ones we have waited for twenty thousand years to see again these are the men upon whom we waited to visit revenge everything totals these are the men of a planet called earth who declared war upon taollan twenty thousand years ago who kept us in slavery and ruined us and destroyed us with a great disease then they went off to live in another galaxy to escape that disease which they visited upon us after ransacking our world they have forgotten that war and that time and they have forgotten us but we have not forgotten them these are our enemies this is certain our waiting is done smith come back quickly upon the red table with the spreadeagled captains body empty new hands began a fight of motion into the wet interior were placed organs of copper brass silver aluminum rubber and silk spiders spun gold web which was stung into the skin a heart was attached and into the skull case was fitted a platinum brain which hummed and fluttered small sparkles of blue fire and the wires led down through the body to the arms and legs in a moment the body was sewn tight the incisions waxed healed at neck and throat and about the skullperfect fresh new the captain sat up and flexed his arms stop on the street the captain reappeared raised his gun and fired smith fell a bullet in his heart the other men turned the captain ran to them that fool afraid of a city they looked at the body of smith at their feet they looked at their captain and their eyes widened and narrowed listen to me said the captain i have something important to tell you now the city which had weighed and tasted and smelled them which had used all its powers save one prepared to use its final ability the power of speech it did not speak with the rage and hostility of its massed walls or towers nor with the bulk of its cobbled avenues and fortresses of machinery it spoke with the quiet voice of one man i am no longer your captain he said nor am i a man the men moved back i am the city he said and smiled ive waited two hundred centuries he said ive waited for the sons of the sons of the sons to return captain sir let me continue who built me the city the men who died built me the old race who once lived here the people whom the earthmen left to die of a terrible disease a form of leprosy with no cure and the men of that old race dreaming of the day when earthmen might return built this city and the name of this city was and is revenge upon the planet of darkness near the shore of the sea of centuries by the mountains of the dead all very poetic this city was to be a balancing machine a litmus an antenna to test all future space travelers in twenty thousand years only two other rockets landed here one from a distant galaxy called ennt and the inhabitants of that craft were tested weighed found wanting and let free unscathed from the city as were the visitors in the second ship but today at long last youve come the revenge will be carried out to the last detail those men have been dead two hundred centuries but they left a city here to welcome you captain sir youre not feeling well perhaps youd better come back to the ship sir the city trembled the pavements opened and the men fell screaming falling they saw bright razors flash to meet them time passed soon came the call smith here jensen here jones hutchinson springer here here here they stood by the door of the rocket we return to earth immediately yes sir the incisions on their necks were invisible as were their hidden brass hearts and silver organs and the fine golden wire of their nerves there was a faint electric hum from their heads on the double nine men hurried the golden bombs of disease culture into the rocket these are to be dropped on earth right sir the rocket valve slammed the rocket jumped into the sky as the thunder faded the city lay upon the summer meadow its glass eyes were dulled over the ear relaxed the great nostril vents stopped the streets no longer weighed or balanced and the hidden machinery paused in its bath of oil in the sky the rocket dwindled slowly pleasurably the city enjoyed the luxury of dying zero hour oh it was to be so jolly what a game such excitement they hadnt known in years the children catapulted this way and that across the green lawns shouting at each other holding hands flying in circles climbing trees laughing overhead the rockets flew and beetle cars whispered by on the streets but the children played on such fun such tremulous joy such tumbling and hearty screaming mink ran into the house all dirt and sweat for her seven years she was loud and strong and definite her mother mrs morris hardly saw her as she yanked out drawers and rattled pans and tools into a large sack heavens mink whats going on the most exciting game ever gasped mink pinkfaced stop and get your breath said the mother no im all right gasped mink okay i take these things mom but dont dent them said mrs morris thank you thank you cried mink and boom she was gone like a rocket mrs morris surveyed the fleeing tot whats the name of the game invasion said mink the door slammed in every yard on the street children brought out knives and forks and pokers and old stovepipes and can openers it was an interesting fact that this fury and bustle occurred only among the younger children the older ones those ten years and more disdained the affair and marched scornfully off on hikes or played a more dignified version of hideandseek on their own meanwhile parents came and went in chromium beetles repairmen came to repair the vacuum elevators in houses to fix fluttering television sets or hammer upon stubborn fooddelivery tubes the adult civilization passed and repassed the busy youngsters jealous of the fierce energy of the wild tots tolerantly amused at their flourishings longing to join in themselves this and this and this said mink instructing the others with their assorted spoons and wrenches do that and bring that over here no here ninny right now get back while i fix this tongue in teeth face wrinkled in thought like that see yayyyy shouted the kids twelveyearold joseph connors ran up go away said mink straight at him i wanna play said joseph cant said mink why not youd just make fun of us honest i wouldnt no we know you go away or well kick you another twelveyearold boy whirred by on little motor skates hey joe come on let them sissies play joseph showed reluctance and a certain wistfulness i want to play he said youre old said mink firmly not that old said joe sensibly youd only laugh and spoil the invasion the boy on the motor skates made a rude lip noise come on joe them and their fairies nuts joseph walked off slowly he kept looking back all down the block mink was already busy again she made a kind of apparatus with her gathered equipment she had appointed another little girl with a pad and pencil to take down notes in painful slow scribbles their voices rose and fell in the warm sunlight all around them the city hummed the streets were lined with good green and peaceful trees only the wind made a conflict across the city across the country across the continent in a thousand other cities there were trees and children and avenues businessmen in their quiet offices taping their voices or watching televisors rockets hovered like darning needles in the blue sky there was the universal quiet conceit and easiness of men accustomed to peace quite certain there would never he trouble again arm in arm men all over earth were a united front the perfect weapons were held in equal trust by all nations a situation of incredibly beautiful balance had been brought about there were no traitors among men no unhappy ones no disgruntled ones therefore the world was based upon a stable ground sunlight illumined half the world and the trees drowsed in a tide of warm air minks mother from her upstairs window gazed down the children she looked upon them and shook her head well theyd eat well sleep well and be in school on monday bless their vigorous little bodies she listened mink talked earnestly to someone near the rose bushthough there was no one there these odd children and the little girl what was her name anna anna took notes on a pad first mink asked the rosebush a question then called the answer to anna triangle said mink whats a tri said anna with difficulty angle never mind said mink how you spell it asked anna tri spelled mink slowly then snapped oh spell it yourself she went on to other words beam she said i havent got tri said anna angle down yet well hurry hurry cried mink minks mother leaned out the upstairs window ange she spelled down at anna oh thanks mrs morris said anna certainly said minks mother and withdrew laughing to dust the hail with an electroduster magnet the voices wavered on the shimmery air beam said anna fading fourninesevenaandbandx said mink far away seriously and a fork and a string and ahexhexagonyhexagonal at lunch mink gulped milk at one toss and was at the door her mother slapped the table you sit right back down commanded mrs morris hot soup in a minute she poked a red button on the kitchen butler and ten seconds later something landed with a bump in the rubber receiver mrs morris opened it took out a can with a pair of aluminum holders unsealed it with a flick and poured hot soup into a bowl during all this mink fidgeted hurry mom this is a matter of life and death aw i was the same way at your age always life and death i know mink banged away at the soup slow down said mom cant said mink drills waiting for me whos drill what a peculiar name said mom you dont know him said mink a new boy in the neighborhood asked mom hes new all right said mink she started on her second bowl which one is drill asked mom hes

drill said and they couldnt figure a way to surprise earth or get help no wonder were pretty darn strong mom laughed cleaning up mink sat there staring at the table seeing what she was talking about until one day whispered mink melodramatically they thought of children well said mrs morris brightly and they thought of how grownups are so busy they never look under rosebushes or on lawns only for snails and fungus and then theres something about dimdims dimdims dimensshuns dimensions four of em and theres something about kids under nine and imagination its real funny to hear drill talk mrs morris was tired well it must be funny youre keeping drill waiting now its getting late in the day and if you want to have your invasion before your supper bath youd better jump do i have to take a

thanks for lunch mink ran out then stuck her head back in mom ill be sure you wont be hurt much really well thanks said mom slam went the door at four oclock the audiovisor buzzed mrs morris flipped the tab hello helen she said in welcome hello mary how are thinks in new york fine how are things in scranton you look tired so do you the children underfoot said helen mrs morris sighed my mink too

too didnt know it had got as far as new york word of mouth i imagine looks like a scrap drive i talked to josephine and she said her kidsthats in bostonare wild on this new game its sweeping the

flung the yoyo down its string reaching the end it it vanished see said mink ope dibbling her finger she made the yoyo reappear and zip up the string do that again said her mother cant zero hours five

it finally it wouldnt work youre not impressionable said mrs morris what never mind something i thought of can i help you helen i wanted to get that blackandwhite cake recipe the hour drowsed by the day waned the sun lowered in the peaceful blue sky shadows lengthened on the green lawns the laughter and excitement continued one little girl ran away crying mrs morris came out the front door mink was that peggy ann crying mink was bent over in the yard near the rosebush yeah shes a scarebaby we wont let her play now shes getting too old to play i guess she grew up all of a sudden is that why she cried nonsense give me a civil answer young lady or inside you come mink whirled in consternation mixed with irritation i cant quit now its almost time ill be good im sorry did you hit peggy ann no honest you ask her it was somethingwell shes just a scaredy pants the ring of children drew in around mink where she scowled at her work with spoons and a kind of squareshaped arrangement of hammers and pipes there and there murmured mink whats wrong said mrs morris drills stuck halfway if we could only get him all the way through itd be easier then all the others could come through after him can i help nom thanks ill fix it all right ill call you for your bath in half an hour im tired of watching you she went in and sat in the electric relaxing chair sipping a little beer from a halfempty glass the chair massaged her back children children children and love and hate side by side sometimes children loved you hated youall in half a second strange children did they ever forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh strict words of command she wondered how can you ever forget or forgive those over and above you those tall and silly dictators time passed a curious waiting silence came upon the street deepening five oclock a clock sang softly somewhere in the house in a quiet musical voice five oclockfive oclock times awasting five oclock and purred away into silence zero hour mrs morris chuckled in her throat zero hour a beetle car hummed into the driveway mr morris mrs morris smiled mr morris got out of the beetle locked it and called hello to mink at her work mink ignored him he laughed and stood for a moment watching the children then he walked up the front steps hello darling hello henry she strained forward on the edge of the chair listening the children were silent too silent he emptied his pipe refilled it swell day makes you glad to be alive buzz whats that asked henry i dont know she got up suddenly her eyes widening she was going to say something she stopped it ridiculous her nerves jumped those children havent anything dangerous out there have they she said nothing but pipes and hammers why nothing electrical heck no said henry i looked she walked to the kitchen the buzzing continued just the same youd better go tell them to quit its after five tell them her eyes widened and narrowed tell them to put off their invasion until tomorrow she laughed nervously the buzzing grew louder what are they up to id better go look all right the explosion the house shook with dull sound there were other explosions in other yards on other streets involuntarily mrs morris screamed up this way she cried senselessly knowing no sense no reason perhaps she saw something from the corners of her eyes perhaps she smelled a new odor or heard a new noise there was no time to argue with henry to convince him let him think her insane yes insane shrieking she ran upstairs he ran after her to see what she was up to in the attic she screamed thats where it is it was only a poor excuse to get him in the attic in time oh godin time another explosion outside the children screamed with delight as if at a great fireworks display its not in the attic cried henry its outside no no wheezing gasping she fumbled at the attic door ill show you hurry ill show you they tumbled into the attic she slammed the door locked it took the key threw it into a far cluttered corner she was babbling wild stuff now it came out of her all the subconscious suspicion and fear that had gathered secretly all afternoon and fermented like a wine in her all the little revelations and knowledges and sense that had bothered her all day and which she had logically and carefully and sensibly rejected and censored now it exploded in her and shook her to bits there there she said sobbing against the door were safe until tonight maybe we can sneak out maybe we can escape henry blew up too but for another reason are you crazy whyd you throw that key away damn it honey yes yes im crazy if it helps but stay here with me i dont know how in hell i can get out quiet theyll hear us oh god theyll find us soon enough below them minks voice the husband stopped there was a great universal humming and sizzling a screaming and giggling downstairs the audiotelevisor buzzed and buzzed insistently alarmingly violently is that helen calling thought mrs morris and is she calling about what i think shes calling about footsteps came into the house heavy footsteps whos coming in my house demanded henry angrily whos tramping around down there heavy feet twenty thirty forty fifty of them fifty persons crowding into the house the humming the giggling of the children this way cried mink below whos downstairs roared henry whos there hush oh nononononono said his wife weakly holding him please be quiet they might go away mom called mink dad a pause where are you heavy footsteps heavy heavy very heavy footsteps came up the stairs mink leading them mom a hesitation dad a waiting a silence humming footsteps toward the attic minks first they trembled together in silence in the attic mr and mrs morris for some reason the electric humming the queer cold light suddenly visible under the door crack the strange odor and the alien sound of eagerness in minks voice finally got through to henry morris too he stood shivering in the dark silence his wife beside him mom dad footsteps a little humming sound the attic lock melted the door opened mink peered inside tall blue shadows behind her peekaboo said mink the rocket many nights fiorello bodoni would awaken to hear the rockets sighing in the dark sky he would tiptoe from bed certain that his kind wife was dreaming to let himself out into the night air for a few moments he would be free of the smells of old food in the small house by the river for a silent moment he would let his heart soar alone into space following the rockets now this very night he stood half naked in the darkness watching the fire fountains murmuring in the air the rockets on their long wild way to mars and saturn and venus well well bodoni bodoni started on a milk crate by the silent river sat an old man who also watched the rockets through the midnight hush oh its you bramante do you come out every night bodoni only for the air so i prefer the rockets myself said old bramante i was a boy when they started eighty years ago and ive never been on one yet i will ride up in one someday said bodoni fool cried bramante youll never go this is a rich mans world he shook his gray head remembering when i was young they wrote it in fiery letters the world of the future science comfort and new things for all ha eighty years the future becomes now do we fly rockets no we live in shacks like our ancestors before us perhaps my sons said bodoni no nor their sons the old man shouted its the rich who have dreams and rockets bodoni hesitated old man ive saved three thousand dollars it took me six years to save it for my business to invest in machinery but every night for a month now ive been awake i hear the rockets i think and tonight ive made up my mind one of us will fly to mars his eyes were shining and dark idiot snapped bramante how will you choose who will go if you go your wife will hate you for you will be just a bit nearer god in space when you tell your amazing trip to her over the years wont bitterness gnaw at her no no yes and your children will their lives be filled with the memory of papa who flew to mars while they stayed here what a senseless task you will set your boys they will think of the rocket all their lives they will lie awake they will be sick with wanting it just as you are sick now they will want to die if they cannot go dont set that goal i warn you let them be content with being poor turn their eyes down to their hands and to your junk yard not up to the stars but suppose your wife went how would you feel knowing she had seen and you had not she would become holy you would think of throwing her in the river no bodoni buy a new wrecking machine which you need and pull your dreams apart with it and smash them to pieces the old man subsided gazing at the river in which drowned images of rockets burned down the sky good night said bodoni sleep well said the other when the toast jumped from its silver box bodoni almost screamed the night had been sleepless among his nervous children beside his mountainous wife bodoni had twisted and stared at nothing bramante was right better to invest the money why save it when only one of the family could ride the rocket while the others remained to melt in frustration fiorello eat your toast said his wife maria my throat is shriveled said bodoni the children rushed in the three boys fighting over a toy rocket the two girls carrying dolls which duplicated the inhabitants of mars venus and neptune green mannequins with three yellow eyes and twelvc fingers i saw the venus rocket cried paolo it took off whoosh hissed antonello children shouted bodoni hands to his ears they stared at him he seldom shouted bodoni arose listen all of you he said i have enough money to take one of us on the mars rocket everyone yelled you understand he asked only one of us who me me me cried the children you said maria you said bodoni to her they all fell silent the children reconsidered let lorenzo gohes oldest let miriamne goshes a girl think what you would see said bodonis wife to him but her eyes were strange her voice shook the meteors like fish the universe the moon someone should go who could tell it well on returning you have a way with words nonsense so have you he objected everyone trembled here said bodoni unhappily from a broom he broke straws of various lengths the short straw wins he held out his tight fist choose solemnly each took his turn long straw long straw another long straw the children finished the room was quiet two straws remained bodoni felt his heart ache in him now he whispered maria she drew the short straw she said ah sighed lorenzo half happy half sad mama goes to mars bodoni tried to smile congratulations i will buy your ticket today wait fiorello you can leave next week he murmured she saw the sad eyes of her children upon her with the smiles beneath their straight large noses she returned the straw slowly to her husband i cannot go to mars but why not i will be busy with another child what she would not look at him it wouldnt do for me to travel in my condition he took her elbow is this the truth draw again start over why didnt you tell me before he said incredulously i didnt remember maria maria he whispered patting her face he turned to the children draw again paolo immediately drew the short straw i go to mars he danced wildly thank you father the other children edged away thats swell paolo paolo stopped smiling to examine his parents and his brothers and sisters i can go cant i he asked uncertainly yes and youll like me when i come back of course paclo studied the precious broomstraw on his trembling hand and shook his head he threw it away i forgot school starts i cant go draw again but none would draw a full sadness lay on them none of us will go said lorenzo thats best said maria bramante was right said bodoni with his breakfast curdled within him fiorello bodoni worked in his junk yard ripping metal melting it pouring out usable ingots his equipment flaked apart competition had kept him on the insane edge of poverty for twenty years it was a very bad morning in the afternoon a man entered the junk yard and called up to bodoni on his wrecking machine hey bodoni i got some metal for you what is it mr mathews asked bodoni listlessly a rocket ship whats wrong dont you want it yes yes he seized the mans arm and stopped bewildered of course said mathews its only a mockup you know when they plan a rocket they build a fullscale model first of aluminum you might make a small profit boiling her down let you have her for two thousand bodoni dropped his hand i havent the money sorry thought id help you last time we talked you said how everyone outbid you on junk thought id slip this to you on the qt well i need new equipment i saved money for that i understand if i bought your rocket i wouldnt even be able to melt it down my aluminum furnace broke down last week sure i couldnt possibly use the rocket if i bought it from you i know bodoni blinked and shut his eyes he opened them and looked at mr mathews but i am a great fool i will take my money from the bank and give it to you but if you cant melt the rocket down deliver it said bodoni all right if you say so tonight tonight said bodoni would be fine yes i would like to have a rocket ship tonight there was a moon the rocket was white and big in the junk yard it held the whiteness of the moon and the blueness of the stars bodoni looked at it and loved all of it he wanted to pet it and lie against it pressing it with his cheek telling it all the secret wants of his heart he stared up at it you are all mine he said even if you never move or spit fire and just sit there and rust for fifty years you are mine the rocket smelled of time and distance it was like walking into a clock it was finished with swiss delicacy one might wear it on ones watch fob i might even sleep here tonight bodoni whispered excitedly he sat in the pilots seat he touched a lever he hummed in his shut mouth his eyes closed the humming grew louder louder higher higher wilder stranger more exhilarating trembling in him and leaning him forward and pulling him and the ship in a roaring silence and in a kind of metal screaming while his fists flew over the controls and his shut eyes quivered and the sound grew and grew until it was a fire a strength a lifting and a pushing of power that threatened to tear him in half he gasped he hummed again and again and did not stop for it could not be stopped it could only go on his eyes tighter his heart furious taking off he screamed the jolting concussion the thunder the moon he cried eyes blind tight the meteors the silent rush in volcanic light mars oh god mars mars he fell back exhausted and panting his shaking hands came loose of the controls and his head tilted back wildly he sat for a long time breathing out and in his heart slowing slowly slowly he opened his eyes the junk yard was still there he sat motionless he looked at the heaped piles of metal for a minute his eyes never leaving them then leaping up he kicked the levers take off damn you the ship was silent ill show you he cried out in the night air stumbling he started the fierce motor of his terrible wrecking machine and advanced upon the rocket he maneuvered the massive weights into the moonlit sky he readied his trembling hands to plunge the weights to smash to rip apart this insolently false dream this silly thing for which he had paid his money which would not move which would not do his bidding ill teach you he shouted but his hand stayed the silver rocket lay in the light of the moon and beyond the rocket stood the yellow lights of his home a block away burning warmly he heard the family radio playing some distant music he sat for half an hour considering the rocket and the house lights and his eyes narrowed and grew wide he stepped down from the wrecking machine and began to walk and as he walked he began to laugh and when he reached the back door of his house he took a deep breath and called maria maria start packing were going to mars oh ah i cant believe it you will you will the children balanced in the windy yard under the glowing rocket not touching it yet they started to cry maria looked at her husband what have you done she said taken our money for this it will never fly it will fly he said looking at it rocket ships cost millions have you millions it will fly he repeated steadily now go to the house all of you i have phone calls to make work to do tomorrow we leave tell no one understand it is a secret the children edged off from the rocket stumbling he saw their small feverish faces in the house windows far away maria had not moved you have ruined us she said our money used for thisthis thing when it should have been spent on equipment you will see he said without a word she turned away god help me he whispered and started to work through the midnight hours trucks arrived packages were delivered and bodoni smiling exhausted his bank account with blowtorch and metal stripping he assaulted the rocket added took away worked fiery magics and secret insults upon it he bolted nine ancient automobile motors into the rockets empty engine room then he welded the engine room shut so none could see his hidden labor at dawn he entered the kitchen maria he said im ready for breakfast she would not speak to him at sunset he called to the children were ready come on the house was silent ive locked them in the closet said maria what do you mean he demanded youll be killed in that rocket she said what kind of rocket can you buy for two thousand dollars a bad one listen to me maria it will blow up anyway you are no pilot nevertheless i can fly this ship i have fixed it you have gone mad she said where is the key to the closet i have it here he put out his hand give it to me she handed it to him you will kill them no no yes you will i feel it he stood before her you wont come along ill stay here she said you will understand you will see then he said and smiled he unlocked the closet come children follow your father goodby goodby mama she stayed in the kitchen window looking out at them very straight and silent at the door of the rocket the father said children we will be gone a week you must come back to school and i to my business he took each of their hands in turn listen this rocket is very old and will fly only one more journey it will not fly again this will be the one trip of your life keep your eyes wide yes papa listen keep your ears clean smell the smells of a rocket feel remember so when you return you will talk of it all the rest of your lives yes papa the ship was quiet as a stopped clock the airlock hissed shut behind them he strapped them all like tiny mummies into rubber hammocks ready he called ready all replied takeoff he jerked ten switches the rocket thundered and leaped the children danced in their hammocks screaming here comes the moon the moon dreamed by meteors broke into fireworks time flowed away in a serpentine of gas the children shouted released from their hammocks hours later they peered from the ports theres earth theres mars the rocket dropped pink petals of fire while the hour dials spun the child eyes dropped shut at last they hung like drunken moths in their cocoon hammocks good whispered bodoni alone he tiptoed from the control room to stand for a long moment fearful at the airlock door he pressed a button the airlock door swung wide he stepped out into space into inky tides of meteor and gaseous torch into swift mileages and infinite dimensions no bodoni smiled all about the quivering rocket lay the junk yard rusting unchanged there stood the padlocked junkyard gate the little silent house by the river the kitchen window lighted and the river going down to the same sea and in the center of the junk yard manufacturing a magic dream lay the quivering purring rocket shaking and roaring bouncing the netted children like flies in a web maria stood in the kitchen window he waved to her and smiled he could not see if she waved or not a small wave perhaps a small smile the sun was rising bodoni withdrew hastily into the rocket silence all still slept he breathed easily tying himself into a hammock he closed his eyes to himself he prayed oh let nothing happen to the illusion in the next six days let all of space come and go and red mars come up under our ship and the moons of mars and let there be no flaws in the color film let there be three dimensions let nothing go wrong with the hidden mirrors and screens that mold the fine illusion let time pass without crisis he awoke red mars floated near the rocket papa the children thrashed to be free bodoni looked and saw red mars and it was good and there was no flaw in it and he was very happy at sunset on the seventh day the rocket stopped shuddering we are home said bodoni they walked across the junk yard from the open door of the rocket their blood singing their faces glowing i have ham and eggs for all of you said maria at the kitchen door mama mama you should have come to see it to see mars mama and meteors and everything yes she said at bedtime the children gathered before bodoni we want to thank you papa it was nothing we will remember it for always papa we will never forget very late in the night bodoni opened his eyes he sensed that his wife was lying beside him watching him she did not move for a very long time and then suddenly she kissed his cheeks and his forehead whats this he cried youre the best father in the world she whispered why now i see she said i understand she lay back and closed her eyes holding his hand is it a very lovely journey she asked yes he said perhaps she said perhaps some night you might take me on just a little trip do you think just a little one perhaps he said thank you she said good night good night said fiorello bodoni epilogue it was almost midnight the moon was high in the sky now the illustrated man lay motionless i had seen what there was to see the stories were told they were over and done there remained only that empty space upon the illustrated mans back that area of jumbled colors and shapes now as i watched the vague patch began to assemble itself in slow dissolvings from one shape to another and still another and at last a face formed itself there a face that gazed out at me from the colored flesh a face with a familiar nose and mouth familiar eyes it was very hazy i saw only enough of the illustration to make me leap up i stood therein the moonlight afraid that the wind or the stars might move and wake the monstrous gallery at my feet but he slept on quietly the picture on his back showed the illustrated man himself with his fingers about my neck choking me to death i didnt wait for it to become clear and sharp and a definite picture i ran down the road in the moonlight i didnt look back a small town lay ahead dark and asleep i knew that long before morning i would reach the town
