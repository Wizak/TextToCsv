famous five five go to smugglers top blyton enid chapter one back to kirrin cottage one fine day right at the beginning of the easter holidays four childien and a dog travelled by train together soon be there now said julian a tall strong boy with a determined face woof said timothy the dog getting excited and trying to look out of the window too get down tim said julian let anne have a look anne was his young sister she put her head out of the window were coming into kirrin station she said t do hope aunt fanny will be there to meet us of course she will said georgina her cousin she looked more like a boy than a girl for she wore her hair very short and it curled close about her head she too had a determined face like julian she pushed anne away and looked out of the window its nice to be going home she said i love school but it will be fun to be at kirrin cottage and perhaps sail out to kirrin island and visit the castle there we havent been since last summer dicks turn to look out now said julian turning to his younger brother a boy with a pleasant face sitting reading in a corner were just coming into sight of kirrin dick cant you stop reading for a second its such an exciting book said dick and shut it with a clap the most exciting adventure story ive ever read pooh i bet its not as exciting as some of the adventures weve had said anne at once it was quite true that the five of them counting in timmy the dog who always shared everything with them had had the most amazing adventures together but now it looked as if they were going to have nice quiet holidays going for long walks over the cliffs and perhaps sailing out in georges boat to their island of kirrin ive worked jolly hard at school this term said julian i could do with a holiday youve gone thin said georgina nobody called her that they all called her george she would never answer to any other name julian grinned well ill soon get fat at kirrin cottage dont you worry aunt fanny will see to that shes a great one for trying to fatten people up it will be nice to see your mother again george shes an awfully good sort yes i hope father will be in a good temper these holls said george he ought to be because he has just finished some new experiments mother says which have been quite successful georges father was a scientist always working out new ideas he liked to be quiet and sometimes he flew into a temper when he could not get the peace he needed or things did not go exactly as he wanted them to the children often thought that hottempered georgina was very like her father she too could fly into fierce tempers when things did not go right for her aunt fanny was there to meet them the four children jumped out on the platform and rushed to hug her george got there first she was very fond of her gentle mother who had so often tried to shield her when her father got angry with her timmy pranced round barking in delight he adored georges mother she patted him and he tried to stand up and lick her face timmys bigger than ever she said laughing down old boy youll knock rne over timmy was certainly a big dog all the children loved him for he was loyal loving and faithful his brown eyes looked from one to the other enjoying the childrens excitement timmy shared in it as he shared in everything but the person he loved most of course was his mistress george she had had him since he was a small puppy she took him to school with her each term for she and anne went to a boardingschool that allowed pets otherwise george would most certainly have refused to go they set off to kirrin in the ponytrap it was very windy and cold and the children shivered and pulled their coats tightly round them its awfully cold said anne her teeth beginning to chatter colder than in the winter its the wind said her aunt and tucked a rug round her its been getting very strong the last day or two the fishermen have pulled their boats high up the beach for fear of a big storm the children saw the boats pulled right up as they passed the beach where they had bathed so often they did not feel like bathing now it made them shiver even to think of it the wind howled over the sea great scudding clouds raced overhead the waves pounded on the beach and made a terrific noise it excited timmy who began to bark be quiet tim said george patting him you will have to learn to be a good quiet dog now we are home again or father will be cross with you is father very busy mother very said her mother but hes going to do very little work now you aie coming home would like to go for walks with you or go out in the boat if the weather calms down the children looked at one another uncle quentin was not the best of companions he had no sense oi humour and when the children went off into fits of laughter as they did twenty times a day or moie he could not see the joke at all it looks as if these holls wont be quite so jolly if uncle quentin parks himself on us most of the time said dick in a low voice to julian sh said julian afraid that his aunt would hear and be hurt george frowned oh mother father will be bored stiff if he comes with us and well be bored too george was very outspoken and could never learn to keep a guard on her tongue her mother sighed dont talk like that dear i daresay your father will get tired of going with you after a bit but it does him good to have a bit of young life about him here we are said julian as the trap stopped outside an old house kirrin cottage my word how the wind is howling round it aunt fanny yes it made a terrible noise last night said his aunt you take the trap round to the back julian when weve got the things out oh heies your uncle to help uncle quentin came out a tall cleverlooking man with rather frowning eyebrows he smiled at the children and kissed george and anne welcome to kirrin cottage he said im quite glad your mother and father are away anne because now we shall have you all here once again soon they were sitting round the table eating a big tea aunt fanny always got ready a fine meal for their first one for she knew they were very hungry after their long journey in the train even george was satisfied at last and leaned back in her chair wishing she could manage just one more of her mothers delicious newmade buns timmy sat close to her he was not supposed to be fed at mealtimes but it was really surprising how many titbits found their way to him under the table the wind howled round the house the windows rattled the doors shook and the mats lifted themselves up and down as the draught got under them they look as if theyve got snakes wriggling underneath them said anne timmy watched them and growled he was a clever dog but he did not know why the mats wriggled in such a queer way i hope the wind will die down tonight said aunt fanny it kept me awake last night julian dear you look rather thin have you been working hard i must fatten you up the children laughed just what we thought youd say mother said george goodness whats that they all sat still startled there was a loud bumping noise on the roof and timmy put up his ears and growled fiercely a tile off the roof said uncle quentin how tiresome we shall have to get the loose tiles seen to fanny when the storm is over or the rain will come in the children rather hoped that their uncle would retire to his study after tea as he usually did but this time he didnt they wanted to play a game but it wasnt much good with uncle quentin there he really wasnt any good at all not even at such a simple game as snap do you know a boy called pierre lenoirj suddenly asked uncle quentin taking a letter from his pocket i believe he goes to your school and dicks julian pierre lenoir oh you mean old sooty said julian yes hes in dicks form sir mad as a hatter sooty now why do you call him that said uncle quentin it seems a silly name for a boy if you saw him you wouldnt think so said dick with a laugh hes awfully dark hair as black as soot eyes like bits of coal eyebrows that look as if theyve been put in with charcoal and his name means the black one doesnt it lenoir thats french for black yes quite true but what a name to give anyone sooty said uncle quentin well ive been having quite a lot of correspondence with this boys father he and i are interested in the same scientific matters in fact ive asked him whether he wouldnt like to come and stay with me a few days and bring his boy pierre oh really said dick looking quite pleased well it wouldnt be bad sport to have old sooty here uncle but hes quite mad he never does as hes told he climbs like a monkey and he can be awfully cheeky i dont know if youd like him much uncle quentin looked sorry he had asked sooty after he had heard what dick had to say he didnt like cheeky boys nor did he like mad ones hm he said putting the letter away i wish id asked you about the boy first before suggesting to his father that he might bring him with him but perhaps i can prevent him coming no dont father said george who rather likecl the sound of sooty lenoir lets have him he could come out with us and liven things up well see said her father who had already made up his mind on no account to have the boy at kirrin cottage if he was mad climbed everywhere and was cheeky george was enough of a handful without a madcap of a boy egging her on much to the childrens relief uncle quentin retired to read by himself about eight oclock aunt fanny looked at the clock time for anne to go to bed she said and you too george just one good game of slapdown patience all of us playing it together mother said george come on you play it too its our first evening at home anyway i shant sleep for ages with this gale howling round come on mother one good game then well go to bed julians been yawning like anything already chapter two a shock in the night it was nice to climb up the steep stairs to their familiar bedrooms that night all the children were yawning widely their long train journey had tired them if only this awful wind would stop said anne pulling the curtain aside and looking out into the night theres a little moon george it keeps bobbing out between the scurrying clouds let it bob said george scrambling into bed im jolly cold hurry anne or youll catch a chill at that window dont the waves make a noise said anne still at the window and the gale in the old ashtree is making a whistling howling sound and bending it right over timmy hurry up and get on my bed commanded george screwing up her cold toes thats one good thing about being at home anne i can have timmy on my bed hes far better than a hot water bottle youre not supposed to have him on your bed at home any more than youre supposed to at school said anne curling up in bed aunt fanny thinks he sleeps in his basket over there well i cant stop him coming on my bed at night can i if he doesnt want to sleep in his basket said george thats right timmy darling make my feet warm wheres your nose let me pat it goodnight tim goodnight anne goodnight said anne sleepily i hope that sooty boy comes dont you he does sound fun yes and anyway father would stay in with mr lenoir the boys father and not come out with us said george father doesnt mean to but he does spoil things somehow hes not very good at laughing said anne hes too serious a loud bang made both girls jump thats the bathroom door said george with a groan one of the boys must have left it open thats the sort of noise that drives father mad there it goes again well let julian or dick shut it said anne who was now beginning to feel nice and warm but julian and dick were thinking that george or anne might shut it so nobody got out of bed to see to the banging door very soon uncle quentins voice roared up the stairs louder than the gale shut that door one of you how can i work with that noise going on all four children jumped out of bed like a shot timmy leapt off georges bed everyone fell over him as they rushed to the bathroom door there was a lot of giggling and scuffling then uncle quentins footsteps were heard on the stairs and the five fled silently to their looms the gale still roared uncle quentin and aunt fanny came up to bed the bedroom door flew out of uncle quentins hand and slammed itself shut so violently that a vase leapt off a nearby shelf uncle quentin leapt too startled this wretched gale he said fiercely never known one like it all the time weve been here if it gets much worse the fishermens boats will be smashed up even though theyve pulled them as high up the beach as possible it will blow itself out soon dear said aunt fanny soothingly probably by the time morning comes it will be quite calm but she was wrong the gale did not blow itself out that night instead it raged round the house even more fiercely shrieking and howling like a live thing nobody could sleep timmy kept up a continuous low growling for he did not like the shakes and rattles and howls towards dawn the wind seemed in a fury anne thought it sounded as if it was in a horrible temper out to do all the harm it could she lay and trembled halffrightened suddenly there was a strange noise it was a loud and woeful groaning and creaking like someone in great pain the two girls sat up terrified what could it be the boys heard it too julian leapt out of bed and ran to the window outside stood the old ash tree tall and black in the fitful moonlight it was gradually bending over its the ash its falling yelled julian almost startling dick out of his wits its falling i tell you itll crash on the house quick warn the girls shouting at the top of his voice julian raced out of his door on to the landing uncle aunt george and anne come downstairs quickly the ash tree is falling george jumped out of bed snatched at her dressinggown and raced to the door yelling to anne the little girl was soon with her timmy ran in front at the door of aunt fannys bedroom uncle quentin appeared tall and amazed wrapping his dressinggown round him whats all this noise julian whats happening aunt fanny come downstairs the ash tree is falling listen to its terrible groans and creaks yelled julian almost beside himself with impatience itll smash in the room and the bedrooms listen here it comes everyone fled downstairs as with an appalling wail the great ash tree hauled up its roots and fell heavily on to kirrin cottage there was a terrible crash and the sound of tiles slipping to the ground everywhere oh dear said poor aunt fanny covering her eyes i knew something would happen quentin we ought to have had that ash tree topped i knew it would fall in a great gale like this what has it done to the roof after the great crash there had come other smaller noises sounds of things falling thuds and little smashing noises the children could not imagine what was happening timmy was thoroughly angry and barked loudly uncle quentin slapped his hand angrily on the table and made everyone jump stop that dog barking ill turn him out but nothing would stop timmy barking or growling that night and george at last pushed him into the warm kitchen and shut the door on him i feel like barking or growling myself said anne who knew exactly what timmy felt like julian has the tree broken in the roof uncle quentin took a powerful torch and went carefully up the stairs to the landing to see what damage had been done he came down looking rather pale the tree has crashed through the attic smashed the roof in and wrecked the girls bedroom he said a big branch has penetrated the boys room too but not badly but the girls room is ruined they would have been killed if they had been in their beds everyone was silent it was an awful thought that george and anne had had such a narrow escape good thing i yelled my head off to warn them then said julian cheerfully seeing how white anne had gone cheer up anne think what a tale youll have to tell at school next term i think some hot cocoa would do us all good said aunt fanny pulling herself together though she felt very shaken ill go and make some quentin see if the fire is still alight in your study we want a little warmth the fire was still alight everyone crowded round it they welcomed aunt fanny when she came in with some steaming milkcocoa anne looked curiously round the room as she sat sipping her drink this was where her uncle did his work his very clever work he wrote his difficult books here books which anne could not understand at all he drew his queer diagrams here and made many strange experiments but just at the moment uncle quentin did not look very clever he looked rather ashamed somehow anne soon knew why quentin it is a mercy none of us was hurt or killed said aunt fanny looking at him rather sternly i told you a dozen times you should get that ash tree topped i knew it was too big and heavy to withstand a great gale i was always afraid it would blow down on the house yes i know my dear said uncle quentin stirring his cup of cocoa very vigorously but i was so busy these last months you always make that an excuse for not doing urgent things said aunt fanny with a sigh i shall have to manage things myself in the future i cant risk our lives like this well a thing like this would only happen once in a blue moon cried uncle quentin getting angry then he calmed down seeing that aunt fanny was really shocked and upset very near to tears he put down his cocoa and slipped his arm round her youve had a terrible shock he said dont you worry about things maybe they wont be so bad when morning comes oh quentin theyll be much worse said his wife where shall we sleep tonight all of us and what shall we do till the roof and upstairs rooms are repaired the children have only just come home the house will be full of workmen for weeks i dont know how im going to manage leave it all to me said uncle quentin ill settle everything dont you worry im sorry about this very sorry particularly as its my fault but ill straighten things out for everyone you just see aunt fanny didnt really believe him but she was grateful for his comforting the children listened in silence drinking their hot cocoa uncle quentin was so very clever and knew so many things but it was so like him to neglect something urgent like cutting off the top of the old ash tree sometimes he didnt seem to live in this world at all it was no use going up to bed the rooms upstairs were either completely ruined or so messed up with bits and pieces and clouds of dust that it was impossible to sleep there aunt fanny began to pile rugs on sofas there was one in the study a big one in the sittingroom and a smaller one in the diningroom she found a camp bed in a cupboard and with julians help put that up too well just have to do the best we can she said there isnt much left of the night but well get a little sleep if we can the gale is not nearly so wild now no its done all the damage it can so its satisfied said uncle quentin grimly well well talk things over in the morning the children found it very difficult to go to sleep after such an excitement tired though they were anne felt worried how could they all stay at kirrin cottage now it wouldnt be fair on aunt fanny but they couldnt go home because her father and mother were both away and the house was shut up for a month i hope we shant be sent back to school thought anne trying to get comfortable on the sofa it would be too awful after having left there and started off so gaily for the holidays george was afraid of that too she felt sure that they would all be packed back to their schools the next morning that would mean that she and anne wouldnt see julian and dick any more those holidays for the boys of course went to a different school timmy was the only one who didnt worry about things he lay on georges feet snoring a little quite happy so long as he was with george he didnt really mind where he went chapter three uncle quentin has an idea next morning the wind was still high but the fury of the gale was gone the fishermen on the beach were relieved to find that their boats had suffered very little damage but word soon went round about the accident to kirrm cottage and a few sightseers came up to marvel at the sight of the great uprooted tree lying heavily on the little house the children rather enjoyed the importance of relating how nearly they had escaped with their lives in the light of day it was surprising what damage the big tree had done it had cracked the roof of the house like an eggshell and the rooms upstairs were in a terrible mess the woman who came up from the village to help aunt fanny during the day exclaimed at the sight why mam itll take weeks to set that right she said have you got on to the builders mam id get them up here right away and let them see whats to be done im seeing to things mrs daly said uncle quentin my wife has had a great shock she is not fit to see to things herself the first thing to do is to decide what is to happen to the children they cant remain here while there are no usable bedrooms they had better go back to school poor things said aunt fanny no ive a better idea than that said uncle quentin fishing a letter out of his pocket much better ive had a letter from that fellow lenoir this morning you know the one whos interested in the same kind of experiments as i am he says er wait a minute ill read you the bit yes here it is uncle quentin read it out it is most kind of you to suggest my coming to stay with you and bringing my boy pierre allow me to extend hospitality to you and your children also i do not know how many you have but all are welcome here in this big house my pierre will be glad of company and so will his sister marybelle uncle quentin looked up triumphantly at his wife there you are i call that a most generous invitation it couldnt have come at a better time well pack the whole of the children off to this fellows house but quentin you cant possibly do that why we dont know anything about him or his family said aunt fanny his boy goes to the same school as julian and dick and i know lenoir is a remarkable clever fellow said uncle quentin as if that was all that really mattered ill telephone him now whats his number aunt fanny felt helpless in face of her husbands sudden determination to settle everything himself he was ashamed because it was his forgetfulness that had brought on the accident to the house now he was going to show that he could see to things if he liked she heard him telephoning and frowned how could they possibly send off the children to a strange place like that uncle quentin put down the receiver and went to find his wife looking jubilant and very pleased with himself its all settled he said lenoir is delighted most delighted says he loves children about the place and so does his wife and his two will be thrilled to have them if we can hire a car today they can go at once but quentin we cant let them go off like that to strange people theyll hate it i shouldnt be surprised if george refuses to go said his wife oh that reminds me shes not to take timothy said uncle quentin apparently lenoir doesnt like dogs well then you know george wont go said his wife thats foolish quentin george wont go anywhere without timmy shell have to this time said uncle quentin quite determined that george should not upset all his marvellous plans here are the children ill ask them what they feel about going and see what they say he called them into his study they came in feeling sure that they were to hear bad news probably they were all to return to school you remember that boy i spoke to you about last night began uncle quentin pierre lenoir you had some absurd name for him sooty said dick and julian together ah yes sooty well his father has kindly invited you all to go and stay with him at smugglers top said uncle quentin the children were astonished smugglers top said dick his fancy caught by the queer name whats smugglers top the name of his house said uncle quentin its very old built on the top of a queer hill surrounded by marshes over which the sea once flowed the hill was once an island but now its just a tall hill rising up from the marsh smuggling went on there in the old days its a very peculiar place so ive heard all this made the children feel excited also julian and dick had always liked sooty lenoir he was quite mad but awfully good fun they might have a firstrate time with him well would you like to go or would you rather go back to school for the holidays asked uncle quentin impatiently oh no not back to school said everyone at once id love to go to smugglers top said dick it sounds a thrilling place and i always liked old sooty especially since he sawed half through one of the legs of our formmasters chair it gave way at once when mr toms sat down hm i dont see that a trick like that is any reason for liking someone said uncle quentin beginning to feel a little doubtful about master lenoir perhaps on the whole school would be best for you oh no no cried everyone lets go to smugglers top do do lets very well said uncle quentin pleased at their eagerness to follow his plan as a matter of fact i have already settled it i telephoned a few minutes ago mr lenoir was very kind about it all can i take timmy asked george suddenly no said her father im afraid not mr lenoir doesnt like dogs then i shouldnt like him said george sulkily i wont go without timmy youll have to go back to school then said her father sharply and take off that sulky expression george you know how i dislike it but george wouldnt she turned away the others looked at her in dismay surely old george wasnt going to get into one of her moods and spoil everything it would be fun to go to smugglers top but of course it certainly wouldnt be so much fun without timmy still they couldnt all go back to school just because george wouldnt go anywhere without her dog they all went into the sittingroom anne put her arm through georges george shook it off george you simply must come with us said anne i cant bear to go without you it would be awful to see you going back to school all alone i shouldnt be all alone said george i should have timmy the others pressed her to change her mind but she shook them off leave me alone she said i want to think how are we supposed to get to smugglers top and where is it which road do we take were going by car and its right up the coast somewhere so i expect well take the coastroad said julian why george dont ask questions said george she went out with timmy the others didnt follow her george was not very nice when she was cross aunt fanny began to pack for them though it was impossible to get some of the things from the girls room after a time george came back but jimmy was not with her she looked more cheerful wheres tim asked anne at once out somewhere said george are you coming with us george asked julian looking at her yes ive made up my mind to said george but for some reason she wouldnt look julian in the eyes he wondered why aunt fanny gave them all an early lunch and then a big car came for them they packed themselves inside uncle quentin gave them all sorts of messages for mr lenoir and aunt fanny kissed them goodbye i do hope you have a nice time at smugglers top she said mind you write at once and tell me all about it arent we going to say goodbye to timmy said anne her eyes opening wide in amazement at george forgetting george surely youre not going without saying goodbye to old timmy cant stop now said uncle quentin afraid that george might suddenly become awkward again right driver you can go off now dont drive too fast please waving and shouting the children drove away from kirrin cottage sad when they looked back and saw the smashed roof under the fallen tree never mind they had not been sent back to school that was the main thing their spirits rose as they thought of sooty and his queerlynamed home smugglers top smugglers top it sounds too exciting for words said anne i can picture it an old house right on the top of a hill fancy being an island once i wonder why the sea went back and left marshes instead george said nothing for a while and the car speeded on the others glanced at her once or twice but came to the conclusion that she was grieving about timmy still she didnt look very sad the car went over a hill and speeded down to the bottom when they got there george leaned forward and touched the drivers arm would you stop a moment please we have to pick somebody up here julian dick and anne stared at george in surprise the driver also rather surprised drew the car to a standstill george opened the car door and gave a loud whistle something shot out of the hedge and hurled itself joyfully into the car it was timmy he licked everyone trod on everyones toes and gave the little short barks that showed he was excited and happy well said the driver doubtfully i dont know if youre supposed to take that dog in miss your father didnt say anything about him its all right said george her face red with joy quite all right you neednt worry start the car again please you are a monkey said julian halfannoyed with george and halfpleased because timmy was with them after all mr lenoir may send him back you know well hell have to send me back too said george defiantly anyhow the main thing is weve got timmy after all and i am coming with you yes thats fine said anne and gave first george and then timmy a hug i didnt like going without tim either on to smugglers top said dick as the car started off again on to smugglers top i wonder if we shall have any adventures there chapter four smugglers top the car sped on mostly along the coast though it sometimes went inland for a few miles but sooner or later it was in sight of the sea again the children enjoyed the long drive they were to stop somewhere for lunch and the driver told them he knew of a good inn at half past twelve he drew up outside an old inn and they all trooped in julian took charge and ordered lunch it was a very good one and all the children enjoyed it so did timmy the innkeeper liked dogs and put down such a piledup plate for timmy that the dog hardly liked to begin on his meal in case it was not for him he looked up at george and she nodded to him its your dinner timmy eat it up so he ate it hoping that if they were going to stay anywhere they might be staying at the inn meals like this did not arrive every day for a hungry dog but after lunch the children got up they went to find the driver who was having his lunch in the kitchen with the innkeeper and his wife they were old friends of his well i hear youre going to castaway said the innkeeper getting up you be careful there castaway said julian is that what the hill is called where smugglers top is thats its name said the innkeeper why is it called that said anne what a funny name were people cast away on it once when it was an island oh no the old story goes that the hill was once joined to the mainland said the innkeeper but it was the haunt of bad people and one of the saints became angry with the place and cast it away into the sea where it became an island and so it was called castaway said dick but perhaps it has got good again because the sea has gone away from it and you can walk from the mainland to the hill cant you yes theres one good road you can take said the innkeeper but you be careful of wandering away from it if you go walking on it the marsh will suck you down in no time if you set foot on it it does sound a most exciting place said george smugglers top on castaway hill only one road to it time to get on said the driver looking at the clock youve got to be there before tea your uncle said they got into the car again timmy clambering over legs and feet to a comfortable place on georges lap he was far too big and heavy to lie there but just occasionally he seemed to want to and george never had the heart to refuse him they drove off once more anne fell asleep and the others felt drowsy too the car purred on and on it began to rain and the countryside looked rather dreary the driver turned round after a while and spoke to julian were coming near to castaway hill sir well soon be leaving the mainland and taking the road across the marsh julian woke anne they all sat up expectantly but it was very disappointing after all the marshes were full of mist the children could not pierce through it with their eyes and could only see the flat road they were on raised a little higher than the surrounding flat marsh when the mist shifted a little now and again the children saw a dreary space of flat marsh on either side stop a minute driver said julian id like to see what the marsh is like well dont step off the road warned the driver stopping the car and dont you let that dog out miss once he runs off the road and gets into the marsh hell be gone for good what do you mean gone for good said anne her eyes wide he means the marsh will suck down timmy at once said julian shut him in the car george so timmy much to his disgust was shut safely in the car he pawed at the door and tried to look out of the window the driver turned and spoke to him its all right theyll be back soon old fellow but timmy whined all the time the others were out of the car he saw them go to the edge of the road he saw julian jump down the couple of feet that raised the road above the marsh there was a line of raised stones running in the marsh alongside the road julian stood on one of these peering at the flat marsh its mud he said loose squelchy mud look when i touch it with my foot it moves it would soon suck me down if i trod heavily on it anne didnt like it she called to julian come up on the road again im afraid youll fall in mists were wreathing and swirling over the salty marshes it was a weird place cold and damp none of the children liked it timmy began to bark in the car tim will scratch the car to bits if we dont get back said george so they all went back rather silent julian wondered how many travellers had been lost in that strange seamarsh oh theres many thats never been heard of again said the driver when they asked him they do say theres one or two winding paths that go to the hill from the mainland that were used before the road was built but unless you know every inch of them youre off them in a trice and find your feet sinking in the mud its horrid to think about said anne dont lets talk about it any more can we see castaway hill yet yes there it is looming up in the mist said the driver the top of it is out of the mist see queer place isnt it the children looked in silence out of the slowly moving mists rosea tall steep hill whose rocky sides were as steep as cliffs the hill seemed to swim in the mists and to have no roots in the earth it was covered with buildings which even at that distance looked old and quaint some of them had towers that must be smugglers top right at the summit said julian pointing its like an old building of centuries ago probably is look at the tower it has what a wonderful view youd get from it the children gazed at the place where they were to stay it looked exciting and picturesque certainly but it also looked rather forbidding its sort of sort of secret somehow said anne putting into words what the others were thinking i mean it looks as if it had kept all kinds of queer secrets down the centuries i guess it could tell plenty of tales the car drove on again quite slowly because the mists came down thickly the road had a line of sparkling round buttons set all along the middle and when the driver switched on his foglamp they shone brightly and guided him well then as they neared castaway hill the road began to slope upwards we go through a big archway soon said the driver that used to be where the city gate once was the whole town is surrounded by wall still just as it used to be in olden times its wide enough to walk on and if you start at a certain place and walk long enough youll come round to the place you started at all the children made up their minds to do this without fail what a view they would have all round the hill if they chose a fine day the road became steeper and the driver put the engine into a lower gear it groaned up the hill then it came to an archway from which old gates were fastened back it passed through and the children were in castaway its almost as if weve gone back through the centuries and come to somewhere that existed ages ago said julian peering at the old houses and shops with their cobbled streets their diamondpaned windows and stout old doors they went up the winding high street and came at last to a big gateway set with wroughtiron gates the driver hooted and they opened they swept into a steep drive and at last stopped before smugglers top they got out feeling suddenly shy the big old house seemed to frown down at them it was built of brick and timber and its front door was as massive as that of a castle queer gables jutted here and there over the diamondpaned windows the houses one tower stood sturdily at the east side of the house with windows all round it was not a square tower but a rounded one and ended in a point smugglers top said julian its a good name for it somehow i suppose lots of smuggling went on here in the old days dick rang the bell to do this he had to pull down an iron handle and a jangling at once made itself heard in the house there was the sound of running feet and the door was opened it opened slowly for it was heavy beyond it stood two children one a girl of about annes age and the other a boy of dicks age here you are at last cried the boy his dark eyes dancing i thought you were never coming this is sooty said dick to the girls who had not met him before they stared at him he was certainly very very dark black hair black eyes black eyebrows and a brown face in contrast to him the girl beside him looked pale and delicate she had golden hair blue eyes and her eyebrows were so faint they could hardly be seen this is marybelle my sister said sooty i always think we look like beauty and the beast sooty was nice everyone liked him at once george found herself twinkling at him in a way quite strange to her for usually she was shy of strangers and would not make friends for some time but who could help liking sooty with his dancing black eyes and his really wicked grin come in said sooty driver you can take the car round to the next door and block will take in the luggage for you and give you tea suddenly sootys face lost its smile and grew very solemn he had seen timmy i say i say thats not your dog is it he said hes mine said george and she laid a protectinghand on timmys head i had to bring him i cant go anywhere without him yes but no dogs allowed at smugglers top said sooty still looking very worried and glancing behind him as if he was afraid someone might come along and see timmy my stepfather wont allow any dogs here once i brought in a stray one and he licked me till i couldnt sit down my stepfather licked me i mean not the dog anne gave a frightened little smile at the poor joke george looked stubborn and sulky i thought thought maybe we could hide him somewhere while we were here she said but if thats how you feel ill go back home with the car goodbye she turned and went after the car which was backing away timmy went with her sooty stared and then he yelled after her come back stupid well think of something chapter five sooty lenoir sooty ran down the steps that led to the front door and tore after george the others followed marybelle went too shutting the big front door behind her carefully there was a small door in the wall just where george was sooty caught hold of her and pushed her roughly through the door holding it open for the others dont shove me like that began george angrily timmy will bite you if you push me about no he wont said sooty with a cheerful grin dogs like me even if i boxed your ears your dog would only wag his tail at me the children found themselves in a dark passage there was a door at the farther end wait here a minute and ill see if the coast is clear said sooty i know my stepfather is in and i tell you if he sees that dog hell pack you all into the car again and send you back and i dont want him to do that because i cant tell you how ive looked forward to having you all he grinned at them and their hearts warmed towards him again even georges though she still felt angry at being so roughly pushed she kept timmy close beside her all the same everyone felt a bit scared of mr lenoir he sounded rather a fierce sort of person sooty tiptoed to the door at the end of the passage and opened it he peeped into the room there and then came back to the others all clear he said well take the secret passage to my bedroom no one will see us then and once were there we can make plans to hide the dog ready a secret passage sounded thrilling feeling rather as if they were in an adventure story the children went quietly to the door and into the room beyond it was a dark oakpanelled room evidently a study of some sort for there was a big desk there and the walls were lined with books there was no one there sooty went to one of the oak panels in the wall felt along it deftly and pressed in a certain place the panel slid softly aside sooty put in his hand and pulled at something a much larger panel below slid into the wall and left an opening big enough for the children to pass through come on said sooty in a low voice dont make a row feeling excited the children all passed through the opening sooty came last and did something that shut the opening and slid the first panel back into its place again he switched on a small torch for it was pitch dark where the children were standing they were in a narrow stone passage so narrow that two people could not possibly have passed one another unless both were as thin as rakes sooty passed his torch along to julian who was in front keep straight on till you come to stone steps he said go up them turn to the right at the top and keep straight on till you come to a blank wall then ill tell you what to do julian led the way holding up the torch for the others the narrow passage ran straight and came to some stone steps it was not only very narrow but rather low so that anne and marybelle were the only ones who did not have to bend their heads anne didnt like it very much she never liked being in a very narrow enclosed space it reminded her of dreams she sometimes had of being somewhere she couldnt get away from she was glad when julian spoke the steps are here up we go everyone dont make a row said sooty in a low voice were passing the diningroom now theres a way into this passage from there too everyone fell silent and tried to walk on tiptoe though this was unexpectedly difficult when heads had to be bent and shoulders stooped they climbed up fourteen steps which were quite steep and curved round halfway julian turned to the right at the top the passage ran upwards then and was as narrow as before julian felt certain that a very fat person could not possibly get along it he went on until with a start he almost bumped into a blank stone wall he flashed his torch up and down it a low voice came from the back of the line of children youve got to the blank wall julian shine your torch up to where the roof of the passage meets the wall you will see an iron handle there press down on it hard julian flashed his torch up and saw the handle he put his torch into his left hand and grasped the thick iron handle with his right he pressed down as hard as he could and quite silently the great stone in the middle of the wall slid forward and sideways leaving a gaping hole julian was astonished he let go the iron handle and flashed his torch into the hole there was nothing but darkness there its all right it leads into a big cupboard in my bedroom called sooty from the back get through julian and well follow there wont be anyone in my room julian crawled through the hole and found himself in a spacious cupboard hung with bootys clothes he groped his way through them and bumped against a door he opened it and at once daylight flooded into the cupboard lighting up the way from the passage into the room one by one the others clambered through the hole lost themselves in clothes for a moment and then went thankfully into the room through the cupboard door timmy puzzled and silent followed close beside george he had not liked the dark narrow passage very much he was glad to be in daylight again sooty coming last carefully closed the opening into the passage by pressing the stone back it worked easily though julian could not imagine how there must be some sort of pivot he thought sooty joined the others in his bedroom grinning george had her hand on timmys collar its all right george said sooty were quite safe here my room and marybelles are separate from the rest of the house were in a wing on our own reached by a long passage he opened the door and showed the others what he meant there was a room next to his which was marybelles beyond stretched a stonefloored stonewalled passage laid with mats at the end of it a big window let in light there was a door there a great oak one which was shut see were quite safe here all by ourselves said sooty timmy could bark if he liked and no one would know but doesnt anyone ever come said anne surprised who keeps your rooms tidy and cleans them oh sarah comes and does that every morning said sooty but usually no one else comes and anyway ive got a way of knowing when anyone opens that door he pointed to the door at the end of the passage the others stared at him how do you know said dick ive rigged up something that makes a buzzing noise here in my room as soon as that door is opened said sooty proudly look ill go along and open it while you stay here and listen he sped along the passage and opened the heavy door at the end immediately a low buzzing noise sounded somewhere in his room and made everyone jump timmy was startled too pricked up his ears and growled fiercely sooty shut the door and ran back did you hear the noise its a good idea isnt it im always thinking of things like that the others thought they had come to rather a queer place they stared round sootys bedroom which was quite ordinary in its furnishings and in its general untidiness there was a big diamondpaned window and anne went to look out of it she gave a gasp she had not expected to look down such a precipice smugglers top was built at the summit of the hill and on the side where sootys bedroom was the hill fell away steeply down and down to the marsh below oh look she said look how steep it is it really gives me a very queer feeling to look down there the others crowded round and looked in silence for it certainly was strange to gaze down such a long way the sun was shining up on the hillsummit but all around as far as they could see mists hid the marsh and the faroff sea the only bit of the marsh that could be seen was far down below at the bottom of the steep hill when the mists are away you can see over the flat marshes to where the sea begins said sooty thats quite a fine sight you can hardly tell where the marsh ends and sea begins except when the sea is very blue fancy once upon a time the sea came right up and around this hill and it was an island yes the innkeeper told us that said george why did the sea go back and leave it i dont know said sooty people say its going back farther and farther theres a big scheme on foot to drain the marsh and turn it into fields but i dont know if that will ever happen i dont like that marsh said anne with a shiver it looks wicked somehow timmy whined george remembered that they must hide him and make plans for him she turned to sooty did you mean what you said about hiding tim she asked where shall we put him and can he be fed and how can we exercise him hes a big dog you know well plan it all said sooty dont you worry i love dogs and i shall be thrilled to have timmy here but i do warn you that if toy stepfather ever finds out we shall probably all get a jolly good thrashing and youll be sent home in disgrace but why doesnt your father like dogs said anne puzzled is he afraid of them no i dont think so its just that he wont have them here in the house said sooty i think he must have a reason for it but i dont know what it is hes a queer sort of man my stepfather how is he queer asked dick well he seems full of secrets said sooty queer people come here and they come secretly without anyone knowing ive seen lights shining in our tower on certain nights but i dont know who puts them there or why ive tried to find out but i cant do you think do you think your father is a smuggler said anne suddenly i dont think so said sooty weve got one smuggler here and everyone knows him see that house over there to the right lower down the hill well thats where he lives hes as rich as can be his name is barling even the police know his goingson but they cant stop him he is very rich and very powerful so he does what he likes and he wont let anyone play the same game as he plays no one else would dare to do any smuggling in castaway while he does it this seems rather an exciting place said julian i have a kind of feeling there might be an adventure somewhere about oh no said sooty nothing ever happens really its only just a feeling you get here because the place is so old so full of secret ways and pits and passages why the whole hill is mined with passages in the rock used by the smugglers of olden times well began julian and stopped very suddenly everyone stared at sooty his secret buzzer had suddenly barked from its hidden corner someone had opened the door at the end of the passage chapter six bootys stepfather and mother someones coming said george in a panic what shall we do with tim quick sooty took timmy by the collar and shoved him into the old cupboard and shut the door on him keep quiet he commanded and timmy stood still in the darkness the hairs at the back of his neck standing up his ears cocked well began sooty in a bright voice perhaps id better show you where your bedrooms are now the door opened and a man came in he was dressed in black trousers and a white linen coat he had a queer face its a shut face thought anne to herself you cant tell a bit what hes like inside because his face is all shut and secret oh hallo block said sooty airily he turned to the others this is block my stepfathers man he said hes deaf so you can say what you like but its better not to because though he doesnt hear he seems to sense what we say anyway i think it would be beastly to say things we wouldnt say in front of him if he wasnt deaf said george who had very strict ideas about things of that sort block spoke in a curiously monotonous voice your stepfather and your mother want to know why you have not brought your friends to see them he said why did you rush up here like this block looked all round as he spoke almost as if he knew there was a dog and wondered where he had gone to george thought in alarm she did hope the cardriver had not mentioned timmy oh i was so pleased to see them i took them straight up here said sooty all right block well be down in a minute the man went his face quite impassive not a smile not a frown i dont like him said anne has he been with you long no only about a year said sooty he suddenly appeared one day even mother didnt know he was coming he just came and without a word changed into that white linen coat and went to do some work in my stepfathers room i suppose my stepfather was expecting him but he didnt say anything to my mother im sure of that she seemed so surprised is she your real mother or a stepmother too asked anne you dont have a stepmother and a stepfather said sooty scornfully you only have one or the other my mother is my real mother and shes marybelles mother too but marybelle and i are only halfbrother and sister because my stepfather is her real father its rather muddled said anne trying to sort it out come on wed better go down said sooty remembering by the way my stepfather is always being very affable always smiling and joking but it isnt real somehow hes quite likely to fly into a furious temper at any moment i hope we shant see very much of him said anne uncomfortably whats your mother like sooty like a frightened mouse said sooty youll like her all right shes a darling but she doesnt like living here she doesnt like this house and shes terrified of my stepfather she wouldnt say so herself of course but i know she is marybelle who was too shy to have joined in any talking until then nodded her head i dont like living here either she said i shall be glad when i go to boardingschool like sooty except that i shall leave mother all alone then come on said sooty and led the way wed better leave timmy in the cupboard till we come back just in case block does a bit of snooping ill lock the cupboard door and take the key feeling rather unhappy at leaving timmy locked up in the cupboard the children followed sooty and marybelle down the stone passage to the oak door they went through and found themselves at the top of a great flight of stairs wide and shallow they went down into a big hall at the right was a door and sooty opened it he went in and spoke to someone here they all are he said sorry i rushed them off to my bedroom like that father but i was so excited to see them all your manners still need a little polishing pierre said mr lenoir in a deep voice the children looked at him he sat in a big oak chair a neat cleverlooking man with fair hair brushed upwards and eyes as blue as marybelles he smiled all the time but with his mouth not his eyes what cold eyes thought anne when she went forward to shake hands with him his hand was cold too he smiled at her and patted her on the shoulder what a nice little girl he said you will be a good companion for marybelle three boys for sooty and one girl for marybelle ha ha he evidently thought george was a boy and she did look rather like one she was wearing shorts and jersey as usual and her curly hair was very short nobody said that george wasnt a boy certainly george was not going to she dick and julian shook hands with mr lenoir they had not even noticed sootys mother she was there though sitting lost in an armchair a tiny woman like a doll with mousecoloured hair and grey eyes anne turned to her oh how small you are she said before she could stop herself mr lenoir laughed he laughed no matter what anyone said mrs lenoir got up and smiled she was only as tall as anne and had the smallest hands and feet that anne had ever seen on a grownup anne liked her she shook hands and said its so nice of you to have us all here like this you know i expect that a tree fell on the roof of our house and smashed it mr lenoirs laugh came again he made some kind of joke and everyone smiled politely well i hope youll have a good time here he said pierre and marybelle will show you the old town and if you promise to be careful you can walk along the road to the mainland to go to the cinema there thank you said everyone and mr lenoir laughed his curious laugh again your father is a very clever man he said suddenly turning to julian who guessed that he had mistaken him for george i am hoping he will come here to fetch you home again when you go and then i shall have the pleasure of talking with him he and i have been doing the same kind of experiments but he has got further than i have oh said julian politely then the dolllike mrs lenoir spoke in her soft voice block will give you all your meals in marybelles schoolroom then you will not disturb my husband he does not like talk at mealtimes and that would be rather hard on six children mr lenoir laughed again his cold blue eyes looked intently at all the children by the way pierre he said suddenly i forbid you to wander about the catacombs in this hill as i have forbidden you before and i also forbid you to do any of your daredevil climbing nor will i have you acting about on the city wall now that you have others here i will not have them taking risks will you promise me this i dont act about on the city wall protested sooty i dont take risks either you play the fool always said mr lenoir and the tip of his nose turned quite white anne looked at it with interest she did not know that it always did this when mr lenoir got angry oh sir i was top of my form last term said sooty in a most injured tone the others felt certain that he was trying to lead mr lenoir away from his request he was not going to promise him what he had asked mrs lenoir now joined in he really did do well last term she said you must remember enough snapped mr lenoir and the smiles and laughs he had so freely lavished on everyone vanished entirely get out all of you rather scared julian dick anne and george hurried from the room followed by marybelle and sooty sooty was grinning as he shut the door i didnt promise he said he wanted to take all our fun away this place isnt any fun if you dont explore it i can show you heaps of queer places what are catacombs asked anne with a vague picture of cats and combs in her head winding secret tunnels in the hill said sooty nobody knows them all you can get lost in them easily and never get out again lots of people have why are there so many secret ways and things here wondered george easy said julian it was a haunt of smugglers and there must have been many a time when they had to hide not only their goods but themselves and according to old sooty there still is a smuggler here what did you say his name was barling wasnt it yes said sooty come on upstairs and ill show you your rooms youve got a good view over the town he took them to two rooms set side by side on the opposite side of the big staircase from his bedroom and marybelles they were small but wellfurnished and had as sooty said a marvellous view over the quaint roofs and towers of castaway hill they also had a remarkably good view of mr barlings house george and anne were to sleep in one room and julian and dick in the other evidently mrs lenoir had taken the trouble to remember that there were two girls and two boys not one girl and three boys as mr lenoir imagined nice cosy rooms said anne i like these dark oak panels are there any secret passages in our rooms sooty you wait and see grinned sooty look there are your things all unpacked from your suitcases i expect sarah did that youll like sarah shes a good sort fat and round and jolly not a bit like block sooty seemed to have forgotten all about tim george reminded him what about timmy hell have to be near me you know and we must arrange to feed him and exercise him oh i do hope hell be all right sooty id rather leave straight away than have timmy unhappy hell be all right said sooty til give him the free run of that narrow passage we came up to my bedroom by and well feed him every chance we get and well smuggle him out by a secret tunnel that opens halfway down the town and give him plenty of exercise each morning oh well have a grand time with timmy george wasnt so sure can he sleep with me at night she asked hell howl the place down if he cant well well try and manage it said sooty rather doubtfully youve got to be jolly careful you know we dont want to land in serious trouble you dont know what my stepfather can be like they could guess though julian looked curiously at sooty was your own fathers name lenoir too he asked sooty nodded yes he was my stepfathers cousin and was as dark as all the lenoirs usually are my stepfather is an exception hes fair people say the fair lenoirs are no good but dont tell my stepfather that as if we should said george gracious hed cut off our heads or something come on lets go back to tim chapter seven the hidden pit the children were all very glad to think that they were going to have meals by themselves in the old schoolroom nobody wanted to have much to do with mr lenoir they felt sorry for marybelle because she had such a queer father they soon settled down at smugglers top once george was satisfied that timmy was safe and happy though rather puzzled about everything she settled down too the only difficulty was getting timmy to her room at night this had to be done in darkness block had a most tiresome way of appearing silently and suddenly and george was terrified of him catching a glimpse of the big dog timmy had a queer sort of life the next few days whilst the children were indoors he had to stay in the narrow secret passage where he wandered about puzzled and lonely pricking his ears for a sound of the whistle that meant he was to come to the cupboard and be let out he was fed very well for sooty raided the larder every night sarah the cook was amazed at the way things like soupbones disappeared she could not understand it but timmy devoured everything that was given to him each morning he was given good exercise by the children the first morning this had been really very exciting george had reminded sooty of his promise to take timmy for walks each day he simply must have exercise or hell be terribly miserable she said but how can we manage it we cant possibly take him through the house and out of the front door wed be certain to walk into your father i told you i knew a way that came out halfway down the hill silly said sooty ill show you we shall be quite safe once we are down there because even if we met block or anyone else that knew us they wouldnt know it was our dog they would think it was just a stray we had picked up well show us the way said george impatiently they were all in bootys bedroom and timmy was lying on the mat beside george they felt really safe in bootys room because of the buzzer that warned them when anyone opened the door at the end of the long passage well have to go into marybelles room said sooty youll get a shock when you see the way that leads down the hill i can tell you he looked out of the door the door at the end of the passage was shut marybelle slip along and peep through the passage door said sooty warn us if anyone is coming up the stairs if not well all dip quickly into your room marybelle ran to the door at the end of the passage she opened it and at once the warning buzzer sounded in sootys room making timmy growl fiercely marybelle looked through the doorway to the stairs then she signalled to the others that no one was coming they all rushed out of sootys room into marybelles and marybelle came to join them she was a funny little mouse of a girl shy and timid anne liked her and once or twice teased her for being so shy but marybelle did not like being teased her eyes filled with tears at once and she turned away shell be better when she goes to school sooty said she cant help being shy shut up all the year round in this queer house she hardly ever sees anyone of her own age they crowded into the little girls bedroom and shut the door sooty turned the key in the lock just in case friend block comes snooping he said with a grin sooty began to move the furniture in the room to the sides near the walls the others watched in surprise and then helped whats the idea of the furniture removal asked dick struggling with a heavy chest got to get this heavy carpet up panted sooty its put there to hide the trapdoor below at least thats what ive always thought once the furniture stood by the walls it was easy to drag up the heavy carpet there was a felt lining under it too and that had to be pulled aside as well then the children saw a trapdoor let flat into the floor with a ringhandle to pull it up they felt excited another secret way this house seemed full of them sooty pulled at the ring and the heavy door came up quite easily the children peered down but they could see nothing it was pitchdark are there steps down asked julian holding anne back in case she fell no said sooty reaching out for a big torch he had brought in with him look he switched on his torch and the children gave a gasp the trapdoor led down to a pit far far below why its miles below the foundations of the house surely said julian surprised its just a hole down to a big pit whats it for oh it was probably used to hide people or to get rid of them said sooty nice little place isnt it if you fell down there youd land with an awful bump but how in the world could we get timmy down there or get down ourselves said george im not going to fall down it thats certain sooty laughed you wont have to he said look here he opened a cupboard and reached up to a wide shelf he pulled something down and the children saw that it was a ropeladder fine but very strong there you are we can all get down by that he said timmy cant said george at once he couldnt possibly climb up or down a ladder oh couldnt he said sooty he seems such a clever dog i should have thought he could easily have done a thing like that well he cant said george decidedly thats a silly idea i know said marybelle suddenly going red at her boldness in breaking in on the conversation t think i know we could get the laundry basket and shut timmy in it and we could tie it with ropes and let him down and pull him up the same way the others stared at her now that really is a brainwave said julian warmly good for you marybelle timmy would be quite safe in a basket but it would have to be a big one theres a very big one in the kitchen said marybelle its never used except when we have lots of people to stay like now we could borrow it oh yes said sooty of course we could ill go and get it now but what excuse will you give shouted julian after him sooty had already unlocked the door and shot out he was a most impatient person and could never put off anything for a single minute sooty didnt answer he sped down the passage julian locked the door after him he didnt want anyone coming in and seeing the draggedup carpet and the yawning hole sooty was back in two minutes carrying a very heavy wicker laundry basket on his head he banged on the door and julian unlocked it good said julian how did you get it did anyone mind didnt ask them grinned sooty nobody there to ask blocks with father and sarah has gone out shopping i can always put it back if any awkward questions are asked the ropeladder was shaken out down the hole it slipped like an uncoiling snake down and down and reached the pit at the bottom then timmy was fetched from sootys room he came in wagging his tail overjoyed at being with everyone again george hugged him darling timmy i hate you being hidden away like this but never mind were all going out together this morning til go down first said sooty then youd better let timmy down ill tie his basket round with this rope its nice and strong and theres plenty to let down better tie the other end to the end of the bed then when we come up again we can easily pull him up timmy was made to get inside the big basket and lie down he was surprised and barked a little but george put her hand over his mouth sh you mustnt say a word timmy she said i know all this is very astonishing but never mind youll have a marvellous walk at the end of it timmy heard the word walk and was glad that was what he wanted a really nice long walk in the open air and sunshine he didnt at all like having the lid shut down on him but as george seemed to think he must put up with all these queer happenings timmy did so with a very good grace hes really a marvellous dog said marybelle sooty get down the hole now and be ready for when we let him down sooty disappeared down the dark hole holding his torch between his teeth down and down he went down and down at last he stood safely at the bottom and flashed his torch upwards his voice came to them sounding rather queer and far away come on lower timmy down the laundry basket feeling extraordinarily heavy now was pushed to the edge of the hole then down it went knocking against the sides here and there timmy growled he didnt like this game dick and julian had hold of the rope between them they lowered timmy as smoothly as they could he reached the bottom with a slight bump and sooty undid the basket out leapt timmy barking but his bark sounded very small and distant to the watchers at the top now come on down one by one shouted up sooty waving his torch is the door locked julian yes said julian look out for anne shes coming now anne climbed down a little frightened at first but as her feet grew use to searching for and finding the rungs of the ropeladder she went down quite quickly then the others followed and soon they were all standing together at the bottom of the hole in the enormous pit they looked round curiously it had a musty smell and its walls were damp and greenish sooty swung his torch round and the children saw various passages leading off here and there where do they all lead to asked julian in amazement well i told you this hill was full of tunnels said sooty this pit is down in the hill and these tunnels lead into the catacombs there are miles and miles of them no one explores them now because so many people have been lost in them and never heard of again there used to be an old map of them but its lost its weird said anne and shivered i wouldnt like to be down here alone what a place to hide smuggled goods in said dick no one would ever find them here i guess the oldtime smugglers knew every inch of these passages said sooty come on well take the one that leads out of the hillside well have to do a bit of climbing when we get there i hope you dont mind not a bit said julian were all good climbers but i say sooty youre sure you know the way we dont want to be lost for ever down here course i know the way come on said sooty and flashing his torch in front of him he led the way into a dark and narrow tunnel chapter eight an exciting walk the tunnel ran slightly downwards and smelt nasty in places sometimes it opened out into pits like the one they themselves had come from sooty flashed his torch up them that one goes into barlings house somewhere he said most of the old houses hereabouts have openings into pits like ours jolly well hidden some of them are too theres daylight or something in front said anne suddenly oh good i hate this tunnel sure enough it was daylight creeping in through a kind of caveentrance in the hillside the children crowded there and looked out they were outside the hill and outside the town somewhere on the steep cliffside that ran down to the marsh sooty climbed out on to a ledge he put his torch into his pocket weve got to get to that path down there he said pointing that will lead us to a place where the city wall is fairly low and we can climb over it is timmy surefooted we dont want him tumbling into the marsh down there the marsh lay a good way below looking ugly and flat george sincerely hoped timmy would never fall into it still he was very surefooted and she didnt think he would slip the path was steep and rocky but quite passable they all went down it clambering over rocks now and again the path led them to the city wail which as sooty had said was fairly low just there he climbed up to the top he was like a cat for climbing no wonder hes got such a name for climbing about everywhere at school said dick to julian hes had good practice here do you remember how he climbed up to the roof of the school the term before last everyone was scared hed slip and fall but he didnt he tied the union jack to one of the chimneypots come on called sooty the coast is clear this is a lonely bit of the town and no one will see us climbing up soon they were all over the wall timmy too they set off for a good walk swinging down the hill enjoying themselves the mist began to clear after a while and the sun felt nice and warm the town was very old some of the houses seemed almost tumbledown but there were people living in them for smoke came from the chimneys the shops were quaint with their long narrow windows and overhanging eaves the children stopped to look into them look out heres block said sooty suddenly in a low voice dont take any notice of timmy at all if he comes around licking us or jumping up pretend to try and drive him off as if he was a stray theall pretended not to see block but gazed earnestly into the window of a shop timmy feeling rather out of it ran up to george and pawed at her trying to make her take notice of him go away dog said sooty and flapped at the surprised timmy go away following us about like this go home cant you timmy thought this was some sort of a game he barked happily and ran round sooty and george giving them an occasional lick home dog home yelled sooty flapping hard again then block came up to them no expression on his face at all the dog bothers you he said i will throw a stone at him and make him go dont you dare said george immediately you go home yourself i dont mind the dog following us hes quite a nice one blocks deaf silly said sooty its no good talking to him to georges horror block picked up a big stone meaning to throw it at timmy george flew at him punched him hard on the arm and made him drop the stone how dare you throw stones at a dog yelled the little girl in a fury til ill tell the police now now said a voice nearby whats all this about pierre whats the trouble the children turned and saw a tall man standing near them wearing his hair rather long he had long narrow eyes a long nose and a long chin hes long everywhere thought anne looking at his long thin legs and long narrow feet oh mr barling i didnt see you said sooty politely nothings the matter thanks its only that this dog is following us and block said hed make it go away by chucking a stone at it and george here is fond of dogs and got angry about that i see and who are all these children said mr barling looking at each one of them out of his long narrow eyes theyve come to stay with us because their uncles house had an accident to it explained sooty georges fathers house i mean at kirrin ah at kirrin said mr barling and seemed to prick up his long ears surely that is where that very clever scientist friend of mr lenoirs lives yes hes my father said george why do you know him i have heard of him and of his very interesting experiments said mr barling mr lenoir knows him well i believe not awfully well said george puzzled they just write to one another i think my father telephoned to mr lenoir to ask him if he could have us to stay while our own house is being mended and mr lenoir of course was only too delighted to have the whole company of you said mr barling such a good generous fellow your father pierre the children stared at mr barling thinking that it was queer of him to say nice things in such a nasty voice they felt uncomfortable it was plain that mr barling did not like mr lenoir at all well neither did they but they didnt like mr barling any better timmy saw another dog and darted happily after him block had now disappeared going up the steep high street with his basket the children said goodbye to mr barling not wanting to talk to him any more they went after timmy talking eagerly as soon as they had left mr barling behind goodness that was a narrow escape from block said julian old beast going to throw that enormous stone at timmy no wonder you flew at him george you nearly gave the game away though i dont care said george i wasnt going to have timmys leg broken it was a bit of bad luck meeting block our very first morning out well probably never meet him again when we take timmy out said sooty comfortingly and if we do well simply say the dog always joins us when it meets us which is perfectly true they enjoyed their walk they went into a quaint old coffee shop and had steaming cups of delicious creamy coffee and jammy buns timmy had two of the buns and gobbled them greedily george went off to buy some meat for him at the butchers choosing a shop that sooty said mrs lenoir did not go to she did not want any butcher telling mrs lenoir that the children had been buying dogmeat they went back the same way as they had come they made their way up the steep cliffpath and in at the tunnelentrance back through the winding tunnel to the pit and there was the ropeladder waiting for them julian and dick went up first while george packed the surprised timmy into the basket again and tied the rope firmly round it then up went the whining timmy bumping against the sides of the hole until the two panting boys pulled the basket into marybelles room and undid it it was ten minutes before the dinnerhour just time to shut the trapdoor pull back the carpet and wash our hands said sooty and ill put old timmy back into the secret passage behind the cupboard in my room george where is that meat you bought ill put that in the passage too he can eat it when he likes did you put him a nice warm rug there and a dish of fresh water asked george anxiously for the third or fourth time you know i did i keep telling you said sooty look we wont put back all the furniture except the chairs we can say we want it left back because we like to play a game on the carpet itll be an awful bore if we have to move chests and things every time we exercise tim they were just in time for their dinner block was there to serve it and so was sarah the children sat down hungrily in spite of having had coffee and buns block and sarah ladled out hot soup on to their plates i hope you got rid of the unpleasant dog said block in his monotonous voice he gave george a rather nasty look evidently he had not forgotten how she had flown at him sooty nodded it was no good speaking in answer for block would not hear sarah bustled round taking away the soupplates and preparing to give them their second course the food was very good at smugglers top there was plenty of it and the hungry visitors and sooty ate everything put before them marybelle hadnt much appetite but she was the only one george tried to secrete titbits and bones whenever she could for timmy two or three days went by and the children fell into their new life quite happily timmy was taken out each morning for a long walk the children soon got used to slipping down the ropeladder and making their way with timmy to the cliffside in the afternoons they went to either bootys room or marybelles and played games or read they could have timmy there because the buzzer always warned them if anyone was coming at night it was always an excitement to get timmy to georges room without being seen this was usually done when mr and mrs lenoir were sitting at their dinner and block and sarah were serving them the children had a light supper first and mr and mrs lenoir had their dinner an hour later it was quite the best time to smuggle timmy along to georges room timmy seemed to enjoy the smuggling he ran silently beside george and sooty stopped at every corner and scampered gladly into georges room as soon as he got there he lay quietly under the bed till george was in bed herself and then he came out to lie on her feet george always locked their door at night she didnt want sarah or mrs lenoir coming in and finding timmy there but nobody came and as night after night went by george grew more easy about timmy taking him back to sootys room in the morning was a bit of nuisance because it had to be done early before anyone was up but george could always wake herself at any time she chose and each morning about half past six the little girl slipped through the house with timmy she went in at sootys door and he jumped out of bed to deal with timmy he was always awakened by the buzzer that sounded when george opened the door at the end of the passage i hope you are all enjoying yourselves mr lenoir said to the children whenever they met him in the hall or on the stairs and they always replied politely oh yes mr lenoir thank you its quite a peaceful holiday after all said julian nothing happens at all and then things did begin to happen and once they had begun they never stopped chapter nine who is in the tower one night julian was awakened by someone opening his door he sat up at once who is it he said me sooty said sootys voice very low i say i want you to come and see something julian woke dick and the two of them put on their dressinggowns sooty led them quietly out of the room and took them to a queer little room tucked away in an odd wing of the house all kinds of things were kept here trunks and boxes old toys chests of old clothes broken vases that had never been mended and many other worthless things look said sooty taking them to the window they saw that the little room had a view of the tower belonging to the house it was the only room in the house that did for it was built at a queer angle the boys looked and julian gave an exclamation someone was signalling from the tower a light there flashed every now and again in and out pause flash flash in and out pause the light went regularly on and off in a certain rhythm now whos doing that whispered sooty your father wondered julian dont think so said sooty i think i heard him snoring away in his room we could go and find out though see if he really is in his bedroom well for goodness sake dont lets get caught said julian not at all liking the idea of prying about in his hosts house they made their way to where mr lenoir had his room it was quite plain he was there for a regular low snoring came from behind the closed door it may be block up in the tower said dick he looks full of secrets i wouldnt trust him an inch i bet its it block well shall we go to his room and see if its empty whispered sooty come on if its block signalling hes doing it without father knowing oh your father might have told him to said julian who felt that he wouldnt trust mr lenoir much further than he would trust block they went up the backstairs to the wing where the staff slept sarah slept in a room there with harriet the kitchenmaid block slept alone sooty pushed open blocks door very softly and slowly when he had enough room to put in his head he did so the room was full of moonlight by the window was blocks bed and block was there sooty could see the humpy shape of his body and the black round patch that was his head he listened but he could not catch blocks breathing he must sleep very quietly he withdrew his head and pushed the other two boys quietly down the backstairs was he there whispered julian yes so it cant be him signalling up in our tower said sooty well who can it be then i dont like it it couldnt possibly be mother or sarah or the little kitchenmaid is there a stranger in our house someone we dont know living here in secret cant be said julian a little shiver running down his back look here what about us going up to the tower and trying to peep through the door or something wed soon find out who it was then perhaps we ought to tell your father no not yet i want to find out a whole lot more befoie i say anything to anyone said sooty sounding obstinate lets creep up to the tower we shall have to be jolly careful though you get to it by a spiral staircase rather narrow theres nowhere much to hide if anyone suddenly came down out of the tower whats in the tower whispered dick as they made their way through the dark and silent house thin streaks of moonlight coming in here and there between the cracks of the closed curtains nothing much just a table and a chair or two and a bookcase of books said sooty we use it on hot summer days when the breeze gets in strongly through the windows there and we can see a long way all round us they came to a little landing from this a winding narrow stairway of stone went up to the rounded tower the boys looked up moonlight fell on the stairway from a slitlike window in the wall wed better not all go up said sooty we should find it so difficult to hurry down three of us if the person in the tower suddenly came out ill go you stay down here and wait ill see if i can spy anything through the crack in the door or the keyhole he crept softly up the stairway soon lost to view as he rounded the first spiral julian and dick waited in the shadows at the bottom there was a thick curtain over one of the windows there and they got behind it wrapping its folds round them for warmth sooty crept up to the top the towerroom had a stout oak door studded and barred it was shut it was no use trying to look through the crack because there wasnt one he bent down to peer through the keyhole but that was stuffed up with something so he could not see through that either he pressed his ear to it and listened he heard a series of little clicks click click click click click nothing else at all thats the click of the light theyre using thought sooty still signalling like mad what for who to and who is in our towerroom using it as a signallingstation how i wish i knew suddenly the clicking stopped there was the sound of someone walking across the stone floor of the tower and almost at once the door opened sooty had no time to hurry down the stairs all he could do was to squeeze into a niche and hope that the person would not see him or touch him as he went by the moon went behind a cloud at that moment and sooty was thankful to know he was hidden in black shadow someone came down the stairs and actually brushed against sootys arm sooty jumped almost out of his skin expecting to be hauled out of his niche but the person did not seem to notice and went on down the spiral stairway walking softly sooty did not dare to go down after him for he was afraid the man would come out and cast his shadow down for the signaller to see so he stayed squeezed in his niche hoping that julian and dick were wellhidden and would not think it was he sooty who was walking down the stairs julian and dick heard the soft footsteps coming andthought at first it was sooty then not hearing his whisper they stiffened behind the curtains guessing that it was the signaller himself who was walking by wed better follow him whispered julian to dick come on quiet now but julian got muddled up with the great curtains and could not seem to find his way out dick however slipped out easily enough and padded after the disappearing person the moon was now out again and dick could catch glimpses of the signaller as he went past the moonlight streaks keeping well in the shadows himself he darted quietly after him where was he going he followed him across the landing to a passage then across another landing and up the backstairs but those led to the staff bedrooms surely the man was not going there dick to his enormous surprise saw the person disappear silently into blocks bedroom he crept to the door which had been left a little ajar there was no light in the room except that of the moon there was no sound of talking nothing at all except a creak which might have come from the bed dick peeped in full of the most intense curiosity would he see the man waking up block would he see him climbing out of the window he stared round the room there was no one there at all except block lying in bed the moonlight lit up the corners and dick could quite plainly see that the room was empty only block lay there and as dick watched he heard him give a sigh and roll over in bed well thats the queerest thing i ever saw thought dick puzzled a man goes into a room and completely disappears without a single sound where can he have gone he went back to find the others sooty by this time had crept down the spiral staircase and had found julian who had explained that dick had gone to follow the queer signaller they went to find dick and suddenly bumped into him creeping along quietly in the darkness they all jumped violently and julian almost cried out but stifled his voice just in time golly you gave me a scare dick he whispered well did you see who it was and where he went dick told them of his queer experience he simply went into blocks room and vanished he said is there any secret passage leading out of blocks room sooty no none said sooty that wing is much newer than the rest of the house and hasnt any secrets in at all i simply cant imagine what happened to the man how very queer who is he and why does he come and where on earth does he go we really must find out said julian its such a mystery sooty how did you know there was signalling going on from the tower well some time ago i found it out quite by accident said sooty i couldnt sleep and i went along to that funny little boxroom place and ferreted about for an old book i thought id seen there and suddenly i looked up at the tower and saw a light flashing there funny said dick well i went along there at night a good many times after that to see if i could see the signals again said sooty and at last i did the first time i had seen them there was a good moon and the second time there was too so i thought next time theres a moon ill creep along to that old boxroom and see if the signaller is at work again and sure enough he was where does that window look out on that we saw the light flashing from asked julian thoughtfully the seaward side or the landward seaward said sooty at once theres something or someone out at sea that receives those signals goodness knows who some kind of smugglers i suppose said dick but it cant be anything to do with your father sooty i say lets go up into the tower shall we we might find something thereor see something they went back to the spiral staircase and climbed up to the towerroom it was dark for the moon was behind a cloud but it came out after a while and the boys looked out of the seaward window there was no mist at all that night they could see the flat marshes stretching away to the sea they gazed down in silence then the moon went in and darkness covered the marsh suddenly julian clutched the others making them jump i can see something he whispered look beyond there what is it they all looked it seemed like a tiny line of very small dots of light they were so far away that it was difficult to see if they stayed still or moved then the moon came out again flooding everywhere with silvery light and the boys could not see anything except the moonshine but when the moon went in again there was the line of tiny pricking lights again a bit nearer surely whispered sooty smugglers coming over a secret path from the sea to castaway hill smugglers chapter ten timmy makes a noise the three girls were very excited the next day when the boys told them their adventure of the night before gracious said anne her eyes wide with surprise who can it be signalling like that and wherever did he go to fancy him going into blocks room with block there in bed its very peculiar said george i wish you had come and told me and anne there wasnt time and anyway we couldnt have timmy about at night he might have flown at the signaller said dick the man must have been signalling to the smugglers said julian thoughtfully let me see probably they came over from france in a ship came as near to the marsh as they could waited for a signal to tell them that the coast was clear probably the signal from the tower and then waded across a path they knew through the marsh each man must have carried a torch to prevent himself from leaving the path and falling into the marsh no doubt there was someone waiting to receive the goods they brought someone at the edge of the marsh below the hill but who said dick it cant have been mr barling who sooty says is known to be a smuggler because the signal lights came from our house not his its all very puzzling well well do our best to solve the mystery said george theres some queer game going on in this very house with or without your fathers knowledge sooty well keep a jolly good lookout and see if we can find out what it is they were at breakfast alone when they discussed the nights adventure block came in to see if they had finished at that moment anne did not notice him what does mr barling smuggle she asked sooty immediately she got a hard kick on her ankle and stared in pain and surprise why did you she began and got another kick harder still then she saw block but hes deaf she said he cant hear anything we say block began to clear away his face as usual showing no expression sooty glared at anne she was upset and cross but said no more she rubbed her bruised ankle hard as soon as block went out of the room she turned on sooty you mean thing you hurt my ankle like anything why shouldnt i say things in front of block hes quite deaf said anne her face very red i know hes supposed to be said sooty and i think he is but i saw a funny look come over his face when you asked me what mr barling smuggled almost as if he had heard what you said and was surprised you imagined it said anne crossly still rubbing her ankle anyway dont kick me so hard again a gentle push with your toe would have been enough i wont talk in front of block if you dont want me to but its quite plain hes as deaf as a post yes hes deaf all right said dick i dropped a plate off the table yesterday by accident just behind him and it smashed to bits if you remember well he didnt jump or turn a hair as he would have done if he could have heard all the same i never trust block deaf or not said sooty i always feel he might read our lips or something deaf people can often do that you know they went off to take timmy for his usual morning walk timmy was quite used to being shut in the laundry basket by now and lowered into the pit in fact he always jumped straight into the basket as soon as the lid was opened and lay down that morning they again met block who stared with great interest at the dog he plainly recognized it as the same dog as before theres block said julian in a low voice dont drive timmy off this time well pretend hes a stray who always meets us each morning so they let timmy run round them and when block came up they nodded to him and made as if to go on their way but the man stopped them that dog seems to be a friend of yours he said in his curious monotone of a voice oh yes he goes with us each morning now said julian politely he quite thinks hes our dog nice fellow isnt he block stared at timmy who growled mind you do not bring that dog into the house said block if you do mr lenoir will have him killed julian saw georges face beginning to turn red with fury he spoke hurriedly why should we bring him to the house block dont be silly block however did not appear to hear he gave timmy a nasty look and went on his way occasionally turning round to look at the little company of children horrid fellow said george angrily how dare he say things like that when they got back to marybelles bedroom that morning they pulled timmy up from the pit and let him out of the basket well put him into the secret passage as usual said george and ill put some biscuits in with him i got some nice ones for him this morning the sort he likes all big and crunchy she went to the door but just as she was about to unlock it and take timmy into sootys room next door timmy gave a small growl george took her hand away from the door at once she turned to look at timmy he was standing stiffly the hackles on his neck rising up and he was staring fixedly at the door george put her hand to her lips warningly and whispered someones outside timmy knows hes smelt them will you all talk loudly and pretend to be playing a game ill pop timmy into the cupboard where the ropeladder is kept at once the others began to talk to one another whilst george swiftly dragged timmy to the cupboard patted him to make him understand he was to be quiet and shut him in my turn to deal said julian loudly and took a pack of snap cards from the top of the chest you won last time dick bet ill win this time he dealt swiftly the others still talking loudly saying anything that came into their heads began to play snap they yelled snap nearly all the time pretending to be very jolly and hilarious anyone listening outside the door would never guess it was all pretence george who was watching the door closely saw that the handle was gradually turning very slowly indeed someone meant to open the door without being heard and come in unexpectedly but the door was locked soon the person outside whoever it was realized that the door was locked and the handle slowly turned the other way again then it was still there came no other sound it was impossible to know if anyone was still outside the door or not but timmy would know signing to the others to carry on with their shouting and laughing george let timmy out of the cupboard he ran to the door of the room and stood there sniffing quietly then he turned and looked at george his tail wagging its all right said george to the others theres no one there now timmy always knows wed better quickly take him into your room sooty while the coast is clear who could it have been do you think snooping outside block i should say said sooty he unlocked the door and peered out there was no one in the passage sooty tiptoed to the door at the end and looked out there also he waved to george to tell her it was all right to take timmy into his room soon timmy was safely in the secret passage crunching up his favourite biscuits he had got quite used to his queer life now and did not mind at all he knew his way about the passage and had explored other passages that led from it he was quite at home in the maze of secret ways better go and have our dinner now said dick and mind anne dont go and say anything silly in front of that horrid block in case he reads your lips of course i shant said anne indignantly i wouldnt have before but i never thought of him reading my lips if he does hes very clever soon they were all sitting down to lunch block was there waiting to serve them sarah was out for the day and did not appear block served them with soup and then went out suddenly to the childrens intense surprise and fright they heard timmy barking loudly they all jumped violently listen hark at timmy said julian he must be somewhere near here in that secret passage how weird it sounds his bark coming muffled and distant like that but anyone would know it was a dog barking dont say anything at all about it in front of block said sooty not a word pretend not to hear at all if timmy barks again what on earth is he barking for its the bark he uses when hes excited and pleased said george i expect hes chasing a rat he always goes right off his head when he sees a rat or a rabbit there he goes again oh dear i hope he catches the rat quickly and settles down block came back at that moment timmy had again just stopped barking but in a moment or two his doggy voice could be heard once more very muffled woof woofwoof julian was watching block closely the man went on serving the meat he said nothing but looked round at the children intently as if he wanted to see each childs expression or see if they said anything jolly good soup that was today said julian cheerfully looking round at the others i must say sarah is a wonderful cook i think her ginger buns are gorgeous said anne especially when they are all hot from the oven woofwoof said timmys voice from far away behind the walls george your mother makes the most heavenly fruit cake i ever tasted said dick to george wishing timmy would be quiet i do wonder how theyre all getting on at kirrin cottage and if theyve started mending the roof yet woof said timmy joyfully chasing his rat down another bit of passage block served everyone and then silently disappeared julian went to the door to make sure he had gone and was not outside i hope old block is as deaf as a post he said i could have sworn i saw a surprised look come into those cold eyes of his when timmy barked well if he could hear himwhich i dont believe said george he must have been jolly surprised to see us talking away and not paying any attention to a dogs barking at all the others giggled they kept a sharp ear for blocks return they heard footsteps after a time and began to pile their plates together for him to take away the schoolroom door opened but it was not block who came in it was mr lenoir he came in smiling as usual and looked round at the surprised children ah so you are enjoying your dinner and eating it all up like good children he said he always irritated the children because he spoke to them as if they were very small does block wait on you properly oh yes sir thank you said julian standing up politely we are having a very nice time here we think sarah is a wonderful cook ah thats good thats good said mr lenoir the children waited impatiently for him to go they were so afraid that timmy would bark again but mr lenoir seemed in no hurry and then timmy barked again woof woof woof chapter eleven george is worried mr lenoir cocked his head on one side almost like a startled dog when he heard the muffled barking he looked at the children but they made no sign of having heard anything mr lenoir listened a little while saying nothing then he turned to a drawingbook belonging to julian and began to look at the sketches there the children felt somehow that he was doing it for the sake of staying in the schoolroom a little longer into julians mind came the quick suspicion that somehow mr lenoir must have been told of timmys barking and come to investigate it for himself it was the first time he had ever come to the schoolroom timmy barked again a little more distantly mr lenoirs nose grew white at the tip sooty and marybelle knew the dangersign and glanced at one another that whitetipped nose usually meant a storm of temper do you hear that noise said mr lenoir snapping out the words what noise sir asked julian politely timmy barked again dont be foolish theres the noise again said mr lenoir at that moment a gull called outside the window circling in the seabreeze oh that gull sir yes we often hear the gulls said dick brightly sometimes they seem to mew like a cat sir pah said mr lenoir almost spitting out the word t suppose you will say they also bark like a dog well they might i suppose sir agreed dick looking faintly surprised after all if they can mew like cats theres no reason why they shouldnt bark like dogs timmy barked again very joyfully mr lenoir faced the children in a very bad temper indeed now cant you hear that tell me what that noise is the children all put their heads on one side and pretended to listen very carefully i cant hear anything said dick not a thing i can hear the wind said anne i can hear the gulls again said julian putting his hand behind one ear i can hear a door banging perhaps thats the noise you mean sir said sooty with a most innocent expression his stepfather gave him a poisonous look he could really be very unpleasant and theres a window rattling said marybelle eager to do her bit too though she felt very frightened of her father for she knew his sudden rages very well i tell you its a dog and ou know it snapped mr lenoir the tip of his nose so white now that it looked very queer indeed wheres the dog whose is he what dog sir began julian frowning as if he were very puzzled indeed theres no dog here that i can see mr lenoir glared at him and clenched his fingers it was quite clear that he would have liked to box julians ears then listen he hissed listen and say what you think could make that barking if not a dog they were all forced to listen for by now they felt scared of the angry man but fortunately timmy made no sound at all either he had let the rat escape or was now gobbling it up anyway there was not a single sound from him sorry sir but really i cant hear a dog barking said julian in rather an injured tone nor can i said dick and the others joined in saying the same mr lenoir knew that this time they were speaking the truth for he too could not hear anything when i catch that dog i will have him poisoned he said very slowly and clearly i will not have dogs in my house he turned on his heel and went out quickly which was a very good thing for george was quite ready to fly into one of her rages and then there would have been a real battle anne put her hand on georges arm to stop her shouting after mr lenoir dont give the game away she whispered dont say anything george george bit her lip she had gone first red with rage and then white she stamped her foot how dare he how dare he she burst out shut up silly said julian block will be back in a minute we must all pretend to be awfully surprised that mr lenoir thought there was a dog because if block can read our lips he mustnt know the truth block came in with the pudding at that moment his face as blank as ever it was the most curious face the children had ever seen for there was never any change of expression on it at all as anne said it might have been a wax mask funny how mr lenoir thought there was a dog barking began julian and the others backed him up valiantly if block could indeed read their lips he would be puzzled to know whether there had been a dog barking or not the children escaped to sootys room afterwards and held a council of war what are we to do about timmy said george does your stepfather know the secret way behind the walls of smugglers top sooty could he possibly get in and find timmy timmy might fly at him you know yes he might said sooty thoughtfully i dont know if father does know about the secret passages i mean i expect he knows but i dont know if he guessed where the entrances are i found them out quite by accident im going home said george suddenly im not going to risk timmy being poisoned you cant go home alone said julian it would look funny if you do wed all have to and then we wont have a chance to solve this mystery with sooty no for goodness sake dont go and leave me just now said sooty looking quite alarmed it would make my father furious simply furious george hesitated she didnt want to make trouble for sooty whom she liked very much but on the other hand she certainly was not going to risk danger to timmy well ill telephone my father and say im homesick and want to go back said george ill say i miss mother its quite true i do miss her you others can stay on here and solve the mystery it wouldnt be fair of you to try and keep me and timmy here when you know id worry every moment in case someone got into the secret passage and put down poisoned meat for him to eat the others hadnt thought of this that would be terrible julian sighed he would have to let george have her own way after all all right you telephone to your father he said theres a phone downstairs do it now if you like there wont be anyone about now i dont suppose george slipped down the passage out of the door there and down the stairs to where the telephone was enclosed in a dark little cupboard she asked for the number she wanted there was a long wait then she heard the buzzing noise brr brr brr brr that told her that the telephone bell at kirrin cottage was ringing she began to plan what she should say to her father she must she really must go home with timmy she didnt know how she was going to explain about timmy perhaps she neednt explain at all but she meant to go home that day or the next brr brr brr brr said the bell at the other end it went on and on and nobody answered it she did not hear her fathers familiar voice only the bell that went on ringing why did nobody answer the operator at the exchange spoke to her im sorry theres no reply george put down the receiver miserably perhaps her parents were out she would have to try again later on poor george tried three times but each time there was the same result no reply as she was coming out of the telephone cupboard for the third time mrs lenoir saw her have you been trying to telephone to your home she said havent you heard any news i havent had a letter yet said george ive tried three times to telephone kirrin cottage but each time there is no reply well we heard this morning that it is impossible to live in kirrin cottage while the men are hammering and knocking everywhere said mrs lenoir in her gentle voice we heard from your mother she said that the noise was driving your father mad and they were going away for a week or so till things were better but mr lenoir at once wrote and asked them here we shall know tomorrow because we have asked them to telephone a reply we could not get them on the telephone today of course any more than you could because they have gone away already oh said george surprised at all this news and wondering why her mother had not written to tell her too your mother said she had written to you said mrs lenoir maybe the letter will come by the next post the posts are often most peculiar here it will be a pleasure to have your parents if they can come mr lenoir particularly wants to meet your clever father he thinks he is quite a genius george said no more but went back to the others her face serious she opened bootys door and the others saw at once that she had had news of some sort i cant go home with timothy said george mother and father cant stand the noise the workmen make and they have both gone away bad luck said sooty all the same im glad youll have to stay here george i should hate to lose you or timmy your mother has written to ask my mother and father to come and stay here too said george what i shall do about timmy i dont know and they are sure to ask questions about him too i cant tell a downright lie and say i left him with alf the fisherboy or anything like that i cant think what to do well think of something promised sooty perhaps i can get one of the villagers to look after him for us that would be a very good idea oh yes said george cheering up why didnt i think of that before lets ask someone quickly sooty but it was impossible to do anything that day because mrs lenoir asked them to go down into the drawingroom after tea and have a game with her so none of them could go out to find someone to look after timmy never mind thought george hell be safe tonight on my bed tomorrow will be soon enough it was the first time that mrs lenoir had asked them down to be with her you see mr lenoir is out tonight on important business she explained he has had to go to the mainland with the car he doesnt like his evenings disturbed when he is at home so i havent been able to see as much of you all as i should have liked but tonight i can julian wondered if mr lenoir had gone to the mainland on smuggling business somehow the smuggled goods must be taken across to the mainland and if all that signalling business the other night had to do with mr lenoirs smuggling then maybe he had now gone to dispose of the goods the telephone bell rang shrilly mrs lenoir got up i expect that is your mother or father on the phone she said to george maybe i shall have news for you perhaps your parents will be arriving here tomorrow she went out into the hall the children waited anxiously would georges parents come or not chapter twelve block gets a surprise mrs lenoir came back after a time she smiled at george that was your father she said he is coming tomorrow but not your mother they went to your aunts and your mother says she thinks she must stay and help her because your aunt is not very well but your father would like to come because he wants to discuss his latest experiments with mr lenoir who is very interested in them it will be very nice to have him the children would very much rather have had aunt fanny instead of uncle quentin who could be very difficult at times but still he would probably be talking with mr lenoir most of the time so that would be all right they finished their game with mrs lenoir and went up to bed george was to get timmy to take him to her room sooty went to see that the coast was clear he could not see block anywhere his stepfather was still away from the house sarah was singing in the kitchen and the little kitchenmaid harriet was knitting there in a corner block must be out thought sooty and went to tell george that the coast was clear as he went across the landing to the long passage that led to his own room the boy noticed two black lumps sticking out at the bottom of the thick curtains drawn across the landing window he looked at them in surprise and then recognized them he grinned so old block suspects we have a dog and he thinks it sleeps in georges room or julians and hes posted himself there to watch he thought aha ill give friend block a nasty shock he ran to tell the others george listened alarmed but sooty as usual had a plan well give block an awful shock he said ill get a rope and well all go down to the landing ill suddenly yell out that theres a robber hiding behind the curtains and ill pounce on block and give him a few good punches then with your help julian and dick ill fold him up well in the curtains a good jerk will bring them down on top of him as well the others began to laugh it would be fun to play a trick on block he really was such an unpleasant fellow a good lesson would do him no harm while all the excitement is beginning ill slip by with timmy said george i only hope he wont want to join in he might give block a good nip well hold on to timmy firmly said julian get him into your room quickly now are we ready they were feeling excited they crept down the long passage that led to the door which opened out on to the landing where block was hiding they saw the curtains move very slightly as they came along block was watching george waited with timmy at the passage door not showing herself at all then with a yell from sooty a really bloodcurdling yell that made both george and timmy jump things began to happen sooty flung himself on the hidden block with all his might a robber help a robber hiding here he shouted block jumped and began to struggle sooty got in two or three wellaimed punches block had often got him into trouble with his father and now sooty was getting a bit of his own back julian and dick rushed to help a violent tug at the curtains brought them down on blocks head not only that the curtain pole descended on him too and knocked him sideways poor block he was completely taken by surprise and could do nothing against the three determined boys even anne gave a hand though marybelle stood apart enjoying the fun though not daring to take part in it just as it all began george slipped by with timmy but timmy could not bear to miss the fun he dragged behind george and would not go with her she tried to force him her hand on his collar but timmy had seen a nice fat leg waving about near him protruding from the curtain he pounced on it there was an agonized yell from block certainly timmy could nip hard with his sharp white teeth he worried at the kicking leg for a few seconds and then had a sharp slap from george shocked timmy let go the leg and humbly followed his mistress she never slapped him she must indeed be angry with him with tail well down timmy followed her into the bedroom and got under the bed at once he poked his head out and looked beseechingly at george with big brown eyes oh timmy i had to slap you said george and she knelt down by the big dog and patted his head you see you might have spoilt everything if youd been seen as it is im sure you bit block and i dont know how were going to explain that lie quietly now old fellow im going out to join the others timmys tail thumped softly on the floor george ran out of the room and joined the others on the landing they were having a fine game with block who was yelling and wriggling and struggling for all he was worth he was wrapped up in the blanket like a caterpillar inside a cocoon his head was completely covered and he could see nothing suddenly mr lenoir appeared in the hall below with a very scared mrs lenoir beside him whats all this thundered bootys stepfather have you gone mad how dare you behave like this at this time of night sir weve caught a robber and tied him up panted sooty mr lenoir ran up the stairs two steps at a time amazed he saw the kicking figure on the ground welltied up in the heavy curtains a robber do you mean a burglar where did you find him he was hiding behind the curtains sir said julian we managed to get hold of him and tie him up before he could escape could you call the police sir an anguished voice came from inside of the curtains let me go ive been bitten let me go good heavens youve got block tied up there said mr lenoir in amazement and anger untie him quickly but sir it cant be block he was hiding behind those curtains at the window protested sooty do as youre told commanded mr lenoir getting angry anne looked at the tip of his nose yes it was turning white as usual the boys reluctantly undid the ropes block angrily parted the curtains that enfolded him and looked out his usually blank face crimson with rage and fright i wont stand this sort of thing he raged look here at my leg sir ive been bitten only a dog could have done that see my leg sure enough there were the marks of teeth on his leg slowly turning purple timmy had taken a good nip and almost gone through the skin theres no dog here said mrs lenoir coming timidly up the stairs at last you couldnt have been bitten by a dog block who bit him then demanded mr lenoir turning fiercely on poor mrs lenoir do you think could have bitten him sir in my excitement suddenly said sooty to the enormous surprise of the others and to their immense amusement he spoke very seriously with a worried look on his face when i lose my temper sir i hardly know what i do do you think i bit him pah said mr lenoir in disgust dont talk nonsense boy ill have you whipped if i think you go about biting people get up block youre not badly hurt my teeth do feel a bit funny now i come to think of it said sooty opening and shutting his mouth as if to see if they were all right i think id better go and clean them sir i feel as if ive got the taste of blocks ankle in my mouth and it isnt nice mr lenoir driven to fury by sootys impudence reached out swiftly to box the boys ears but sooty dodged and ran back up the passage just going to clean my teeth he called and the others tried to keep from laughing the idea of sooty biting anyone was absurd it was quite obvious however that neither mr nor mrs lenoir guessed what had bitten block go to bed all of you ordered mr lenoir i hope i shall not have to complain of you to your father tomorrow when he comes or your uncle as it may be i dont know which of you are his children and which not im surprised at you making such a nuisance of yourselves in somebody elses house tying up my servant if he leaves it will be your fault the children hoped fervently that block would leave it would be marvellous to have the deaf blankfaced fellow out of the house he was on the watch for timmy they felt sure he would snoop about till he got timmyor one of them into trouble but block was still there next morning he came into the schoolroom with the breakfast his face almost as blank as usual he gave sooty an evil look you look out for yourself he said in a curiously soft voice you look out somethings going to happen to you one of these days yes and that dog too i know youve got a dog see you cant deceive me the children said nothing but looked at one another sooty grinned and rapped out a gay little tattoo on the table with his spoon dark dire dreadful threats he said you look out for yourself too block any more snooping about and youll find yourself tied up again yes and i might bite you again too you never know my teeth feel quite ready for it this morning he bared his teeth at block who made no reply at all but merely looked as if he had not heard a word the man went out and closed the door softly behind him nasty bit of work isnt he said sooty but george felt rather alarmed she feared block there was something cold and clever and bad about those narrow eyes of his she longed with all her heart to get timmy out of the house she got a terrible shock that morning sooty came to her looking agitated i say what do you think your fathers going to have my room ive got to sleep with julian and dick block is taking all my things from my room to theirs this very minute with sarah i hope we shall have a chance to get him out all right before your father comes oh sooty said george in despair ill go and see if i can get him at once she went off pretending to go to marybelles room for something but block was still in bootys room and there he stayed cleaning it all morning george was very worried about timmy he would wonder why she hadnt fetched him he would miss his walk she hovered about the passage all morning getting into sarahs way as she carried clothes from sootys old room to julians block gave george some curious looks he walked with a limp to show that his leg was bad from the bite he left the room at last and george darted in but block returned almost at once and she dashed back into marybelles room again block left and went down the passage and again the desperate little girl rushed into sootys room but block was back before she could even open the cupboard door what are you doing in this room he said roughly i havent cleaned it all morning to have children in here messing it up again clear out of it george went and then once more waited for block to go he would have to see to the luncheon soon he went at last george rushed to the door of sootys room eager to get poor timmy but she couldnt open the door it was locked and block had taken the key chapter thirteen poor george by now george was in despair she felt as if she was in a nighimare she went to find sooty he was in julians room next to hers washing his hands ready for lunch sooty i shall have to get into the secret passage the way you first took us in she said through that little studyroom of your fathers you know where the sliding panels are we cant said sooty looking rather alarmed he uses it now and hed halfkill anyone who went in there hes got the records of all his experiments there and hes put them ready to show your father i dont care said george desperately ive got to get in there somehow timmy may starve not timmy hell live on the rats in the passages said sooty timmy could always look after himself i bet well hed die of thirst then said george obstinately theres no water in those secret passages you know that george could hardly eat any lunch because she was so worried she made up her mind somehow to get into that little studyroom and see if she could open the entrance into the wall behind the panels then she would slip in and get timmy she didnt care what happened she was going to get timmy i shant tell the others though she thought they would only try and stop me or offer to do it themselves and i dont trust anyone but myself to do this timmys my dog and im going to save him after lunch everyone went to julians room to discuss things george went with them but after a few minutes she left them back in a minute she said they took no notice and went on discussing how to rescue timmy it really did seem as if the only way was to raid the study and try and get into the secret passage without being seen but my stepfather works there now said sooty and i shouldnt be surprised if he locks the door when he leaves the room george didnt come back after about ten minutes anne grew puzzled what can george be doing it must be about ten minutes since she went oh shes probably gone to see if my old room is unlocked yet said sooty getting up you peep out and see if shes about she wasnt she didnt seem to be anywhere she wasnt in the passage that led to sootys old room she couldnt be in that room because it was still locked and she wasnt in marybelles room sooty peeped in georges own room the one she shared with anne but that was empty too he went downstairs and snooped around a bit no george he went back to the others puzzled i cant find her anywhere he said where can she be anne looked alarmed this was such a queer house with queer happenings she wished george would come shes not gone into that little studyroom has she said julian suddenly it would be just like george to try and get into the lions den i didnt think of that said sooty silly of me ill go and see he went down the stairs he made his way cautiously to his fathers study he stood quietly outside the shut door there was no sound from inside was his father there or not sooty debated whether to open the door and peep in or whether to knock he decided to knock then if his father answered he could rush back upstairs before the door could be opened and his father would not know whom to scold for the interruption so he knocked very smartly raprap whos that came his stepfathers irritable voice come in am i to have no peace sooty fled upstairs at once he went to the others george cant be in the study he said my stepfathers there and he didnt sound in too good a temper either then where can she be said julian looking worried i do wish she wouldnt go off without telling us where shes going she must be somewhere about she wouldnt go very far from timmy they all had a good hunt over the house even going into the kitchen block was there reading a paper what do you want he said you wont get it whatever it is we dont want anything from you said sooty hows your poor bad bitten leg block looked so unpleasantly at them that they all retreated from the kitchen in a hurry sooty put julian and dick on guard and went up to the staff bedrooms to see if by any chance george had gone there a silly idea he knew but george must be somewhere she wasnt there of course the children went back gloomily to julians room this beastly house said julian i cant say i like it sorry to say so sooty but its a queer place with a queer feeling about it sooty was not hurt at all oh i agree with you he said ive always thought the same myself so has mother and so has marybelle its my stepfather that likes it where is george said anne i keep on and on trying to think theres only one place im certain shes not in and thats your stepfathers study sooty even george wouldnt dare to go there while your stepfather was there but anne was wrong the study was the very place where george was at that very moment the little girl had made up her mind that it was best to try and get in there and wait for a chance to open the sliding panel so she had slipped downstairs gone across the hall and tried the door of the study it was locked blow said george desperately everything is against me and timmy how can i get in i must i must she slipped out of the sidedoor near the study and went into the little yard on to which the studywindow looked could she get in there but the window was barred so that was no good either she went back again wishing she could find the key to unlock the door but it was nowhere to be seen suddenly she heard mr lenoirs voice in the room across the hall in a panic george lifted up the lid of a big wooden chest nearby and climbed hurriedly into it she closed the lid over her and knelt there waiting heart beating fast mr lenoir came across the hall he was going to his study i shall get everything ready to show my visitor when he comes he called to his wife dont disturb me at all i shall be very busy indeed george heard the sound of a key being put into the study door it turned the door opened and shut with a click but it was not locked again from the inside george knelt in the dark chest and considered matters she meant to get into that study she meant to get through the entrance into the secret passage where tim was that passage led from the study to sootys old bedroom and somewhere in that passage was timmy what she was going to do once she had timmy she didnt quite know perhaps sooty would take him to someone who could look after him for her someone on castaway hill she heard the sound of mr lenoir coughing she heard the shuffling of papers then she heard the click of a cupboard being opened and shut mr lenoir was evidently busy then he gave an exclamation of annoyance he said something in an irritable voice that sounded like now where did i put that then the door opened very suddenly and mr lenoir came out george had just time to close down the lid which she had opened to let in fresh air she knelt in the chest trembling as mr lenoir passed there and went on across the hall george suddenly knew that this was her chance mr lenoir might be gone for a few minutes and give her time to open that panel in the wall she lifted the lid of the chest and jumped out quickly she ran into the study and went to the place where sooty had pressed the panelling but before she could even run her fingers over the smooth brown oak she heard returning footsteps mr lenoir had hardly been half a minute he was coming back at once in a panic poor george looked round for somewhere to hide there was a large sofa against one wall george crawled behind it finding just room to crouch there without being seen she was hardly there before mr lenoir entered the room shut the door and sat down at his desk he switched on a big lamp over it and bent to look at some documents george hardly dared to breathe her heart bumped against her ribs and seemed to make a terrible noise it was very uncomfortable behind the sofa but she did not dare to move she could not think what in the world to do it would be terrible to be there for hours what would the others think they would soon be looking for her they were even at that moment sooty was outside the study door pondering whether to go in or to knock he knocked smartly raprap and george almost jumped out of her skin she heard mr lenoirs impatient voice whos that come in am i to have no peace there was no answer no one came in mr lenoir called again come in i say still no answer he strode to the door and flung it open angrily no one was there sooty had fled upstairs at once those tiresome children i suppose muttered mr lenoir well if any of them comes and knocks again and goes away ill punish them properly bed and bread and water for them he sounded fierce george wished she was anywhere but in his study what would he say if he knew she was only three or four feet away from him mr lenoir worked for about half an hour and poor george got stiffer and stiffer and more and more uncomfortable then she heard mr lenoir yawn and her heart felt lighter perhaps he would have a nap that would be good luck she might creep out then and try to get into the secret passage mr lenoir yawned again then he pushed his papers aside and went to the sofa he lay down on it and pulled the rug there over his knees he settled himself down as if for a good sleep the sofa creaked under him george tried to hold her breath again afraid that now he was so near to her he would certainly hear her soon a small snore came to her ears then another and another mr lenoir was asleep george waited for a few minutes the snores went on a little louder surely it would be safe now to creep from her hidingplace george began to move very cautiously and quietly she crept to the end of the sofa she squeezed out from behind it still the snores went on she stood upright and went on tiptoe to the panel that had slid aside she began to press here and there with her fingers trying to find the spot that would move the panel to one side she couldnt seem to find it she grew red with anxiety she cast a glance at the sleeping mr lenoir and worked feverishly at the panel where was the spot to press oh where was it then a stern voice came from behind her making her jump almost out of her skin and what exactly do you think you are doing my boy how dare you come into my study and mess about like this george turned round and faced mr lenoir he always thought she was a boy she didnt know what to say he looked very angry indeed and the tip of his nose was already white george was frightened she ran to the door but mr lenoir caught her before she opened it he shook her hard what were you doing in my study was it you who knocked and ran away do you think it is funny to play tricks like that ill soon teach you that it isnt he opened the door and called loudly block come here sarah tell block i want him block appeared from the kitchen his face as blank as usual mr lenoir wrote something down quickly on a piece of paper and gave it him to read block nodded ive told him to take you to your room lock you in and give you nothing but bread and water for the rest of the day said mr lenoir fiercely that will teach you to behave yourself in the future any more nonsense and ill whip you myself my father wont be very pleased when he hears youre t punishing me like this began george in a trembling voice but mr lenoir sneered pah wait till he hears from me how you have misbehaved yourself and i am sure he will agree with me now go and you will not be allowed out of your room till tomorrow i will make your excuses to your father when he comes poor george was propelled upstairs by block who was only too delighted to be punishing one of the children as she came to the door of the room george shouted to the others who were in julians room next door julian dick help me quick help me chapter fourteen a very puzzling thing julian dick and the others rushed out at once just in time to see block shove george roughly into her room and shut the door there was a click as he locked it here what are you doing cried julian indignantly block took no notice but turned to go julian caught hold of his arm and yelled loudly in his ear unlock that door at once do you hear block gave no sign whether he had or not he shook off julians hand but the boy put it back again at once getting angry mr lenoir gave me orders to punish that girl said block looking at julian out of his cold narrow eyes well you jolly well unlock that door commanded julian and he tried to snatch the key from block with sudden vicious strength the man lifted his hand and struck julian sending him half across the landing then he went swiftly downstairs to the kitchen julian looked after him a little scared the brute he said hes as strong as a horse george george whatevers happened george answered angrily from the locked bedroom she told the others everything and they listened jn silence bad luck george said dick poor old girl just as you were feeling for the opening to the passage too i must apologize for my stepfather said sooty he has such a terrible temper he wouldnt have punished you like this if he had thought you were a girl but he keeps thinking youre a boy i dont care said george i dont care about any punishment its only that im so worried about timmy well i suppose ill have to stay here now till im let out tomorrow i shant eat anything that block brings me you can tell him i dont want to see his horrid face again how shall i go to bed tonight wailed anne all my things are in your room george youll have to sleep with me said little marybelle who looked very frightened i can lend you a nightie oh dear what will georges father say when he comes i hope he will say that george is to be set free at once well he wont said george from behind the locked door hell just think ive been in one of my bad moods and he wont mind my being punished at all oh dear wish mother was coming too the others were very upset about george as well as about timmy things seemed to be going very wrong indeed at teatime they went to the schoolroom to have tea wishing they could take george some of the chocolate cake set ready for them george felt lonely when the others had gone to tea it was five oclock she was hungry she wanted timmy she was angry and miserable and longed to escape she went to the window and looked out her room looked straight down the cliffside just as bootys old room did below was the citywall that ran round the town going unevenly up and down as it followed the contours of the hillside george knew that she could not jump down to the wall she might roll off it and fall straight down to the marsh below that would be horrible then she suddenly remembered the ropeladder that they used when they got down into the pit each day it had at first been kept in marybelles room on the shelf in the cupboard but since the children had been scared by knowing that someone had tried the handle of the door one morning they had decided to keep the ladder in georges room for safety they were afraid that perhaps block might go snooping round marybelles room and find it so george had smuggled it to her own room and hidden it in her suitcase which she had locked now her hands shaking a little with excitement she unlocked her suitcase and took out the ropeladder she might perhaps escape out of the window with it she looked out again the rope in her hands but windows overlooked the citywall just there the kitchen too must be just below and maybe block would see her climbing down that would never do she must wait till it was twilight when the others came back she told them what she was going to do speaking in a low voice through the door ill get down on the wall walk along it for some way and then jump down and creep back she said you get some food for me somehow and ill have it then tonight when everyone has gone to bed ill get into the study again and find the way through to the secret passage sooty can help me then i can get timmy right said sooty wait till its fairly dark before you go down the ladder though block has gone to his room with a bad headache but sarah and harriet are in the kitchen and you dont want to be seen so when the twilight hung like a soft purple curtain over the house george slid down the ropeladder out of the window she only needed to let about a quarter of it out for it was far too long for such a short distance she fastened it to the legs of her heavy little oak bed then she climbed out of the window and slid quietly down the ropeladder she passed the kitchen window which fortunately had its blinds drawn down now she landed squarely on the old wall she had brought a torch with her so that she could see she debated with herself what to do she did not want to run any risk of coming up against either block or mr lenoir perhaps it would be best to walk along the wall till she came to some part of the town she knew then she could jump off and make her way cautiously back up the hill looking out for the others so she began to walk along the broad top of the old wall it was very rough and uneven in places and many stones were missing but her torch showed a steady light and she did not miss her footing the wall ran round some stables then round the backs of some quaint old shops then it ran round a big yard belonging to some house and then round the house itself then down it went around some more houses george could look into those windows that were not curtained lights shone out from them now it was queer being able to see into the windows without being seen a little family sat at a meal in one room their faces cheerful and happy an old man sat alone in another leading and smoking a woman sat listening to a wireless knitting as george silently walked on the wall outside her window nobody heard her nobody saw her then she came to another house a big one the wall ran close against it for it was built where the cliff ran steeply down to the marsh just there there was a lighted window there george glanced in as she passed then she stood still in great surprise surely surely that was block in there he had his back to her but she could have sworn it was block the same head the same ears the same shoulders who was he talking to george tried to see and all at once she knew he was talking to mr barling whom everyone said was a smuggler the smuggler of castaway hill but wait a minute could it be block block was deaf and this man evidently wasnt he was listening to mr barling that was plain and was answering him though george could not hear the words of course i oughtnt to be snooping like this said george to herself but its very strange very puzzling and very interesting if only the man would turn round id know at once if it was block but he didnt turn he just sat in his chair his back to george mr barling his long face lighted up by the nearby lamp was talking animatedly and block if it was block was listening intently and nodding his head in agreement every now and again george felt puzzled if she only knew for certain that it was block but why should he be talking to mr barling and wasnt he stone deaf after all then george jumped down from the wall into a dark little passage and made her way through the town up to smugglers top outside the front door hiding in the shadows was sooty he laid his hand on georges arm making her jump come on in ive left the sidedoor open weve got a fine spread for you the two slipped in at the sidedoor tiptoed past the study across the hall and up to julians bedroom truly there was a spread there i went and raided the larder said sooty with satisfaction harriet was out and sarah had run along to the post block has gone to bed for a rest because he said he had such an awful headache oh said george then it couldnt have been block i saw and yet im as certain as certain can be that it was whatever do you mean asked the others in surprise george sat down on the floor and began to gobble up cakes and tarts for she was terribly hungry between her mouthfuls she told them how she had got out of the window walked along the citywall and found herself unexpectedly by mr barlings house and i looked into a lighted window there and saw block talking to mr barling and listening to him and answering him she said the others could not believe this did you see his face asked julian no said george but im certain it was block go and peep into his room and see if hes there sooty he wouldnt be back yet from mr barlings because he had a glass full of something or other which would take him some time to drink go and peep sooty vanished he came back quickly hes in bed he said i could see the shape of his body and the dark patch of his head are there two blocks then whatever does this mean chapter fifteen strange happenings it certainly was very puzzling most of all to george who felt so certain it had been block talking to the wellknown smuggler the others did not feel so certain especially as george admitted that she had not seen his face is my father here yet asked george suddenly remembering that he was supposed to come that evening yes just arrived said sooty just before you came i nearly got run over by the car just hopped aside in time i was out there waiting for you what are our plans asked george til have to get timmy tonight or hell be frantic i think id better go and climb back through my window again now in case block comes along and finds ive disappeared ill wait till everyone is in bed and then ill slip out of the window again and you must let me into the house sooty please then ill go to the study with you and you must open the secret way for me then ill find timmy and everything will be all right i dont see that everything will be all right said sooty doubtfully but anyway your plan is the only one to follow youd better get back into your room now if youve had enough to eat ill take a few buns back with me said george stuffing them into her pocket sooty come and knock at my door when everyone is in bed and ill know then that its safe for me to slip out of the window and come into the house again it wasnt long before george was back in her room once more just in time too for block appeared a little while after with a plate of dry bread and a glass of water he unlocked the door and put them on the table your supper he said george looked at his blank face and disliked it so much that she felt she must do something about it so she took up the water and threw it deftly at the back of his head it dripped down his neck and made him jump block took a step towards her his eyes gleaming but julian and dick were by the door and he did not dare to strike her ill pay you out for that he said see you will never get that dog of yours back again he went out and locked the door julian called through as soon as he had gone what did you do that for you idiot hes a bad enemy to make i know i just couldnt help it somehow said george forlornly i wish i hadnt now the others had to go down to see mr lenoir they left george feeling lonely it was horrid to be locked up like this even though she could escape through the window whenever she wanted to she listened for the others to come back they soon did and reported their meeting with georges father uncle quentin is awfully tired and a bit cross and frightfully annoyed with you for misbehaving said julian through the door he said you were to be locked up the whole of tomorrow too if you dont apologize george didnt mean to apologize she couldnt bear mr lenoir with his false smiles and laughter and his sudden queer rages she said nothing weve got to go and have our supper now said sooty well save you some of it as soon as block goes out of the room look out for a knocking on your door tonight itll be me telling you everyones in bed george lay on her bed thinking many things puzzled her she couldnt get them straight somehow the signaller in the tower the queer man block mr barlings talk to a man who looked so like block but block was all the time in his bed at home as she lay thinking her eyes closed and she fell asleep anne went to bed with marybelle and came to whisper goodnight to her the boys all went into the next room for sooty was now to share julians and dicks bedroom george woke up enough to say goodnight and then slept again at midnight she awoke with a jump someone was knocking softly and impatiently on her door it was sooty coming whispered george through the door and took up her torch she went to the window and was soon safely down the ropeladder she jumped down from the wall and went to the sidedoor of the house sooty was there she slipped in thankfully everyones gone to bed whispered sooty i thought your father and my stepfather were never going they stayed talking in the study for ages gome on lets go there said george impatiently they went to the studydoor and sooty turned the handle it was locked again he pushed hard but it wasnt a bit of good it was well and truly locked we might have thought of that said george in despair blow blow blow what are we to do now sooty thought for a few moments then he spoke in a low voice in georges ear theres only one thing left to do george i must creep into your fathers room my old bedroom when he is asleep and i must get into the cupboard there open the entrance to the secret passage and slip in that way ill find timmy and bring him back the same way hoping that your father wont wake oh would you really do that for me said george gratefully you are a good friend sooty would you rather i did it no i know the way up and down that passage better than you do said sooty its a bit frightening to be all alone there at midnight too ill go george went with sooty up the stairs across the wide landing to the door at the end of the passage that led to sootys old room where georges father was now sleeping when they got there george pulled his arm sooty the buzzer will go as soon as you open the door and it will wake my father and warn him idiot i disconnected it as soon as i knew my room was to be changed said sooty scornfully as if i wouldnt think of that he opened the door that led into the passage he crept up to his old room the door was shut he and george listened intently your father sounds a bit restless said sooty ill wait my chance to creep in george and then as soon as possible slip into the cupboard and open the secret passage to find tim as soon as ive got timmy ill bring him along to you you could wait in marybelles room if you liked annes there too george crept into the room next door where anne and marybelle lay fast asleep she left the door open so that she might hear when sooty returned how lovely it would be to have dear old timmy again he would lick her and lick her sooty crept into the room where georges father lay halfasleep he made no sound he knew every creaking board and avoided them he made his way quietly to a big chair meaning to hide behind it till he was certain georges father was sound asleep for some time the man in the bed tossed and turned he was tired with his long journey and his mind was excited with his talk with mr lenoir he muttered now and again and sooty began to feel he would never be sound asleep he grew sleepy himself and yawned silently at last georges father grew quiet and peaceful no more creaks came from the bed sooty cautiously moved out from behind the chair then suddenly something startled him he heard a sound over by the window but what could it be it was a very small sound like a tiny creak of a door the night was rather dark but the window its curtains pulled right back could easily be seen as a square of grey sooty fixed his eyes on it was someone opening the window no the window did not move but something queer was happening under it near the sill a big windowseat was built in under the window wide and comfortable sooty knew it well he had sat on it hundreds of times to look out of the window now what was happening to it it looked as if the top or lid of the seat was slowly moving upwards bit by bit sooty was puzzled he had never known it could be opened like that it had always been screwed down and he had thought it was just a seat and nothing else but now it looked as if someone had unscrewed the top and had hidden himself inside lifting up the top like a lid when he thought it was safe sooty stared at the upwardmoving lid quite fascinated who was in there why had he hidden it was rather frightening seeing the lid move slowly bit by bit at last the lid was wide open and rested against the windowpane a big figure cautiously and slowly got out not making the slightest sound sooty felt his hair rising up on his head he was afraid terribly afraid he could not utter a sound the figure tiptoed over to the bed he made a quick and sudden movement and there was a stifled sound from georges father sooty guessed he had been gagged so that he could not cry out still the boy could not move or speak he had never been so scared in all his life the intruder lifted the limp body from the bed and went to the windowseat he put georges father into the darkness there what he had done to make him unable to struggle sooty didnt know he only knew that poor georges father was being put down in the windowseat and couldnt seem to move a hand to help himself the boy suddenly found his voice hie he yelled hie what are you doing who are you he remembered his torch and switched it on he saw a face he knew and cried out in surprise mr barling then someone hit him a hard blow on the head and he remembered nothing more at all he did not know that he was lifted into the windowseat too he did not know that the intruder followed after him he knew nothing george awake in the next room suddenly heard sootys voice crying out hie she heard hie what are you doing who are you and then as she slipped out of bed she heard the next cry mr barling george was extremely startled what was going on next door she fumbled about for her torch anne and marybelle were still asleep george could not find her torch she fell over a chair and banged her head when at last she had found her torch she tiptoed trembling to the door she shone her torch and saw that the door next to hers was a little ajar just as sooty had left it when he had crept inside she listened there was absolutely no sound at all now she had heard a small bumping noise after sootys last cry but she didnt know what it was she suddenly put her head round the door of her fathers room and shone her torch again she stared in surprise the bed was empty the room was empty there was no one there at all she flashed her torch all round she opened the cupboard door fearfully she looked under the bed she was in fact extremely brave at last she sank down on the windowseat frightened and puzzled where was her father where was sooty whatever had been happening here that night chapter sixteen next morning as george sat by the window on the very seat into which everyone had unaccountably disappeared though she did not know it she heard a faint sound from the passage quick as lightning the girl slipped under the bed someone was creeping down the long passage george lay silently on the floor lifting the valance a little to try and see who it was what queer things were going on tonight someone came in at the door someone stopped there as if to look and listen then the someone crept over to the windowseat george watched and listened straining her eyes in the darkness she dimly saw the someone outlined against the grey square of the window he was bent over the windowseat he showed no light at all but he made some curious little sounds first came the sound of his fingers tapping about on the closed lid of the seat then came the clink of something metallic and a very faint squeaking george could not imagine what the man if it was a man was doing for about five minutes the someone worked away at his task in the darkness then as quietly as he had come he went away george couldnt help thinking it was block though his outline against the darkgrey of the window was too dim to recognize but he had once given a little cough exactly like block so often gave it must be block but whatever was he doing in her fathers room at night on the windowseat george felt as if she was in a bad dream the queerest things happened and kept on happening and they didnt seem to make sense at all where was her father had he left his room and gone wandering over the house where was sooty and why had he called out he wouldnt have shouted out like that surely if her father had been asleep in the room george lay under the bed shivering for a little while longer then she rolled out softly and went out of the door she crept down the long passage to the end she opened the door there and peeped out the whole house was in darkness little sounds came to georges ears a window rattling faintly the creak of some bit of furniture but nothing else she had only one thought in her mind and that was to get to the boys room and tell them the mysterious things that had happened soon she was across the landing and had slipped through the door of julians bedroom he and dick were awake of course waiting for sooty to come with timmy and george but only george arrived a scared george with a very curious story to tell she wrapped herself in the eiderdown on julians bed and told what had happened in whispers they were amazed uncle quentin gone sooty disappeared someone creeping into the room and fiddling about on the windowseat what did it all mean well come to uncle quentins room with you straight away now said julian pulling on a dressinggown and hunting about for his slippers ive got a feeling that things are getting pretty serious they all padded off to the other rooms they went into marybelles room and woke her and anne both little girls felt scared soon all five children were in the next room from which georges father and sooty had so strangely vanished julian shut the door drew the curtains and switched on the light at once they all felt better it was so horrid to grope about in the dark with torches they looked round the silent room there was nothing there to show them how the others had disappeared the bed was crumpled and empty on the floor lay bootys torch where it had fallen george repeated again what she had thought she had heard sooty call out but it made no sense to anyone why call out mr barlings name when there was only your father in the room said julian surely mr barling wasnt hiding here that would be nonsense he had nothing to do with your father george i know but im sure it was mr barlings name that i heard sooty call out said george do you think oh yes do you think mr barling could possibly havecreptthrough the secret opening in the cupboard meaning to do some dirty work or other and have gone back the same way taking the others with him because they discovered him this seemed a likely explanation though not a very good one they all went to the cupboard and opened it they groped between the clothes for the secret opening but the little iron handle set there to pull on the stone at the back was gone someone had removed it and now the secret passage could not be entered for there was no way of opening it just there look at that said julian in astonishment someones been tampering with that too no george the midnight visitor whoever he was didnt go back that way george looked pale she had been hoping to go and fetch timmy by slipping through the secret opening in the cupboard now she couldnt she longed for timmy with all her heart and felt that if only the big faithful dog were with her things would seem much brighter im sure mr lenoir is at the bottom of all this said dick and block too i bet that was block you saw in here tonight doing something in the dark george i bet he and mr lenoir are hand in glove with each other over something well then we cant possibly go and tell them what has happened said julian if they are at the bottom of all these queer happenings it would be foolish to go and tell them what we know and we cant tell your mother marybelle because she would naturally go to your father about it its a puzzle to know what to do anne began to cry marybelle frightened and puzzled at once began to sob too george felt tears pricking the backs of her eyelids but she blinked them away george never cried i want sooty wept marybelle who adored her cheeky daring brother wheres he gone im sure hes in danger i do want sooty well rescue him tomorrow dont you worry said julian kindly we cant do anything tonight though theres nobody at smugglers top we can possibly get advice or help from as things are i vote we go to bed sleep on it and make plans in the morning by that time sooty and uncle quentin may have turned up again if they havent mr lenoir will have to be told by someone and well see how he behaves if hes surprised and upset well soon know if he has had anything to do with this mystery or not hell have to do something go to the police or have the house turned upside down to find the missing people well soon see what happens everyone felt a little comforted after this long speech julian sounded cheerful and firm though he didnt feel at all happy really he knew better than any of the others that something very strange and probably dangerous was going on at smugglers top he wished the girls were not there now listen he said george you go and sleep with anne and marybelle next door lock your door and keep the light on dick and i will sleep here in bootys old room also with the light on so youll know we are quite nearby it was comforting to know that the two boys were so near the three girls went at last into marybelles room tired out anne and marybelle got into bed again and george lay down on a small but comfortable couch pulling a thick rug over her in spite of all the worry and excitement the girls were asleep in a half a minute quite exhausted the boys talked a little as they lay in bootys old bed where their uncle quentin had been asleep some time before julian did not think anything more would happen that night he and dick fell asleep but julian was ready to wake at the slightest noise next morning they were awakened by a most surprised sarah who had come in to draw the curtains and bring georges father a pot of earlymorning tea she could not believe her eyes when she saw the two boys in the visitors bed and no visitor whats all this said sarah gaping wheres your uncle why are you here oh well explain later said julian who did not want to enter into any details with sarah who was a bit of a chatterbox you can leave the tea sarah wed like it yes but wheres your uncle is he in your room said the puzzled sarah whats up you can go and look in our room if you like and see if hes there said dick wanting to get rid of the amazed woman she disappeared thinking that the household must be going mad she left the hot tea behind though and the boys at once took it into the girls room george unlocked the door for them they took it in turns to sip the hot tea from the one cup presently sarah came back with harriet and block blocks face was as blank as usual theres nobody in your room master julian began sarah then block gave a sudden exclamation and stared at george angrily he had thought she was locked in her room and here she was in marybelles room drinking tea how did you get out he demanded til tell mr lenoir youre in disgrace shut up said julian dont you dare to speak to my cousin like that i believe youre mixed up in this curious business clear out block whether block heard or not he gave no sign of going julian got up his face set clear out of this room he said narrowing his eyes do you hear i have a feeling that the police might be interested in you block now clear out harriet and sarah gave little shrieks the sudden mystery was too much for them they gazed at block and began to back out of the room fortunately block went too casting an evil look at the determined julian i shall go to mr lenoir said block and disappeared in a few minutes along came mr and mrs lenoir to marybelles room mrs lenoir looked scared out of her life mr lenoir looked puzzled and upset now whats all this he began block has been to me with a most curious tale says your father has disappeared george and and so has sooty suddenly wailed marybelle bursting into tears again sootys gone hes gone too mrs lenoir gave a cry what do you mean how can he have gone marybelle what do you mean marybelle i think i had better take charge of the telling said julian who was not going to let the little girl give away all the things they knew after all mr lenoir was probably at the bottom of everything and it would be foolish to tell him what they suspected about him julian tell me what has happened quickly begged mrs lenoir looking really upset uncle quentin disappeared from his bed last night and sooty has vanished too said julian shortly they may turn up of course julian you are keeping back something said mr lenoir suddenly watching the boy sharply you will tell us everything please how dare you keep anything back at a moment like this tell him julian tell him wailed marybelle julian looked obstinate and glared at marybelle the tip of mr lenoirs nose went white i am going to the police he said perhaps you will talk to them my boy they will knock some sense into you julian was surprised why i shouldnt have thought you would want to go to the police he blurted out youve got too many secrets to hide chapter seventeen more and more puzzling mr lenoir stared in the utmost amazement at julian there was a dead silence after this remark julian could have kicked himself for making it but he couldnt unsay it now mr lenoir opened his mouth to say something at last when footsteps came to the door it was block come in block said mr lenoir there seem to have been queer happenings here block did not appear to hear and remained outside the door mr lenoir beckoned him in impatiently no said julian firmly what we have to say is not to be said in front of block mr lenoir we dont like him and we dont trust him what do you mean cried mr lenoir angrily what do you know about my servants ive known block for years before he came into my service and hes a most trustworthy fellow he cant help being deaf and that makes him irritable at times julian remained obstinate he caught an angry gleam in blocks cold eyes and glared back well this is incredible said mr lenoir trying not to lose his temper i cant think whats come over everybody disappearing like this and now you children talking to me as if i wasnt master in my own house i insist that you tell me all you know id rather tell it to the police said julian his eye on block but block showed no trace of expression on his face go away block said mr lenoir at last seeing that there was no hope of getting anything out of julian while the servant was there youd better all come down to my study this is getting more and more mysterious if the police have got to know you may as well tell me first i dont want to look a complete idiot in my own house in front of them julian couldnt help feeling a bit puzzled mr lenoir was not behaving as he had thought he might behave he seemed sincerely puzzled and upset and he was evidently planning to get the police in himself surely he wouldnt do that if he had had a hand in the disappearances julian was lost in bewilderment again mrs lenoir was now crying quietly with marybelle sobbing beside her mr lenoir put an arm round his wife and kissed marybelle suddenly appearing very much nicer than he had ever seemed before dont worry he said in a gentle voice well soon get to the bottom of this if i have to get the whole of the police force in i think i know whos at the bottom of it all that surprised julian even more he and the others followed mr lenoir down to his study it was still locked mr lenoir opened it and pushed aside a great pile of papers that were on his desk now what do you know he said to julian quietly the children noticed that the top of his nose was no longer white evidently he had got over his burst of temper well sir i think this is a queer house with a lot of queer things happening in it said julian not quite knowing how to begin im afraid sir you wont like me telling the police all i know julian dont speak in riddles said mr lenoir impatiently you act as if i were a criminal in fear of the police im not what goes on in this house well the signalling from the tower for instance said julian watching mr lenoirs face mr lenoir gaped it was clear that he was immensely astonished he stared at julian and mrs lenoir cried out suddenly signalling what signalling julian explained he told how sooty had discovered the lightflashing first and then how he and dick had gone with him to the tower when they had seen the flashing again he described the line of tiny pricking lights across the marsh from the seaward side mr lenoir listened intently he asked questions about dates and times he heard how the boys had followed the signaller to blocks room where he had disappeared got out of the window i suppose said mr lenoir blocks got nothing to do with this you can rest assured of that he is most faithful and loyal and has been a great help to me while he has been here i have an idea that mr barling is at the bottom of all this he cant signal from his house to the sea because its not quite high enough up the hill and is in the wrong position he must have been using my tower to signal from coming himself to do it too he knows all the secret ways of this house better than i do it would be easy for him to come here whenever he wanted to the children thought at once that probably mr barling had been the signaller they stared at mr lenoir they were all beginning to think that he really and truly had nothing to do with the queer goingson after all i dont see why block shouldnt know all this said mr lenoir getting up its plain to me that barling could explain a lot of the queer things that have been happening ill see if block has ever suspected anything julian pursed his lips together if mr lenoir was going to tell everything to block who certainly must be in the plot somehow he wasnt going to tell him anything more ill see what block thinks about everything and then if we cant solve this mystery ourselves well get in the police said mr lenoir going out of the room julian did not want to say anything much in front of mrs lenoir so he changed the subject completely what about breakfast he said tm feeling hungry so they all went to have breakfast though marbelle could eat nothing at all because she kept thinking of poor sooty i think said julian when they were alone at the table i rather think well do a little mysterysolving ourselves id like a jolly good look round that room of your fathers george to begin with there must be some other way of getting out of there besides the secret passage we know what do you think happened there last night said dick well i imagine that sooty went there and hid to wait until it was safe to try and get into the secret passage as soon as uncle quentin was asleep said julian thoughtfully and while he was hiding someone came into that room from somewhere to kidnap uncle quentin why i dont know but thats what i think then sooty yelled out in surprise and got knocked on the head or something then he and uncle quentin were kidnapped together and taken off through some secret way we dont know yes said george and it was mr barling who kidnapped them i distinctly heard sooty yell out mr barling he must have switched on his torch and seen him they are quite probably hidden somewhere in mr barlings house said anne suddenly yes said julian why didnt i think of that why thats just where they would be of course ive a jolly good mind to go down and have a look oh let me come too begged george no said julian certainly not this is rather a dangerous adventure and mr barling is a bad and dangerous man you and marybelle are certainly not to come ill take dick you are absolutely meanl began george her eyes flashing arent i as good as a boy im going to come well if youre as good as a boy which i admit you are said julian cant you stay and keep an eye on anne and marybelle for us we dont want them kidnapped too oh dont go george said anne stay here with us i think its mad to go anyhow said george mr barling wouldnt let you in and if you did get in you wouldnt be able to find all the secret places in his house there must be as many and more as there are here julian couldnt help thinking george wag right still it was worth trying he and dick set out after breakfast and went down the hill to mr barlings but when they got there they found the whole house shut up nobody answered their knocking and ringing the curtains were drawn across the closed windows and no smoke came from the chimney mr barlings gone away for a holiday said the gardener who was working in the next door flowerbeds went this morning he did in his car all his servants have got a holiday too oh said julian blankly was there anyone with him in the car a man and a boy for instance the gardener looked surprised at this question and shook his head no he was alone and drove off himself thanks said julian and walked back with dick to smugglers top this was queer mr barling had shut up the house and gone off without his captives then what had he done with them and why on earth had he kidnapped uncle quentin julian remembered that mr lenoir had not put forward any reason for that did he know one and hadnt wanted to say what it was it was all most puzzling meantime george had been doing a little snooping round on her own she had slipped into uncle quentins room and had had a really good look round everywhere to see if by chance there was another secret passage sooty hadnt known about she had tapped the walls she had turned back the carpet and examined every inch of the floor she had tried the cupboard again and wished she could get through into the secret passage there and find timmy the study door downstairs was again locked and she did not dare to tell mr lenoir about timmy and ask his help george was just about to leave the quiet room when she noticed something on the floor near the window she bent to pick it up it was a small screw she looked round where had it come from at first she couldnt see any screws of the same size at all then her eyes slid down to the windowseat there were screws there screwing down the top oaken plank to the under ones that supported it had the screw come out of the windowseat why should it anyway the others there were all screwed down tightly she examined one then she gave a low cry ones missing the one in the middle of this side now just let me think she remembered last night she remembered how someone had crept in while she had hidden under the bed and had fiddled about by the window bending over the polished windowseat she remembered the little noises the metallic clinks and the tiny squeaks it was screws being screwed into the seat someone screwed down the windowseat last night and in the darkness dropped one of the little screws thought george beginning to feel excited why did he screw it down to hide something whats in this windowseat it sounds hollow enough it never lifted up i know that it was always screwed down because i remember looking for a cupboard under it like the one we have at home and there wasnt one george began to feel certain there was some secret about the windowseat she rushed off to get a screwdriver she found one and hurried back she shut the door and locked it behind her in case block should come snooping around then she set to work with the screwdriver what would she find in the windowseat she could hardly wait to see chapter eighteen curious discoveries just as she had unscrewed almost the last screw there came a tapping at the door george jumped and stiffened she did not answer afraid that it was block or mr lenoir then to her great relief she heard julians voice george are you in here the little girl hurried across to the door and unlocked it the boys came in looking surprised followed by anne and marybelle george shut the door and locked it again mr barlings gone away and shut up the house said julian so thats that what on earth are you doing george unscrewing this windowseat said george and told them about the screw she had found on the floor they all crowded round her excited good for you george said dick tlere let me finish the unscrewing no thanks this is my job said george she took out the last screw then she lifted the edge of the windowseat it came up like a lid everyone peered inside rather scared what would they see to their great surprise and disappointment they saw nothing but an empty cupboard it was as if the windowseat was a box with the lid screwed down for people to sit on well what a disappointment said dick he shut down the lid i dont expect you heard anyone screwing down the lid really george it might have been your imagination well it wasnt said george shortly she opened the lid again she got right into the boxlike windowseat and stamped and pressed with her feet and quite suddenly there came a small creaking noise and the bottom of the empty windowseat fell downwards like a trapdoor on a hinge george gasped and clutched at the side she kicked about in air for a moment and then scrambled out everyone looked down in silence they looked down a straight yawning hole which however came to an end only about eight feet down there it appeared to widen out and no doubt entered a secret passage which ran into one of the underground tunnels with which the whole hill was honeycombed it might even run to mr barlings house look at that said dick who would have thought of that i bet even old sooty didnt know about this shall we go down said george shall we see where it goes to we might find old timmy there came the noise of someone trying the handle of the door it was locked then there was an impatient rapping and a cross voice called out sharply why is this door locked open it at once what are you doing in here its father whispered marybelle with wide eyes id better unlock the door george shut the lid of the windowseat down at once very quietly she did not want mr lenoir to see their latest discovery when the door was opened mr lenoir saw the children standing about or sitting on the windowseat ive had a good talk to block he said and as i thought he doesnt know a thing about all the goingson here he was most amazed to hear about the signalling from the tower but he doesnt think its mr barling he thinks it may be a plot of some sort against me oh said the children who felt that they would not believe block so readily as mr lenoir appeared to its quite upset block said mr lenoir he feels really sick and ive told him to go and have a rest till we decide what to do next the children felt hat block would not be so easily upset as all that they all suspected at once that he would not really go to rest but would probably sneak out on business of his own ive some work to attend to for a little while said mr lenoir ive rung up the police but unluckily the inspector is out he will ring me directly he comes back now can you keep out of mischief till ive finished my work the children thought that was a silly question they made no reply mr lenoir gave one of his sudden smiles and little laughs and went im going to pop along to blocks room and see if he really is there said julian as soon as mr lenoir was out of sight he went to the wing where the staff bedrooms were and stopped softly outside blocks the door was a little ajar and julian could see through the crack he saw the shape of blocks body in the bed and the dark patch that was his head the curtains were drawn across the window to keep out the light but there was enough to see all this julian sped back to the others yes hes in bed all right he said well hes safe for a bit shall we have a shot at getting down the windowseat hole id dearly like to see where it leads to oh yes said everyone but it was not an easy job to drop eight feet down without being terribly jolted julian went first and was very much jarred he called up to dick well have to get a bit of rope and tie it to something up there and let it hang down the hole its an awful business to let yourself drop down but just as dick went to find a rope julian called up again oh its all right ive just seen something there are niches carved into the sides of the hole niches you can put foot or hand into i didnt see them before you can use them to help you down so down went everyone one after another feeling for the niches and finding them george missed one or two clawed wildly at the air and dropped down the last few feet landing with rather a bump but she was not hurt as they had thought the hole led to another secret passage in the house but this one went straight downwards by means of steps so that very soon they were well below the level of the house then they came into themaze of tunnels that honeycombed the hill they stopped look here we cant possibly go any farther said julian we shall get lost we havent got sooty with us now and marybelle isnt any good at finding the way it would be dangerous to wander about listen said dick suddenly in a low voice theres someone coming they could hear the hollow sound of footsteps coming from a tunnel to the left of them they all shrank back into the shadows and julian switched off his torch its two people whispered anne as two figures came out of the nearby tunnel one was very tall and long the other yes surely the other was block if it wasnt block it was someone the exact image of him the men were talking in low voices answering one another how could it be block though if he could hear as well as that anyway block was asleep in bed it was hardly ten minutes since julian had seen him there were there two blocks then thought george as she had once thought before the men disappeared into another tunnel and the bright light of their lanterns disappeared gradually the muffled rumble of their voices echoed back shall we follow them said dick of course not said julian we might lose them and lose ourselves too and supposing they suddenly turned back and found us following them we should be in a horrid fix tm sure the first man was mr barling said anne suddenly i couldnt see his face because the light of the lantern wasnt on it but he seemed just like mr barling awfully tall and long everywhere but mr barlings gone away said marybelle supposed to have gone away said george it looks as if hes come back if it was him i wonder where those two have gone to see my father and sooty do you think quite likely said julian come on lets get back we simply darent wander about by ourselves in these old tunnels they run for miles sooty said and cross one another and go up and down and round about even right down to the marsh we should never never find our way out if we got lost they turned to go back they came to the end of the steps they had been climbing and found themselves at the bottom of the windowseat hole it was quite easy to pull themselves up by the niches in the sides of the hole soon they were all in the room again glad to see the sunshine streaming in at the window they looked out the marshes were beginning to be wreathed in mist once more though up here the hill was golden with sunlight tm going to put the screws back into the windowseat again said julian picking up the screwdriver and shutting down the lid then if block comes here he wont guess weve found this new secret place im pretty certain that he unscrewed the seat so that mr barling could get into this room and then screwed it down again so that no one would guess what had happened he quickly put in the screws then he looked at his watch almost dinnertime and im jolly hungry i wish old sooty was here and uncle quentin i do hope theyre all right and timmy too said julian i wonder if block is still in bed or wandering about the tunnels im going to have a peep again he soon came back puzzled yes hes there all right safe in bed its jolly funny block did not appear at lunch time sarah said he had asked not to be disturbed if he did not appear he does get the most awful sick headaches she said maybe hell be all right this afternoon she badly wanted to talk about everything but the children had decided not to tell her anything she was very nice and they liked her but somehow they didnt trust anyone at smugglers top so sarah got nothing out of them at all and retired in rather a huff julian went down to speak to mr lenoir after the meal he felt that even if the inspector of police was not at the policestation somebody else must be informed he was very worried about his uncle and sooty he couldnt help wondering if mr lenoir had made up the bit about the inspector being away to put off time mr lenoir was looking cross when julian knocked at his studydoor oh its you he said to julian i was expecting block ive rung and rung for him the bell rings in his room and i cant imagine why he doesnt come i want him to come to the policestation with me good thought julian then he spoke aloud ill go and hurry him up for you mr lenoir i know where his room is julian ran up the stairs and went to the little landing up which the backstairs went to the staff bedrooms he pushed open blocks door block was apparently still asleep in bed julian called loudly then remembered that block was deaf so he went over to the bed and put his hand rather roughly on the hump of the shoulder between the clothes but it was curiously soft julian drew his hand away and looked down sharply then he got a real shock there was no block in the bed there was a big ball of some sort painted black to look like a head almost under the sheets and when julian threw back the covers he saw instead of blocks body a large lumpy bolster cleverly moulded to look like a curved body thats the trick block plays when he wants to slip off anywhere and yet pretend hes still here said julian so it was block we saw in the tunnel this morning and it must have been block that george saw talking to mr barling yesterday when she looked through the window hes not deaf either hes a very clever sly doublefaced deceitful rogue chapter nineteen mr barling talks meantime what was happening to uncle quentin and sooty many strange things uncle quentin had been gagged and drugged so that he could neither struggle nor make any noise when mr barling had crept so unexpectedly into his room it was easy to drop him down the hole in the windowseat he fell with a thud that bruised him considerably then poor sooty had been dropped down too and after them had come mr barling climbing deftly down by the help of the niches in the sides someone else was down there to help mr barling not block who had been left to screw down the windowseat so that no one might guess where the victims had been taken but a hardfaced servant belonging to mr barling had to bring this boy too its lenoirs son said mr barling snooping about in the room well it will serve lenoir right for working against me the two were halfcarried halfdragged down the long flight of steps and taken into the tunnels below mr barling stopped and took a ball of string from his pocket he tossed it to his servant here you are tie the end to that nail over there and let the string unravel as we go i know the way quite well but block doesnt and hell be coming along to bring food to our couple of prisoners tomorrow dont want him to lose his way we can tie the string up again just before we get to the place im taking them to so that they wont see it and use it to escape by the servant tied the string to the nail that mr barling pointed out and then as he went along he let the ball unravel the string would then serve as a guide to anyone not knowing the way otherwise it would be very dangerous to wander about in the underground tunnels for some of them ran for miles after about eight minutes the little company came to a kind of rounded cave set in the side of a big but rather low tunnel here had been put a bench with some rugs a box to serve as a table and jug of water nothing else sooty by now was coming round from his blow on the head the other prisoner however still lay unconscious breathing heavily no good talking to him said mr barling he wont be all right till tomorrow well come and talk to him then ill bring block sooty had been put on the floor he suddenly sat up and put his hand to his aching head he couldnt imagine where he was he looked up and saw mr barling and then suddenly he remembered everything but how had he got here in this dark cave mr barling he said whats all this what did you hit me for why have you brought me here punishment for a small boy who cant keep his nose out of things that dont concern him said mr barling in a horrid sarcastic voice youll be company for our friend on the bench there hell sleep till the morning im afraid you can tell him all about it then and say ill be back to have a little hearttoheart talk with him and see here pierre you do know dont you the foolishness of trying to wander about these old passages ive brought you to a littleknown one and if you want to lose yourself and never be heard of again well try wandering about thats all sooty looked pale he did know the danger of wandering about those lost old tunnels this one he was in he was sure he didnt know at all he was about to ask a few more questions when mr barling turned quickly on his heel and went off with his servant they took the lantern with them and left the boy in darkness he yelled after them hie you beasts leave me a light but there was no answer sooty heard the footfalls going farther and farther away and then there was silence and darkness the boy felt in his pocket for his torch but it wasnt there he had dropped it in his bedroom he groped his way over to the bench and felt about for georges father he wished he would wake up it was so horrid to be there in the darkness it was cold too sooty crept under the rugs and cuddled close to the unconscious man he longed with all his heart for him to wake up from somewhere there sounded the dripdripdrip of water after a time sooty couldnt bear it he knew it was only drops dripping off the roof of the tunnel in a damp place but he felt he couldnt bear it dripdripdrip dripdripdrip if only it would stop ill have to wake georges father up thought the boy desperately i must talk to someone he began to shake the sleeping man wondering what to call him for he did not know his surname he couldnt call him georges father then he remembered that the others called him uncle quentin and he began yelling the name in the drugged mans ear uncle quentin uncle quentin wake up do wake up oh wont you please wake up uncle quentin stirred at last he opened his eyes in the darkness and listened to the urgent voice in his ear feeling faintly puzzled uncle quentin wake up and speak to me im scared said the voice uncle quentin the man thought vaguely that it must be julian or dick he put his arm round sooty and dragged him close to him its all right go to sleep he said whats the matter julian or is it dick go to sleep he fell asleep again himself for he was still halfdrugged but sooty felt comforted now he shut his eyes feeling certain that he couldnt possibly go to sleep but he did almost at once he slept soundly all through the night and was only awakened by uncle quentin moving on the bench the puzzled man was amazed to find his bed so un expectedly hard he was even more amazed to find someone in bed with him for he remembered nothing at all he stretched out his hand to switch on the readinglamp which had been beside his bed the night before but it wasnt there strange he felt about and touched sootys face who was this beside him he began to feel extremely puzzled he felt ill too what could have happened are you awake said sootys voice oh uncle quentin im so glad youre awake i hope you dont mind me calling you that but i dont know your surname i only know you are georges father and julians uncle well who are you said uncle quentin in wonder sooty began to tell him everything uncle quentin listened in the utmost amazement but why have we been kidnapped like this he said astonished and angry i never heard of such a thing in my life i dont know why mr barling has kidnapped you but i know he took me because i happened to see what he was doing said sooty anyway hes coming back this morning with block and he said he would have a hearttoheart talk with you well have to wait here im afraid we cant possibly find our way to safety in the darkness through this maze of tunnels so they waited and in due course mr barling did come bringing block with him block carried some food which was very welcome to the prisoners you beast block said sooty at once as he saw the servant in the light of the lantern how dare you help in this you wait till my stepfather hears about it unless hes in it too hold your tongue said block sooty stared at him so you can hear he said all this time youve been pretending you cant what a sly fellow you are what a lot of secrets you must have learnt pretending to be deaf and overhearing all kinds of things not meant for you youre sly block and youre worse things than that whip him block if you like said mr barling sitting down on the box ive no time for rude boys myself i will said block grimly and he undid a length of rope from round his waist ive often wanted to cheeky little worm sooty felt alarmed he leapt off the bench and put up his fists let me talk to our prisoner first said mr barling then you can give pierre the hiding he deserves it will be nice for him to wait for it uncle quentin was listening quietly to all this he looked at mr barling and spoke sternly you owe me an explanation for your strange behaviour i demand to be taken to smugglers top you shall answer to the police for this oh no i shant said mr barling in a curiously soft voice i have a very generous proposal to make to you i know why you have come to smugglers top i know why you and mr lenoir are so interested in each others experiments how do you know said uncle quentin spying i suppose yes i bet blocks been spying and reading letters cried sooty indignantly mr barling took no notice of the interruption now my dear sir he said to uncle quentin i will tell you very shortly what i propose i know you have heard that i am a smuggler i am i make a lot of money from it it is easy to run a smuggling trade here because no one can patrol the marshes or stop men using the secret path that only i and a few others know on favourable nights i send out a signal or rather block here does so for me using the convenient tower of smugglers top oh so it was block cried sooty then the goods arrive said mr barling and again at a favourable moment i er dispose of them i cover my tracks very carefully so that no one can possibly accuse me because they never have any real proof why are you telling me all this said uncle quentin scornfully its of no interest to me im only interested in a plan for draining the marshes not in smuggling goods across them exactly my dear fellow said mr barling amiably i know that i have even seen your plans and read about your experiments and mr lenoirs but the draining of the marsh means the end of my own business once the marsh is drained once houses are built there and roads made once the mists have gone my business goes too a harbour may be built out there at the edge of the marsh my ships can no longer creep in unseen bringing valuable cargoes not only will my money go but all the excitement which is more than life to me will go too youre mad said uncle quentin in disgust mr barling was a little mad he had always felt a great satisfaction in being a successful smuggler in days when smuggling was almost at an end he loved the thrill of knowing that his little ships were creeping in the mist towards the treacherous marshes he liked to know that men were making their way over a small and narrow path over the misty marsh to the appointed meetingplace bringing smuggled goods you should have lived a hundred years or more ago said sooty also feeling that mr barling was a little mad you dont belong to nowadays mr barling turned on sooty his eyes gleaming dangerously in the light of the lantern another word from you and ill drop you in the marshes he said sooty felt a shiver go down his back he suddenly knew that mr barling really did mean what he said he was a dangerous man uncle quentin sensed it too he looked at mr barling warily how do i come into this he asked why have you kidnapped me i know that mr lenoir is going to buy your plans from you said mr barling i know he is going to drain the marsh by using your very excellent ideas you see i know all about them i know too that mr lenoir hopes to make a lot of money by selling the land once it is drained it is all his that misty marsh and no use to anyone now except to me but that marsh is not going to be drained i am going to buy your plans not mr lenoir do you want to drain the marsh then said uncle quentin in surprise mr barling laughed scornfully no your plans and the results of your experiments will be burnt they will be mine but i shall not want to use them i want the marsh left as it is secret covered with mist and treacherous to all but me and my men so my dear sir you will please name your price to me instead of to mr lenoir and sign this document which i have had prepared making over all your plans to me he flourished a large piece of paper in front of uncle quentin sooty watched breathlessly uncle quentin picked up the paper he tore it into small pieces he threw them into mr barlings face and said scornfully i dont deal with madmen nor with rogues mr barling chapter twenty timmy to the rescue mr barling went very pale sooty gave a loud crow of delight hurrah good for you uncle quentin block gave a loud exclamation and darted to the excited boy he took him by the shoulder and raised the rope to thrash him thats right said mr barling in a funny kind of hissing voice deal with him first block and then with this this stubborn obstinate fool well soon bring them to their senses a good thrashing now and again a few days here in the dark without any food ah that will make them more biddable sooty yelled at the top of his voice uncle quentin leapt to his feet the rope came down and sooty yelled again then there suddenly came the pattering of quick feet and something flung itself on block block gave a scream of pain and turned he knocked the lantern over by accident and the light went out there was a sound of fierce growling block staggered about trying to keep off the creature that had fastened itself on to him barling help me he shouted mr barling went to his aid but was attacked in his turn uncle quentin and sooty listened in amazement and fear what creature was this that had suddenly arrived would it attack them next was it a giantrat or some fierce wild animal that haunted these tunnels the fierce animal suddenly barked sooty gave a squeal of joy timmy its you timmy oh good dog good dog go for him then go for him bite him jimmy bite hard the two frightened men could do nothing against the angry dog soon they were running down the tunnel as fast as they could go feeling for the string for fear of being lost timmy chased them with much enjoyment and then returned to sooty and georges father rather pleased with himself he had a tremendous welcome georges father made a great fuss of him and sooty put his arms round the big dogs neck how did you come here did you find your way out of the secret passage youve been in are you halfstarved look heres some food timmy ate heartily he had managed to devour a few rats but otherwise had had no food at all he had licked the drops that here and there he had found dripping from the roof so he had not been thirsty but he had certainly been extremely puzzled and worried he had never before been so long away from his beloved mistress uncle quentin timmy could take us safely back to smugglers top couldnt he said sooty suddenly he spoke to timmy can you take us home old boy home to george timmy listened with his ears cocked up he ran down the passage a little way but soon came back he did not like the idea of going down there he felt that enemies were waiting for them all mr barling and block were not likely to give in quite so easily but timmy knew other ways about the tunnels that honeycombed the hillside he knew for instance the way down to the marsh so he set off in the darkness with uncle quentins hand on his collar and sooty following close behind holding on to uncle quentins coat it wasnt easy or pleasant uncle quentin wondered at times if timmy really did know where he was going they went down and down stumbling over uneven places sometimes knocking their heads against an unexpectedly low piece of roof it was not a pleasant journey for uncle quentin for he had no shoes on his feet and was dressed only in pyjamas and rugs after a long time they came out on the edge of the marsh itself at the bottom of the hill it was a desolate place and the mists were over it so that neither sooty nor uncle quentin knew which way to turn never mind said sooty we can easily leave it to timmy he knows the way all right hell take us back to the town and once there well know the way home ourselves but suddenly to their surprise and dismay timmy stopped dead pricked up his ears whined and would go no farther he looked thoroughly miserable and unhappy what could be the matter then with a bark the big dog left the two by themselves and galloped back into the tunnel they had just left he disappeared completely timmy yelled sooty timmy come here dont leave us timmy but timmy was gone why neither sooty nor uncle quentin knew they stared at one another well i suppose wed better try to make our way over this marshy bit said uncle quentin doubtfully putting a foot out to see if the ground was hard it wasnt he drew back his foot at once the mists were so thick that it was really impossible to see anything behind them was the opening to the tunnel a steep rocky cliff rose up above it there was no path that way it was certain somehow they had to make their way round the foot of the hill to the mainroad that entered the town but the way lay over marshy ground lets sit down and wait for a bit to see if timmy comes back said sooty so they sat down on a rock at the entrance to the tunnel and waited sooty began to think of the others he wondered what they had thought when they had discovered that both he and uncle quentin were missing how astonished they must have been i wonder what the others are doing he said aloud tdlove to know the others as we know had been doing plenty they had found the opening in the windowseat where mr barling had taken the captives and they had gone down it and actually seen mr barling and block on their way to talk to uncle quentin and sooty they had found out too that block hadnt been in his bed he had left a dummy there instead now everyone was talking at once and mr lenoir was suddenly convinced that block had been a spy put in his house by mr barling and not the good servant he had appeared once julian felt that he was convinced of this he spoke to him more freely and told him of the way through the windowseat and of how they had seen mr barling and block that very day in the underground tunnels good heavens said mr lenoir now looking thoroughly alarmed barling must be mad ive always thought he was a bit queer but he must be absolutely mad to kidnap people like this and block must be too this is a plot theyve heard what ive been planning with your uncle and theyve made up their minds to stop it because it will interfere with their smuggling goodness knows whattheyll do now this is serious if only we had timmy suddenly said george mr lenoir looked astonished whos timmy well you might as well know everything now said julian and he told mr lenoir about timmy and how they had hidden him very foolish of you said mr lenoir shortly looking displeased if youd told me i would have had someone in the town look after him i cant help not liking dogs i detest them and never will have them in the house but i would willingly have arranged for him to be boarded out if id known youd brought him the children felt sorry and a little ashamed mr lenoir was a queer hottempered person but he didnt seem nearly as horrid as they had thought he was id like to go and see if i can find timmy said george youll get the police in now i suppose mr lenoir and perhaps we could go and find timmy we know the way into the secret passage from your study oh so thats why you were hiding there in the afternoon yesterday said mr lenoir i thought you were a very bad boy well go and try and find him if you like but dont let him come anywhere near me i really cannot bear dogs in the house he went to telephone the policestation again mrs lenoir her eyes red with crying stood by him george slipped away to the study followed by dick and julian and anne marybelle stayed beside her mother come on lets get into that secret passage and try and find old timmy said george if we all go and whistle and shout and call hes sure to hear us they found the way into the passage by doing the things they had done before the panel slid back and then another larger opening came as before they all squeezed through it and found themselves in the very narrow passage that led from the study up to sootys bedroom but timmy was not there the children were surprised but george soon thought why do you remember sooty telling us there was a way into this passage from the diningroom as well as from the study and sootys bedroom well i believe i saw a door or something there as we passed where the diningroom must be and its likely timmy may have pushed through it and gone into another passage somewhere they went back one by one they came to the diningroom or rather they walked behind the diningroom wall there they saw the door that george had noticed as they passed a door small and set quite flat to the wall so that it was difficult to see george pushed it it opened easily and then flapped shut with a little click it could be opened from one side but not from the other thats where timmys gone said george and she pushed the door open again he pushed against the door and it opened he went through and the door fastened itself so that he couldnt get back come on we must find him they all went through the small door it was so low that they had to bend their heads to go through even anne they found themselves in a passage rather like the one they had just left but not quite so narrow it suddenly began to go downwards julian called back to the others i believe it goes down to the passages where we used to take timmy when we let him down into that pit to go for a walk yes look weve come to where the pit itself is they went on calling timmy and whistling loudly but no timmy came george began to feel worried hallo surely this is where we came out when we climbed down all those steps from the windowseat passage said dick suddenly yes it is look theres the tunnel where we saw block and mr barling going oh do you think theyve done something to timmy said george in a frightened voice i never thought of that everyone felt alarmed it was strange that block and mr barling could go about unmolested by timmy if timmy was somewhere near could they have harmed him in any way they had no idea that timmy was at that very minute with georges father and sooty look at this said julian suddenly and he shone his torch on to something to show the others string string going right down this tunnel why its the tunnel that mr barling and block took said george i believe it leads to where theyve taken my father and sooty theyre keeping them prisoners down here im going to follow the string and find them whos coming with me chapter twentyone a journey through the hill im coming said everyone at once as if they would let george go alone so down the dark tunnel they went feeling the string and following it julian ran it through his fingers and the others followed behind holding hands it would not do for anyone to get lost after about ten minutes they came to the rounded cave where sooty and georges father had been the night before they were not there now of course they were on their way down to the marsh hallo look this is where they must have been cried julian shining his torch round a bench with tumbled rugs and an overturned lamp and look here scraps of paper torn into bits somethings been happening here quickwitted george pieced it together in her mind mr barling took them here and left them then he came back with some sort of proposal to father who refused it there must have beeen a struggle of some sort and the lamp got broken oh i do hope father and sooty got away all right julian felt gloomy ci hope to goodness they havent gone wandering about these awful tunnels even sooty doesnt know a quarter of them i wish i knew whats happened someones coming suddenly said dick snap out the light ju julian snapped off the torch he carried at once they were all four in darkness they crouched at the back of the cave listening yes footsteps were coming rather cautious footsteps sounds like two or three people whispered dick they came nearer whoever was coming was plainly following the tunnel where the string was mr barling perhaps and block whispered george come to have another talk with father but hes gone a brilliant light flashed suddenly round the cave and picked out the huddled children there was a loud exclamation of astonishment good heavens whos here whats all this it was mr barlings voice julian stood up blinking in the bright light we came to took for my uncle and sooty he said where are they arent they here said mr barling seeming surprised and is that horrible brute of a dog gone oh was timmy here cried george joyfully where is he there were two other men with mr barling one was block the other was his servant mr barling put down the lantern he was carrying do you mean to say you dont know where the others are he said uneasily if theyve gone off on their own theyll never come back anne gave a little scream its all your fault you horrid man shut up anne said julian mr barling he said turning to the angry smuggler i think youd better come back with us and explain things mr lenoir is now talking to the police oh is he said mr barling then i think it would be as well for us all to stay down here for a while yes you too ill make mr lenoir squirm ill hold you all prisoners and this time you shall be bound so that you dont go wandering off like the others got some rope block block stepped forward with the other man they caught hold of george first very roughly she screamed loudly timmy timmy where are you timmy come and help oh timmy but no timmy came she was soon in a corner with her hands tied behind her then they turned to julian youre mad julian said to mr barling who was standing nearby holding the lantern you must be mad to do things like this timmy shouted george trying to free her hands timmy timmy timmy timmy didnt hear he was too far away but the dog suddenly felt uneasy he was with georges father and sooty at the edge of the marsh about to lead them round the hill to safety but he stopped and listened he could hear nothing of course but timmy knew that george was in danger he knew that his beloved little mistress needed him his ears did not tell him nor did his nose but his heart told him george was in danger he turned and fled back into the tunnel he tore up the winding passages at top speed panting and quite suddenly just as julian was angrily submitting to having his hands tied tightly together a furry thunderbolt arrived it was timmy he smelt his enemy mr barling again he smelt block grrrrrrrrrrrnr heres that awful dog again yelled block and leapt away from julian wheres your gun barling but timmy didnt worry about guns he leapt at mr barling and got him on the floor he gave him a nip in the shoulder that made him yell then he leapt at block and got him down too the other man fled call your dog off call him off or hell kill us cried mr barling struggling up his shoulder paining him terribly but nobody said a word let timmy do what he liked it wasnt long before all three of the men had gone into the dark tunnel staggering about without a light trying to find their way back but they missed the string and went wandering away in the darkness groaning and terrified timmy came running back very pleased with himself he went to george and whining with joy he licked his little mistress from head to foot and george who never cried was most astonished to find the tears pouring down her cheeks but im glad not sad she said oh somebody undo my hands i cant pat timmy dick undid her hands and julians then they all had a marvellous time making a fuss of timmy and what a fuss he made of them too he whined and barked he rolled over and over he licked them and butted them all with his head he was wild with delight oh timmy its lovely to have you again said george happily now you can lead us to the others im sure you know where father is timmy and sooty timmy did of course he set off his tail wagging georges hand on his collar and the others behind in a line holding hands they had the lantern with them and two torches so they could see the way easily but they would never have taken the right tunnels if timmy hadnt been with them the dog had explored them all thoroughly and his sense of smell enabled him to go the right way without mistake hes a marvellous dog said anne i think hes the best dog in the world george of course he is said george who had always thought that ever since she had had timmy as a puppy darling tim wasnt it wonderful when he came racing up and jumped at block just as he was tying julians hands he must have known we needed him i suppose hes taking us to wherever your father and sooty are said dick he seems certain of the way were going steadily downhill i bet well be at the marshes soon when they at last came to the bottom of the hill and emerged from the tunnel in the mists george gave a yell look theres father and sooty too uncle quentin shouted julian dick and anne sooty hallo here we are uncle quentin and sooty turned in the greatest surprise they jumped up and went to meet the dog and the excited children how did you get here said georges father giving her a hug did timmy go back for you he suddenly deserted us and fled back into the tunnel whats happened asked sooty eagerly knowing that the others would have plenty of news heaps said george her face glowing it was so nice all to be together again timmy too she and julian and dick began to tell everything in turn and then her father told his tale too interrupted a little by sooty well said julian at last i suppose we ought to be getting back or the police will be sending out bloodhounds to trace us all mr lenoir will be surprised to see us all turning up together i wish i wasnt in pyjamas said his uncle drawing the rugs about him i shall feel queer walking the streets like this never mind its awfully misty now said george and she shivered a little for the air was damp timmy show us the way out of this place im sure you know it timmy had never been out of the tunnel before but he seemed to know what to do he set off round the foot of the hill the rest following marvelling at the way timmy found a dry path to follow in the mist it was almost impossible to see which place was safe to walk on and which was not the treacherous marsh was all around them hurrah theres the road cried julian suddenly as they came in sight of the roadway built over the marsh running up the hill from the salty stretches of mud they picked their way to it their feet soaked with wet mud timmy tried to take a flying leap on to it but somehow or other he slipped he fell back into the marsh tried to find a safe foothold and couldnt he whined timmy oh look hes in the mud and hes sinking screamed george in panic timmy timmy im coming she was about to step down into the marsh to rescue tim but her fatter pulled her back roughly do you want to sink in too he cried timmy will get out all right but he wasnt getting out he was sinking do something oh do something shouted george struggling to get away from her fathers hold oh save timmy quick chapter twentytwo things come right at last but what could anyone do in despair they all gazed at poor timmy who was struggling with all his might in the sinking mud hes going down wept anne suddenly there came the sound of rumbling wheels along the road to the hill it was a lorry carrying a load of goods coal coke planks logs sacks of various things george yelled to it stop stop help us our dogs in the marsh the lorry came to a stop georges father ran his eye over the things it carried in a trice he and julian were dragging out some planks from the load they threw these into the marsh and using them as steppingstones the two reached poor sinking timmy the lorrydriver jumped down to help into the marsh crosswise on the other planks went some more wood to make a safe path the first lot were already sinking jn the mud uncle quentins got timmy hes pulling him up hes got him squealed anne george had sat down suddenly at the edge of the road looking white she saw that timmy would now be rescued and she felt sick with shock and relief it was a difficult business getting timmy right out for the mud was strong and sucked him down as hard as it could but at last he was out and he staggered across the sinking planks trying to wag a very muddy tail muddy as he was george flung her arms round him oh timmy what a fright you gave us all oh how you smell but i dont care a bit i thought you were gone poor poor timmy the lorrydriver looked ruefully at his planks in the marsh they were now out of sight beneath the mud uncle quentin feeling rather foolish in pyjamas and rugs spoke to him ive no money on me now but if youll call at smugglers top sometime ill pay you well for your lost planks and your help well im delivering some coal to the house next to smugglers top said the man eyeing uncle quentins curious attire maybe youd all like a lift theres plenty of room at the back there it was getting dark now as well as being foggy and everyone was tired thankfully they climbed up into the lorry and it roared up the hill into castaway soon they were at smugglers top and they all clambered down suddenly feeling rather stiff ill be calling tomorrow said the driver cant stop now good evening to you all the little company rang the bell sarah came hurrying to the door she almost fell over in surprise as she saw everyone standing there in the light of the halllamp lands sakes she said youre all back my mr and mrs lenoir will be glad theyve got the police hunting everywhere for you theyve gone down secret passages and theyve been to mr barlings and timmy bounced into the hall the mud now drying on him so that he looked most peculiar sarah gave a scream whats that gracious it cant be a dog come here tim said george suddenly remembering that mr lenoir detested dogs sarah do you think youd have poor timmy in the kitchen with you i really cant turn him out into the streets youve no idea how brave hes been come along come along said her father impatient with all this talk lenoir can put up with timmy for a few minutes surely oh ill have him with pleasure said sarah ill give him a bath thats what he wants mr and mrs lenoir are in the sittingroom sir oh sir shall i get you some clothes the little party went in and made their way to the sittingroom while timmy went docilely to the kitchen with the excited sarah mr lenoir heard the talking and flung open the sittingroom door mrs lenoir fell on sooty tears pouring down her cheeks marybelle pawed at him in delight just as if she was a dog mr lenoir rubbed his hands clapped everyone on the back and said well well fine to see you all safe and sound well well what a tale youve got to tell im sure its a strange tale lenoir said georges father very strange but ill have to see to my feet before i tell it ive walked miles in my bare feet and theyre very painful now so with bits of tales pouring out from everyone the household bustled round and got hot water for bathing uncle quentins feet a dressinggown for him food for everyone and hot drinks it was really a most exciting time and now that the thrills were all over the children rather felt important to be able to relate so much then the police came in of course and the inspector at once asked a lot of questions everyone wanted to answer them but the inspector said that only georges father sooty and george were to tell the tale they knew most about everything mr lenoir was perhaps the most surprised person there when he heard how mr barling had actually offered to buy the plans for draining the marsh and how he had frankly admitted to being a smuggler he sat back in his chair unable to say a word hes mad of course said the inspector of police doesnt seem to live in this world at all thats just what i said to him said sooty i told him he ought to have lived a hundred years ago well weve tried to catch him in the smuggling business many and many a time said the inspector but he was too artful fancy him planting block here as a spy sir that was a clever bit of work and block using your tower as a signalling place bit of nerve that and block isnt deaf after all that was clever too sending him about pretending he was stonedeaf so that he could catch many a bit of knowledge not meant for his ears do you think we ought to do something about block and mr barling and the other man said julian suddenly for all we know theyre still wandering about in that maze of tunnels and two of them are bitten by timmy we know ah yes that dog saved your lives i should think said the inspector a bit of luck that sorry you dont like dogs mr lenoir but im sure youll admit it was a lucky thing for you all that he was wandering about yes yes it was said mr lenoir of course block never wanted dogs here either he was afraid they might bark at his curious comings and goings i suppose by the way where is this marvellous dog i dont mind seeing him for a moment though i do detest dogs and always shall ill get him said george i only hope sarahs done what she said and bathed him he was awfully muddy she went out and came back with timmy but what a different timmy sarah had given him a good hot bath and had dried him well he smelt sweet and fresh his coat was springy and clean and he had had a good meal he was feeling very pleased with himself and everything timmy meet a friend said george to him solemnly timmy looked at mr lenoir out of his big brown eyes he trotted straight up to him and held up his right paw politely to shake hands as george had taught him mr lenoir was rather taken aback he was not used to good manners in dogs he couldnt help putting out his hand to timmy and the two shook hands in a most friendly manner timmy didnt attempt to lick mr lenoir or jump up at him he took away his paw gave a little wuff as if to say howdoyoudo and then went back to george he lay down quietly beside her well he doesnt seem like a dog said mr lenoir in surprise oh he is said george at once very earnestly hes a real proper dog mr lenoir only much much cleverer than most dogs are could i keep him please while we stay here and get someone in the town to look after him well seeing he is such a very fine fellow and seems so sensible ill let you have him here said mr lenoir making a great effort to be generous only please keep him out of my way im sure a sensible boy like you will see to that everyone grinned when mr lenoir called george a boy he never seemed to realize she was a girl she grinned too she wasnt going to tell him she wasnt a boy youll never see him she said joyfully ill keep him right out of your way thank you very much its awfully good of you the inspector liked timmy too he looked at him and nodded across to george when you want to get rid of him sell him to me he said we could do with a dog like that in our police force soon round up the smugglers for us george didnt even bother to reply as if she would ever sell timmy or let him go into the police force all the same the inspector had to call on timmy for help before long when the next day came and no one had found mr barling and his companions in the maze of tunnels and they hadnt turned up anywhere the inspector asked george if she would let timmy go down into the tunnels and hunt them out cant leave them there lost and starving he said bad as they are well have to rescue them timmy is the only one who can find them that was true of course so timmy once more went underground into the hill and hunted for his enemies he found them after a while lost in the maze of passages hungry and thirsty in pain and frightened he took them like sheep to where the police waited for them and after that mr barling and his friends disappeared from public life for quite a long time the police must be glad to have got them at last said mr lenoir they have tried to stop this smuggling for a long time they even suspected me at one time barling was a clever fellow though i still think he was half mad when block found out my ideas about draining the marsh barling was afraid that once the mists and the marsh were gone that would be the end of all his excitements no more smuggling no more waiting for his little ships to come creeping up in the fog no more lines of men slipping across the secret ways of the marsh no more signalling no more hiding away of smuggled goods did you know that the police had found a cave full of them inside the hill it was an exciting adventure to talk about now that it was all over the children felt sorry about one thing though they were sorry that they had thought mr lenoir so horrid he was a queer man in many ways but he could be kind and jolly too did you know were leaving smugglers top said sooty mother was so terribly upset when i disappeared
