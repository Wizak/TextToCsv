 lin mclean by owen wister dedication my dear harry mercer when lin mclean was only a hero in manuscript he received his first welcome and chastening beneath your patient roof by none so much as by you has he in private been helped and affectionately disciplined an now you must stand godfather to him upon this public page always yours owen wister philadelphia how lin mclean went east in the old days the happy days when wyoming was a territory with a future instead of a state with a past and the unfenced cattle grazed upon her ranges by prosperous thousands young lin mclean awaked early one morning in cow camp and lay staring out of his blankets upon the world he would be twentytwo this week he was the youngest cowpuncher in camp but because he could break wild horses he was earning more dollars a month than any man there except one the cook was a more indispensable person none save the cook was up so far this morning lins brother punchers slept about him on the ground some motionless some shifting their prone heads to burrow deeper from the increasing day the busy work of spring was over that of the fall or beef roundup not yet come it was midjuly a lull for these hardriding bachelors of the saddle and many unspent dollars stood to mr mcleans credit on the ranch books whats the matter with some variety muttered the boy in his blankets the long range of the mountains lifted clear in the air they slanted from the purple folds and furrows of the pines that richly cloaked them upward into rock and grassy bareness until they broke remotely into bright peaks and filmed into the distant lavender of the north and the south on their western side the streams ran into snake or into green river and so at length met the pacific on this side wind river flowed forth from them descending out of the lake of the painted meadows a mere troutbrook it was up there at the top of the divide with easy riffles and steppingstones in many places but down here outside the mountains it was become a streaming avenue a broadening course impetuous between its two tall green walls of cottonwoodtrees and so it wound away like a vast green ribbon across the lilacgray sagebrush and the yellow vanishing plains variety you bet young lin repeated aloud he unrolled himself from his bed and brought from the garments that made his pillow a few toilet articles he got on his long boy legs and limped blithely to the margin in the mornings his slight lameness was always more visible the camp was at bull lake crossing where the fork from bull lake joins wind river here lin found some convenient shinglestones with dark deepish water against them where he plunged his face and energetically washed and came up with the short curly hair shining upon his round head after enough looks at himself in the dark water and having knotted a clean jaunty handkerchief at his throat he returned with his slight limp to camp where they were just sitting at breakfast to the rear of the cookshelf of the wagon bugged up to kill exclaimed one perceiving lins careful dress he sure has not shaved again another inquired with concern i aint got my operaglasses on answered a third he has spared that pansyblossom mustache said a fourth my spring crop remarked young lin rounding on this last one has juicier prospects than that rateaten catastrophe of last years hay which wanders out of your face why youll soon be talking yourself into a regular man said the other but the camp laugh remained on the side of young lin till breakfast was ended when the ranch foreman rode into camp him lin mclean at once addressed i was wantin to speak to you said he the experienced foreman noticed the boys holiday appearance i understand youre tired of work he remarked who told you asked the bewildered lin the foreman touched the boys pretty handkerchief well i have a way of taking things in at a glance said he thats why im foreman i expect so youve had enough work my systems full of it replied lin grinning as the foreman stood thinking he added and id like my time time in the cattle idiom meant backpay up to date its good were not busy said the foreman meanin id quit all the same inquired lin rapidly flushing no not meaning any offence catch up your horse i want to make the post before it gets hot the foreman had come down the river from the ranch at meadow creek and the post his goal was fort washakie all this part of the country formed the shoshone indian reservation where by permission pastured the herds whose owner would pay lin his time at washakie so the young cowpuncher flung on his saddle and mounted solong he remarked to the camp by way of farewell he might never be going to see any of them again but the cowpunchers were not demonstrative by habit going to stop long at washakie asked one alma is not waitergirl at the hotel now another mentioned if theres a new girl said a third kiss her one for me and tell her im handsomer than you i aint a deceiver of women said lin thats why youll tell her replied his friend say lin why are you quittin us so sudden anyway asked the cook grieved to lose him im after some variety said the boy if you pick up more than you can use just can a little of it for me shouted the cook at the departing mclean this was the last of camp by bull lake crossing and in the foremans company young lin now took the road for his accumulated dollars so youre leaving your bedding and stuff with the outfit said the foreman brought my toothbrush said lin showing it in the breastpocket of his flannel shirt going to denver why maybe take in san francisco sounds slick made any plans gosh no dont want anything on your brain nothin except my hat i guess said lin and broke into cheerful song twas a nasty baby anyhow and it only died to spite us twas afflicted with the cerebrow spinal meningitis they wound up out of the magic valley of wind river through the bastioned gullies and the gnomelike mystery of dry watercourses upward and up to the level of the huge sagebrush plain above behind lay the deep valley they had climbed from mighty expanding its trees like bushes its cattle like pebbles its opposite side towering also to the edge of this upper plain there it lay another world one step farther away from its rim and the two edges of the plain had flowed together over it like a closing sea covering without a sign or ripple the great country which lay sunk beneath a man might think hed dreamed hed saw that place said lin to the foreman and wheeled his horse to the edge again shes sure there though he added gazing down for a moment his boy face grew thoughtful shucks said he then abruptly wheres any joy in money thats comin till it arrives i have most forgot the feel o spotcash he turned his horse away from the farwinding vision of the river and took a sharp jog after the foreman who had not been waiting for him thus they crossed the eighteen miles of high plain and came down to fort washakie in the valley of little wind before the day was hot his roll of wages once jammed in his pocket like an old handkerchief young lin precipitated himself out of the posttraders store and away on his horse up the stream among the shoshone tepees to an unexpected entertainment a wolfdance he had meant to go and see what the new waitergirl at the hotel looked like but put this off promptly to attend the dance this hospitality the shoshone indians were extending to some visiting ute friends and the neighborhood was assembled to watch the ring of painted naked savages the posttrader looked after the galloping lin whats he quitting his job for he asked the foreman same as most of em quit nothing nothing been satisfactory never had a boy more so goodhearted willing a plumb daredevil with a horse and worthless suggested the posttrader well not yet hes headed that way been punching cattle long came in the country about seventyeight i believe and rode for the bordeaux outfit most a year and quit blew in at cheyenne till he went broke and worked over on to the platte rode for the c y outfit most a year and quit blew in at buffalo rode for balaam awhile on butte creek broke his leg went to the drybone hospital and when the fracture was commencing to knit pretty good he broke it again at the hogranch across the bridge next time youre in cheyenne get dr barker to tell you about that mclean drifted to green river last year and went up over on to snake and up snake and was around with a prospecting outfit on galena creek by pitchstone canyon seems he got interested in some dutchwoman up there but she had trouble died i think they said and he came down by meteetsee to wind river hes liable to go to mexico or africa next if you need him said the posttrader closing his ledger you can offer him five more a month thatll not hold him well let him go have a cigar the bishop is expected for sunday and ive got to see his room is fixed up for him the bishop said the foreman ive heard him highly spoken of you can hear him preach tomorrow the bishop is a good man hes better than that hes a man stated the foreman at least so they tell me now saving an indian dance scarce any possible event at the shoshone agency could assemble in one spot so many sorts of inhabitants as a visit from this bishop inhabitants of four colors gathered to view the wolfdance this afternoon red men white men black men yellow men next day three sorts came to church at the agency the chinese laundry was absent but because indeed as the foreman said the bishop was not only a good man but a man wyoming held him in respect and went to look at him he stood in the agency church and held the episcopal service this sunday morning for some brightly glittering army officers and their families some white cavalry and some black infantry the agency doctor the posttrader his foreman the government scout three gamblers the waitergirl from the hotel the stagedriver who was there because she was old chief washakie whitehaired and royal in blankets with two royal utes splendid beside him one benchful of squatting indian children silent and marvelling and on the back bench the commanding officers new hiredgirl and beside her lin mclean mr mcleans hours were already various and successful even at the wolfdance before he had wearied of its monotonous drumming and pageant his roving eye had rested upon a girl whose eyes he caught resting upon him a look an approach a word and each was soon content with the other then when her duties called her to the post from him and the streams border with a promise for next day he sought the hotel and found the three gamblers anxious to make his acquaintance for when a cowpuncher has his pay many people will take an interest in him the three gamblers did not know that mr mclean could play cards he left them late in the evening fat with their money and sought the tepees of the arapahoes they lived across the road from the shoshones and among their tents the boy remained until morning he was here in church now keeping his promise to see the bishop with the girl of yesterday and while he gravely looked at the bishop miss sabina stone allowed his arm to encircle her waist no soldier had achieved this yet but lin was the first cowpuncher she had seen and he had given her the handkerchief from round his neck the quiet air blew in through the windows and door the pure light breath from the mountains only passing over their foothills it had caught and carried the clear aroma of the sagebrush this it brought into church and with this seemed also to float the peace and great silence of the plains the little melodeon in the corner played by one of the ladies at the post had finished accompanying the hymn and now it prolonged a few closing chords while the bishop paused before his address resting his keen eyes on the people he was dressed in a plain suit of black with a narrow black tie this was because the union pacific railroad while it had delivered him correctly at green river had despatched his robes towards cheyenne without citing chapter and verse the bishop began and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him the bishop told the story of that surpassing parable and then proceeded to draw from it a discourse fitted to the drifting destinies in whose presence he found himself for one solitary morning he spoke unlike many clergymen his words were chiefly those which the people round him used and his voice was more like earnest talking than preaching miss sabina stone felt the arm of her cowpuncher loosen slightly and she looked at him but he was looking at the bishop no longer gravely but with wideopen eyes alert when the narrative reached the elder brother in the field and how he came to the house and heard sounds of music and dancing miss stone drew away from her companion and let him watch the bishop since he seemed to prefer that she took to reading hymns vindictively the bishop himself noted the sunbrowned boy face and the wideopen eyes he was too far away to see anything but the alert listening position of the young cowpuncher he could not discern how that after he had left the music and dancing and begun to draw morals attention faded from those eyes that seemed to watch him and they filled with dreaminess it was very hot in church chief washakie went to sleep and so did a corporal but lin mclean sat in the same alert position till miss stone pulled him and asked if he intended to sit down through the hymn then church was out officers indians and all the people dispersed through the great sunshine to their dwellings and the cowpuncher rode beside sabina in silence what are you studying over mr mclean inquired the lady after a hundred yards did you ever taste steamed duxbury clams asked lin absently no indeed whats them oh just clams yu have drawn butter too mr mclean fell silent again i guess ill be late for settin the colonels table goodbye said sabina quickly and swished her whip across the pony who scampered away with her along the straight road across the plain to the post lin caught up with her at once and made his peace only protested sabina i aint used to gentlemen taking me out and well same as if i was a colliedog maybe its wind river politeness but she went riding with him up trout creek in the cool of the afternoon out of the indian tepees scattered wide among the flat levels of sagebrush smoke rose thin and gentle and vanished they splashed across the many little running channels which lead water through that thirsty soil and though the range of mountains came no nearer behind them the post with its white flat buildings and green trees dwindled to a toy village my but its far to everywheres here exclaimed sabina and its little youre sayin for yourself today mr mclean ill have to do the talking whats that thing now where the rocks are thats little wind river canyon said the young man feel like goin there miss stone why yes it looks real nice and shady like dont it lets so miss stone turned her pony in that direction when do your folks eat supper inquired lin halfpast six oh weve lots of time come on how many miles per hour do you figure that cayuse of yourn can travel lin asked what are you atalking about anyway youre that strange today said the lady only if we try to make that canyon i guess youll be late settin the colonels table lin remarked his hazel eyes smiling upon her that is if your horse aint good for twenty miles an hour mine aint i know but ill do my best to stay with yu youre the teasingest man said miss stone pouting i might have knowed it was ever so much further nor it looked well i aint sayin i dont want to go if yu was desirous of campin out tonight mr mclean indeed and id do no such thing and sabina giggled a sagehen rose under their horses feet and hurtled away heavily over the next rise of ground taking a final wide sail out of sight something like them partridges used to said lin musingly partridges inquired sabina used to be in the woods between lynn and salem maybe the woods are gone by this time yes they must be gone i guess presently they dismounted and sought the stream bank we had music and dancing at thanksgiving and such times said lin his wiry length stretched on the grass beside the seated sabina he was not looking at her but she took a pleasure in watching him his curly head and bronze face against which the young mustache showed to its full advantage i expect you used to dance a lot remarked sabina for a subject yes do yu know the portland fancy sabina did not and her subject died away did anybody ever tell you you had good eyes she inquired next why sure said lin waking for a moment but i like your color best a girls eyes will mostly beat a mans indeed i dont think so exclaimed poor sabina too much expectant to perceive the fatal note of routine with which her transient admirer pronounced this gallantry he informed her that hers were like the sea and she told him she had not yet looked upon the sea never said he its a turruble pity youve never saw salt water its different from fresh all around home its blue awful blue in july around swampscott and marblehead and nahant and around the islands ive swam there lots then our home bruck up and we went to board in boston he snapped off a flower in reach of his long arm suddenly all dreaminess left him i wonder if youll be settin the colonels table when i come back he said miss stone was at a loss im goin east tomorrow east to boston yesterday he had told her that sixteen miles to lander was the farthest journey from the post that he intended to make the farthest from the post and her i hope nothing aint happened to your folks said she i aint got no folks replied lin barring a brother i expect he is taking good care of himself dont you correspond well i guess he would if there was anything to say there aint been nothin sabina thought they must have quarrelled but learned that they had not it was time for her now to return and set the colonels table so lin rose and went to bring her horse when he had put her in her saddle she noticed him step to his own why i didnt know you were lame cried she shucks said lin it dont cramp my style any he had sprung on his horse ridden beside her leaned and kissed her before she got any measure of his activity thats how said he and they took their homeward way galloping no lin continued frank and me never quarrelled i just thought id have a look at this western country frank he thought drygoods was good enough for him and so were both satisfied i expect and thats a lot of years now whoop ye he suddenly sang out and fired his sixshooter at a jackrabbit who strung himself out flat and flew over the earth both dismounted at the paradeground gate and he kissed her again when she was not looking upon which she very properly slapped him and he took the horses to the stable he sat down to tea at the hotel and found the meal consisted of black potatoes gray tea and a guttering dish of fat pork but his appetite was good and he remarked to himself that inside the first hour he was in boston he would have steamed duxbury clams of sabina he never thought again and it is likely that she found others to take his place fort washakie was one hundred and fifty miles from the railway and men there were many and girls were few the next morning the other passengers entered the stage with resignation knowing the thirtysix hours of evil that lay before them lin climbed up beside the driver he had a new trunk now dont get full lin said the clerk putting the mailsacks in at the store my plans aint settled that far yet replied mr mclean leave it out of them said the voice of the bishop laughing inside the stage it was a cool fine air gazing over the huge plain down in which lies fort washakie lin heard the faint notes of the trumpet on the parade ground and took a goodbye look at all things he watched the american flag grow small saw the circle of steam rising away down by the hot springs looked at the bad lands beyond chemically pink and rose amid the vast natural quietcolored plain across the spreading distance indians trotted at wide spaces generally two large bucks on one small pony or a squaw and pappoose a bundle of particolored rags presiding over the whole rose the mountains to the west serene lifting into the clearest light then once again came the now tiny music of the trumpet when do yu figure on comin back inquired the driver oh ill just look around back there for a spell said lin about a month i guess he had seven hundred dollars at lander the horses are changed and during this operation lins friends gathered and said where was any sense in going to boston when you could have a good time where you were but lin remained sitting safe on the stage toward evening at the bottom of a little dry gulch some eight feet deep the horses decided it was a suitable place to stay it was the bishop who persuaded them to change their minds he told the driver to give up beating and unharness then they were led up the bank quivering and a broken trace was spliced with rope then the stage was forced on to the level ground the bishop proving a strong man familiar with the gear of vehicles they crossed through the pass among the quaking asps and the pines and reaching pacific springs came down again into open country that afternoon the stage put its passengers down on the railroad platform at green river this was the route in those days before the midwinter catastrophes of frozen passengers led to its abandonment the bishop was going west his robes had passed him on the up stage during the night when the reverend gentleman heard this he was silent for a very short moment and then laughed vigorously in the baggageroom i can understand how you swear sometimes he said to lin mclean but i cant you see not even at this the cowpuncher was checking his own trunk to omaha goodbye and good luck to you continued the bishop giving his hand to lin and look here dont you think you might leave that getting full out of your plans lin gave a slightly shamefaced grin i dont guess i can sir he said im givin yu straight goods yu see he added thats right but you look like a man who could stop when hed had enough try that youre man enough and come and see me whenever were in the same place he went to the hotel there were several hours for lin to wait he walked up and down the platform till the stars came out and the bright lights of the town shone in the saloon windows over across the way pianomusic sounded through one of the many open doors wonder if the professors there yet said lin and he went across the railroad tracks the bartender nodded to him as he passed through into the back room in that place were many tables and the flat clicking and rattle of ivory counters sounded pleasantly through the music lin did not join the studpoker game he stood over a table at which sat a dealer and a player very silent opposite each other and whereon were painted sundry cards numerals and the colors red and black in squares the legend jacks pay was also clearly painted the player placed chips on whichever insignia of fortune he chose and the dealer slid cards quite fairly from the top of a pack that lay held within a skeleton case made with some clamped bands of tin sometimes the players pile of chips rose high and sometimes his sumptuous pillar of gold pieces was lessened by one it was very interesting and pretty to see lin had much better have joined the game of studpoker presently the eye of the dealer met the eye of the player after that slight incident the players chip pile began to rise and rose steadily till the dealer made admiring comments on such a run of luck then the player stopped cashed in and said goodnight having nearly doubled the number of his gold pieces five dollars worth said lin sitting down in the vacant seat the chips were counted out to him he played with unimportant shiftings of fortune until a short while before his train was due and then singularly enough he discovered he was one hundred and fifty dollars behind the game i guess ill leave the train go without me said lin buying five dollars worth more of ivory counters so that train came and went removing eastward mr mcleans trunk during the hour that followed his voice grew dogged and his remarks briefer as he continually purchased more chips from the now surprised and sympathetic dealer it was really wonderful how steadily lin lost just as steadily as his predecessor had won after that meeting of eyes early in the evening when lin was three hundred dollars out his voice began to clear of its huskiness and a slight humor revolved and sparkled in his eye when his seven hundred dollars had gone to safer hands and he had nothing left at all but some silver fractions of a dollar his robust cheerfulness was all back again he walked out and stood among the railroad tracks with his hands in his pockets and laughed at himself in the dark then his fingers came on the check for omaha and he laughed loudly the trunk by this hour must be nearing rawlins it was going east anyhow im following it you bet he declared kicking the rail not yet though nor ill not go to washakie to have em josh me and yonder lays boston he stretched his arm and pointed eastward had he seen another man going on in this fashion alone in the dark among sidetracked freight cars he would have pitied the poor fool and i guess bostonll have to get along without me for a spell too continued lin a man dont want to show up plumb broke like that younger son did after eatin with the hogs the bishop told about his father was a jimdandy that hog chaps hustled around and set em up when he come back home frank hed say to me how do you do brother and hed be wearin a good suit o clothes and no sir you bet lin now watched the great headlight of a freight train bearing slowly down into green river from the wilderness green river is the end of a division an epoch in every trains journey lanterns swung signals the great dim thing slowed to its standstill by the coal chute its locomotive moved away for a turn of repose the successor backed steaming to its place to tackle a nights work cars were shifted heavily bumping and parting hello lin a face was looking from the window of the caboose hello responded mr mclean perceiving above his head honey wiggin a good friend of his they had not met for three years they claimed you got killed somewheres i was sorry to hear it honey offered his condolence quite sincerely bruck my leg corrected lin if thats what they meant i expect thats it said honey youve had no other trouble been boomin said lin from the mere undertone in their voices it was plain they were good friends carefully hiding their pleasure at meeting wherre yu bound inquired honey east said lin better jump in here then were goin west that just suits me said lin the busy lanterns wagged among the switches the steady lights of the saloons shone along the towns wooden facade from the bluffs that wall green river the sweet clean sagebrush wind blew down in currents freshly through the coalsmoke a wrench passed through the train from locomotive to caboose each fettered car in turn strained into motion and slowly rolled over the bridge and into silence from the steam and the bells of the railroad yard through the open windows of the caboose great dullred cinders rattled in and the whistles of distant union pacific locomotives sounded over the open plains ominous and long like ships at sea honey and lin sat for a while making few observations and far between as their way is between whom flows a stream of oldtime understanding mutual whiskey and silence can express much friendship and eloquently what are yu doing at present lin inquired prospectin now prospecting means hunting gold except to such spirits as the boy lin to these it means finding gold so lin mclean listened to the talk of his friend honey wiggin as the caboose trundled through the night he saw himself in a vision of the near future enter a bank and thump down a bag of golddust then he saw the new clean money the man would hand him in exchange bills with round zeroes half covered by being folded over and heavy satisfactory gold pieces and then he saw the blue water that twinkles beneath boston his fingers came again on his trunk check he had his ticket too and as dawn now revealed the gray country to him his eye fell casually upon a milepost omaha he began to watch for them but the trunk would really get to omaha what are yu laughin about asked honey oh the wheels wheels dont yu hear em said lin variety they keep asayin variety variety huh said honey with scorn kerchunkachunk s all i make it youre no poet observed mr mclean as the train moved into evanston in the sunlight a gleam of dismay shot over lins face and he ducked his head out of sight of the window but immediately raised it again then he leaned out waving his arm with a certain defiant vigor but the bishop on the platform failed to notice this performance though it was done for his sole benefit nor would lin explain to the inquisitive wiggin what the matter was therefore very naturally honey drew a conclusion for himself looked quickly out of the window and being disappointed in what he expected to see remarked sulkily do yu figure i care what sort of a lookin girl is stuck on yu in evanston and upon this young lin laughed so loudly that his friend told him he had never seen a man get so foolish in three years byandby they were in utah and in the company of ogden friends forgot prospecting later they resumed freight trains and journeyed north in idaho they said goodbye to the train hands in the caboose and came to little camas and so among the mountains near feather creek here the berries were of several sorts and growing riper each day and the bears in the timber above knew this and came down punctually with the season making variety in the otherwise even life of the prospectors it was now august and lin sat on a wet hill making mudpies for sixty days but the philosophers stone was not in the wash at that placer nor did lin gather golddust sufficient to cover the nail of his thumb then they heard of an excitement at obo nevada and hurrying to obo they made some more mudpies now and then eating their fat bacon at noon honey would say lin wherre yu goin and lin always replied east this became a signal for drinks for beauty and promise nevada is a name among names nevada pronounce the word aloud does it not evoke mountains and clear air heights of untrodden snow and valleys aromatic with the pine and musical with falling waters nevada but the name is all abomination of desolation presides over ninetenths of the place the sun beats down as on a roof of zinc fierce and dull not a drop of water to a mile of sand the mean ashdump landscape stretches on from nowhere to nowhere a spot of mange no portion of the earth is more lacquered with paltry unimportant ugliness there is gold in nevada but lin and honey did not find it prospecting of the sort they did besides proving unfruitful is not comfortable now and again losing patience lin would leave his work and stalk about and gaze down at the scattered men who stooped or knelt in the water passing each busy prospector lin would read on every broad upturned pair of overalls the same label levi strauss no with a picture of two lusty horses hitched to one of these garments and vainly struggling to split them asunder lin remembered he was wearing a label just like that too and when he considered all things he laughed to himself then having stretched the ache out of his long legs he would return to his ditch as autumn wore on his feet grew cold in the mushy gravel they were sunk in he beat off the sand that had stiffened on his boots and hated obo nevada but he held himself ready to say east whenever he saw honey coming along with the bottle the cold weather put an end to this adventure the ditches froze and filled with snow through which the sordid gravel heaps showed in a dreary fashion so the two friends drifted southward near the small new town of mesa arizona they sat down again in the dirt it was milder here and when the sun shone never quite froze but this part of arizona is scarcely more grateful to the eye than nevada moreover lin and honey found no gold at all some men near them found a little then in january even though the sun shone it quite froze one day were seein the country anyway said honey seein hell said lin and theres more of it above ground than i thought whatll we do honey inquired have to walk for a job a goodpayin job responded the hopeful cowpuncher and he and honey went to town lin found a job in twentyfive minutes becoming assistant to the apothecary in mesa established at the drugstore he made up the simpler prescriptions he had studied practical pharmacy in boston between the ages of thirteen and fifteen and besides this qualification the apothecary had seen him when he first came into mesa and liked him lin made no mistakes that he or any one ever knew of and as the mild weather began he materially increased the apothecarys business by persuading him to send east for a sodawater fountain the ladies of the town clustered around this entertaining novelty and while sipping vanilla and lemon bought knickknacks and the gentlemen of the town discovered that whiskey with soda and strawberry syrup was delicious and produced just as competent effects a group of them were generally standing in the shop and shaking dice to decide who should pay for the next while lin administered to each glass the necessary ingredients thus money began to come to him a little more steadily than had been its wont and he divided with the penniless honey but honey found fortune quickly too through excellent cardplaying he won a pinto from a small mexican horsethief who came into town from the south and who cried bitterly when he delivered up his pet pony to the new owner the new owner being a man of the world and agile on his feet was only slightly stabbed that evening as he walked to the dancehall at the edge of the town the mexican was buried on the next day but one the pony stood thirteen two and was as long as a steamboat he had white eyelashes pink nostrils and one eye was bright blue if you spoke pleasantly to him he rose instantly on his hindlegs and tried to beat your face he did not look as if he could run and that was what made him so valuable honey travelled through the country with him and every gentleman who saw the pinto and heard honey became anxious to get up a race lin always sent money for wiggin to place and he soon opened a bank account while honey besides his racingbridle bought a silverinlaid one a pair of fortydollar spurs and a beautiful saddle richly stamped every day when in mesa honey would step into the drugstore and inquire lin wherre yu goin but lin never answered any more he merely came to the sodawater fountain with the whiskey the passing of days brought a choked season of fine sand and hard blazing sky heat rose up from the ground and hung heavily over man and beast many insects sat out in the sun rattling with joy the little tearing river grew clear from the swollen mud and shrank to a succession of standing pools and the fat squatting cactus bloomed everywhere into buttercolored flowers big as tulips in the sand there were artesian wells in mesa and the water did not taste very good but if you drank from the standing pools where the river had been you repaired to the drugstore almost immediately a troop of wandering players came dotting along the railroad and reaching mesa played a brassband up and down the street and announced the powerful drama of east lynne then mr mclean thought of the lynn marshes that lie between there and chelsea and of the sea that must look so cool he forgot them while following the painful fortunes of the lady isabel but going to bed in the back part of the drugstore he remembered how he used to beat everybody swimming in the salt water im goin he said then he got up and striking the light he inspected his bank account im sure goin he repeated blowing the light out and i can buy the fatted calf myself you bet for he had often thought of the bishops story you bet he remarked once more in a muffled voice and was asleep in a minute the apothecary was sorry to have him go and honey was deeply grieved id pull out with yer he said only i can do business round yuma and westward with the pinto for three farewell days lin and honey roved together in all sorts of places where they were welcome and once more lin rode a horse and was in his native element then he travelled to deming and so through denver to omaha where he was told that his trunk had been sold for some months besides a suit of clothes for town wear it had contained a buffalo coat for his brother something scarce to see in these days frankll have to get along without it he observed philosophically and took the next eastbound train if you journey in a pullman from mesa to omaha without a waistcoat and with a silk handkerchief knotted over the collar of your flannel shirt instead of a tie wearing besides tall highheeled boots a soft gray hat with a splendid brim a few people will notice you but not the majority new mexico and colorado are used to these things as iowa with its immense rolling grain encompasses you people will stare a little more for youre getting near the east where cowpunchers are not understood but in those days the line of cleavage came sharpdrawn at chicago west of there was still tolerably west but east of there was east indeed and the atlantic ocean was the next important stoppingplace in lins new train good gloves patentleathers and silence prevailed throughout the sleepingcar which was for boston without change had not home memories begun impetuously to flood his mind he would have felt himself conspicuous town clothes and conventions had their due value with him but just now the boys singlehearted thoughts were far from any surroundings and he was murmuring to himself tomorrow tomorrow night there were ladies in that blue plush car for boston who looked at lin for thirty miles at a stretch and by the time albany was reached the next day one or two of them commented that he was the most attractivelooking man they had ever seen whereas beyond his tallness and wideopen jocular eyes eyes that seemed those of a not highly conscientious wild animal there was nothing remarkable about young lin except stage effect the conductor had been annoyed to have such a passenger but the cowpuncher troubled no one and was extremely silent so evidently was he a piece of the true frontier that curious and hopeful fellowpassengers after watching him with diversion more than once took a seat next to him he met their chatty inquiries with monosyllables so few and so unprofitable in their quiet politeness that the passengers soon gave him up at springfield he sent a telegram to his brother at the great drygoods establishment that employed him the train began its homestretch after worcester and whirled and swung by hills and ponds he began to watch for and through stations with old wayside names these flashed on lins eye as he sat with his hat off and his forehead against the window looking wellesley then not long after riverside that was the charles river and did the picnic woods used to be above the bridge or below west newton newtonville newton faneuils next he said aloud in the car as the longforgotten homeknowledge shone forth in his recollection the traveller seated near said beg pardon but turning wondered at the allunconscious lin with his forehead pressed against the glass the blue water flashed into sight and soon after they were running in the darkness between high walls but the cowpuncher never moved though nothing could be seen when the porter announced boston he started up and followed like a sheep in the general exodus down on the platform he moved along with the slow crowd till some one touched him and wheeling round he seized both his brothers hands and swore a good oath of joy there they stood the long brown fellow with the silk handkerchief knotted over his flannel shirt greeting tremendously the spruce civilian who had a ropecolored mustache and bore a fainthearted resemblance to him the story was plain on its face to the passersby and one of the ladies who had come in the car with lin turned twice and smiled gently to herself but frank mcleans heart did not warm he felt that what he had been afraid of was true and he saw he was being made conspicuous he saw men and women stare in the station and he saw them staring as he and his western brother went through the streets lin strode along sniffing the air of boston looking at all things and making it a stretch for his sleek companion to keep step with him frank thought of the refined friends he should have to introduce his brother to for he had risen with his salary and now belonged to a small club where the payingtellers of banks played cards every night and the head clerk at the parker house was president perhaps he should not have to reveal the cowpuncher to these shining ones perhaps the cowpuncher would not stay very long of course he was glad to see him again and he would take him to dine at some obscure place this first evening but this was not lins plan frank must dine with him at the parker house frank demurred saying it was he that should be host and he added they charge up high for wines at parkers then for the twentieth time he shifted a sidelong eye over his brothers clothes youre goin to take your grub with me said lin thats all right i guess and there aint any no about it things is not the same like as if father was livin his voice softened and here to see me come home now im good for several dinners with wines charged up high i expect nor it aint nobody in this world barrin just lin mclean that ive any need to ask for anything mr mclean says i to lin can yu spare me some cash why to be sure you bet and well start off with steamed duxbury clams the cowpuncher slapped his pocket where the coin made a muffled chinking then he said gruffly i suppose swampscotts there yet yes said frank its a dead little town is swampscott i guess ill take a look at the old house tomorrow lin pursued oh thats been pulled down since i forget the year they improved that block lin regarded in silence his brother who was speaking so jauntily of the first and last home they had ever had seventynine is when it was continued frank so you can save the trouble of travelling away down to swampscott i guess ill go to the graveyard anyway said the cowpuncher in his offish voice and looking fixedly in front of him they came into washington street and again the elder mclean uneasily surveyed the youngers appearance but the momentary chill had melted from the heart of the genial lin after tomorrow said he laying a hand on his brothers shoulder yu can start any lead yu please and i guess i can stay with yu pretty close frank frank said nothing he saw one of the members of his club on the other side of the way and the member saw him and frank caught diverted amazement on the members face lins hand weighed on his shoulder and the stress became too great lin said he while youre running with our crowd you dont want to wear that style of hat you know it may be that such words can in some way be spoken at such a time but not in the way that these were said the frozen fact was irrevocably revealed in the tone of franks voice the cowpuncher stopped dead short and his hand slid off his brothers shoulder youve made it plain he said evenly slanting his steady eyes down into franks youve explained yourself fairly well run along with your crowd and ill not bother yu more with comin round and causin yu to feel ashamed its a heap better to understand these things at once and save making a fool of yourself any longer n yu need to i guess there aint no more to be said only one thing if yu see me around on the street dont yu try any talk for id be liable to close your jaw up and maybe yud have more of a job explainin that to your crowd than youve had makin me see what kind of a man ive got for a brother frank found himself standing alone before any reply to these sentences had occurred to him he walked slowly to his club where a friend joked him on his glumness lin made a sore failure of amusing himself that night and in the bright hot morning he got into the train for swampscott at the graveyard he saw a woman lay a bunch of flowers on a mound and kneel weeping there aint nobody to do that for this one thought the cowpuncher and looked down at the grave he had come to see then absently gazed at the woman she had stolen away from her daily life to come here where her grief was shrined and now her heart found it hard to bid the lonely place goodbye so she lingered long her thoughts sunk deep in the motionless past when she at last looked up she saw the tall strange man reenter from the street among the tombs and deposit on one of them an ungainly lump of flowers they were what lin had been able hastily to buy in swampscott he spread them gently as he had noticed the woman do but her act of kneeling he did not imitate he went away quickly for some hours he hung about the little town aimlessly loitering watching the salt water where he used to swim yu dont belong any more lin he miserably said at length and took his way to boston the next morning determined to see the sights he was in new york and drifted about to all places night and day till his money was mostly gone and nothing to show for it but a somewhat pleasurebeaten face and a deep hatred of the crowded scrambling east so he suddenly bought a ticket for green river wyoming and escaped from the city that seemed to numb his good humor when after three days the missouri lay behind him and his holiday he stretched his legs and took heart to see out of the window the signs of approaching desolation and when on the fourth day civilization was utterly emptied out of the world he saw a bunch of cattle and galloping among them his spurred and booted kindred and his manner took on that alertness a horse shows on turning into the home road as the stage took him toward washakie old friends turned up every fifty miles or so shambling out of a cabin or a stable and saying in casual tones hello lin whereve you been at at lander there got into the stage another old acquaintance the bishop of wyoming he knew lin at once and held out his hand and his greeting was hearty it took a week for my robes to catch up with me he said laughing then in a little while how was the east firstrate said lin not looking at him he was shy of the conversations taking a moral turn but the bishop had no intention of reverting at any rate just now to their last talk at green river and the advice he had then given i trust your friends were all well he said i guess they was healthy enough said lin i suppose you found boston much changed its a beautiful city good enough town for them that likes it i expect lin replied the bishop was forming a notion of what the matter must be but he had no notion whatever of what now revealed itself mr bishop the cowpuncher said how was that about that fellow you told about thats in the bible somewheres he come home to his folks and they well there was his father saw him comin he stopped embarrassed then the bishop remembered the wideopen eyes and how he had noticed them in the church at the agency intently watching him and just now what were best to say he did not know he looked at the young man gravely have yu got a bible pursued lin for excuse me but id like yu to read that onced so the bishop read and lin listened and all the while this good clergyman was perplexed how to speak or if indeed to speak at this time at all to the heart of the man beside him for whom the parable had gone so sorely wrong when the reading was done lin had not taken his eyes from the bishops face how long has that there been wrote he asked he was told about how long mr bishop said lin i aint got good knowledge of the bible and i never figured it to be a book much on to facts and i tell you im more plumb beat about its having that elder brother and him being angry down in black and white two thousand years ago than than if id seen a man turn water into wine for id have knowed that aint so but the elder brother is facts deadsure facts and they knowed about that and put it down just the same as life two thousand years ago well said the bishop wisely ignoring the challenge as to miracles i am a good twenty years older than you and all that time ive been finding more facts in the bible every day i have lived lin meditated i guess that could be he said yes after that yuve been areadin and what i know for myself that i didnt know till lately i guess that could be then the bishop talked with exceeding care nor did he ask uncomfortable things or moralize visibly thus he came to hear how it had fared with lin his friend and lin forgot altogether about its being a parson he was delivering the fulness of his heart to and come to think he concluded it werent home i had went to back east layin round them big cities where a man cant help but feel strange all the week no sir yu can blow in a thousand dollars like i did in new york and itll not give yu any more home feelin than what cattle has put in a stockyard nor it wouldnt have in boston neither now this country here he waved his hand towards the endless sagebrush seein it onced more i know where my home is and i wouldnt live nowheres else only i aint got no father watching for me to come up wind river the cowpuncher stated this merely as a fact and without any note of selfpity but the bishops face grew very tender and he looked away from lin knowing his man for had he not seen many of this kind in his desert diocese he forbore to make any text from that last sentence the cowpuncher had spoken lin talked cheerfully on about what he should now do the roundup must be somewhere near du noir creek he would join it this season but next he should work over to the powder river country more business was over there and better chances for a man to take up some land and have a ranch of his own as they got out at fort washakie the bishop handed him a small book in which he had turned several leaves down carefully avoiding any page that related of miracles you need not read it through you know he said smiling just read where i have marked and see if you dont find some more facts goodbye and always come and see me the next morning he watched lin riding slowly out of the post towards wind river leading a single packhorse byandby the little moving dot went over the ridge and as the bishop walked back into the paradeground thinking over the possibilities in that untrained manly soul he shook his head sorrowfully the winning of the biscuitshooter it was quite clear to me that mr mclean could not know the news meeting him today had been unforeseen unforeseen and so pleasant that the thing had never come into my head until just now after both of us had talked and dined our fill and were torpid with satisfaction i had found lin here at riverside in the morning at my horses approach to the cabin it was he and not the postmaster who had come precipitately out of the door im turruble pleased to see yu he had said immediately whats happened said i in some concern at his appearance and he piteously explained why ive been here all alone since yesterday this was indeed all and my hasty impressions of shooting and a corpse gave way to mirth over the child and his innocent grievance that he had blurted out before i could get off my horse since when i inquired of him had his own company become such a shock to him as to that replied mr mclean a thought ruffled when a man expects lonesomeness he stands it like he stands anything else of course but when he has figured on finding company say he broke off and vindictiveness sparkled in his eye when youre lucky enough to catch yourself alone why i suppose yu just take a chair and chat to yourself for hours youve not seen anything of tommy he pursued with interest i had not and forthwith lin poured out to me the pentup complaints and sociability with which he was bursting the foreman had sent him over here with a sackful of letters for the post and to bring back the weeks mail for the ranch a day was gone now and nothing for a man to do but sit and sit tommy was overdue fifteen hours well you could have endured that but the neighbors had all locked their cabins and gone to buffalo it was circus week in buffalo had i ever considered the money there must be in the circus business tommy had taken the outgoing letters early yesterday nobody had kept him waiting by all rules he should have been back again last night maybe the stage was late reaching powder river and tommy had had to lay over for it well that would justify him far more likely he had gone to the circus himself and taken the mail with him tommy was no type of man for postmaster except drawing the allowance his mother in the east gave him first of every month he had never shown punctuality that lin could remember never had any second thoughts and awful few first ones told bigger lies than a small man ought also has successes though said i wickedly huh went on mr mclean successes one icecreamsoda success and she lins still wounded male pride made him plaintive why even that girl quit him once she got the chance to appreciate how insignificant he was as compared with the size of his words no sir not one of em retains interest in tommy lin was unsaddling and looking after my horse just because he was glad to see me since our first acquaintance that memorable summer of pitchstone canyon when he had taken such good care of me and such bad care of himself i had learned pretty well about horses and camp craft in general he was an entire boy then but he had been east since east by a route of his own discovering and from his account of that journey it had proved i think a sort of spiritual experience and then the years of our friendship were beginning to roll up manhood of the body he had always richly possessed and now whenever we met after a seasons absence and spoke those invariable words which all old friends upon this earth use to each other at meeting you havent changed you havent changed at all i would wonder if manhood had arrived in lins boy soul and so today while he attended to my horse and explained the nature of tommy a subject he dearly loved just now i looked at him and took an intimate superior pride in feeling how much more mature i was than he after all theres nothing like a sense of merit for making one feel aggrieved and on our return to the cabin mr mclean pointed with disgust to some firewood look at those sorrowful toothpicks said he tommys work so lin the excellent hearted had angrily busied himself and chopped a pile of real logs that would last a week he had also cleaned the stove and nailed up the bed the pillowend of which was on the floor it appeared the master of the house had been sleeping in it the reverse way on account of the slant thus had lin cooked and dined alone supped alone and sat over some old newspapers until bedtime alone with his sense of virtue and now here it was long after breakfast and no tommy yet its good yu come this forenoon lin said to me id not have had the heart to get up another dinner just for myself lets eat rich accordingly we had richly eaten lin and i he had gone out among the sheds and caught some eggs that is how he spoke of it we had opened a number of things in cans and i had made my famous dish of evaporated apricots in which i managed to fling a suspicion of caramel throughout the stew tommyll be hot about these said lin joyfully as we ate the eggs he dont mind what yu use of his canned goods pickled salmon and truck he is hospitable all right enough till it comes to an egg then hell tell any lie but shucks yu can read tommy right through his clothing make yourself at home lin says he yesterday and he showed me his fresh milk and his stuff heres a new ham says he too bad my damned hens aint been layin the sonsoguns have quit on me ever since christmas and away he goes to powder river for the mail you swore too heavy about them hens thinks i well i expect he may have travelled half a mile by the time id found four nests i am fond of eggs and eat them constantly and in wyoming they were always a luxury but i never forget those that day and how lin and i enjoyed them thinking of tommy perhaps manhood was not quite established in my own soul at that time and perhaps that is the reason why it is the only time i have ever known which i would live over again those years when people said you are old enough to know better and one didnt care salmon apricots eggs we dealt with them all properly and i had some cigars it was now that the news came back into my head what do you think of i began and stopped i spoke out of a long silence the slack luxurious silence of digestion i got no answer naturally from the torpid lin and then it occurred to me that he would have asked me what i thought long before this had he known so observing how comfortable he was i began differently what is the most important event that can happen in this country said i mr mclean heard me where he lay along the floor of the cabin on his back dozing by the fire but his eyes remained closed he waggled one limp open hand slightly at me and torpor resumed her dominion over him i want to know what you consider the most important event that can happen in this country said i again enunciating each word with slow clearness the throat and lips of mr mclean moved and a sulky sound came forth that i recognized to be meant for the word war then he rolled over so that his face was away from me and put an arm over his eyes i dont mean country in the sense of united states said i i mean this country here and bear creek and well the ranches southward for fifty miles say important to this section mosquitoesll be due in about three weeks said lin yu might leave a man rest till then i want your opinion said i oh misery well a raise in the price of steers no yu said yu wanted my opinion said lin seems like yu merely figure on givin me yours very well said i very well then i took up a copy of the cheyenne sun it was five weeks old and i soon perceived that i had read it three weeks ago but i read it again for some minutes now i expect a railroad would be more important said mr mclean persuasively from the floor than a rise in steers said i occupied with the cheyenne sun oh yes yes a railroad certainly would its got to be money anyhow stated lin thoroughly wakened money in some shape how little you understand the real wants of the country said i coming to the point its a girl mr mclean lay quite still on the floor a girl i repeated a new girl coming to this starved country the cowpuncher took a long gradual stretch and began to smile well said he yu caught me if thats much to do when a man is halfwitted with dinner and sleep he closed his eyes again and lay with a specious expression of indifference but that sort of thing is a solitary entertainment and palls starved he presently muttered we are kind o starved that way ill admit more dollars than girls to the square mile and to think of all of us nice healthy young bet yu i know who she is he triumphantly cried he had sat up and levelled a finger at me with the throwdown jerk of a marksman sidney nebraska i nodded this was not the ladys name he could not recall her name but his geography of her was accurate one day in february my friend mrs taylor over on bear creek had received a letter no common event for her therefore during several days she had all callers read it just as naturally as she had them all see the new baby and baby and letter had both been brought out for me the letter was signed ever your afectionite frend katie peck and was not easy to read here and there but you could piece out the drift of it and there was mrs taylor by your side eager to help you when you stumbled miss peck wrote that she was overworked in sidney nebraska and needed a holiday when the weather grew warm she should like to come to bear creek and be like old times like to come and be like old times filled mrs taylor with sentiment and the cowpunchers with expectation but it is a long way from february to warm weather on bear creek and even cowpunchers will forget about a new girl if she does not come for several weeks i had not heard miss peck mentioned and old girls had to do yesterday however when i paid a visit to miss molly wood the bear creek schoolmistress i found her keeping in order the cabin and the children of the taylors while they were gone fortyfive miles to the stage station to meet their guest well said lin judicially miss wood is a lady yes said i with deep gravity for i was thinking of an occasion when mr mclean had discovered that truth somewhat abruptly lin thoughtfully continued she is shes shes what are you laughin at oh nothing you dont see quite so much of miss wood as you used to do you huh so thats got around well o course id ought tve knowed better i suppose all the same theres lots and lots of girls do like gettin kissed against their wishes and you know it but the point would rather seem to be that she would rather seem dont yu start that professor style o yours or ill ill talk more wickedness in worse language than ever yuve heard me do yet impossible i murmured sweetly and master lin went on as to point that dont need to be explained to me shes a lady all right he ruminated for a moment she has about scared all the boys off though he continued and thats what you get by being refined he concluded as if providence had at length spoken in this matter she has not scared off a boy from virginia i notice said i he was there yesterday afternoon again ridden all the way over from sunk creek didnt seem particularly frightened oh well nothin alarms him not even refinement said mr mclean with his grin and shell fool your virginian like she done the balance of us you wait shucks if all the girls were that chilly why what would us poor punchers do you have me cornered said i and we sat in a philosophical silence lin on the floor still and i at the window there i looked out upon a scene my eyes never tired of then nor can my memory now spring had passed over it with its first lightest steps the pastured levels undulated in emerald through the manychanging sage that just this moment of today was lilac shone greens scarce a week old in the dimples of the foothills and greens newborn beneath todays sun melted among them around the doubling of the creek in the willow thickets glimmered skeined veils of yellow and delicate crimson the stream poured turbulently away from the snows of the mountains behind us it went winding in many folds across the meadows into distance and smallness and so vanished round the great red battlement of wall beyond upon this were falling the deep hues of afternoon violet rose and saffron swimming and meeting as if some prism had dissolved and flowed over the turrets and crevices of the sandstone far over there i saw a dot move at last said i lin looked out of the window its more than tommy said he at once and his eyes made it out before mine could its a wagon thats tommys baldfaced horse alongside hes fooling to the finish lin severely commented as if after all this delay there should at least be a homestretch presently however a homestretch seemed likely to occur the baldfaced horse executed some lively manoeuvres and tommys voice reached us faintly through the light spring air he was evidently howling the remarkable strain of yells that the cowpunchers invented as the speech best understood by cows oiee yah whoopyahyeee oooooop oop oopoopoopoopyahhee but that gives you no idea of it alphabets are worse than photographs it is not the lungs of every man that can produce these effects nor even from armies eagles or mules were such sounds ever heard on earth the cowpuncher invented them and when the last cowpuncher is laid to rest if that alas have not already befallen the yells will be forever gone singularly enough the cattle appeared to appreciate them tommy always did them very badly and that was plain even at this distance nor did he give us a homestretch after all the baldfaced horse made a number of evolutions and returned beside the wagon showin off remarked lin tommys showin off suspicion crossed his face and then certainty why we might have knowed that he exclaimed in dudgeon its her he hastened outside for a better look and i came to the door myself thats what it is said he its the girl oh yes thats taylors buckskin pair he traded balaam for she come by the stage all right yesterday yu see but she has been too tired to travel yu see or else maybe taylor wanted to rest his buckskins theyre fouryearolds or else anyway they laid over last night at powder river and tommy he has just laid over too yu see holdin the mail back on us twentyfour hours and thats your postmaster it was our postmaster and this he had done quite as the virtuously indignant mclean surmised had i taken the same interest in the new girl i suppose that i too should have felt virtuously indignant lin and i stood outside to receive the travellers as their cavalcade drew near mr mclean grew silent and watchful his whole attention focused upon the taylors vehicle its approach was joyous its gear made a cheerful clanking taylor cracked his whip and encouragingly chirruped to his buckskins and tommys apparatus jingled musically for tommy wore upon himself and his saddle all the things you can wear in the wild west except that his hair was not long our postmaster might have conducted a show and minted gold by exhibiting his romantic person before the eyes of princes he began with a blackandyellow rattlesnake skin for a hatband he continued with a fringed and beaded shirt of buckskin and concluded with large tinkling spurs of course there were things between his shirt and his heels but all leather and deadly weapons he had also a riata a cuerta and tapaderos and frequently employed these spanish names for the objects i wish that i had not lost tommys photograph in rocky mountain costume you must understand that he was really pretty with blue eyes ruddy cheeks and a graceful figure and besides he had twentyfour hours start of poor dusty lin whose best clothes were elsewhere you might have supposed that it would be mrs taylor who should present us to her friend from sidney nebraska but tommy on his horse undertook the office before the wagon had well come to a standstill good friends of mine and gentlemen both said he to miss peck and to us a lady whose acquaintance will prove a treat to our section we all bowed at each other beneath the florid expanse of these recommendations and i was proceeding to murmur something about its being a long journey and a fine day when miss peck cut me short gaily well she exclaimed to tommy i guess im pretty near ready for them eggs youve spoke so much about i have not often seen mr mclean lose his presence of mind he needed merely to exclaim why tommy you told me your hens had not been laying since christmas and we could have sat quiet and let tommy try to find all the eggs that he could but the new girl was a sore embarrassment to the cowpunchers wits poor lin stood by the wheels of the wagon he looked up at miss peck he looked over at tommy his features assumed a rueful expression and he wretchedly blurted why tommy ive been and eat em well if that aint cried miss peck she stared with interest at lin as he now assisted her to descend all faltered tommy not the four nests ive had three meals yu know lin reminded him deprecatingly i helped him said i ten innocent fresh eggs but we have left some ham forgive us please i declare said miss peck abruptly and rolled her sluggish inviting eyes upon me youre a case too i expect but she took only brief note of me although it was from head to foot in her stare the dull shine of familiarity grew vacant and she turned back to lin mclean you carry that said she and gave the pleased cowpuncher a hand valise ill look after your things miss peck called tommy now springing down from his horse the egg tragedy had momentarily stunned him youll attend to the mail first mr postmaster said the lady but favoring him with a look from her large eyes theres plenty of gentlemen here with that her glance favored lin she went into the cabin he following her close with the taylors and myself in the rear well i guess im about collapsed said she vigorously and sank upon one of tommys chairs the fragile article fell into sticks beneath her and lin leaped to her assistance he placed her upon a firmer foundation mrs taylor brought a basin and towel to bathe the dust from her face mr taylor produced whiskey and i found sugar and hot water tommy would doubtless have done something in the way of assistance or restoratives but he was gone to the stable with the horses shall i get your medicine from the valise deary inquired mrs taylor not now her visitor answered and i wondered why she should take such a quick look at me well soon have yu independent of medicine said lin gallantly our climate and scenery here has frequently raised the dead youre a case anyway exclaimed the sick lady with rich conviction the cowpuncher now sat himself on the edge of tommys bed and throwing one leg across the other began to raise her spirits with cheerful talk she steadily watched him his face sometimes sometimes his lounging masculine figure while he thus devoted his attentions to her taylor departed to help tommy at the stable and good mrs taylor busy with supper for all of us in the kitchen expressed her joy at having her old friend of childhood for a visit after so many years sickness has changed poor katie some said she but im hoping shell get back her looks on bear creek she seems less feeble than i had understood i remarked yes indeed i do believe shes feeling stronger she was that tired and down yesterday with the long stageride and it is so lonesome but taylor and i heartened her up and tommy came with the mail and today shes real sprucedup like feeling shes among friends how long will she stay i inquired just as long as ever she wants me and katie hasnt met since we was young girls in dubuque for i left home when i married taylor and he brought me to this country right soon and it aint been like dubuque much though if i had it to do over again id do just the same as taylor knows katie and me hasnt wrote even not till this february for you always mean to and you dont well itll be like old times katiell be most thirtyfour i expect yes i was seventeen and she was sixteen the very month i was married poor thing she ought to have got some good man for a husband but i expect she didnt have any chance for there was a big famly o them girls and old peck used to act real scandalous getting drunk so folks didnt visit there evenings scarcely at all and so she quit home it seems and got a position in the railroad eatinghouse at sidney and now she has poor health with feeding them big trains day and night a biscuitshooter said i loyal mrs taylor stirred some batter in silence well said she then im told thats what the yardhands of the railroad call them poor waitergirls you might hear it around the switches at them division stations i had heard it in higher places also but meekly accepted the reproof if you have made your transmissouri journeys only since the new era of diningcars there is a quantity of things you have come too late for and will never know three times a day in the brave days of old you sprang from your scarcehalted car at the summons of a gong you discerned by instinct the right direction and passing steadily through doorways had taken before you knew it one of some sixty chairs in a room of tables and catsup bottles behind the chairs standing attention a platoon of amazons thickwristed pinkandblue began immediately a swift chant it hymned the total billoffare at a blow in this inexpressible ceremony the name of every dish went hurtling into the next telescoped to shapelessness moreover if you stopped your amazon in the middle it dislocated her and she merely went back and took a fresh start the chant was always the same but you never learned it as soon as it began your mind snapped shut like the upper berth in a pullman you must have uttered appropriate words even a parrot will for next you were eating things pie ham hot cakes as fast as you could twenty minutes of swallowing and all aboard for ogden with your piledriven stomach dumb with amazement the strasburg goose is not dieted with greater velocity and biscuitshooter is a grand word very likely some homer of the railroad yards first said it for what men upon the present earth so speak with imaginations tongue as we americans if miss peck had been a biscuitshooter i could account readily for her conversation her equipped deportment the maturity in her round blue marble eye her abrupt laugh something beyond gay was now sounding in response to mr mcleans lively sallies and i found him fanning her into convalescence with his hat she herself made but few remarks but allowed the cowpuncher to entertain her merely exclaiming briefly now and then i declare and if you aint lin was most certainly engaging if that was the ladys meaning his wideopen eyes sparkled upon her and he half closed them now and then to look at her more effectively i suppose she was worth it to him i have forgotten to say that she was handsome in a large californiafruit style they made a goodlooking pair of animals but it was in the presence of tommy that master lin shone more energetically than ever and under such shining tommy was transparently restless he tried and failed to bring the conversation his way and took to rearranging the mail and the furniture suppers ready he said at length come right in miss peck right in here this is your seat this one please now you can see my fields out of the window you sit here said the biscuitshooter to lin and thus she was between them thems elegant she presently exclaimed to tommy did you cook em i explained that the apricots were of my preparation indeed said she and returned to tommy who had been telling her of his ranch his potatoes his horses and do you punch cattle too she inquired of him me said tommy slightingly gave it up years ago too empty a life for me i leave that to such as like it when a man owns his own property tommy swept his hand at the whole landscape he takes to more intellectual work lickin postagestamps mr mclean suggested sourly you lick them and i cancel them answered the postmaster and it does not seem a powerful rejoinder but miss peck uttered her laugh thats one on you she told lin and throughout this meal it was tommy who had her favor she partook of his generous supplies she listened to his romantic inventions the trails he had discovered the bears he had slain and after supper it was with tommy and not with lin that she went for a little walk katie was ever a tease said mrs taylor of her childhood friend and mr taylor observed that there was always safety in numbers shell get used to the ways of this country quicker than our little schoolmarm said he mr mclean said very little but read the newarrived papers it was only when bedtime dispersed us the ladies in the cabin and the men choosing various spots outside that he became talkative again for a while we lay in the blank we had spread on some soft dry sand in preference to the stable where taylor and tommy had gone under the contemplative influence of the stars lin fell into generalization ever notice said he how whiskey and lyin act the same on a man i did not feel sure that i had just the same way you keep either of em up long enough and yu get to require it if tommy didnt lie some every day hed get sick i was sleepy but i murmured assent to this and trusted he would not go on ever notice said he how the victims of the whiskey and lyin habit get to increasing the dose yes said i him roping six bears pursued mr mclean after further contemplation or any bear ever notice how the worser a mans lyin the silenter other menll get whys that now i believe that i made a faint sound to imply that i was following him men dont get took in but ladies now they here he paused again and during the next interval of contemplation i sank beyond his reach in the morning i left riverside for buffalo and there or thereabouts i remained for a number of weeks miss peck did not enter my thoughts nor did i meet any one to remind me of her until one day i stopped at the drugstore it was not for drugs but gossip that i went in the daytime there was no place like the apothecarys for meeting men and hearing the news there i heard how things were going everywhere including bear creek all the cowpunchers liked the new girl up there said gossip she was a great addition to society reported to be more companionable than the schoolmarm miss molly wood who had been raised too far east and showed it vermont or some such dude place several had been in town buying presents for miss katie peck tommy postmaster had paid high for a necklace of elktushes the government scout at mckinney sold him too bad miss peck did not enjoy good health shorty had been in only yesterday to get her medicine again third bottle had i heard the big joke on lin mclean he had promised her the skin of a big bear he knew the location of and tommy got the bear two days after this i joined one of the roundup camps at sunset they had been working from salt creek to bear creek and the taylor ranch was in visiting distance from them again after an interval of gathering and branding far across the country the virginian the gentlevoiced southerner whom i had last seen lingering with miss wood was in camp silent threequarters of the time as was his way he sat gravely watching lin mclean that person seemed silent also as was not his way quite so much lin said the southerner i reckon youre failin mr mclean raised a sombre eye but did not trouble to answer further a healthy mans laigs ought to fill his pants pursued the virginian the challenged puncher stretched out a limb and showed his muscles with young pride and yu certnly take no comfort in your food his ingenious friend continued slowly and gently ill eat you a match any day and place yu name said lin it aint scacely honable went on the virginian to waste away durin the roundup a man owes his strength to them that hires it if he is paid to rope stock he ought to rope stock and not leave it dodge or pull away its not many dodge my rope boasted lin imprudently why they tell me as how that heifer of the sidneynebraska brand got plumb away from yu and little tommy had to chase afteh her lin sat up angrily amid the laughter but reclined again ill improve said he if yu learn me how yu rope that vermont stock so handy has she promised to be your sister yet he added is that what they do inquired the virginian serenely i have never got related that way why thatll make tommy your brotherinlaw lin and now indeed the camp laughed a loud merciless laugh but lin was silent where everybody lives in a glasshouse the victory is to him who throws the adroitest stone mr mclean was readier witted than most but the gentle slow virginian could be a master when he chose tommy has been recountin his wars up at the taylors he now told the camp he has frequently campaigned with general crook general miles and general ruger all at onced hes an exciting fighter in conversation and kep us all scared for mighty nigh an hour miss peck appeared interested in his statements what was you doing at the taylors yourself demanded lin visitin miss wood answered the virginian with entire ease for he also knew when to employ the plain truth as a bluff youd ought to write to tommys mother lin and tell her what a daredevil her son is gettin to be she would cut off his allowance and bring him home and you would have the runnin all to yourself ill fix him yet muttered mr mclean him and his wars with that he rose and left us the next afternoon he informed me that if i was riding up the creek to spend the night he would go for company in that direction we started therefore without any mention of the taylors or miss peck i was puzzled never had i seen him thus disconcerted by woman with him woman had been a transient disturbance i had witnessed a series of flighty romances where the cowpuncher had come seen often conquered and moved on nor had his affairs been of the sort to teach a young man respect i am putting it rather mildly for the first part of our way this afternoon he was moody and after that began to speak with appalling wisdom about life life he said was a serious matter did i realize that a man was liable to forget it a man was liable to go sporting and helling around till he waked up some day and found all his best pleasures had become just a business no interest no surprise no novelty left and no cash in the bank shorty owed him fifty dollars shorty would be able to pay that after the roundup and he lin would get his time and rustle altogether some five hundred dollars then there was his homestead claim on box elder and the surveyors were coming in this fall no better location for a home in this country than box elder wood water fine land all it needed was a house and ditches and buildings and fences and to be planted with crops such chances and considerations should sober a man and make him careful what he did id take in cheyenne on our weddingtrip and after that id settle right down to improving box elder concluded mr mclean suddenly his real intentions flashed upon me for the first time i had not remotely imagined such a step marry her i screeched in dismay marry her i dont know which word was the worse to emphasize at such a moment but i emphasized both thoroughly i didnt expect yud act that way said the lover he dropped behind me fifty yards and spoke no more not at once did i beg his pardon for the brutality i had been surprised into it is one of those speeches that once said is said forever but it was not that which withheld me as i thought of the tone in which my friend had replied it seemed to me sullen rather than deeply angry or wounded resentment at my opinion not of her character so much as of his choice then i began to be sorry for the fool and schemed for a while how to intervene but have you ever tried intervention i soon abandoned the idea and took a way to be forgiven and to learn more lin i began slowing my horse you must not think about what i said im thinkin of pleasanter subjects said he and slowed his own horse oh look here i exclaimed well said he he allowed his horse to come within about ten yards astonishment makes a man say anything i proceeded and ill say again youre too good for her and ill say i dont generally believe in the wife being older than the husband whats two years said lin i was near screeching out again but saved myself he was not quite twentyfive and i remembered mrs taylors unprejudiced computation of the biscuitshooters years it is a ladys prerogative however to estimate her own age she had her twentyseventh birthday last month said lin with sentiment bringing his horse entirely abreast of mine i promised her a bearskin yes said i i heard about that in buffalo lins face grew dusky with anger no doubt yu heard about it said he i dont guess yu heard much about anything else i aint told the truth to any of em but her he looked at me with a certain hesitation i think i will he continued i dont mind tellin you he began to speak in a strictly business tone while he evened the coils of rope that hung on his saddle she had spoke to me about her birthday and i had spoke to her about something to give her i had offered to buy her in town whatever she named and i was figuring to borrow from taylor but she fancied the notion of a bearskin i had mentioned about some cubs i had found the cubs where the shebear had them cached by the foot of a big boulder in the range over ten sleep and i put back the leaves and stuff on top o them little things as near as i could the way i found them so that the bear would not suspicion me for i was aiming to get her and miss peck she sure wanted the hide for her birthday so i went back the shebear was off and i crumb up inside the rock and i waited a turruble long spell till the sun travelled clean around the canyon mrs bear come home though a big cinnamon and i raised my gun but laid it down to see what shed do she scrapes around and snuffs and the cubs start whining and she talks back to em next she sits up awful big and lifts up a cub and holds it to her close with both her paws same as a person and she rubbed her ear agin the cub and the cub sort o nipped her and she cuffed the cub and the other cub came toddlin and away they starts rolling all three of em i watched that for a long while that big thing just nursed and played with them little cubs beatin em for a change onced in a while and talkin and onced in a while shed sit up solemn and look all around so lifelike that i near busted why how was i goin to spoil that so i come away very quiet you bet for id have hated to have mrs bear notice me miss peck she laughed she claimed i was scared to shoot after you had told her why it was said i before and after i didnt tell her first because i felt kind of foolish then tommy went and he killed the bear all right and she has the skin now of course the boys joshed me a heap about gettin beat by tommy but since she has taken you said i she aint said it but she will when she understands tommy i fancied that the lady understood the once i had seen her she appeared to me as what might be termed an expert in men and one to understand also the reality of tommys ranch and allowance and how greatly these differed from box elder probably the one thing she could not understand was why lin spared the mother and her cubs a deserted home in dubuque a career in a railroad eatinghouse a somewhat vague past and a present lacking context indeed i hoped with all my heart that tommy would win lin said i im backing him back away said he tommy can please a woman him and his blue eyes but he dont savvy how to make a woman want him not any better than he knows about killin injuns did you hear about the crows said i about young bucks going on the warpath shucks thats put up by the papers of this section theyre aimin to get uncle sam to order his troops out and then folks can sell hay and stuff to em if tommy believed any crows he stopped and suddenly slapped his leg whats the matter now i asked oh nothing he took to singing and his face grew roguish to its full extent what made yu say that to me he asked presently say what about marrying yu dont think id better i dont onced in a while yu tell me im flighty well i am whoopya colts ought not to marry said i sure said he and it was not until we came in sight of the virginians black horse tied in front of miss woods cabin next the taylors that lin changed the lively course of thought that was evidently filling his mind tell yu said he touching my arm confidentially and pointing to the black horse for all her vermont refinement shes a woman just the same she likes him dangling round her so earnest him that no body ever saw dangle before and he has quit spreein with the boys and what does he get by it i am glad i was not raised good enough to appreciate the miss woods of this world he added defiantly except at long range at the taylors cabin we found miss wood sitting with her admirer and tommy from riverside come to admire miss peck the biscuitshooter might pass for twentyseven certainly something had agreed with her whether the medicine or the mountain air or so much masculine company whatever had done it she had bloomed into brutal comeliness her hair looked curlier her figure was shapelier her teeth shone whiter and her cheeks were a lusty overbearing red and there sat molly wood talking sweetly to her big grave virginian to look at them there was no doubt that he had been raised good enough to appreciate her no matter what had been his raising lin greeted every one jauntily how are yu miss peck how are yu tommy said he hear the news tommy crow injuns on the warpath i declare said the biscuitshooter the virginian was about to say something but his eye met lins and then he looked at tommy then what he did say was i hadnt been goin to mention it to the ladies until it was right sure you neednt to be afraid miss peck said tommy theres lots of men here whos afraid said the biscuitshooter oh said lin maybe its like most news we get in this country two weeks stale and a lie when it was fresh of course said tommy hello tommy called taylor from the lane your horse has broke his rein and run down the field tommy rose in disgust and sped after the animal i must be cooking supper now said katie shortly ill stir for yu said lin grinning at her come along then said she and they departed to the adjacent kitchen miss woods gray eyes brightened with mischief she looked at her virginian and she looked at me do you know she said i used to be so afraid that when bear creek wasnt new any more it might become dull miss peck doesnt find it dull either said i molly wood immediately assumed a look of doubt but mightnt it become just just a little trying to have two gentlemen so very determined you know only one is determined said the virginian molly looked inquiring lin is determined tommy shall not beat him thats all it amounts to dear me what a notion no maam no notion tommy well tommy is considered harmless maam a cowpuncher of reputation in this country would certnly never let tommy get ahaid of him that way its pleasant to know sometimes how much we count exclaimed molly why maam said the virginian surprised at her flash of indignation where is any countin without some love do you mean to say that mr mclean does not care for miss peck i reckon he thinks he does but there is a mighty wide difference between thinkin and feelin maam i saw mollys eyes drop from his and i saw the rose deepen in her cheeks but just then a loud voice came from the kitchen you lin if you try any of your foolin with me ill histe yus over the jiste all cowpunchers i attempted to resume quit now lin mclean shouted the voice or ill put yus through that window and it shut well miss peck im gettin most a full dose o this treatment ever since yu come ive been doing my best and yu just cough in my face and now im going to quit and cough back would you enjoy walkin out till supper maam inquired the virginian as molly rose you was speaking of gathering some flowers yondeh why yes said molly blithely and youll come she added to me but i was on the virginians side i must look after my horse said i and went down to the corral day was slowly going as i took my pony to the water corncliff mesa crowheart butte these shone in the rays that came through the canyon the canyons sides lifted like tawny castles in the same light where i walked the odor of thousands of wild roses hung over the margin where the thickets grew high in the upper air magpies were sailing across the silent blue somewhere i could hear tommy explaining loudly how he and general crook had pumped lead into hundreds of indians and when suppertime brought us all back to the door he was finishing the account to mrs taylor molly and the virginian arrived bearing flowers and he was saying that few cowpunchers had any reason for saving their money but when you get old said she we mostly dont live long enough to get old maam said he simply but i have a reason and i am saving give me the flowers said molly and she left him to arrange them on the table as lin came hurrying out ive told her said he to the southerner and me that ive asked her twiced and im going to let her have one more chance and ive told her that if its a log cabin shes marryin why tommy is a sure good wooden piece of furniture to put inside it and i guess she knows theres not much wooden furniture about me i want to speak to you he took the virginian round the corner but though he would not confide in me i began to discern something quite definite at supper cattle men will lose stock if the crows get down as far as this he said casually and mrs taylor suppressed a titter aint it hawses there repawted as running off said the virginian chap come into the roundup this afternoon said lin but he was rattled and told a heap o facts that wouldnt square of course they wouldnt said tommy haughtily oh theres nothing in it said lin dismissing the subject have yu been to the opera since we went to cheyenne mrs taylor mrs taylor had not lin said the virginian did yu ever see that opera cyarmen you bet fellows girl quits him for a bullfighter gets him up in the mountains and quits him he wasnt much good not in her class o sports smugglin and such i reckon she was doubtful of him from the start took him to the mountins to experiment where theyd not have interruption said the virginian talking of mountains said tommy this range here used to be a great place for indians till we ran em out with terry pumped lead into the red sonsofguns you bet said lin do yu figure that girl tired of her bullfighter and quit him too i reckon replied the virginian that the bullfighter wore better fans and taverns and gypsies and sportin said lin my but id like to see them countries with oranges and bullfights only i expect spain maybe aint keepin it up so gay as when carmen happened the tabletalk soon left romance and turned upon steers and alfalfa a grass but lately introduced in the country no further mention was made of the hostile crows and from this i drew the false conclusion that tommy had not come up to their hopes in the matter of reciting his campaigns but when the hour came for those visitors who were not spending the night to take their leave taylor drew tommy aside with me and i noticed the virginian speaking with molly wood whose face showed diversion dont seem to make anything of it whispered taylor to tommy but the ladies have got their minds on this indian truck why ill just explain began tommy dont whispered lin joining us yu know how women are once they take a notion why the more yu deny the surer they get now yu see him and me he jerked his elbow towards the virginian must go back to camp for were on second relief and the ladies would sleep better knowing there was another man in the house said taylor in that case said tommy i yu see said lin theyve been told about ten sleep being burned two nights ago it aint cried tommy why of course it aint drawled the ingenious lin but thats what i say you and i know ten sleeps all right but we cant report from our own knowledge seeing it all right and there it is they get these nervous notions just dont appear to make anything special of not going back to riverside repeated taylor but but just kind of stay here said lin i will exclaimed tommy of course im glad to oblige i suppose i was slowsighted all this pains seemed to me larger than its results they had imposed upon tommy yes but what of that he was to be kept from going back to riverside until morning unless they proposed to visit his empty cabin and play tricks but that would be too childish even for lin mclean to say nothing of the virginian his occasional partner in mischief in spite of the crows i satirically told the ladies i shall sleep outside as i intended ive no use for houses at this season the cinches of the horses were tightened lin and the virginian laid a hand on their saddlehorns swung up and soon all sound of the galloping horses had ceased molly wood declined to be nervous and crossed to her little neighbor cabin we all parted and as always in that blessed country deep sleep quickly came to me i dont know how long after it was that i sprang from my blankets in halfdoubting fright but i had dreamed nothing a second long wild yell now gave me i must own to it a horrible chill i had no pistol nothing in the hateful brightness of the moon my single thought was house house and i fled across the lane in my underclothes to the cabin when round the corner whirled the two cowpunchers and i understood i saw the virginian catch sight of me in my shirt and saw his teeth as he smiled i hastened to my blankets and returned more decent to stand and watch the two go shooting and yelling round the cabin crazy with their youth the door was opened and taylor courageously emerged bearing a winchester he fired at the sky immediately b gosh he roared thats one he fired again out and at em theyre running at this duly came mrs taylor in white with a pistol and miss peck in white staring and stolid but no tommy noise prevailed without shots by the stable and shots by the creek the two cowpunchers dismounted and joined taylor maniac delight seized me and i too rushed about with them helping the din oh mr taylor said a voice i didnt think it of you it was molly wood come from her cabin very pretty in a hoodandcloak arrangement she stood by the fence laughing but more at us than with us stop friends said taylor gasping she teaches my bobbie his a b c id hate to have bobbie speak to your papa said molly and held her scholar up on the fence well ill be goldarned said taylor surveying his costume if lin mclean hasnt made a fool of me tonight where has tommy got said mrs taylor didnt yus see him said the biscuitshooter speaking her first word in all this we followed her into the kitchen the table was covered with tin plates beneath it wedged knelt tommy with a pistol firm in his hand but the plates were rattling up and down like castanets there was a silence among us and i wondered what we were going to do well murmured the virginian to himself if i could have foresaw id not it makes yu feel humiliated yuself he marched out got on his horse and rode away lin followed him but perhaps less penitently we all dispersed without saying anything and presently from my blankets i saw poor tommy come out of the silent cabin mount and slowly very slowly ride away he would spend the night at riverside after all of course we recovered from our unexpected shame and the tale of the table and the dancing plates was not told as a sad one but it is a sad one when you think of it i was not there to see lin get his bride i learned from the virginian how the victorious puncher had ridden away across the sunny sagebrush bearing the biscuitshooter with him to the nearest justice of the peace she was astride the horse he had brought for her yes he beat tommy said the virginian some folks anyway get what they want in this hyeh world from which i inferred that miss molly wood was harder to beat than tommy lin mcleans honeymoon rain had not fallen for some sixty days and for some sixty more there was no necessity that it should fall it is spells of weather like this that set the western editor writing praise and prophecy of the boundless fertility of the soil when irrigated and of what an eden it can be made with irrigation but the spells annoy the people who are trying to raise the eden we always told the transient eastern visitor when he arrived at cheyenne and criticised the desert that anything would grow here with irrigation and sometimes he replied unsympathetically that anything could fly with wings then we would lead such a man out and show him six eight ten square miles of green crops and he if he was thoroughly nasty would mention that wyoming contained ninetyfive thousand square miles all waiting for irrigation and eden one of these eastern supercivilized hostiles from new york was breakfasting with the governor and me at the cheyenne club and we were explaining to him the glorious future the coming empire of the western country now the governor was about thirtytwo and until twentyfive had never gone west far enough to see over the top of the alleghany mountains i was not a pioneer myself and why both of us should have pitied the newyorkers narrowness so hard i cannot see but we did we spoke to him of the size of the country we told him that his state could rattle round inside wyomings stomach without any inconvenience to wyoming and he told us that this was because wyomings stomach was empty altogether i began to feel almost sorry that i had asked him to come out for a hunt and had travelled in haste all the way from bear creek to cheyenne expressly to meet him for purposes of amusement he said ill admit anything you claim for this place ranches cowboys elk its all splendid only as an investment i prefer the east am i to see any cowboys you shall i said and i distinctly hoped some of them might do something to him for purposes of amusement you fellows come up with me to my office said the governor ill look at my mail and show you round so we went with him through the heat and sun whats that inquired the newyorker whom i shall call james ogden that is our park said i of course its merely in embryo its wonderful how quickly any shade tree will grow here wi i checked myself but ogden said with irrigation for me and i was entirely sorry he had come we reached the governors office and sat down while he looked his letters over here you are ogden said he heres the way we hump ahead out here and he read us the following magaw kansas july hon amory w baker sir understanding that your district is suffering from a prolonged drought i write to say that for necessary expenses paid i will be glad to furnish you with a reasonably shower i have operated successfully in australia mexico and several states of the union and am anxious to exhibit my system if your legislature will appropriate a sum to cover as i said merely my necessary expenses say three hundred and fifty dollars for half an inch i will guarantee you that quantity of rain or forfeit the money if i fail to give you the smallest fraction of the amount contracted for there is to be no pay kindly advise me of what date will be most convenient for you to have the shower i require twentyfour hours preparation hoping a favorable reply i am respectfully yours robert hilbrun will the legislature do it inquired ogden in good faith the governor laughed boisterously i guess it wouldnt be constitutional said he oh bother said ogden my dear man the governor protested i know were new and our women vote and were a good deal of a joke but were not so progressively funny as all that the people wouldnt stand it senator warren would fly right into my back hair barker was also new as governor do you have senators here too said ogden raising his eyebrows what do they look like are they females and the governor grew more boisterous than ever slapping his knee and declaring that these eastern men were certainly out of sight ogden however was thoughtful id have been willing to chip in for that rain myself he said thats an idea cried the governor nothing unconstitutional about that lets see three hundred and fifty dollars ill put up a hundred said ogden promptly im out for a western vacation and ill pay for a good specimen the governor and i subscribed more modestly and by noon with the help of some lively minded gentlemen of cheyenne we had the purse raised he wont care said the governor whether its a private enterprise or a municipal step so long as he gets his money he wont get it im afraid said ogden but if he succeeds in tempting providence to that extent i consider it cheap now what do you call those people there on the horses we were walking along the track of the cheyenne and northern and looking out over the plain toward fort russell that is a cowpuncher and his bride i answered recognizing the couple real cowpuncher quite the punchers name is lin mclean real bride im afraid so shes riding straddle exclaimed the delighted ogden adjusting his glasses why do you object to their union being holy i explained that my friend lin had lately married an eatinghouse lady precipitately and against my advice i suppose he knew his business observed ogden thats what he said to me at the time but you ought to see her and know him ogden was going to husband and wife were coming our way husband nodded to me his familiar offish nod which concealed his satisfaction at meeting with an old friend wife did not look at me at all but i looked at her and i instantly knew that lin the fool had confided to her my disapproval of their marriage the most delicate specialty upon earth is your standing with your old friends new wife goodday mr mclean said the governor to the cowpuncher on his horse howre are yu doctor said lin during his early days in wyoming the governor when as yet a private citizen had set mr mcleans broken leg at drybone let me make yu known to mrs mclean pursued the husband the lady at a loss how convention prescribes the greeting of a bride to a governor gave a waddle on the ponys back then sat up stiff gazed haughtily at the air and did not speak or show any more sign than a cow would under like circumstances so the governor marched cheerfully at her extending his hand and when she slightly moved out toward him her big dumb red fist he took it and shook it and made her a series of compliments she maintaining always the scrupulous reserve of the cow i say ogden whispered to me while barker was pumping the hand of the flesh image im glad i came the appearance of the puncherbridegroom also interested ogden and he looked hard at lins leather chaps and cartridgebelt and so forth lin stared at the newyorker and his high white collar and good scarf he had seen such things quite often of course but they always filled him with the same distrust of the man that wore them well said he i guess well be pulling for a hotel any show in town circus come yet no said i are you going to make a long stay the cowpuncher glanced at the image his bride of three weeks till were tired of it i guess said he with hesitation it was the first time that i had ever seen my gay friend look timidly at any one and i felt a rising hate for the rubychecked largeeyed eatinghouse lady the biscuitshooter whose influence was dimming this jaunty irrepressible spirit i looked at her her bulky bloom had ensnared him and now she was going to tame and spoil him the governor was looking at her too thoughtfully say lin i said if you stay here long enough youll see a big show and his eye livened into something of its native jocularity as i told him of the rainmaker shucks said he springing from his horse impetuously and hugely entertained at our venture three hundred and fifty dollars let me come in and before i could tell him that we had all the money raised he was hauling out a wadded lump of bills well i aint going to starve here in the road i guess spoke the image with the suddenness of a miracle i think we all jumped and i know that lin did the image continued some folks and their money are soon parted she meant me her searching tones came straight at me i was sure from the first that she knew all about me and my unfavorable opinion of her but it aint going to be you this time lin mclean ged ap this last was to the horse i maintain though the governor says the husband immediately started off on a run at any rate they were gone to their hotel and ogden was seated on some railroad ties exclaiming oh i like wyoming i am certainly glad i came thats who she is said the governor remembering mrs mclean all at once i know her she used to be at sidney shes got another husband somewhere shes one of the boys oh thats nothing in this country he continued to the amazed ogden who had ejaculated bigamy lots of them marry live together awhile get tired and quit travel catch on to a new man marry him get tired and quit travel catch on one moment i beg said ogden adjusting his glasses what does the law law said the governor look at that place he swept his hand towards the vast plains and the mountains ninetyfive thousand square miles of that and sixty thousand people in it we havent got policemen yet on top of the rocky mountains i see said the newyorker but but well let a and b represent first and second husbands and x represent the woman now does a know about b or does b know about a and what do they do about it cant say the governor answered jovially cant generalize depends on heaps of things love money did you go to college well let a minus x equal b plus x then if a and b get squared oh come to lunch i said barker do you really know the first husband is alive wasnt dead last winter and barker gave us the particulars miss katie peck had not served long in the restaurant before she was wooed and won by a man who had been a ranch cook a sheepherder a bartender a freight hand and was then hauling poles for the government during his necessary absences from home she too went outofdoors this he often discovered and would beat her and she would then also beat him after the beatings one of them would always leave the other forever thus was sidney kept in smalltalk until mrs lusk one day really did not come back lusk said the governor finishing his story cried around the saloons for a couple of days and then went on hauling poles for the government till at last he said hed heard of a better job south and next we knew of him he was round leavenworth lusk was a pretty poor bird owes me ten dollars well i said none of us ever knew about him when she came to stay with mrs taylor on bear creek she was miss peck when lin made her mrs mclean youll notice said the governor how she has got him under in three weeks old hand you see poor lin i said lucky i call him said the governor he can quit her supposing mclean does not want to quit her shes educating him to want to right now and i think hell learn pretty quick i guess mr lins romance wasnt very ideal this trip hello here comes jode jode wont you lunch with us mr ogden of new york mr jode mr jode is our signalservice officer mr ogden the governors eyes were sparkling hilariously and he winked at me gentlemen goodmorning mr ogden i am honored to make your acquaintance said the signalservice officer jode when is it going to rain said the governor anxiously now jode is the most extraordinarily solemn man i have ever known he has the solemnity of all science added to the unspeakable weight of representing five of the oldest families in south carolina the jodes themselves were not old in south carolina but immensely so in i think he told me it was long island his name is poinsett middleton manigault jode he used to weigh a hundred and twentyeight pounds then but his health has strengthened in that climate his clothes were black his face was white with black eyes sharp as a pin he had the shape of a spout the same narrow size all the way down and his voice was as dry and light as an eggshell in his first days at cheyenne he had constantly challenged large cowboys for taking familiarities with his dignity and they after one moments bewilderment had concocted apologies that entirely met his exactions and gave them much satisfaction also nobody would have hurt jode for the world in time he came to see that wyoming was a game invented after his book of rules was published and he looked on but could not play the game he had fallen along with other incongruities into the roaring western hotchpot and he passed his careful precise days with barometers and weathercharts he answered the governor with official and south carolina impressiveness there is no indication of diminution of the prevailing pressure he said well thats what i thought said the joyous governor so im going to whoop her up what do you expect to whoop up sir atmosphere and all that said the governor whole business has got to get a move on ive sent for a rainmaker governor you are certainly a wag sir said jode who enjoyed barker as some people enjoy a symphony without understanding it but after we had reached the club and were lunching and jode realized that a letter had actually been written telling hilbrun to come and bring his showers with him the punctilious signalservice officer stated his position have your joke sir he said waving a thin clean hand but i decline to meet him hilbrun said the governor staring if thats his name yes sir as a member of the weather bureau and the meteorological society i can have nothing to do with the fellow glory said the governor well i suppose not i see your point jode ill be careful to keep you apart as a member of the college of physicians ive felt that way about homeopathy and the faithcure all very well if patients will call em in but cant meet em in consultation but three months drought annually jode its slow too slow the western people feel that this conservative method the zodiac does its business by is out of date i am quite serious sir said jode and let me express my gratification that you do see my point so we changed the subject our weather scheme did not at first greatly move the public beyond those who made up the purse few of our acquaintances expressed curiosity about hilbrun and next afternoon lin mclean told me in the street that he was disgusted with cheyennes coldness toward the enterprise but the boys would fly right at it and stay with it if the roundup was near town you bet said he he was walking alone hows mrs mclean today i inquired shes well said lin turning his eye from mine whos your friend all bugged up in english clothes about as good a man as you said i and more cautious him and his eyeglasses said the sceptical puncher still looking away from me and surveying ogden who was approaching with the governor that excellent man still at long range broke out smiling till his teeth shone and he waved a yellow paper at us telegram from hilbrun he shouted be here tomorrow and he hastened up says he wants a cart at the depot and a small building where he can be private added ogden great isnt it you bet said lin brightening the new yorkers urbane but obvious excitement mollified mr mclean ever seen rain made mr ogden said he never have you lin had not ogden offered him a cigar which the puncher pronounced excellent and we all agreed to see hilbrun arrive were going to show the telegram to jode said the governor and he and ogden departed on this mission to the signal service well i must be getting along myself said lin but he continued walking slowly with me wherere yu bound he said nowhere in particular said i and we paced the board sidewalks a little more youre going to meet the train tomorrow said he the train oh yes hilbruns tomorrow youll be there yes ill be there its sure been a dry spell aint it yes just like last year in fact like all the years yes ive never saw it rain any to speak of in summer i expect its the rule dont you i shouldnt wonder i dont guess any man knows enough to break such a rule do you no but itll be fun to see him try sure fun well i must be getting along see yu tomorrow see you tomorrow lin he left me at a corner and i stood watching his tall depressed figure a hundred yards down the street he turned and seeing me looking after him pretended he had not turned and then i took my steps toward the club telling myself that i had been something of a skunk for i had inquired for mrs mclean in a certain tone and i had hinted to lin that he had lacked caution and this was nothing but a way of saying i told you so to the man that is down down lin certainly was although it had not come so home to me until our little walk together just now along the boards at the club i found the governor teaching ogden a cheyenne specialty a particular drink the allston cocktail its the bitters that does the trick he was saying but saw me and called out you ought to have been with us and seen jode i showed him the telegram you know he read it through and just handed it back to me and went on monkeying with his anemometer ever seen his instruments every fresh jigger they get out he sends for well he monkeyed away and wouldnt say a word so i said you understand jode this telegram comes from hilbrun and jode he quit his anemometer and said i make no doubt sir that your despatch is genuwine oh south carolinas indignant at me and the governor slapped his knee why hes so set against hilbrun he continued i guess if he knew of something he could explode to stop rain hed let her fly no he wouldnt said i hed not consider that honorable thats so the governor assented jodell play fair it was thus we had come to look at our enterprise a game between a wellestablished respectable weather bureau and an upstart charlatan and it was the charlatan had our sympathy as all charlatans whether religious military medical political or what not have with the average american we met him at the station that is ogden mclean and i and the governor being engaged sent unofficially his secretary and the requested cart lin was anxious to see what would be put in the cart and i was curious about how a rainmaker would look but he turned out an unassuming quiet man in blue serge with a face you could not remember afterwards and a few civil ordinary remarks he even said it was a hot day as if he had no relations with the weather and what he put into the cart were only two packingboxes of no special significance to the eye he desired no lodging at the hotel but to sleep with his apparatus in the building provided for him and we set out for it at once it was an untenanted barn and he asked that he and his assistant might cut a hole in the roof upon which we noticed the assistant for the first time a tallish goodlooking young man but with a weak mouth this is mr lusk said the rainmaker and we shook hands ogden and i exchanging a glance ourselves and the cart marched up hill street or capitol avenue as it has become named since cheyenne has grown fuller of pomp and emptier of prosperity and i thought we made an unusual procession the governors secretary unofficially leading the way to the barn the cart and the rainmaker beside it guarding his packedup mysteries mclean and lusk walking together in unconscious bigamy and in the rear odgen nudging me in the ribs that it was the correct lusk we had with us i felt sure from his incompetent healthy vacant appearance strongbodied and shiftless the sort of man to weary of one trade and another and make a failure of wife beating between whiles in twentyfourth street the towns uttermost rim the governor met us and stared at lusk christopher was his single observation but he never forgets a face cannot afford to now that he is in politics and besides lusk remembered him you seldom really forget a man to whom you owe ten dollars so youve quit hauling poles said the governor nothing in it sir said lusk is there any objection to my having a hole in the roof asked the rainmaker for this the secretary had been unable to tell him what going to throw your bombs through it said the governor smiling heartily but the rainmaker explained at once that his was not the bomb system but a method attended by more rain and less disturbance not that the bomb dont produce firstclass results at times and under circumstances he said but its uncertain and costly the governor hesitated about the hole in the roof which hilbrun told us was for a metal pipe to conduct his generated gases into the air the owner of the barn had gone to laramie however we found a stovepipe hole which saved delay and what day would you prefer the shower said hilbrun after we had gone over our contract with him any day would do the governor said this was thursday and sunday was chosen as a day when no one had business to detain him from witnessing the shower though it seemed to me that on weekdays too business in cheyenne was not so inexorable as this we gave the strangers some information about the town and left them the sun went away in a cloudless sky and came so again when the stars had finished their untarnished shining friday was clear and dry and hot like the dynasty of blazing days that had gone before i saw a sorry spectacle in the street the bridegroom and the bride shopping together or rather he with his wad of bills was obediently paying for what she bought and when i met them he was carrying a scarlet parasol and a bonnetbox his biscuitshooter with the lust of purchase on her was brilliantly dressed and pervaded the street with splendor like an escaped parrot lin walked beside her but it might as well have been behind and his bearing was so different from his wonted happygoluckiness that i had a mind to take off my hat and say goodmorning mrs lusk but it was mrs mclean i said of course she gave me a remote imperious nod and said come on lin something like a cross nurse while he out of sheer decency made her a goodhumored jocular answer and said to me it takes a woman to know what to buy for housekeepin which poor piece of hypocrisy endeared him to me more than ever the puncher was not of the fibre to succeed in keeping appearances but he deserved success which the angels consider to be enough i wondered if disenchantment had set in or if this were only the preliminary stage of surprise and wounding and i felt that but one test could show namely a coming face to face of mr and mrs lusk perhaps not to be desired neither was it likely the assistant rainmaker kept himself steadfastly inside or near the barn at the north corner of cheyenne while the bride when she was in the street at all haunted the shops clear across town diagonally on this friday noon the appearance of the metal tube above the blind building spread some excitement it moved several of the citizens to pay the place a visit and ask to see the machine these callers of course sustained a polite refusal and returned among their friends with a contempt for such quackery and a greatly heightened curiosity so that pretty soon you could hear discussions at the street corners and by saturday morning cheyenne was talking of little else the town prowled about the barn and its oracular metal tube and heard and saw nothing the governor and i let it be confessed went there ourselves since the twentyfour hours of required preparation were now begun we smelled for chemicals and he thought there was a something but having been bred a doctor distrusted his imagination i could not be sure myself whether there was anything or not although i walked three times round the barn snuffing as dispassionately as i knew how it might possibly be chlorine the governor said or some gas for which ammonia was in part responsible and this was all he could say and we left the place the world was as still and the hard sharp hills as clear and near as ever and the sky over sahara is not more dry and enduring than was ours this tenacity in the elements plainly gave jode a malicious official pleasure we could tell it by his talk at lunch and when the governor reminded him that no rain was contracted for until the next day he mentioned that the approach of a storm is something that modern science is able to ascertain long in advance and he bade us come to his office whenever we pleased and see for ourselves what science said this was at any rate something to fill the afternoon with and we went to him about five lin mclean joined us on the way i came upon him lingering alone in the street and he told me that mrs mclean was calling on friends i saw that he did not know how to spend the short recess or holiday he was having he seemed to cling to the society of others and with them for the time regain his gayer mind he had become converted to ogden and the newyorker on his side found pleasant and refreshing this democracy of governors and cowpunchers jode received us at the signalservice office and began to show us his instruments with the careful pride of an orchidcollector a hair hygrometer he said to me waving his waxlike hand over it the indications are obtained from the expansion and contraction of a prepared human hair transferred to an index needle traversing the divided arc of what oil do you put on the human hair jode called out the governor who had left our group and was gamboling about by himself among the tubes and dials what will this one do he asked and poked at a wet paper disc but before the courteous jode could explain that it had to do with evaporation and the dewpoint the governors attention wandered and he was blowing at a little fanwheel this instantly revolved and set a number of dial hands going different ways hi said the governor delighted seen em like that down mines register air velocity in feet put it away jode you dont want that tomorrow what youll need hilbrun says is a big old raingauge and rubber shoes i shall require nothing of the sort governor jode retorted at once and you can go to church without your umbrella in safety sir see there he pointed to a stormglass which was certainly as clear as crystal an oldfashioned test you will doubtless say gentlemen jode continued though none of us would have said anything like that but unjustly discredited and furthermore its testimony is well corroborated as you will find you must admit jodes voice was almost threatening and he fetched one corroborator after another i looked passively at wet and dry bulbs at selfrecording dotted registers i caught the fleeting sound of words like meniscus and terrestrial minimum thermometer and i nodded punctually when jode went through some calculation at last i heard something that i could understand a series of telegraphic replies to jode from brother signalservice officers all over the united states he read each one through from date of signature and they all made any rain tomorrow entirely impossible and i tell you jode concluded in his high eggshell voice theres no chance of precipitation now sir i tell you sir he was shrieking jubilantly theres not a damn thing to precipitate we left him in his triumph among his glass and mercury gee whiz said the governor i guess wed better go and tell hilbrun its no use we went and hilbrun smiled with a certain compassion for the antiquated scientist thats what they all say he said ill do my talking tomorrow if any of you gentlemen or your friends said assistant lusk stepping up feel like doing a little business on this i am ready to accommodate you what do yu want this evenin said lin mclean promptly five to one said lusk go yu in twenties said the impetuous puncher and i now perceived this was to be a sporting event lin had his wad of bills out or what of it still survived his brides shopping will you hold stakes doctor he said to the governor but that official looked at the clear sky and thought he would do five to one in twenties himself lusk accommodated him and then ogden and then me none of us could very well be stakeholder but we registered our bets and promised to procure an uninterested man by eight next morning i have seldom had so much trouble and i never saw such a universal search for ready money every man we asked to hold stakes instantly whipped out his own pocketbook went in search of lusk and disqualified himself it was jode helped us out he would not bet but was anxious to serve and thus punish the bragging lusk sunday was as usual chronically fine with no cloud or breeze anywhere and by the time the churchbells were ringing ten to one was freely offered the biscuitshooter went to church with her friends so she might wear her fine clothes in a worthy place while her furloughed husband rushed about cheyenne entirely his own old self again his wad of money staked and in jodes keeping many citizens bitterly lamented their lack of ready money but it was a good thing for these people that it was sunday and the banks closed the churchbells ceased the congregations sat inside but outside the hot town showed no sunday emptiness or quiet the metal tube the possible smell jodes sustained and haughty indignation the extraordinary assurance of lusk all this had ended by turning every one restless and eccentric a citizen came down the street with an umbrella in a moment the bystanders had reduced it to a sordid tangle of ribs old judge burrage attempted to address us at the corner about the vast progress of science the postmaster pinned a card on his back with the wellknown legend i am somewhat of a liar myself and all the while the sun shone high and hot while jode grew quieter and colder under the certainty of victory it was after twelve oclock when the people came from church and no change or sign was to be seen jode told us with a chill smile that he had visited his instruments and found no new indications fifteen minutes after that the sky was brown sudden padded dropsical clouds were born in the blue above our heads they blackened and a smart shower the first in two months wet us all and ceased the sun blazed out and the sky came blue again like those rapid unconvincing weather changes of the drama amazement at what i saw happening in the heavens took me from things on earth and i was unaware of the universal fit that now seized upon cheyenne until i heard the high cry of jode at my ear his usual punctilious bearing had forsaken him and he shouted alike to stranger and acquaintance it is no halfinch sir dont you tell me and the crowd would swallow him but you could mark his vociferous course as he went proclaiming to the world a failure sir the fellows an impostor as i well knew its no halfinch which was true what have you got to say to that we asked hilbrun swarming around him if youll just keep cool said he its only the first instalment in about two hours and a half ill give you the rest soon after four the dropsical clouds materialized once again above openmouthed cheyenne no school let out for an unexpected holiday no herd of stampeded range cattle conducts itself more miscellaneously gray respectable men with daughters married leaped over fences and sprang back prominent legislators hopped howling up and down doorsteps women waved handkerchiefs from windows and porches the chattering jode flew from anemometer to raingauge and old judge burrage apostrophized providence in his front yard with the postmasters label still pinned to his back nobody minded the sluicing downpour this second instalment was much more of a thing than the first and hilbrun alone kept a calm exterior the face of the man who lifts a heavy dumbbell and throws an impressive glance at the audience assistant lusk was by no means thus proof against success i saw him put a bottle back in his pocket his face already disintegrated with a tipsy leer judge burrage perceiving the rainmaker came out of his gate and proceeded toward him extending the hand of congratulation mr hilbrun said he i am judge burrage the honorable t coleman burrage and i will say that i am most favorably impressed with your shower his shower yelped jode flourishing measurements why yu dont claim its yourn do yu said lin mclean grinning i tell you its no halfinch yet gentlemen said jode ignoring the facetious puncher youre mistaken said hilbrun sharply its a plumb big show halfinch or no halfinch said lin if hes short he dont get his money said some ignoble subscriber yes he will said the governoror im a short hes earned it you bet said lin fair and square if theyre goin back on yu doctor ill chip shucks lins hand fell from the empty pocket he remembered his wad in the stakeholders hands and that he now possessed possibly two dollars in silver all told i cant chip in doctor he said that hobo over there has won my cash an hes filling up on the prospect right now i dont care its the biggest show ive ever saw youre a dandy mr hilbrun whoop and lin clapped the rainmaker on the shoulder exulting he had been too well entertained to care what he had in his pocket and his wife had not yet occurred to him they were disputing about the rainfall which had been slightly under half an inch in a few spots but over it in many others and while we stood talking in the renewed sunlight more telegrams were brought to jode saying that there was no moisture anywhere and simultaneously with these riders dashed into town with the news that twelve miles out the rain had flattened the grain crop we had more of such reports from as far as thirty miles and beyond that there had not been a drop or a cloud it staggered ones reason the brain was numb with surprise well gentlemen said the rainmaker im packed up and my trainll be along soon would have been along by this only its late whats the word as to my three hundred and fifty dollars even still there were objections expressed he had not entirely performed his side of the contract i think different gentlemen said he but ill unpack and let that train go i cant have the law on you i suppose but if you dont pay me the rainmaker put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the fence ill flood your town in earthquakes and eruptions people end by expecting anything and in the total eclipse that was now over all cheyennes ordinary standards and precedents the bewildered community saw in this threat nothing more unusual than if he had said twice two made four the purse was handed over im obliged said hilbrun simply if i had foreseen gentlemen said jode too deeply grieved now to feel anger that i would even be indirectly associated with your losing your money through this this absurd occurrence i would have declined to help you it becomes my duty he continued turning coldly to the inebriated lusk to hand this to you sir and the assistant lurchingly stuffed his stakes away its worth it said lin hes welcome to my cash whats that you say lin mclean it was the biscuitshooter and she surged to the front im broke hes got it thats all said lin briefly broke you she glared at her athletic young lord and she uttered a preliminary howl at that longlost cry lusk turned his silly face its my darling kate he said why kate the next thing that i knew ogden and i were grappling with lin mclean for everything had happened at once the bride had swooped upon her first wedded love and burst into tears on the mans neck which lin was trying to break in consequence we do not always recognize our benefactors at sight they all came to the ground and we hauled the second husband off the lady and lusk remained in a heap he foolish tearful and affectionate she turned furiously at bay his guardian angel indifferent to the onlooking crowd and hurling righteous defiance at lin dont yus dare lay yer finger on my husband you sagebrush bigamist is what the marvelous female said bigamist repeated lin dazed at this charge i aint he said to ogden and me i never did ive never married any of em before her little good thatll do yus lin mclean me and him was man and wife before ever i come acrosst yus you and him murmured the puncher her and me whimpered lusk sidney he sat up with a limp confiding stare at everybody sidney who said lin no no corrected lusk crossly sidney nebraska the stakes at this point fell from his pocket which he did not notice but the bride had them in safekeeping at once who are yu anyway when yu aint drunk demanded lin hes as good a man as you and better snorted the guardian angel give him a pistol and hell make you hard to find well you listen to me sidney nebraska lin began no no corrected lusk once more as a distant whistle blew jim goodbye gentlemen said the rainmaker thats the westbound im perfectly satisfied with my experiment here and im off to repeat it at salt lake city you are shouted lin mclean him and jims going to work it again for goodness sake somebody lend me twentyfive dollars at this there was an instantaneous rush ten minutes later in front of the ticketwindows there was a line of citizens buying tickets for salt lake as if it had been madame bernhardt some rock had been smitten and ready money had flowed forth the governor saw us off sad that his duties should detain him but jode went betting is the fools argument gentlemen said he to ogden mclean and me and its a weary time since i have had the pleasure which way are yu bettin lin asked with my principles sir answered the little signalservice officer i expect i aint got any said the puncher its jim im backin this time see here said i i want to talk to you we went into another car and i did and so yu knowed about lusk when we was on them board walks the puncher said do you mean i ought to have shucks no yu couldnt nobody couldnt its a queer world all the same yu have good friends and all that he looked out of the window laramie already he commented and got out and walked by himself on the platform until we had started again yu have good friends he pursued settling himself so his long legs were stretched and comfortable and they tell yu things and you tell them things and when it dont make no particular matter one way or the other yu give em your honest opinion and talk straight to em and theyll come to you the same way so that when yure ridin the range alone sometimes and thinkin a lot o things over on top maybe of some doggoned hill youll say to yourself about some fellow yu know mighty well theres a man is a good friend of mine and yu mean it and its so yet when matters is serious as onced in a while theyre bound to get and yure in a plumb hole where is the man then your good friend why hes where yu want him to be standin off keepin his mouth shut and lettin yu find your own trail out if he tried to show it to yu yud likely hit him but shucks circumstances have showed me the trail this time you bet and the punchers face which had been sombre grew lively and he laid a friendly hand on my knee the trails pretty simple said i you bet but its sure a queer world tell yu said lin with the air of having made a discovery when a man gets down to bedrock affairs in this life hes got to do his travellin alone same as he does his dyin i expect even married men has thoughts and hopes they dont tell their wives never was married said i well no more was i lets go to bed and lin shook my hand and gave me a singular rather melancholy smile at salt lake city which ogden was glad to include in his western holiday we found both mormon and gentile ready to give us odds against rain only i noticed that those of the true faith were less free indeed the mormon the quaker and most sects of an isolated doctrine have a nice prudence in money during our brief stay we visited the sights floating in the lake listening to pins drop in the gallery of the tabernacle seeing frescos of saints in robes speaking from heaven to joseph smith in the sunday clothes of a modern farmhand and in the street we heard at a distance a strenuous domestic talk between the new or perhaps i should say the original husband and wife shes corralled sidneys cash said the delighted lin he cant bet nothing on this shower and then after all this time it didnt rain stripped of money both ways cheyenne having most fortunately purchased a return ticket sought its home the perplexed rainmaker went somewhere else without his assistant lusks exulting wife having the money retained him with her good luck to yu sidney said lin speaking to him for the first time since cheyenne i feel a heap better since ive saw yu married he paid no attention to the biscuitshooter or the horrible language that she threw after him jode also felt a heap better legitimate science had triumphed today most of cheyenne believes with jode that it was all a coincidence south carolina had bet on her principles and won from lin the few dollars that i had lent the puncher and what will you do now i said to lin join the beef roundup balaams payin forty dollars i guess thatll keep a single man a journey in search of christmas the governor descended the steps of the capitol slowly and with pauses lifting a list frequently to his eye he had intermittently pencilled it between stages of the forenoons public business and his gait grew absent as he recurred now to his jottings in their accumulation with a slight pain at their number and the definite fear that they would be more in seasons to come they were the names of his friends children to whom his excellent heart moved him to give christmas presents he had put off this regenerating evil until the latest day as was his custom and now he was setting forth to do the whole thing at a blow entirely planless among the guns and rockinghorses that would presently surround him as he reached the highway he heard himself familiarly addressed from a distance and turning saw four sons of the alkali jogging into town from the plain one who had shouted to him galloped out from the others rounded the capitols enclosure and approaching with radiant countenance leaned to reach the hand of the governor and once again greeted him with a hilarious hello doc governor barker md seeing mr mclean unexpectedly after several years hailed the horseman with frank and lively pleasure and inquiring who might be the other riders behind was told that they were shorty chalkeye and dollar bill come for christmas and dandies to hit town with mr mclean added redhot i am acquainted with them assented his excellency weve been ridin trail for twelve weeks the cowpuncher continued makin our beds down anywheres and eatin the same old chuck every day so weve shook fried beef and heifers delight and were goin to feed high then mr mclean overflowed with talk and pungent confidences for the holidays already rioted in his spirit and his tongue was loosed over their coming rites weve soured on scenery he finished in his drastic idiom were sick of moonlight and cowdung and were heeled for a big time call on me remarked the governor cheerily when youre ready for bromides and sulphates i aint boxheaded no more protested mr mclean ive got maturity doc since i seen yu at the rainmaking and im a heap older than them hospital days when i bust my leg on yu three or four glasses and quit thats my rule that your rule too inquired the governor of shorty chalkeye and dollar bill these gentlemen of the saddle were sitting quite expressionless upon their horses we aint talkin were waitin observed chalkeye and the three cynics smiled amiably well doc see yu again said mr mclean he turned to accompany his brother cowpunchers but in that particular moment fate descended or came up from whatever place she dwells in and entered the body of the unsuspecting governor whats your hurry said fate speaking in the officials hearty manner come along with me cant do it where are yu goin christmasing replied fate well ive got to feed my horse christmasing yu say yes im buying toys toys you what for oh some kids yourn screeched lin precipitately his excellency the jovial governor opened his teeth in pleasure at this for he was a bachelor and there were fifteen upon his list which he held up for the edification of the hasty mclean not mine im happy to say my friends keep marrying and settling and their kids call me uncle and climb around and bother and i forget their names and think its a girl and the mother gets mad why if i didnt remember these little folks at christmas theyd be wondering not the kids they just break your toys and dont notice but the mother would wonder whats the matter with dr barker has governor barker gone back on us thats where the strain comes he broke off facing mr mclean with another spacious laugh but the cowpuncher had ceased to smile and now while barker ran on exuberantly mcleans wideopen eyes rested upon him singular and intent and in their hazel depths the last gleam of jocularity went out thats where the strain comes you see two sets of acquaintances grateful patients and loyal voters and ive got to keep solid with both outfits especially the wives and mothers theyre the people so its drums and dolls and sheep on wheels and games and monkeys on a stick and the saleslady shows you a mechanical bear and it costs too much and you forget whether the judges second girl is nellie or susie and well im just in for my annual circus this afternoon youre in luck christmas dont trouble a chap fixed like you lin mclean prolonged the sentence like a distant echo a chap fixed like you the cowpuncher said it slowly to himself no sure he seemed to be watching shorty and chalkeye and dollar bill going down the road thats a new idea christmas he murmured for it was one of his oldest and he was recalling the christmas when he wore his first long trousers comes once a year pretty regular remarked the prosperous governor seems often when you pay the bill i havent made a christmas gift pursued the cowpuncher dreamily not for for lord its a hundred years i guess i dont know anybody that has any right to look for such a thing from me this was indeed a new idea and it did not stop the chill that was spreading in his heart gee whiz said barker briskly there goes twelve oclock ive got to make a start sorry you cant come and help me goodbye his excellency left the rider sitting motionless and forgot him at once in his own preoccupation he hastened upon his journey to the shops with the list not in his pocket but held firmly like a plank in the imminence of shipwreck the nellies and susies pervaded his mind and he struggled with the presentiment that in a day or two he would recall some omitted and wretchedly important child quick hoofbeats made him look up and mr mclean passed like a wind the governor absently watched him go and saw the pony hunch and stiffen in the check of his speed when lin overtook his companions down there in the distance they took a side street and barker rejoicingly remembered one more name and wrote it as he walked in a few minutes he had come to the shops and met face to face with mr mclean the boys are seein after my horse lin rapidly began and ive got to meet em sharp at one were twelve weeks shy on a square meal yu see and this first has been a date from way back id like to here mr mclean cleared his throat and his speech went less smoothly doc id like just for a while to watch yu gettin them monkeys yu know the governor expressed his agreeable surprise at this change of mind and was glad of mcleans company and judgment during the impending selections a picture of a cowpuncher and himself discussing a couple of dolls rose nimbly in barkers mental eye and it was with an imperfect honesty that he said youll help me a heap and lin quite sincere replied thank yu so together these two went christmasing in the throng wyomings chief executive knocked elbows with the spurred and jingling waif one man as good as another in that raw hopeful fullblooded cattle era which now the sobered west remembers as the days of its fond youth for one man has been as good as another in three places paradise before the fall the rocky mountains before the wire fence and the declaration of independence and then this governor beside being young almost as young as lin mclean or the chief justice who lately had celebrated his thirtysecond birthday had in his doctoring days at drybone known the cowpuncher with that familiarity which lasts a lifetime without breeding contempt accordingly he now laid a hand on lins tall shoulder and drew him among the petticoats and toys christmas filled the windows and christmas stirred in mankind cheyenne not overzealous in doctrine or litanies and with the opinion that a world in the hand is worth two in the bush nevertheless was flocking together neighbor to think of neighbor and every one to remember the children a sacred assembly after all gathered to rehearse unwittingly the articles of its belief the creed and doctrine of the child lin saw them hurry and smile among the paper fairies they questioned and hesitated crowded and made decisions failed utterly to find the right thing forgot and hastened back suffered all the various desperations of the eleventh hour and turned homeward dropping their parcels with that undimmed goodwill that once a year makes gracious the universal human face this brotherhood swam and beamed before the cowpunchers brooding eyes and in his ears the greeting of the season sang children escaped from their mothers and ran chirping behind the counters to touch and meddle in places forbidden friends dashed against each other with rabbits and magic lanterns greeted in haste and were gone amid the sound of musical boxes through this tinkle and bleating of little machinery the murmur of the human heart drifted in and out of mcleans hearing fragments of home talk tendernesses economies intimate first names and dinner hours and whether it was joy or sadness it was in common the world seemed knit in a single skein of home ties two or three came by whose purses must have been slender and whose purchases were humble and chosen after much nice adjustment and when one plain man dropped a word about both ends meeting and the woman with him laid a hand on his arm saying that his children must not feel this year was different lin made a step toward them there were hours and spots where he could readily have descended upon them at that played the role of clinking affluence waved thanks aside with competent blasphemy and tossing off some infamous whiskey cantered away in the full selfconscious strut of the frontier but here was not the moment the abashed cowpuncher could make no such parade in this place the people brushed by him back and forth busy upon their errands and aware of him scarcely more than if he had been a spirit looking on from the helpless dead and so while these weaving needs and kindnesses of man were within arms touch of him he was locked outside with his impulses barker had in the natural press of customers long parted from him to become immersed in choosing and rejecting and now with a fair part of his mission accomplished he was ready to go on to the next place and turned to beckon mclean he found him obliterated in a corner beside a lifesized image of santa claus standing as still as the frosty saint he looks livelier than you do said the hearty governor fraid its been slow waiting no replied the cowpuncher thoughtfully no i guess not this uncertainty was expressed with such gentleness that barker roared you never did lie to me he said long as ive known you well never mind ive got some real advice to ask you now at this mr mcleans face grew more alert say doc said he what do yu want for christmas that nobodys likely to give yu a big practice big enough to interfere with my politics what else things and truck i mean oh nothing ill get people dont give things much to fellows like me dont they dont they why you and santa claus werent putting up any scheme on my stocking well i believe youre in earnest cried his excellency thats simply rich here was a thing to relish the frontier comes to town heeled for a big time finds that presents are all the rage and must immediately give somebody something oh childlike miscellaneous frontier so thought the goodhearted governor and it seems a venial misconception my dear fellow he added meaning as well as possible i dont want you to spend your money on me ive got plenty all right said lin shortly plentys not the point ill take as many drinks as you please with you you didnt expect anything from me that aint that dont there of course you didnt then what are you getting proud about heres our shop they stepped in from the street to new crowds and counters now pursued the governor this is for a very particular friend of mine here they are now which of those do you like best they were sets of tennyson in cases holding little volumes equal in number but the binding various and mr mclean reached his decision after one look that said he and laid a large muscular hand upon the laureate the young lady behind the counter spoke out acidly and lin pulled the abject hand away his taste however happened to be sound or at least it was at one with the governors but now they learned that there was a distressing variance in the matter of price the governor stared at the delicate article of his choice i know that tennyson is what she is whats wanted he muttered and feeling himself nudged looked around and saw lins extended fist this gesture he took for a facetious sympathy and dolorously grasping the hand found himself holding a lump of bills sheer amazement relaxed him and the cowpunchers matted wealth tumbled on the floor in sight of all people barker picked it up and gave it back no no no he said mirthful over his own inclination to be annoyed you cant do that im just as much obliged lin he added just as a loan doc some of it im grassbellied with spotcash a giggle behind the counter disturbed them both but the sharp young lady was only dusting the governor at once paid haughtily for tennysons expensive works and the cowpuncher pushed his discountenanced savings back into his clothes making haste to leave the book department of this shop they regained a mutual ease and the governor became waggish over lins concern at being too rich he suggested to him the list of delinquent taxpayers and the latest census from which to select indigent persons he had patients too whose inveterate pennilessness he could swear cheerfully to since you want to bolt from your own money he remarked yes im a green horse assented mr mclean gallantly aint used to the looks of a twentydollar bill and i shy at em from his face that jocular mask one might have counted him the most serene and careless of vagrants and in his words only the ordinary voice of banter spoke to the governor a good woman it may well be would have guessed before this the sensitive soul in the blundering body but barker saw just the familiar whimsical happygolucky mclean of old days and so he went gayly and innocently on treading upon holy ground ive got it he exclaimed give your wife something the ruddy cowpuncher grinned he had passed through the world of woman with but few delays rejoicing in informal and transient entanglements and he welcomed the turn which the conversation seemed now to be taking if youll give me her name and address said he with the future entirely in his mind why laramie and the governor feigned surprise say doc said lin uneasily none of em aint married me since i saw yu last then she hasnt written from laramie said the hilarious governor and mr mclean understood and winced in his spirit deep down gee whiz went on barker ill never forget you and lusk that day but the mask fell now youre talking of his wife not mine said the cowpuncher very quietly and smiling no more and doc im going to say a word to yu for i know yuve always been my good friend ill never forget that day myself but i dont want to be reminded of it im a fool lin said the governor generous instantly i never supposed i know yu didnt doc it aint you thats the fool and in a way in a way lins speech ended among his crowding memories and barker seeing how wistful his face had turned waited but i aint quite the same fool i was before that happened to me the cowpuncher resumed though maybe my actions dont show to be wiser i know that there was better luck than a man like me had any call to look for the sobered barker said simply yes lin he was put to thinking by these words from the unsuspected inner man out in the bow leg country lin mclean had met a woman with thick red cheeks calling herself by a maiden name and this was his whole knowledge of her when he put her one morning astride a mexican saddle and took her fifty miles to a magistrate and made her his lawful wife to the best of his ability and belief his sagebrush intimates were confident he would never have done it but for a rival racing the rival and beating him had swept mr mclean past his own intentions and the marriage was an inadvertence he jest bumped into it before he could pull up they explained and this casualty resulting from mr mcleans sporting blood had entertained several hundred square miles of alkali for the newmade husband the joke soon died in the immediate weeks that came upon him he tasted a bitterness worse than in all his life before and learned also how deep the woman when once she begins can sink beneath the man in baseness that was a knowledge of which he had lived innocent until this time but he carried his outward self serenely so that citizens in cheyenne who saw the cowpuncher with his bride argued shrewdly that men of that sort liked women of that sort and before the strain had broken his endurance an unexpected first husband named lusk had appeared one sunday in the street prosperous forgiving and exceedingly drunk to the arms of lusk she went back in the public street deserting mclean in the presence of cheyenne and when cheyenne saw this and learned how she had been mrs lusk for eight long if intermittent years cheyenne laughed loudly lin mclean laughed too and went about his business ready to swagger at the necessary moment and with the necessary kind of joke always ready to shield his hurt spirit and soon of course the matter grew stale seldom raked up in the bow leg country where lin had been at work so lately he had begun to remember other things beside the smouldering humiliation is she with him he asked barker and musingly listened while barker told him the governor had thought to make it a racy story with the moral that the joke was now on lusk but that inner man had spoken and revealed the cowpuncher to him in a new and complicated light hence he quieted the proposed lively cadence and vocabulary of his anecdote about the house of lusk but instead of narrating how mrs beat mr on mondays wednesdays and fridays and mr took his turn the odd days thus getting one ahead of his lady while the kid lusk had outlined his opinion of the family by recently skipping to parts unknown barker detailed these incidents more gravely adding that laramie believed mrs lusk addicted to opium i dont guess ill leave my card on em said mclean grimly if i strike laramie you dont mind my saying i think youre well out of that scrape barker ventured shucks no thats all right doc only yu see now a man gets tired pretending onced in a while time had gone while they were in talk and it was now half after one and mr mclean late for that longplotted first square meal so the friends shook hands wishing each other merry christmas and the cowpuncher hastened toward his chosen companions through the stirring cheerfulness of the season his playhour had made a dull beginning among the toys he had come upon people engaged in a pleasant game and waited shy and well disposed for some bidding to join but they had gone on playing with each other and left him out and now he went along in a sort of hurry to escape from that loneliness where his human promptings had been lodged with him useless here was cheyenne full of holiday for sale and he with his pockets full of money to buy and when he thought of shorty and chalkeye and dollar bill those dandies to hit a town with he stepped out with a brisk false hope it was with a mental hurrah and a foretaste of a good time coming that he put on his town clothes after shaving and admiring himself and sat down to the square meal he ate away and drank with a robust imitation of enjoyment that took in even himself at first but the sorrowful process of his spirit went on for all he could do as he groped for the contentment which he saw around him he began to receive the jokes with counterfeit mirth memories took the place of anticipation and through their moody shiftings he began to feel a distaste for the company of his friends and a shrinking from their lively voices he blamed them for this at once he was surprised to think he had never recognized before how light a weight was shorty and here was chalkeye who knew better talking religion after two glasses presently this attack of noticing his friends shortcomings mastered him and his mind according to its wont changed at a stroke im celebrating no christmas with this crowd said the inner man and when they had next remembered lin mclean in their hilarity he was gone governor barker finishing his purchases at halfpast three went to meet a friend come from evanston mr mclean was at the railway station buying a ticket for denver denver exclaimed the amazed governor thats what i said stated mr mclean doggedly gee whiz went his excellency what are you going to do there get good and drunk cant you find enough whiskey in cheyenne im drinking champagne this trip the cowpuncher went out on the platform and got aboard and the train moved off barker had walked out too in his surprise and as he stared after the last car mr mclean waved his wide hat defiantly and went inside the door and he says hes got maturity barker muttered ive known him since seventynine and hes kept about eight years old right along the governor was cross and sorry and presently crosser his jokes about lins marriage came back to him and put him in a rage with the departed fool yes about eight or six said his excellency justifying himself by the past for he had first known lin the boy of nineteen supreme in length of limb and recklessness breaking horses and feeling for an early mustache next when the mustache was nearly accomplished he had mended the boys badly broken thigh at drybone his skill and lins utter health had wrought so swift a healing that the surgeon overflowed with the pride of science and over the bandages would explain the human body technically to his wildeyed and flattered patient thus young lin heard all about tibia and comminuted and other glorious new words and when sleepless would rehearse them then with the bone so nearly knit that the patient might leave the ward on crutches to sit each morning in barkers room as a privilege the disobedient child of twentyone had slipped out of the hospital and hobbled hastily to the hog ranch where whiskey and variety waited for a languishing convalescent here he grew gay and was soon carried back with the leg refractured yet barkers surgical rage was disarmed the patient was so forlorn over his doctors professional chagrin i suppose it aint no better this morning doc he had said humbly after a new week of bed and weights your right legs going to be shorter thats all oh gosh ive been and spoiled your comminuted feemur aint i a sonofagun you could not chide such a boy as this and in times due course he had walked jauntily out into the world with legs of equal length after all and in his stride the slightest halt possible and doctor barker had missed the childs conversation today his mustache was a perfected thing and he in the late end of his twenties hell wake up about noon tomorrow in a dive without a cent said barker then hell come back on a freight and begin over again at the denver station lin mclean passed through the shoutings and omnibuses and came to the beginning of seventeenth street where is the first saloon a customer was ordering hot scotch and because he liked the smell and had not thought of the mixture for a number of years lin took hot scotch coming out upon the pavement he looked across and saw a saloon opposite with brighter globes and windows more prosperous that should have been his choice lemon peel would undoubtedly be fresher over there and over he went at once to begin the whole thing properly in such frozen weather no drink could be more timely and he sat to enjoy without haste its mellow fitness once again on the pavement he looked along the street toward uptown beneath the crisp cold electric lights and three little bootblacks gathered where he stood and cried shine shine at him remembering that you took the third turn to the right to get the best dinner in denver lin hit on the skilful plan of stopping at all hot scotches between but the next occurred within a few yards and it was across the street this one being attained and appreciated he found that he must cross back again or skip number four at this rate he would not be dining in time to see much of the theatre and he stopped to consider it was a german place he had just quitted and a huge light poured out on him from its window which the proprietors fatherland sentiment had made into a show lights shone among a wellset pine forest where beery jovial gnomes sat on roots and reached upward to santa claus he grinning fat and teutonic held in his right hand forever a foaming glass and forever in his left a string of sausages that dangled down among the gnomes with his american back to this the cowpuncher wearing the same serious absent face he had not changed since he ran away from himself at cheyenne considered carefully the hot scotch question and which side of the road to take and stick to while the little bootblacks found him once more and cried shine shine monotonous as snowbirds he settled to stay over here with the southside scotches and the little onenote song reaching his attention he suddenly shoved his foot at the nearest boy who lightly sprang away dare you to touch him piped a snowbird dangerously they were in short trousers and the eldest enemy it may be was ten dont hit me said mr mclean im innocent well you leave him be said one whats he layin to kick you for billy taint yer pop is it new said billy in scorn father never kicked me dont know who he is hes a special shrilled the leading bird sensationally hes got a badge and hes goin to arrest yer two of them hopped instantly to the safe middle of the street and scattered with practiced strategy but billy stood his ground dare you to arrest me said he whatll you give me not to inquired lin and he put his hands in his pockets arms akimbo nothing ive done nothing announced billy firmly but even in the last syllable his voice suddenly failed a terror filled his eyes and he too sped into the middle of the street whats he claim you lifted inquired the leader with eagerness tell him you havent been inside a store today we can prove it they screamed to the special officer say said the slowspoken lin from the pavement youre poor judges of a badge you fellows his tone pleased them where they stood wide apart from each other mr mclean also remained stationary in the bluish illumination of the window why if any policeman was caught wearin this here said he following his sprightly invention hed get arrested himself this struck them extremely they began to draw together billy lingering the last if its your idea pursued mr mclean alluringly as the three took cautious steps nearer the curb that blue clasped hands in a circle of red stars gives the bearer the right to put folks in the jug why ill get somebody else to black my boots for a dollar the three made a swift rush fell on simultaneous knees and clattering their boxes down began to spit in an industrious circle easy wheedled mr mclean and they looked up at him staring and fascinated not having three feet said the cowpuncher always grave and slow i can only give two this here job hes got a big pistol and a belt exulted the leader who had precociously felt beneath lins coat youre a smart boy said lin considering him and yu find a man out right away now you stand off and tell me all about myself while they fix the boots and a dollar goes to the quickest through young billy and his towheaded competitor flattened down each to a boot with all their might while the leader ruefully contemplated mr mclean thats a colt youve got ventured he right again some day maybe youll be wearing one of your own if the angels dont pull yu before youre ripe im through sang out towhead rising in haste small billy was struggling still but leaped at that the two heads bobbing to a level together and mr mclean looking down saw that the arrangement had not been a good one for the boots will you kindly referee said he forgivingly to the leader and decide which of them smears is the awfulest but the leader looked the other way and played upon a mouthorgan well that saves me money said mr mclean jingling his pocket i guess youve both won he handed each of them a dollar now he continued i just dassent show these boots uptown so this time its a dollar for the best shine the two went palpitating at their brushes again and the leader played his mouthorgan with brilliant unconcern lin tall and brooding leaned against the jutting sill of the window a figure somehow plainly strange in town while through the bright plateglass santa claus holding out his beer and sausages perpetually beamed billy was laboring gallantly but it was labor the cowpuncher perceived and billy no seasoned expert see here said lin stooping ill show yu how its done hes playin that toon crosseyed enough to steer anybody crooked there keep your blacking soft and work with a dry brush lemme said billy ive got to learn so he finished the boot his own way with wiry determination breathing and repolishing and this event was also adjudged a dead heat with results gratifying to both parties so here was their work done and more money in their pockets than from all the other boots and shoes of this day and towhead and billy did not wish for further trade but to spend this handsome fortune as soon as might be yet they delayed in the brightness of the window drawn by curiosity near this new kind of man whose voice held them and whose remarks dropped them into constant uncertainty even the omitted leader had been unable to go away and nurse his pride alone is that a secret society inquired towhead lifting a finger at the badge mr mclean nodded turruble said he youre a wells fargo detective asserted the leader play your harp said lin are you a a desperaydo whispered towhead oh my observed mr mclean sadly what has our jack been readin hes a cattleman cried billy i seen his heels thats you said the discovered puncher with approval youll do but i bet you cant tell me what we wearers of this badge have sworn to do this night at this they craned their necks and glared at him we are sworn dont yu jump now and give me away sworn to blow off three bootblacks to a dinner ah pshaw they backed away bristling with distrust thats the oath fellows yu may as well make your minds up for i have it to do dare you to ah and after dinner its the operahouse to see the children of captain cant they screamed shrilly at him keeping off beyond the curb i cant waste my time on such smart boys said mr mclean rising lazily to his full height from the windowsill i am goin somewhere to find boys that aint so turruble quick stampeded by a roast turkey he began to lounge slowly away serious as he had been throughout and they stopping their noise short swiftly picked up their boxes and followed him some change in the current of electricity that fed the window disturbed its sparkling light so that santa claus with his arms stretched out behind the departing cowpuncher seemed to be smiling more broadly from the midst of his flickering brilliance on their way to turkey the host and his guests exchanged but few remarks he was full of goodwill and threw off a comment or two that would have led to conversation under almost any circumstances save these but the minds of the guests were too distracted by this whole state of things for them to be capable of more than keeping after mr mclean in silence at a wary interval and with their mouths during most of the journey open the badge the pistol their patrons talk and the unusual dollars wakened wide their bent for the unexpected their street affinity for the spur of the moment they believed slimly in the turkey part of it but what this man might do next to be there when he did it and not to be trapped kept their wits jumping deliciously so when they saw him stop they stopped instantly too ten feet out of reach this was denvers most civilized restaurant that one which mr mclean had remembered with foreign dishes and private rooms where he had promised himself among other things champagne mr mclean had never been inside it but heard a tale from a friend and now he caught a sudden sight of people among geraniums with plumes and white shirtfronts very elegant it must have been several minutes that he stood contemplating the entrance and the luxurious couples who went in plumb french he observed at length and then shucks in a key less confident while his guests ten feet away watched him narrowly theyre eatin patty de parleyvoo in there he muttered and the three bootblacks came beside him say fellows said lin confidingly i wasnt raised good enough for them dude dishes what do yu say im after a place where yu can mention oyster stoo without givin anybody a fit what do yu say boys that lighted the divine spark of brotherhood ah you come along with us well take yer you dont want to go in there well show yer the boss place in market street we wont lose yer so shouting together in their shrill little city trebles they clustered about him and one pulled at his coat to start him he started obediently and walked in their charge they leading the way christmas is comin now sure said lin grinning to himself it aint exactly what i figured on it was the first time he had laughed since cheyenne and he brushed a hand over his eyes that were dim with the new warmth in his heart believing at length in him and his turkey the alert street faces so suspicious of the unknown looked at him with ready intimacy as they went along and soon in the friendly desire to make him acquainted with denver the three were patronizing him only billy perhaps now and then stole at him a doubtful look the large country mouse listened solemnly to his three town mice who presently introduced him to the place in market street it was not boss precisely and denver knows better neighborhoods but the turkey and the oyster stew were there with catsup and vegetables in season and several choices of pie here the country mouse became again efficient and to witness his liberal mastery of ordering and imagine his pocket and its wealth which they had heard and partly seen renewed in the guests a transient awe as they dined however and found the host as frankly ravenous as themselves this reticence evaporated and they all grew fluent with oaths and opinions at one or two words indeed mr mclean stared and had a slight sense of blushing have a cigarette said the leader over his pie thank yu said lin i wont smoke if yull excuse me he had devised a wholesome meal with water to drink chewins no good at meals continued the boy dont you use tobaccer onced in a while the leader spat brightly he aint learned yet said he slanting his elbows at billy and sliding a match over his rump but beer now i never seen anything in it he and towhead soon left billy and his callow profanities behind and engaged in a town conversation that silenced him and set him listening with all his admiring young might nor did mr mclean join in the talk but sat embarrassed by this knowledge which seemed about as much as he knew himself ill be goshed he thought if id caught on to half that when i was streakin around in short pants maybe they grow up quicker now but now the country mouse perceived billys eager and attentive apprenticeship hello boys he said that theatres got a big start on us they had all forgotten he had said anything about theatre and other topics left their impatient minds while the country mouse paid the bill and asked to be guided to the operahouse this man here will look out for your blackin and truck and let yu have it in the morning they were very late the spectacle had advanced far into passages of the highest thrill and denvers eyes were riveted upon a ship and some icebergs the party found its seats during several beautiful limelight effects and that remarkable flybuzzing of violins which is proounced so helpful in times of peril and sentiment the children of captain grant had been tracking their father all over the equator and other scenic spots and now the north pole was about to impale them the captains youngest child perceiving a hummock rushing at them with a sudden motion loudly shouted sister the ice is closing in and she replied chastely then let us pray it was a superb tableau the ice split and the sun rose and joggled at once to the zenith the actdrop fell and male denver wrung to its religious deeps went out to the rumshop of course mr mclean and his party did not do this the party had applauded exceedingly the defeat of the elements and the leader with towhead discussed the probable chances of the ships getting farther south in the next act until lately billys doubt of the cowpuncher had lingered but during this intermission whatever had been holding out in him seemed won and in his eyes that he turned stealthily upon his unconscious quiet neighbor shone the beginnings of heroworship dont you think this is splendid said he splendid lin replied a trifle remotely dont you like it when they all get balled up and get out that way humming said lin dont you guess its just girls though that do that what young fellow why all that prayersaying an stuff i guess it must be she said to do it when the ice scared her an of course a man had to do what she wanted him sure well do you believe theyd a done it if she hadnt been on that boat and clung around an cried an everything an made her friends feel bad i hardly expect they would replied the honest lin and then suddenly mindful of billy except there wasnt nothin else they could think of he added wishing to speak favorably of the custom why that chunk of ice werent so awful big anyhow id a shoved her off with a pole wouldnt you butted her like a ram exclaimed mr mclean well i dont say my prayers any more i told mr perkins i wasnt agoing to an he i think he is a flubdub anyway ill bet he is said lin sympathetically he was scarcely a prudent guardian i told him straight an he looked at me an down he flops on his knees an he made em all flop but i told him i didnt care for them putting up any campmeeting over me an he says ill lick you an i says dare you to i told him mother kep alicking me for nothing an id not pray for her not in sundayschool or anywheres else do you pray much no replied lin uneasily there i told him a man didnt an he said then a man went to hell you lie father aint going to hell i says and youd ought to heard the first class laugh right out loud girls an boys an he was that mad but i didnt care i came here with fifty cents yu must have felt like a millionaire ah i felt all right i bought papers an sold em an got more an saved ant got my box an blacking outfit i werent going to be licked by her just because she felt like it an she feeling like it most any time lemme see your pistol you wait said lin after this show is through ill put it on you will you honest belt an everything did you ever shoot a bear lord lots honest silvertips silvertips cinnamon black and i roped a cub onced oh i never shot a bear youd ought to try it im agoing to im agoing to camp out in the mountains id like to see you when you camp id like to camp with you mightnt i some time billy had drawn nearer to lin and was looking up at him adoringly you bet said lin and though he did not perhaps entirely mean this it was with a curiously softened face that he began to look at billy as with dogs and his horse so always he played with what children he met the few in his sagebrush world but this was ceasing to be quite play for him and his hand went to the boys shoulder father took me camping with him once the time mother was off father gets awful drunk too ive quit laramie for good lin sat up and his hand gripped the boy laramie said he almost shouting it yu yu is your name lusk but the boy had shrunk from him instantly youre not going to take me home he piteously wailed heaven and heavens murmured lin mclean so youre her kid he relaxed again down in his chair his legs stretched their straight length below the chair in front he was waked from his bewilderment by a brushing under him and there was young billy diving for escape to the aisle like the cornered city mouse that he was lin nipped that poor little attempt and had the limp billy seated inside again before the two in discussion beyond had seen anything he had said not a word to the boy and now watched his unhappy eyes seizing upon the various exits and dispositions of the theatre nor could he imagine anything to tell him that should restore the perished confidence why did yu lead him off he asked himself unexpectedly and found that he did not seem to know but as he watched the restless and estranged runaway he grew more and more sorrowful i just hate him to think that of me he reflected the curtain rose and he saw billy make up his mind to wait until they should all be going out in the crowd while the children of captain grant grew hotter and hotter upon their fathers geographic trail lin sat saying to himself a number of contradictions hes nothing to me whats any of them to me driven to bay by his bewilderment he restated the facts of the past why shed deserted him and lusk before shed ever laid eyes on me i neednt to bother myself he wasnt never even my stepkid the past however brought no guidance lord whats the thing to do about this if i had any home this is a stinkin world in some respects said mr mclean aloud unknowingly the lady in the chair beneath which the cowpuncher had his legs nudged her husband they took it for emotion over the sad fortune of captain grant and their backs shook presently each turned and saw the singular man with untamed wideopen eyes glowering at the stage and both backs shook again once more his hand was laid on billy say the boy glanced at him and quickly away look at me and listen billy swervingly obeyed i aint after yu and never was this heres your business not mine are yu listenin good the boy made a nod and lin proceeded whispering youve got no call to believe what i say to yu yuve been lied to i guess pretty often so ill not stop yu runnin and hidin and ill never give it away i saw yu but yu keep doin what yu please ill just go now ive saw all i want but you and your friends stay with it till it quits if yu happen to wish to speak to me about that pistol or bears yu come around to smiths palace thats the boss hotel here aint it and if yu dont come too late ill not be gone to bed but this time of night im liable to get sleepy tell your friends goodbye for me and be good to yourself ive appreciated your company mr mclean entered smiths palace and engaging a room with two beds in it did a little delicate lying by means of the truth its a lost boy a runaway he told the clerk hell not be extra clean i expect if he does come maybe hell give me the slip and ill have a job cut out tomorrow ill thank yu to put my money in your safe the clerk placed himself at the disposal of the secret service and lin walked up and down looking at the railroad photographs for some ten minutes when master billy peered in from the street hello said mr mclean casually and returned to a fine picture of pikes peak billy observed him for a space and receiving no further attention came stepping along im not agoing back to laramie he stated warningly i wouldnt said lin it aint half the town denver is well goodnight sorry yu couldnt call sooner im dead sleepy oh billy stood blank i wish id shook the darned old show say lemme black your boots in the morning not sure my train dont go too early im up im up i get around to all of em where do yu sleep sleeping with the engineman now why cant you put that on me tonight goin upstairs this gentleman wouldnt let you go upstairs but the earnestly petitioned clerk consented and billy was the first to hasten into the room he stood rapturous while lin buckled the belt round his scanty stomach and ingeniously buttoned the suspenders outside the accoutrement to retard its immediate descent to earth did it ever kill a man asked billy touching the sixshooter no it aint never had to do that but i expect maybe its stopped some killin me oh leave me wear it just a minute do you collect arrowheads i think theyre bully theres the finest one you ever seen he brought out the relic tightly wrapped in paper several pieces i foun it myself camping with father it was sticking in a crack right on top of a rock but nobodyd seen it till i came along aint it fine mr mclean pronounced it a gem father an me

an perkins wanting me to say god bless my mother agetting up and agoing to bed hes a flubdub an so i cleared out but id just as leaves said for god to bless father an you ill do it now if you say its any sense mr mclean sat down in a chair dont yu do it now said he you wouldnt like mother billy continued you can keep that he came to lin and placed the arrowhead in his hands standing beside him do you like birds eggs i collect them i got twentyfive kinds sagehen an blue grouse an willowgrouse an lots more kinds harder but i couldnt bring all them from laramie i brought the magpies though d you care to see a magpie egg well you stay tomorrow an ill show you that en some other things i got the engineman lets me keep there for theres boys that would steal an egg an i could take you where we could fire that pistol bet you dont know what that is he brought out a small tin box shaped like a thimble in which were things that rattled mr mclean gave it up thats kinnikinnic seed you can have that for i got some more with the engineman lin received this second token also and thanked the giver for it his first feeling had been to prevent the boys parting with his treasures but something that came not from the polish of manners and experience made him know that he should take them billy talked away laying bare his little soul the street boy that was not quite come made place for the child that was not quite gone and unimportant words and confidences dropped from him disjointed as he climbed to the knee of mr mclean and inadvertently took that cowpuncher for some sort of parent he had not hitherto met it lasted but a short while however for he went to sleep in the middle of a sentence with his head upon lins breast the man held him perfectly still because he had not the faintest notion that billy would be impossible to disturb at length he spoke to him suggesting that bed might prove more comfortable and finding how it was rose and undressed the boy and laid him between the sheets the arms and legs seemed aware of the moves required of them and stirred conveniently and directly the head was upon the pillow the whole small frame burrowed down without the opening of an eye or a change in the breathing lin stood some time by the bedside with his eyes on the long curling lashes and the curly hair then he glanced craftily at the door of the room and at himself in the lookingglass he stooped and kissed billy on the forehead and rising from that gave himself a hangdog stare in the mirror and soon in his own bed was sleeping the sound sleep of health he was faintly roused by the church bells and lay still lingering with his sleep his eyes closed and his thoughts unshaped as he became slowly aware of the morning the ringing and the light reached him and he waked wholly and still lying quiet considered the strange room filled with the bells and the sun of the winters day where have i struck now he inquired and as last night returned abruptly upon his mind he raised himself on his arm there sat responsibility in a chair washed clean and dressed watching him youre awful late said responsibility but i werent agoing without telling you goodbye go exclaimed lin go where yu surely aint leavin me to eat breakfast alone the cowpuncher made his voice very plaintive set responsibility free after all his trouble to catch him this was more than he could do ive got to go if id thought youd want for me to stay why you said you was agoing by the early train but the durned things got away on me said lin smiling sweetly from the bed if i hadnt apromised them who sidney ellis and pete goode why you know them you grubbed with them shucks were agoing to have fun today oh for its christmas an weve bought some good cigars an pete says hell learn me sure o course ive smoked some you know but id just as leaves stayed with you if id only knowed sooner i wish you lived here did you smoke whole big cigars when you was beginning do you like

yu see but i slep and slep and kep yu from meetin your engagements yu see for you couldnt go of course a man couldnt treat a man that way now could he course he couldnt said billy brightening and they wouldnt wait yu see they wouldnt fool away christmas that only comes onced a year kickin their heels and sayin wheres billy theyd say bill has sure made other arrangements which hell explain to us at his leesyure and theyd skip with the cigars the advocate paused effectively and from his bolster regarded billy with a convincing eye thats so said billy and where would yu be then bill in the street out of friends out of christmas and left both ways no tobaccer and no flapjacks now bill what do yu say to us putting up a christmas deal together just you and me id like that said billy is it all day i was thinkin of all day said lin ill not make yu do anything yud rather not ah they can smoke without me said billy with sudden acrimony ill see em tomorro thats you cried mr mclean now bill you hustle down and tell them to keep a table for us ill get my clothes on and follow yu the boy went and mr mclean procured hot water and dressed himself tying his scarf with great care wished id a clean shirt said he but i dont look very bad shavin yesterday afternoon was a good move he picked up the arrowhead and the kinnikinnic and was particular to store them in his safest pocket i aint sure whether youre crazy or not said he to the man in the lookingglass i aint never been sure and he slammed the door and went downstairs he found young bill on guard over a table for four with all the chairs tilted against it as warning to strangers no one sat at any other table or came into the room for it was late and the place quite emptied of breakfasters and the several entertained waiters had gathered behind billys importantlooking back lin provided a thorough meal and billy pronounced the flannel cakes superior to flapjacks which were not upon the bill of fare id like to see you often said he ill come and see you if you dont live too far thats the trouble said the cowpuncher i do awful far he stared out of the window well i might come some time i wish youd write me a letter can you write whats that can i write oh yes i can write an i can read too ive been to school in sidney nebraska an magaw kansas an salt lake thats the finest town except denver billy fell into that cheerful strain of comment which unreplied to yet goes on contented and selfsustaining while mr mclean gave amiable signs of assent but chiefly looked out of the window and when the now interested waiter said respectfully that he desired to close the room they went out to the office where the money was got out of the safe and the bill paid the streets were full of the bright sun and seemingly at denvers gates stood the mountains sparkling an air crisp and pleasant wafted from their peaks no smoke hung among the roofs and the sky spread wide over the city without a stain it was holiday up among the chimneys and tall buildings and down among the quiet groundstories below as well and presently from their scattered pinnacles through the town the bells broke out against the jocund silence of the morning dont you like music inquired billy yes said lin ladies with their husbands and children were passing and meeting orderly yet gayer than if it were only sunday and the salutations of christmas came now and again to the cowpunchers ears but today possessor of his own share in this lin looked at every one with a sort of friendly challenge and young billy talked along beside him dont you think we could go in here billy asked a church door was open and the rich organ sounded through to the pavement theyve good music here an they keep it up without much talking between ive been in lots of times they went in and sat to hear the music better than the organ it seemed to them were the harmonious voices raised from somewhere outside like unexpected visitants and the pair sat in their back seat too deep in listening to the processional hymn to think of rising in decent imitation of those around them the crystal melody of the refrain especially reached their understandings and when for the fourth time shout the glad tidings exultingly sing pealed forth and ceased both the delighted faces fell dont you wish there was more billy whispered wish there was a hundred verses answered lin but canticles and responses followed with so little talking between them they were held spellbound seldom thinking to rise or kneel lins eyes roved over the church dwelling upon the pillars in their evergreen the flowers and leafy wreaths the texts of white and gold peace goodwill towards men he read thats so peace and goodwill yes thats so i expect they got that somewheres in the bible its awful good and youd never think of it yourself there was a touch on his arm and a woman handed a book to him this is the hymn we have now she whispered gently and lin blushing scarlet took it passively without a word he and billy stood up and held the book together dutifully reading the words it came upon the midnight clear that glorious song of old from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold peace on the earth this tune was more beautiful than all and lin lost himself in it until he found billy recalling him with a finger upon the words the concluding ones and the whole world sent back the song which now the angels sing the music rose and descended to its lovely and simple end and for a second time in denver lin brushed a hand across his eyes he turned his face from his neighbor frowning crossly and since the heart has reasons which reason does not know he seemed to himself a fool but when the service was over and he came out he repeated again peace and goodwill when i run on to the bishop of wyoming ill tell him if hell preach on them words ill be there couldnt we shoot your pistol now asked billy sure boy aint yu hungry though no i wish we were away off up there dont you the mountains they look pretty so white a heap better n houses why well go there theres trains to golden well shoot around among the foothills to golden they immediately went and after a meal there wandered in the open country until the cartridges were gone the sun was low and billy was walked off his young heels a truth he learned complete in one horrid moment and battled to conceal lame he echoed angrily i aint shucks said lin after the next ten steps you are and both feet tell you theres stones here an im just askipping them lin briefly took the boy in his arms and carried him to golden im played out myself he said sitting in the hotel and looking lugubriously at billy on a bed and i aint fit to have charge of a hog he came and put his hand on the boys head im not sick said the cripple i tell you im bully you wait an see me eat dinner but lin had hot water and cold water and salt and was an hour upon his knees bathing the hot feet and then billy could not eat dinner there was a doctor in golden but in spite of his light prescription and most reasonable observations mr mclean passed a foolish night of vigil while billy slept quite well at first and as the hours passed better and better in the morning he was entirely brisk though stiff i couldnt work quick today he said but i guess one day wont lose me my trade how d yu mean asked lin why ive got regulars you know sidney ellis an pete goode has theirs an we dont cut each other ive got mr daniels an mr fisher an lots an if you lived in denver id shine your boots every day for nothing i wished you lived in denver shine my boots yull never and yu dont black daniels or fisher or any of the outfit why im doing firstrate said billy surprised at the swearing into which mr mclean now burst an i aint big enough to get to make money at any other job i want to see that engineman muttered lin i dont like your smokin friend pete goode why hes awful smart dont you think hes smart smarts nothin observed mr mclean pete has learned me and sidney a lot pursued billy engagingly ill bet he has growled the cowpuncher and again billy was taken aback at his language it was not so simple this case to the perturbed mind of mr mclean it grew less simple during that day at golden while billy recovered and talked and ate his innocent meals the cowpuncher was far too wise to think for a single moment of restoring the runaway to his debauched and shiftless parents possessed of some imagination he went through a scene in which he appeared at the lusk threshold with billy and forgiveness and intruded upon a conjugal assault and battery shucks said he the kid would be off again inside a week and i dont want him there anyway denver upon the following day saw the little bootblack again at his corner with his trade not lost but near him stood a tall singular man with hazel eyes and a sulky expression and citizens during that week noticed as a new sight in the streets the tall man and the little boy walking together sometimes they would be in shops the boy seemed as happy as possible talking constantly while the man seldom said a word and his face was serious upon newyears eve governor barker was overtaken by mr mclean riding a horse up hill street cheyenne hello said barker staring humorously through his glasses have a good drunk changed my mind said lin grinning proves ive got one struck christmas all right though whos your friend inquired his excellency this is mister billy lusk him and me have agreed that towns aint nice to live in if judge henrys foreman and his wife wont board him at sunk creek why ill fix it somehow the cowpuncher and his responsibility rode on together toward the open plain sufferin moses remarked his excellency separs vigilante we had fallen half asleep my pony and i as we went jogging and jogging through the long sunny afternoon our hills of yesterday were a paleblue coast sunk almost away behind us and ahead our goal lay shining a little island of houses in this quiet midocean of sagebrush for two hours it had looked as clear and near as now rising into sight across the huge dead calm and sinking while we travelled our undulating imperceptible miles the train had come and gone invisibly except for its slow pillar of smoke i had watched move westward against wyomings stainless sky though i was still far off the watertank and other buildings stood out plain and complete to my eyes like childrens blocks arranged and forgotten on the floor so i rode along hypnotized by the sameness of the lazy splendid plain and almost unaware of the distant rider till suddenly he was close and hailing me theyve caved he shouted who i cried thus awakened ah the fool company said he quieting his voice as he drew near theyve shed their haughtiness he added confidingly as if i must know all about it where did they learn that wisdom i asked not knowing in the least experience he called over his shoulder for already we had met and passed nothing like experience for sweating the fat off the brain he yelled me a brotherly goodbye and i am sorry never to have known more of him for i incline to value any stranger so joyous but now i waked the pony and trotted briskly surmising as to the company and its haughtiness i had been viewing my destination across the sagebrush for so spunout a time that as constantly in wyoming journeys the emotion of arrival had evaporated long before the event and i welcomed employment for my otherwise highanddry mind probably he meant the railroad company certainly something large had happened even as i dismounted at the platform another hilarious cowpuncher came out of the station and at once remarking theyre going to leave us alone sprang on his horse and galloped to the corrals down the line where some cattle were being loaded into a train i went inside for my mail and here were four more cowpunchers playing with the agent they had got a letter away from him and he wore his daily look of anxiety to appreciate the jests of these rollicking people read it they said to me and i did read the private document and learned that the railroad was going to waive its right to enforce law and order here and would trust to separs good feeling nothing more the letter ran will be done about the initial outrage or the subsequent vandalisms we shall pass over our wasted outlay in the hope that a policy of friendship will prove our genuine desire to benefit that section initial outrage quoted one of the agent large playmates aint they furgivin well said i you would have some name for it yourself if you sent a deputy sheriff to look after your rights and he came back tied to the cowcatcher the man smiled luxuriously over this memory we didnt hurt him none just returned him to his home hear about the label honey wiggin pinned on to him send us along one dozen as per sample honeys quaint yes he drawled judicially id be mad at that but if youre making peace with a man because its convenient why your words must be pleasanter than if you really felt pleasant he took the paper from me and read sardonically subsequent vandalisms wasted outlay i suppose they run this station from charity to the cattle saves the poor things walking so far to the other railroad policy of friendship genuine desire oh mouthwash and shaking his bold clever head he daintily flattened the letter upon the head of the agent tubercle said he this was their name for the agent who had told all of us about his lungs it aint your fault we saw their fine letter they just intended you should give it out how they wouldnt bother us any more and then wed act square the boysll sit up late over this joke then they tramped to their horses and rode away the spokesman had hit the vital point unerringly for cowpunchers are shrewdly alive to frankness and it often draws out the best that is in them but its opposite affects them unfavorably and i needing sleep sighed to think of their late sitting up over that joke i walked to the board box painted hotel brunswick hotel in small italics and brunswickin enormous capitals the n and the s wrong side up here sat a girl outside the door alone her face was broad wholesome and strong and her eyes alert and sweet as i came she met me with a challenging glance of goodwill those women who journeyed along the line in the wake of payday to traffic with the men employed a stare well known but this straight look seemed like the greeting of some pleasant young cowboy in surprise i forgot to be civil and stepped foolishly by her to see about supper and lodging at the threshold i perceived all lodging bespoken on each of the four beds lay a coat or pistol or other article of dress and i must lodge myself there were my saddleblankets rather wet or lin mclean might ride in tonight on his way to riverside or perhaps down at the corrals i could find some other acquaintance whose habit of washing i trusted and whose bed i might share failing these expedients several empties stood idle upon a siding and the boxlike darkness of these freightcars was timely nights were short now camping out the dawn by three oclock would flow like silver through the universe and sinking through my blankets remorselessly pervade my buried hair and brain but with clean straw in the bottom of an empty i could sleep my fill until five or six i decided for the empty and opened the supperroom door where the table was set for more than enough to include me but the smell of the butter that awaited us drove me out of the hotel brunswick to spend the remaining minutes in the air i was expecting you said the girl well if i havent frightened him she laughed so delightfully that i recovered and laughed too why she explained i just knew youd not stay in there which side are you going to butter your bread this evening you had smelt it said i still cloudy with surprise yes unquestionably very rancid she glanced oddly at me and with less fellowship in her tone said i was going to warn you when suddenly down at the corrals the boys began to shoot at large oh dear she cried starting up theres trouble not trouble i assured her too many are firing at once to be in earnest and you would be safe here me a lady without escort well i should reckon so leastways we are respected where i was raised i was anxious for the gentlemen ovah yondah shawhan k c branch of the louavull an nashvull is my home the words louisville and nashville spoke creamily of bluegrass unescorted all that way i exclaimed isnt it awful said she tilting her head with a laugh and showing the pistol she carried but weve always been awful in kentucky now i suppose new york would never speak to poor me as it passed by and she eyed me with capable goodhumored satire why new york i demanded guess again well she debated well cowboy clothes and city language hes english she burst out and then she turned suddenly red and whispered to herself reprovingly if im not acting rude oh said i rather familiarly it was sir and please to excuse me if you had started joking so free with me id have been insulted when i saw you the hat and everything i took you you see ive always been that used to talking to to folks around her bright face saddened memories evidently rose before her and her eyes grew distant i wished to say treat me as folks around but this tall country girl had put us on other terms on discovering i was not folks around she had taken refuge in deriding me but swiftly feeling no solid ground there she drew a firm clear womans line between us plainly she was a comrade of men in her buoyant innocence secure yet by no means in the dark as to them yes unescorted two thousand miles she resumed and never as far as twenty from home till last tuesday i expect youll have to be scandalized for id do it right over again tomorrow youve got me all wrong said i im not english im not new york i am good american and not bounded by my own farm either no sectional line or mason and dixon or missouri river tattoos me but you when you say united states you mean united kentucky did you ever said she staring at what was greek to her as it is to most americans and so if you had a sister back east and she and you were all there was of you any more and she hadnt seen you since not since you first took to staying out nights and she started to visit you youd not tell her fie for shame id travel my moneys length to meet her said i a wave of pain crossed her face nate didnt know she said then lightly you see nates only a boy and regular thoughtless about writing ah so this nate never wrote and his sister loved and championed him many such stray nates and bobs and bills galloped over wyoming lost and forgiven im starting for him in the buffalo stage continued the girl then ill have your company on a weary road said i for my journey was now to that part of the cattle country to buffalo she said quickly then maybe you maybe my brother is nate buckner she paused then youre not acquainted with him i may have seen him i answered slowly but faces and names out here come and go i knew him well enough he was in jail convicted of forgery last week waiting to go to the penitentiary for five years and even this wild border community that hated law courts and punishments had not been sorry for he had cheated his friends too often and the wide charity of the sagebrush does not cover that sin beneath his pretty looks and daring skill with horses they had found vanity and a cold false heart but his sister could not here she was come to find him after lonely years and to this one soul that loved him in the world how was i to tell the desolation and the disgrace i was glad to hear her ask me if the stage went soon after supper now isnt that a bother said she when i answered that it did not start till morning she glanced with rueful gayety at the hotel never mind she continued briskly im used to things ill just sit up somewhere maybe the agent will let me stay in the office youre sure all that shootings only jollification certain i said but ill go and see they always will have their fun said she but i hate to have a poor boy get hurt even him deserving it they use pistols instead of firecrackers said i but you must never sleep in that office ill see what we can do why youre real kind she exclaimed heartily and i departed wondering what i ought to do perhaps i should have told you before that separ was a place once a sort of place but you will relish now i am convinced the pithy fable of its name midway between two sections of this still unfinished line that rail after rail and mile upon mile crawled over the earths face visibly during the constructing hours of each new day lay a camp to this point these unjoined pieces were heading and here at length they met camp separation it had been fitly called but how should the american railway man afford time to say that separation was pretty and apt but needless and with the sloughing of two syllables came the brief businesslike result separ chicago miles it was labelled on a board large almost as the hut station a yswitch two sidings the fat watertank and steampump and a sectionhouse with three trees before it composed the north side south of the track were no trees there was one long siding by the corrals and cattlechute there were a hovel where plug tobacco and canned goods were for sale a shed where you might get your horse shod a wire fence that at shipping times enclosed bales of pressed hay the hotel the stage stable and the little station some seven shanties all told between them were spaces of dust the immediate plains engulfed them and through their midst ran the farvanishing railroad to which they hung like beads on a great string from horizon to horizon a great eastandwest string one end in the rosy sun at morning and one in the crimson sun at night beyond each skyline lay cities and ports where the world went on out of sight and hearing this lone steel thread had been stretched across the continent because it was the day of haste and hope when dollars seemed many and hard times were few and from the yellowstone to the rio grande similar threads were stretching and little separs by dispersed hundreds hung on them as it were in space eternal can you wonder that vigorous young men with pistols should when they came to such a place shoot them off to let loose their unbounded joy of living and yet it was not this merely that began the custom but an error of the agents the new station was scarce created when one morning honey wiggin with the virginian had galloped innocently in from the roundup to telegraph for some additional cars im dead on to you squealed the official dropping flat at the sight of them and bang went his gun at them they most naturally thought it was a maniac and ran for their lives among the supports of the watertank while he remained anchored with his weapon crouched behind the railing that fenced him and his apparatus from the laity and some fifteen strategic minutes passed before all parties had crawled forth to an understanding and the message was written and paid for and comfortably despatched the agent was an honest creature but of tame habits sent for the sake of his imperfect lungs to this otherwise inappropriate air he had lived chiefly in midwest towns a serious reader of our comic weeklies hence the apparition of wiggin and the virginian had reminded him sickeningly of bandits he had express money in the safe he explained to them and this was a hard old country wasnt it and did they like good whiskey they drank his whiskey but it was not well to have mentioned that about the bandits both were aware that when shaved and washed of their roundup grime they could look very engaging the two cowpunchers rode out not angry but grieved that a man come here to dwell among them should be so tactless if we dont get him used to us observed the virginian he and his popgun will be guttin some blameless man forthwith the cattle country proceeded to get the agent used to it the news went over the sagebrush from belle fourche to sweetwater and playful howling horsemen made it their custom to go rioting with pistols round the ticket office educating the agent his lungs improved and he came dimly to smile at this life which he did not understand but the company discerned no humor whatever in having its watertank perforated which happened twice and sheriffs and deputies and other symptoms of authority began to invest separ now what should authority do upon these free plains this wilderness of doasyouplease where mere breathing the air was like inebriation the large headlong children who swept in from the sagebrush and out again meant nothing that they called harm until they found themselves resisted then presently happened that affair of the cowcatcher and later a toozealous marshal come about a mailcar they had sidetracked and held with fiddles drink and petticoats met his death accidentally at which they were sincerely sorry for about five minutes they valued their own lives as little and that lifts them forever from baseness at least so the company concluding such things must be endured for a while yet wrote their letter and you have seen how wrong the letter went all it would do would be from now on to fasten upon separ its code of recklessness to make shooting the watertank for example part of a gentlemans deportment when he showed himself in town it was not now the season of heavy shipping tonight their work would be early finished and then they were likely to play after their manner to arrive in such a place on her way to her brother the felon in jail made the girls journey seem doubly forlorn to me as i wandered down to the corrals a small bold voice hailed me hello you it said and here was billy lusk aged nine in boots and overalls importantly useless with a stick helping the men prod the steers at the chute thought you were at school said i ah schools quit returned billy and changed the subject say lins hunting you hes angling to eat at the hotel im grubbing with the outfit and billy resumed his specious activity mr mclean was in the ticketoffice where the newspaper had transiently reminded him of politics wall street he was explaining to the agent has been lunched on by them rosschilds and theyre moving on feeding along to chicago we want here he noticed me and dragging his gauntlet off shook my hand with his lusty grasp your eldest son just said you were in haste to find me i remarked lose you he meant the kid gets his words twisted didnt know you were a father mr mclean simpered the agent lin fixed his eye on the man and you dont know it now said he then he removed his eye lets grub he added to me my friend did not walk to the hotel but slowly round and about with a face overcast billy is a good kid he said at length and stopping began to kick small mounds in the dust politics floated lightly over him but here was a matter dwelling with him heavy and real hes dead stuck on being a cowpuncher he presently said some day i began he dont want to wait that long lin said and smiled affectionately and anyhow what is some day some day we punchers will not be here the living will be scattered and the dead well theyll be all right have yu studied the wire fence its spreading to catch us like nets do the salmon in the columbia river no more salmon no more cowpunchers stated mr mclean sententiously and his words made me sad though i know that progress cannot spare land and water for such things but billy lin resumed has agreed to school again when it starts up in the fall he takes his medicine because i want him to affection crept anew over the cowpunchers face he can learn books with the quickest when he wants that bear creek schoolmarm says but hed ought to have a regular mother till till i can do for him yu know its onwholesome him seeing and hearing the boys and me and me when i forget but shucks how can i fix it billy was sure enough dropped and deserted but when i found him the little calf could run and notice like everything i should hate your contract lin said i adoptings a touchandgo business even when a man has a home ill fill the contract you bet i wish the little sonofagun was mine im a heap more natural to him than that pair of drunkards that got him he likes me i think he does ive had to lick him now and then but lord his badness is all right not sneaky ill take him hunting next month and then the foremans wife at sunk creek boards him till school only when they move judge henryll make his virginia man foreman and hes got no woman to look after billy yu see hes asking one hard enough said i digressing oh yes asking talk of adopting said mr mclean and his wideopen hazel eyes looked away as he coughed uneasily then abruptly looking at me again he said dont you get off any more truck about eldest son and that will yu friend the boys are joshing me now not that i care for what might easy enough be so but theres billy maybe hed not mind but maybe he would after a while and i am kind o set on well he didnt have a good time till he shook that home of his and im going to make this old bitch of a world pay him what she owes him if i can now youll drop joshing wont yu his forehead was moist over getting the thing said and laying bare so much of his soul and so the world owes us a good time lin said i he laughed shortly she must have been dead broke then quite a while you bet oh no maybe i used to travel on that basis but see here lin laid his hand on my shoulder if you cant expect a good time for yourself in reason you can sure make the kids happy out o reason cant yu i fairly opened my mouth at him oh yes he said laughing in that short way again and he took his hand off my shoulder ive been thinking a wonderful lot since we met last i guess i know some things yu havent got to yet yourself why theres a girl that there is said i and certainly the world owes her a better shes a finelooker interrupted mr mclean paying me no further attention here the decrepit strawhatted proprietor of the hotel brunswick stuck his beard out of the door and uttered supper with a shrill croak at which the girl rose come said lin lets hurry but i hooked my fingers in his belt and in spite of his plaintive oaths at my losing him the best seat at the table told him in three words the sisters devoted journey nate buckner he exclaimed him with a decent sister its the other way round said i her with him for a brother he goes to the penitentiary this week said lin he had no more cash to stake his lawyer with and the lawyer lost interest in him so his sister could have waited for her convict away back at joliet and saved time and money how did she act when yu told her ive not told her not too kind o not your business well well youd ought to know better n me only it dont seem right to let her no sir its not right either put it her brother was dead and miss fliggs husband would like dearly to make him dead youd not let her come slap up against the news unwarned you would tell her he was sick and start her gently deaths different said i shucks and shes to find him caged and waiting for stripes and a shaved head how d yu know she mightnt hate that worse n if hed been just shot like a man in a husband scrape instead of jailed like a skunk for thieving no sir she mustnt think of how itll be quick as the stage pulls up front o the buffalo postoffice plump shell be down ahead of the mailsacks inquiring after her brother and all that crowd around staring why we cant let her do that she cant do that if you dont feel so interfering im good for this job myself and mr mclean took the lead and marched jingling in to supper the seat he had coveted was vacant on either side the girl were empty chairs two or three for with that clean shy respect of the frontier that divines and evades a good woman the dusty company had sat itself at a distance and mr mcleans best seat was open to him yet he had veered away to the other side of the table and his usually roving eye attempted no gallantry he ate sedately and it was not until after long weeks and many happenings that miss buckner told lin she had known he was looking at her through the whole of this meal the strawhatted proprietor came and went bearing beefsteak hammered flat to make it tender the girl seemed the one happy person among us for supper was going forward with the invariable alkali etiquette all faces brooding and feeding amid a disheartening silence as of guilt or bereavement that springs from i have never been quite sure what perhaps reversion to the native animal absorbed in his meat perhaps a little from every guests uneasiness lest he drink his coffee wrong or stumble in the accepted uses of the fork indeed a diffident uncleansed youth nearest miss buckner presently wiped his mouth upon the cloth and mr mclean knowing better than that eyed him for this conduct in the presence of a lady the lively strength of the butter must i think have reached all in the room at any rate the tablecloth lad troubled by mr mcleans eye now relieved the general silence by observing chattily say friends that butter aint in no trance if its too rich for you croaked the enraged proprietor use axledope the company continued gravely feeding while i struggled to preserve the decorum of sadness and miss buckners face was also unsteady but sternness mantled in the countenance of mr mclean until the harmless boy embarrassed to pieces offered the untasted smellingdish to lin to me helped himself and finally thrust the plate at the girl saying in his texas idiom have butter he spoke in the shell voice of adolescence and on butter cracked an octave up into the treble miss buckner was speechless and could only shake her head at the plate mr mclean however thought she was offended she wouldnt choose for none he said to the youth with appalling calm thank yu most to death i guess fluted poor texas in a dove falsetto it would go slicker rubbed outside than swallered at this miss buckner broke from the table and fled out of the house you dont seem to know anything observed mr mclean what toyshop did you escape from wind him up wind him up said the proprietor sticking his head in from the kitchen ah whats the matter with this outfit screamed the boy furiously cant yu leave a man eat cant yu leave him be you make me sick and he flounced out with his young boots all the while the company fed on unmoved presently one remarked whos hiring him the c y outfit said another halfcircle l a third corrected i seen one like him onced said the first taking his hat from beneath his chair up in the black hills he was eighteen seventynine gosh and he wandered out upon his business one by one the others also silently dispersed upon going out lin and i found the boy pacing up and down eagerly in talk with miss buckner she had made friends with him and he was now smoothed down and deeply absorbed being led by her to tell her about himself but on lins approach his face clouded and he made off for the corrals displaying a sullen back while i was presenting mr mclean to the lady overtaken by his cowpuncher shyness lin was greeting her with ungainly ceremony when she began at once youll excuse me but i just had to have my laugh thats all right mm said he dont mention it for that boy you know ill fix him mm hell not insult yu no more ill speak to him now please dont why why you were every bit as bad miss buckner pealed out joyously it was the two of you oh dear mr mclean looked crestfallen i had no i didnt go to why there was no harm to see him mean so well and you mean so well and i know i ought to behave better no yu oughtnt said lin with sudden ardor and then in a voice of deprecation youll think us plumb ignorant you know enough to be kind to folks said she wed like to its the only thing makes the world go round she declared with an emotion that i had heard in her tone once or twice already but she caught herself up and said gayly to me and wheres that house you were going to build for a lone girl to sleep in im afraid the foundations arent laid yet said i now you gentlemen neednt bother about me well have to mm you aint used to separ oh i am no tenderfoot dont you call them she whipped out her pistol and held it at the cowpuncher laughing this would have given no pleasure to me but over lins features went a glow of delight and he stood gazing at the pointed weapon and the girl behind it my he said at length almost in a whisper shes got the drop on me i reckon id be afraid to shoot that one of yours said miss buckner but this hits a target real good and straight at fifteen yards and she handed it to him for inspection he received it hugely grinning and turned it over and over my he murmured again why shucks he looked at miss buckner with stark rapture caressing the polished revolver at the same time with a fond unconscious thumb you hold it just as steady as i could he said with pride and added insinuatingly i could learn yu the professional drop in a morning this here is a little dandy gun youd not trade though said she for all your flattery will yu trade pounced lin wont yu now mr mclean i am afraid youre thoughtless how could a girl like me ever hold that awful colt steady she knows the brands too cried lin in ecstasy see here he remarked to me with a manner that smacked of command were losing time right now you go and tell the agent to hustle and fix his room up for a lady and ill bring her along i found the agent willing of course to sleep on the floor of the office the toy station was also his home the front compartment held the ticket and telegraph and mail and express chattels and the railing and room for the public to stand through a door you then passed to the sitting dining and sleeping box and through another to a cookingstove in a pigeonhole here flourished the agent and his lungs and here the companys strict orders bade him sleep in charge so i helped him put his room to rights but we need not have hurried ourselves mr mclean was so long in bringing the lady that i went out and found him walking and talking with her while fifty yards away skulked poor texas alone this boys name was like himself of the somewhat unexpected order being manassas donohoe as i came towards the new friends they did not appear to be joking and on seeing me miss buckner said to lin did he know lin hesitated you did know she exclaimed but lost her resentment at once and continued very quietly and with a friendly tone i reckon you dont like to have to tell folks bad news it was i that now hesitated not to a strange girl anyway said she well now i have good news to tell you you would not have given me any shock if you had said you knew about poor nate for thats the reason of course those things cant be secrets why hes only twenty sir how should he know about this world he hadnt learned the first little thing when he left home five years ago and i am twentythree old enough to be nates grandmother hes that young and thoughtless he couldnt ever realize bad companions when they came around see that she showed me a paper taking it out like a precious thing as indeed it was for it was a pardon signed by governor barker and the governor has let me carry it to nate myself he wont know a thing about it till i tell him the governor was real kind and we will never forget him i reckon nate must have a mustache by now said she to lin yes lin answered gruffly looking away from her he has got a mustache all right hell be glad to see you said i for something to say of course he will how many hours did you say we will be she asked lin turning from me again for mr mclean had not been losing time it was plain that between these two had arisen a freemasonry from which i was already shut out her womans heart had answered his right impulse to tell her about her brother and i had been found wanting so now she listened over again to the hours of stage jolting that we had before us and that lay between her and nate we would be four herself lin myself and the boy billy was billy the one at supper oh no just billy lusk of laramie hes a kid im taking up the country lin explained aint you most tuckered out oh me she confessed with a laugh and a sigh there again she had put aside my solicitude lightly but was willing lin should know her fatigue yet fatigue and all she would not sleep in the agents room at sight of it and the close quarters she drew back into the outer office so prompted by that inner unsuspected strictness she had shown me before come out she cried laughing indeed i thank you but i cant have you sleep on this hard floor out here no politeness now thank you ever so much im used to roughing it pretty near as well as if i was a cowboy and she glanced at lin theyre calling fortyseven she added to the agent thats me he said coming out to the telegraph instrument so youre one of us i didnt know fortyseven meant separ said i how in the world do you know that i didnt i heard fortyseven fortyseven fortyseven start and go right along so i guessed they wanted him and he couldnt hear them from his room can yu do astronomy and spanish too inquired the proud and smiling mclean why its nothing ive been day operator back home why is a deputy coming through on a special engine please dont say it out loud quavered the agent as the machine clicked its news yu neednt be scared of a girl said lin another sheriff so theyre not quit bothering us yet however this meddling was not the companys but the countys a sheriff sent to arrest on a charge of murder a man named trampas said to be at the sand hill ranch that was near rawhide two stations beyond and the engine might not stop at separ even to water so here was no molesting of separs liberties all the same lin said for pistols now and then still sounded at the corrals the boysll not understand that till its explained and they may act wayward first id feel easier if you slept here he urged to the girl but she would not well then we must rustle some other private place for you hows the sectionhouse rank said the agent since those italians used it the pump engineer has been scouring but hes scared to bunk there yet himself too bad you couldnt try my plan of a freightcar said i an empty she cried is there a clean one youve sure never done that lin burst out so youre scandalized said she punishing him instantly i reckon it does take a decent girl to shock you and while she stood laughing at him with robust irony poor lin began to stammer that he meant no offence why to be sure you didnt said she but i do enjoy you real thoroughly well mm protested the wincing cowpuncher driven back to addressing her as maam we aint used dont tangle yourself up worse mr mclean no more am i used i have never slept in an empty in my life and why is that just because ive never had to and theres the difference between you boys and us you do lots of things you dont like and tell us and we put up with lots of things we dont like but we never let you find out i know you meant no offense she continued heartily softening towards her crushed protector because youre a gentleman and lands im not complaining about an empty that will be rich if i can have the door shut upon this she went out to view the cars mr mclean hovering behind her with a devoted uneasy countenance and frequently muttering shucks while the agent and i followed with a lamp for the dark was come with our help she mounted into the first car and then into the next taking the lamp and while she scanned the floor and corners and slid the door back and forth lin whispered in my ear her names jessamine she told me dont yu like that name so i answered him yes very much thinking that some larger flower but still a flower might have been more apt nobody seems to have slept in these said she stepping down and on learning that even the tramp avoided separ when he could she exclaimed what lodging could be handier than this only it would be so cute if you had a louavull an nashvull car said she twould seem like my old kentucky home and laughing rather sweetly at her joke she held the lamp up to read the cars lettering d and r g oh thats a wayoff stranger i reckon theyre all strange she went along the train with her lamp yes b and m and s c and p oh this is rich nate will laugh when he hears ill choose c b and q thats a little nearer my country what time does the stage start porter please wake c b and q at six sharp said she to lin from this point of the evening on i think of our doings their doings with a sort of unchanging homesickness nothing like them can ever happen again i know for its all gone settled sobered and gone and whatever wholesomer prose of good fortune waits in our cup how i thank my luck for this swallow of frontier poetry which i came in time for to arrange some sort of bed for her was the next thing and we made a good shakedown clean straw and blankets and a pillow and the agent would have brought sheets but though she would not have these she did not resist what do you suppose a lookingglass for next morning and we got a bucket of water and her valise it was all one to her she said in what car lin and i put up and let it be next door by all means if it pleased him to think he could watch over her safety better so and she shut herself in bidding us goodnight we began spreading straw and blankets for ourselves when a whistle sounded far and long and its tone rose in pitch as it came ill get him to run right to the corrals said the agent so the sheriff can tell the boys hes not after them thatll convince em he is said lin stop him here or let him go through but we were not to steer the course that events took now the rails of the main line beside us brightened in wavering parallels as the headlight grew down upon us and in this same moment the shootings at the corrals chorused in a wild hilarious threat the burden of the coming engine heavily throbbed in the air and along the steel and met and mixed with the hard light beating of hoofs the sounds approached together like a sort of charge and i stepped between the freightcars where i heard lin ordering the girl inside to lie down flat and could see the agent running about in the dust flapping his arms to signal with as much coherence as a chicken with its head off i had very short space for wonder or alarm the edge of one of my freightcars glowed suddenly with the imminent headlight and galloping shots invaded the place the horsemen flew by overreaching and leaning back and lugging against their impetus they passed in a tangled swirl and their dust coiled up thick from the dark ground and luminously unfolded across the glare of the sharphalted locomotive then they wheeled and clustered around it where it stood by our cars its airbrake pumping deep breaths and the internal steam humming through its bowels and i came out in time to see billy lusk climb its front with callow enterprising shouts that was childs play and the universal yell now raised by the horsemen was their childs play too but the whole thing could so precipitately reel into the fatal that my thoughts stopped i could only look when i saw that they had somehow recognized the man on the engine for a sheriff two had sprung from their horses and were making boisterously toward the cab while lin mclean neither boisterous nor joking was going to the cab from my side with his pistol drawn to keep the peace the engineer sat with a neutral hand on the lever the fireman had run along the top of the coal in the tender and descended and crouched somewhere and the sheriff cool and with a goodnatured eye upon all parties was just beginning to explain his errand when some rider from the crowd cut him short with an invitation to get down and have a drink at the word of ribald endearment by which he named the sheriff a passing fierceness hardened the officers face and the new yell they gave was less playful waiting no more explanations they swarmed against the locomotive and mclean pulled himself up on the step the loud talking fell at a stroke to let business go on and in this silence came the noise of a slidingdoor at that i looked and they all looked and stood harmless like children surprised for there on the threshold of the freightcar with the interior darkness behind her and touched by the headlights diverging rays stood jessamine buckner will you gentlemen do me a favor said she strangers maybe have no right to ask favors but i reckon youll let that pass this time for im real sleepy she smiled as she brought this out ive been four days and nights on the cars and tomorrow ive got to stage to buffalo you see ill not be here to spoil your fun tomorrow night and i want boys to be boys just as much as ever they can wont you put it off till tomorrow night in their amazement they found no spokesman but i saw lin busy among them and that some word was passing through their groups after the brief interval of standstill they began silently to get on their horses while the looming engine glowed and pumped its breath and the sheriff and engineer remained as they were goodnight lady said a voice among the moving horsemen but the others kept their abashed native silence and thus they slowly filed away to the corrals the figures in their loose shirts and leathern chaps passed from the dimness for a moment through the cone of light in front of the locomotive so that the metal about them made here and there a faint vanishing glint and here and there in the departing column a bold halflaughing face turned for a look at the girl in the doorway and then was gone again into the dimness the sheriff in the cab took off his hat to miss buckner remarking that she should belong to the force and as the bell rang and the engine moved off popped young billy lusk from his cowcatcher with an exclamation of horror she sprang down and mr mclean appeared and with all a parents fright and rage held the boy by the arm grotesquely as the sheriff steamed by i aint agoing to chase it said young billy struggling ive a mind to cowhide you said lin but miss buckner interposed oh well said she next time if he does it next time its so late tonight youll not frighten us that way again if he lets you off she asked billy no said billy looking at her with interest father d have cowhided me anyway i guess he added meditatively do you call him father ah fathers at laramie said billy with disgust hed not stop for your asking lin dont bother me much you quit talking and step up there ordered his guardian well mm i guess yu can sleep good now in there if it was only an l and n id not have a thing against it goodnight mr mclean goodnight young mr im billy lusk i can ride chalkeyes pinto that bucked honey wiggin i am sure you can ride finely mr lusk maybe you and i can take a ride together pleasant dreams she nodded and smiled to him and slid her door to and billy considered it remarking i like her what makes her live in a car but he was drowsing while i told him and i lifted him up to lin who took him in his own blankets where he fell immediately asleep one distant whistle showed how far the late engine had gone from us we left our car open and i lay enjoying the cool air thus was i drifting off when i grew aware of a figure in the door it was lin standing in his stockings and not much else with his pistol he listened and then leaped down light as a cat i heard some repressed talking and lay in expectancy but back he came noiseless in his stockings and as he slid into bed i asked what the matter was he had found the texas boy manassas donohoe by the girls car with no worse intention than keeping a watch on it so i gave him to understand said lin that i had no objection to him amusing himself playing picketline but that i guessed i was enough guard and he would find sleep healthier for his system after this i went to sleep wholly but waking once in the night thought i heard some one outside and learned in the morning from lin that the boy had not gone until the time came for him to join his outfit at the corrals and i was surprised that lin the usually goodhearted should find nothing but mirth in the idea of this unknown unthanked young sentinel sleepings a heap better for them kind till they get their growth was his single observation but when separ had dwindled to toys behind us in the journeying stage i told miss jessamine and although she laughed too it was with a note that young texas would have liked to hear and she hoped she might see him upon her return to thank him any jack can walk around all night said mr mclean disparagingly well then and i know a jack who didnt observed the young lady this speech caused her admirer to be full of explanations so that when she saw how readily she could perplex him and yet how capable and untiring he was about her comfort helping her out or tucking her in at the stations where we had a meal or changed horses she enjoyed the hours very much in spite of their growing awkwardness but oh the sparkling unbashful lin sometimes he sat himself beside her to be close and then he would move opposite the better to behold her never except once long after when sorrow manfully borne had still further refined his clay have i heard lins voice or seen his look so winning no doubt many a male bird cares nothing what neighbor bird overhears his spring song from the top of the open tree but i extremely doubt if his ladylove even if she be a frank bouncing robin does not prefer to listen from some thicket and not upon the public lawn jessamine grew silent and almost peevish and from discourse upon man and woman she hopped she skipped she flew when lin looked at his watch and counted the diminished hours between her and buffalo she smiled to herself but from mention of her brother she shrank glancing swiftly at me and my wellassumed slumber and it was with indignation and selfpity that i climbed out in the hot sun at last beside the driver and small billy i know this road piped billy on the box i camped here with father when mother was off that time you can take a lefthand trail by those cottonwoods and strike the mountains so i inquired what game he had then shot ah just a sagehen lins agoing to let me shoot a bear you know what made lin marry mother when father was around the driver gave me a look over billys head and i gave him one and i instructed billy that people supposed his father was dead i withheld that his mother gave herself out as miss peck in the days when lin met her on bear creek the formidable nineyearold pondered the geography says they used to have a lot of wives at salt lake city is there a place where a woman can have a lot of husbands it dont especially depend on the place remarked the driver to me because billy went on bert taylor told me in recess that motherd had a lot and i told him he lied and the other boys they laughed and i blacked berts eye on him and id have blacked the others too only miss wood came out i wouldnt tell her what bert said and bert wouldnt and sophy armstrong told her berts father found out and he come round and i thought he was agoing to lick me about the eye and he licked bert say am i lins honest no billy youre not i said wish i was they couldnt get me back to laramie then but oh bother id not go for em id like to see em try lin wouldnt leave me go you aint married are you no more is lin now i guess a good many are but i wouldnt want to i dont think anything of em ive seen mother take pothecary stuff on the sly shes whaled me worse than lin ever does i guess he wouldnt want to be mothers husband again and if he does said billy his voice suddenly vindictive ill quit him and skip no danger bill said i how would the nice lady inside please you inquired the driver ah pshaw she aint after lin sang out billy loud and scornful shes after her brother shes all right though he added approvingly at this all talk stopped short inside reviving in a casual scanty manner while unconscious billy lusk tired of the one subject now spoke cheerfully of birds eggs who knows the childsoul young in days yet old as adam and the hills that schoolyard slur about his mother was as dim to his understanding as to the offenders yet mysterious nature had bid him go to instant war how foreseeing in lin to choke the unfounded jest about his relation to billy lusk in hopes to save the boys ever awakening to the facts of his mothers life though said the driver an easygoing cynic folks with lots of fathers will find heaps of brothers in this country but presently he let billy hold the reins and at the next station carefully lifted him down and up ive knowed that woman too he whispered to me sidney nebraska lusk was off half the time we laughed when she fooled lin into marryin her come to think he mused as twilight deepened around our clanking stage and small billy slept sound between us theres scarcely a thing in life you get a laugh out of that dont make soberness for somebody soberness had now visited the pair behind us even lins lively talk had quieted and his tones were low and few but though miss jessamine at our next change of horses hoped i would come inside i knew she did not hope very earnestly and outside i remained until buffalo journeying done her face revealed the strain beneath her brave brightness and the haunting care she could no longer keep from her eyes the imminence of the jail and the meeting had made her cheeks white and her countenance seem actually smaller and when reminding me that we should meet again soon she gave me her hand it was icecold i think she was afraid lin might offer to go with her but his heart understood the lonely sacredness of her next halfhour and the cow puncher standing aside for her to pass lifted his hat wistfully and spoke never a word for a moment he looked after her with sombre emotion but the courthouse and prison stood near and in sight and as plain as if he had said so i saw him suddenly feel she should not be stared at going up those steps it must be all alone the pain and the joy of that reprieve he turned away with me and after a few silent steps said wasted all wasted let us hope i began youre not a fool he broke in roughly you dont hope anything hell start life elsewhere said i elsewhere yes keep starting till all the elsewheres know him like powder river knows him but she i have had to sit and hear her tell and tell about him all about back in kentucky playin around the farm and how she raised him after the old folks died then he got bigger and made her sell their farm and she told how it was right he should turn it into money and get his half i did not dare say a word for shed have just bit my head off and and that would sure hurt me now lin brought up with a comical chuckle and she went to work and he cleared out and no more seen or heard of him thats for five years and shed given up tracing him when one morning she reads in the paper about how her longlost brother is convicted for forgery thats the way she knows hes not dead and she takes her savings off her railroad salary and starts for him she was that hasty she thought it was buffalo new york till she got in the cars and read the paper over again but she had to go as far as cincinnati either way she has paid every cent of the money he stole we had come to the bridge and lin jerked a stone into the quick little river shes awful strict in some ways thought buffalo must be a wicked place because of the shops bein open sunday now if that was all buffalos wickedness and she thinks divorce is mostly sin but her heart is a shield for nate her face is as beautiful as her actions he added well said i and would you make such a villain your brotherinlaw he whirled round and took both my shoulders come walking he urged i must talk some so we followed the stream out of town towards the mountains i came awful near asking her in the stage said he goodness lin give yourself time time cant increase my feelings hers man hers how many hours have you known her hours and hours youre talking foolishness what have they got to do with it and she will listen to me i can tell she will i know i can be so shell listen and it will go all right for ill ask so hard and everythingll come out straight yu see ive not been spending to speak of since billys on my hands and now ill fix up my cabin and finish my fencing and my ditch and shes going to like box elder creek better than shawhan shes the first ive ever loved then id like to ask i cried out ask away he exclaimed inattentively in his enthusiasm when you but i stopped perceiving it impossible it was of course not the many transient passions on which he had squandered his substance but the one where faith also had seemed to unite had he not married once innocent of the womans being already a wife but i stopped for to trench here was not for me or any one and my pause strangely flashed on him something of that i had in my mind no he said his eyes steady and serious upon me dont you ask about the things youre meaning then his face grew radiant and rather stern do you suppose i dont know shes too good for me and that some bygones cant ever be bygones but if you he said never come to look away up to a woman from away down and mean to win her just the same as if you did deserve her why youll make a turruble mess of the whole business when we walked in silence for a long while he lighted again with the blossoming dawn of his sentiment i thought of the coarse yet taking vagabond of twenty i had once chanced upon and hunted and camped with since through the years decidedly he was not that boy today it is not true that all of us rise through adversity any more than that all plants need shadow some starve out of the sunshine and i have seen misery deaden once kind people to everything but self almost the saddest sight in the world but lins character had not stood well the ordeal of happiness and for him certainly harsh days and responsibility had been needed to ripen the spirit yes jessamine buckner would have been much too good for him before that humiliation of his marriage and this care of young billy with which he had loaded himself lin said i i will drink your health and luck im healthy enough said he and we came back to the main street and into the main saloon how dye boys said some one and there was nate buckner its on me today he continued shoving whiskey along the bar and i saw he was a little drunk im setting em up he continued why why because he looked around for appreciation because its not every sonofagun in wyoming gets pardoned by governor barker im important i want you to understand he pursued to the cold bystanders theyll have a picture of me in the cheyenne paper the broncobuster of powder river they cant do without me if any sonofagun here thinks he knows how to break a colt he shouted looking around with the irrelevant fierceness of drink and then his challenge ebbed vacantly in laughter as the subject blurred in his mind youre not drinking lin said he no said mclean im not sworn off again well water never did agree with me yu never gave water the chance retorted the cowpuncher and we left the place without my having drunk his health it was a grim beginning this brag attempt to laugh his reputation down with the jail door scarce closed behind him folks are not going to like that said lin as we walked across the bridge again to the hotel yet the sister left alone here after an hour at most of her brothers company would pretend it was a matter of course nate was not in she told us at once he had business to attend to and friends to see he must get back to riverside and down in that country where colts were waiting for him he was the only one the e k outfit would allow to handle their young stock did we know that and she was going to stay with a mrs pierce down there for a while near where nate would be working all this she told us but when he did not return to dine with her on this first day i think she found it hard to sustain her wilful cheeriness lin offered to take her driving to see the military post and dress parade at retreat and clouds peak and buffalos various sights but she made excuses and retired to her room nate however was at tea shaven clean with good clothes and well conducted his tone and manner to jessamine were confidential and caressing and offended mr mclean so that i observed to him that it was scarcely reasonable to be jealous oh no jealousy said he but he comes in and kisses her and he kisses her goodnight and us strangers looking on its such oncontrollable affection yu see after never writing for five years i expect she must have some of her savings left it is true that the sister gave the brother money more than once and as our ways lay together i had chances to see them both and to wonder if her joy at being with him once again was going to last on the road to riverside i certainly heard jessamine beg him to return home with her and he ridiculed such a notion what proper life for a live man was that dead place back east he asked her i thought he might have expressed some regret that they must dwell so far apart or some intention to visit her now and then but he said nothing of the sort though he spoke volubly of himself and his prospects i suppose this spectacle of brother and sister had rubbed lin the wrong way too much for he held himself and billy aloof joining me on the road but once and then merely to give me the news that people here wanted no more of nate buckner he would be run out of the country and respect for the sister was all that meanwhile saved him but buckner like so many spared criminals seemed brazenly unaware he was disgraced and went hailing loudly any riders or drivers we met while beside him his sister sat close and straight her stanch affection and support for the world to see for all she let appear she might have been bringing him back from some gallant heroism achieved and as i rode along the travesty seemed more and more pitiful the outcome darker and darker at all times is riverside beautiful but most beautiful when the sun draws down through the openings of the hills from each one a stream comes flowing clearly out into the plain and fields spread green along the margins it was beneath the longslanted radiance of evening that we saw blue creek and felt its coolness rise among the shifting veils of light the red bluff eastward the tall natural fortress lost its stern masonry of shapes and loomed a soft towering enchantment of violet and amber and saffron in the changing rays the cattle stood quiet about the levels and horses were moving among the restless colts these the brother bade his sister look at for with them was his glory and i heard him boasting of his skill truthful boasting to be sure had he been honest in his dealings the goodwill that mans courage and dashing appearance beget in men would have brought him more employment than he could have undertaken he told jessamine his way of breaking a horse that few would dare and she listened eagerly do you remember when i used to hold the pony for you to get on she said you always would scare me nate and he replied fluently yes yes did she see that horse there near the fence he was a fouryearold an outlaw and she would find no one had tried getting on his back since he had been absent this was the first question he asked on reaching the cabin where various neighbors were waiting the mailrider and finding he was right he turned in pride to jessamine they dont know how to handle that horse said he i told you so give me a rope did she notice the cold greeting nate received i think not not only was their welcome to her the kinder but any one is glad to witness bold riding and this chance made a stir which the sister may have taken for cordiality but lin gave me a look for it was the same here as it had been in the buffalo saloon the trick is easy enough said nate arriving with his outlaw and liking an audience you dont want a bridle but a rope hackamore like this spanish style then let them run as hard as they want and on a sudden reach down your arm and catch the hackamore short close up by the mouth and jerk them round quick and heavy at full speed they quit their fooling after one or two doses now watch your outlaw he went into the saddle so swift and secure that the animal amazed trembled stockstill then sprang headlong it stopped vicious and knowing and plunged in a rage but could do nothing with the man and bolted again and away in a straight blind line over the meadow when the rider leaned forward to his trick the horse veered in a jagged swerve rolled over and over with its twisted impetus and up on its feet and on without a stop the man still seated and upright in the saddle how we cheered to see it but the figure now tilted strangely and something awful and nameless came over us and chilled our noise to silence the horse dazed and tamed by the fall brought its burden towards us a wobbling thing falling by small shakes backward until the head sank on the horses rump come away said lin mclean to jessamine and at his voice she obeyed and went leaning on his arm jessamine sat by her brother until he died twelve hours afterwards having spoken and known nothing the whole weight of the horse had crushed him internally he must have become almost instantly unconscious being held in the saddle by his spurs which had caught in the hair cinch it may be that our loud cheer was the last thing of this world that he knew the injuries to his body made impossible any taking him home which his sister at first wished to do why i came here to bring him home she said with a smile and tone like cheerfulness in wax her calm the unearthly ease with which she spoke to any comer and she was surrounded with rough kindness embarrassed the listeners she saw her calamity clear as they did but was sleepwalking in it it was lin gave her what she needed the repose of his strong silent presence he spoke no sympathy and no advice nor even did he argue with her about the burial he perceived somehow that she did not really hear what was said to her and that these first griefless sensible words came from some mechanism of the nerves so he kept himself near her and let her tell her story as she would once i heard him say to her with the same authority of that first come away now youve had enough of the talking come for a walk enough of the talking as if it were a treatment how did he think of that jessamine at any rate again obeyed him and i saw the two going quietly about in the meadows and along the curving brook and that night she slept well on one only point did the cowpuncher consult me they figured to put nate on top of that bald mound said he but she has talked about the flowers and shade where the old folks lie and where she wants him to be alongside of them ive not let her look at him today for well she might get the way he looks now on her memory but id like to show you my idea before going further lin had indeed chosen a beautiful place and so i told him at the first sight of it thats all i wanted to know said he ill fix the rest i believe he never once told jessamine the body could not travel so far as kentucky i think he let her live and talk and grieve from hour to hour and then led her that afternoon to the nook of sunlight and sheltering trees and won her consent to it thus for there was nate laid and there she went to sit alone lin did not go with her on those walks but now something new was on the fellows mind he was plainly occupied with it whatever else he was doing and he had some active cattlework on my asking him if jessamine buckner had decided when to return east he inquired of me angrily what was there in kentucky she could not have in wyoming consequently though i surmised what he must be debating i felt myself invited to keep out of his confidence and i did so my advice to him would have been ill received and as was soon to be made plain would have done his delicacy injustice next one morning he and billy were gone my first thought was that he had rejoined jessamine at mrs pierces where she was and left me away over here on bear creek where we had come for part of a week but stuck in my hatband i found a pencilled farewell now mr mclean constructed perhaps three letters in the year painful serious events like an interview with some important person with whom your speech must decorously flow no matter to whom he was writing it froze all nature stiff in each word he achieved and his bald business diction and wild archaic penmanship made documents that i value among my choicest correspondence this one especially wensday four a m dear sir this is to inform you that i have gone to separ on important bisness where i expect to meet you on your arrival at same point you will confer a favor and oblidge undersigned by informing miss j buckner of date if soon you fix for returning per stage to separ as miss j buckner may prefer company for the trip being long and poor accommodations yours c l mclean this seemed to point but one way and uncharitable though it sound that this girl so close upon bereavement should be able to give herself to a lover was distasteful to me but most extraordinary lin had gone away without a word to her and she was left as plainly in the dark as myself after her first frank surprise at learning of his departure his name did not come again from her lips at any rate to me good mrs pierce dropped a word one day as to her opinion of men who deceive women into expecting something from them let us talk straight said i do you mean that miss buckner says that or that you say it why the poor thing says nothing exclaimed the lady its like a man to think she would and ill not say anything either for youre all just the same except when youre worse and that lin mclean is going to know what i think of him next time we meet he did on that occasion the kind old dame told him he was the best boy in the country and stood on her toes and kissed him but meanwhile we did not know why he had gone and jessamine though he was never subtle or cruel enough to plan such a thing missed him and thus in her loneliness had the chance to learn how much he had been to her though pressed to stay indefinitely beneath mrs pierces hospitable roof the girl after lingering awhile and going often to that nook in the hill by riverside took her departure she was restless yet clung to the neighborhood it was with a wrench that she fixed her going when i told her of my own journey back to the railroad in buffalo she walked to the courthouse and stood a moment as if bidding this site of one lifememory farewell and from the stage she watched and watched the receding town and mountains its awful to be leaving him she said excuse me for acting so in front of you with the poignant emptiness overcoming her in new guise she blamed herself for not waiting in illinois until he had been sent to joliet for then so near home he must have gone with her how could i tell her that nates death was the best end that could have come to him but i said you know you dont think it was your fault you know you would do the same again she listened to me but her eyes had no interest in them he never knew pain i pursued and he died doing the thing he liked best in the world he was happy and enjoying himself and you gave him that its bad only for you some would talk religion but i cant yes she answered i can think of him so glad to be free thank you for saying that about religion do you think its wicked not to want it to hate it sometimes i hope its not thank you truly during our journey she summoned her cheerfulness and all that she said was wholesome in the robust coarse soundness of her fibre the wounds of grief would heal and leave no sickness perhaps no higher sensitiveness to human sufferings than her broad native kindness already held we touched upon religion again and my views shocked her kentucky notions for i told her kentucky locked its religion in an iron cage called sunday which made it very savage and fond of biting strangers now and again i would run upon that vein of deepseated prejudice that was in her character like some fine wire in short our disagreements brought us to terms more familiar than we had reached hitherto but when at last separ came where was i there stood mr mclean waiting and at the suddenness of him she had no time to remember herself but stepped out of the stage with such a smile that the ardent cowpuncher flushed and beamed so i went away without telling you goodbye he began not wisely mrs pierce has been circulating war talk about me you bet the maiden in jessamine spoke instantly indeed there was no special obligation for you to call on me or her to notice if you didnt oh said lin crestfallen yu sure dont mean that she looked at him and was compelled to melt no neighbor i dont mean it neighbor he exclaimed and again neighbor much pleased now it would sound kind o pleasant if youd call me that for a steady thing it would sound kind of odd mr mclean thank you blamed if i understand her cried lin blamed if i do but youre going to understand me sure quick he rushed inside the station spoke sharply to the agent and returned in the same tremor of elation that had pushed him to forwardness with his girl and with which he seemed near bursting ive been here three days to meet you theres a letter and i expect i know whats in it tubercle has got it here he took it from the less hasty agent and thrust it in jessamines hand you neednt to fear please open it its good news this time you bet he watched it in her hand as the boy of eight watches the string of a christmas parcel he wishes his father would cut instead of so carefully untie open it he urged again keeping me waiting this way what in the world does all this mean cried jessamine stopping short at the first sentence read said lin youve done this she exclaimed read read so she read with big eyes it was an official letter of the railroad written by the division superintendent at edgeford it hoped miss buckner might feel like taking the position of agent at separ if she was willing to consider this would she stop over at edgeford on her way east and talk with the superintendent in case the duties were more than she had been accustomed to on the louisville and nashville she could continue east with the loss of only a day the superintendent believed the salary could be arranged satisfactorily enclosed please to find an order for a free ride to edgeford jessamine turned her wondering eyes on lin you did do this she repeated but this time with extraordinary quietness yes said he and i am plumb proud of it she gave a rich laugh of pleasure and amusement a long laugh and stopped did anybody ever she said we can call each other neighbors now yu see said the cowpuncher oh no oh no jessamine declared though how am i ever to thank you by not argufying lin answered oh no no i can do no such thing dont you see i cant i believe you are crazy ive been waiting to hear yu say that said the complacent mclean im not argufying well eat supper now the eastbound is due in an hour and i expect youll be wanting to go on it and i expect ill go too said the girl ill be plumb proud to have yu the cowpuncher assented im going to get my ticket to chicago right now said jessamine again laughing sunny and defiant you bet you are said the incorrigible mclean he let her go into the station serenely you cant get used to new ideas in a minute he remarked to me ive figured on all that of course but thats why he broke out impetuously i quit you on bear creek so sudden when she goes back away home id been saying to myself every day whatll you do then lin mclean well i knew id go to kentucky too just knew id have to yu see and it was inconvenient turruble inconvenient billy here and my ranch and the beef roundup comin but how could i let her go and forget me take up maybe with some bluegrass sonofagun back there and i hated the fix i was in till that morning getting up i was joshin the virginia man thats after miss wood id been sayin no educated lady would think of a man who talked with an african accent its repotted you have a southern rival yourself says he joshin back so i said i guessed the rival would find life uneasy he does says he any man with his voice broke in two halves and one down in his stomach and one up among the angels is goin to feel uneasy but texas talks a heap about his lady vigilante in the freightcar vigilante i said and i must have jumped for they all asked where the lightning had struck and in fifteen minutes after writing you id hit the trail for separ oh i figured things out on that ride mr mclean here clapped me on the back got to separ got the sheriffs address the sheriff that saw her that night they held up the locomotive got him to meet me at edgeford and make a big talk to the superintendent made a big talk myself i said put that girl in charge of separ and the boysll quit shooting your watertank but tubercle cant influence em tubercle says the superintendent whats that and when i told him it was the agent he flapped his two hands down on the chair arms each side of him and went to rockin up and down i said the agent was just a temptation to the boys to be gay right along and theyd keep ashooting you can choose between tubercle and your tank i said but youve got to move one of em from separ if yu went peace the sheriff backed me up good too he said a man couldnt do much with separ the way it was now but a decent woman would be respected there and the only question was if she could conduct the business so i spoke up about shawhan and when the whole idea began to soak into that superintendent his eyeballs jingled and he looked as wise as a workox ill see her says he and hes going to see her well said i you deserve success after thinking of a thing like that youre wholly wasted punching cattle but shes going to chicago by eleven oclock she will have passed by your superintendent why so she will said lin affecting surprise he baffled me and he baffled jessamine indeed his eagerness with her parcels his assistance in checking her trunk his cheerful examination of check and ticket to be sure they read over the same route plainly failed to gratify her her firmness about going was sincere but she had looked for more dissuasion and this sprightly abettal of her departure seemed to leave something vacant in the ceremonies she fell singularly taciturn during supper at the hotel brunswick and presently observed i hope i shall see mr donohoe texas said lin i expect theyll have tucked him in bed by now up at the ranch the little fellow is growing yet he can walk round a freightcar all night said miss buckner stoutly ive always wanted to thank him for looking after me mr mclean smiled elaborately at his plate well if hes not actually thinking hell tease me cried out jessamine though he claims not to be foolish like mr donohoe why mr mclean you surely must have been young once see if you cant remember shucks began lin but her laughter routed him maybe you didnt notice you were young she said but dont you reckon perhaps the men around did why maybe even the girls kind o did shes hard to beat aint she inquired lin admiringly of me in my opinion she was she had her wish too about texas for we found him waiting on the railroad platform dressed in his best to say goodbye the friendly things she told him left him shuffling and repeating that it was a mistake to go a big mistake but when she said the butter was not good enough his laugh cracked joyously up into the treble the trains arrival brought quick sadness to her face but she made herself bright again with a special farewell for each acquaintance dont you ride any more cowcatchers she warned billy lusk or ill have to come back and look after you you said you and me were going for a ride and we aint shouted the longmemoried nineyearold you will murmured mr mclean oracularly as the trains pace quickened he did not step off and miss buckner cried jump too late said he placidly then he called to me im hard to beat too so the train took them both away as i might have guessed was his intention all along is that marriage again said billy anxiously he wouldnt tell me nothing hes just seeing miss buckner as far as edgeford said the agent be back tomorrow then i dont see why he wouldnt take me along billy complained and separ laughed but the lover was not back tomorrow he was capable of anything gossip remarked and took up new themes the sun rose and set the two trains made their daily slight event and gathering the watertank glaring bulkily in the sun beaconed unmolested and the agents natural sleep was unbroken by pistols for the cowboys did not happen to be in town separ lay a clot of torpor that i was glad to leave behind me for a while but news is a strange permeating substance and it began to be sifted through the air that tubercle was going to gods country that is how they phrased it in cowcamp meaning not the next world but the eastern states its certainly a shame him leaving after weve got him so good and used to us said the virginian we cant tell him goodbye said honey wiggin separll be slow we can give his successor a right hearty welcome the virginian suggested thats you said honey schemin mischief away ahead youre the leadin devil in this country and just because yu wear a faithfullooking face youre tryin to fool a poor schoolmarm yes drawled the southerner thats what im aiming to do so now they were curious about the successor planning their hearty welcome for that official and were encouraged in this by mr mclean he reappeared in the neighborhood with a manner and conversation highly casual bring your new wife they inquired no she preferred kentucky lin said bring the old one no she preferred laramie kentuckys a right smart way to chase after a girl said the virginian sure said mr mclean i quit at edgeford he met their few remarks so smoothly that they got no joy from him and being asked had he seen the new agent he answered yes that tubercle had gone wednesday and his successor did not seem to be much of a man but to me lin had nothing to say until noon camp was scattering from its lunch to work when he passed close and whispered youll see her tomorrow if you go in with the outfit then looking round to make sure we were alone in the sagebrush he drew from his pocket cherishingly a little shining pistol hers said he simply i looked at him weve exchanged he said he turned the token in his hand caressing it as on that first night when jessamine had taken his heart captive my idea he added unable to lift his eyes from the treasure see this too i looked and there was the word neighbor engraved on it her idea said he a good one i murmured its on both yu know we had it put on the day she settled to accept the superintendents proposition here lin fired his small exchanged weapon at a cottonwood striking low she can beat that with mine he exclaimed proud and tender she took four days deciding at edgeford and i learned her to hit the ace of clubs he showed me the cards they had practiced upon during those four days of indecision he had them in a book as if they were pressed flowers they wont get crumpled that way said he and he further showed me a tintype shes got the other at separ he finished i shook his hand with all my might yes he was worthy of her yes he deserved this smooth course his love was running and i shook his hand again to tonic her grief jessamine had longed for some activity some work and he had shown her wyoming might hold this for her as well as kentucky but how in the world i asked him did you persuade her to stop over at edgeford at all yu mustnt forget said the lover and he blushed that i had her four hours alone on the train but his face that evening round the fire when they talked of their next days welcome to the new agent became comedy of the highest and he was so desperately canny in the moments he chose for silence or for comment he had not been sure of their ignorance until he arrived and it was a joke with him too deep for laughter he had a special eye upon the virginian his mate in such a tale of mischiefs and now he led him on he suggested to the southerner that caution might be wise this change at separ was perhaps some new trick of the companys we mostly take their tricks observed the virginian yes said lin nodding sagely at the fire thats so too yet not he not any one could have foreseen the mortifying harmlessness of the outcome they swept down upon separ like all the hordes of legendmore egregiously perhaps because they were playacting and no serious horde would go on so our final hundred yards of speed and copious howling brought all dwellers in separ out to gaze and disappear like rabbits all save the new agent in the station nobody ran out or in there and the horde whirled up to the tiny defenceless building and leaped to earth except lin and me we sat watching the innocent door stood open wide to any cool breeze or invasion and honey wiggin tramped in foremost hat lowering over eyes and pistol prominent he stopped rooted staring and his mouth came open slowly his hand went feeling up for his hat and came down with it by degrees as by degrees his grin spread then in a milky voice he said why excuse me maam goodmorning there answered a clear long rippling ample laugh it came out of the open door into the heat it made the sunbaked air merry it seemed to welcome and mock it genially hovered about us in the dusty quiet of separ for there was no other sound anywhere at all in the place and the great plain stretched away silent all round it the bulging watertank shone overhead in bland ironic safety the horde stood blank then it shifted its legs looked sideways at itself and in a hesitating clump reached the door shambled in and removed its foolish hat goodmorning gentlemen said jessamine buckner seated behind her railing and various voices endeavored to reply conventionally if you have any letters maam said the virginian more inventive ill take them letters for judge henrys he knew the judges office was seventy miles from here any for the c y muttered another likewise knowing better it was a happy if simple thought and most of them inquired for the mail jessamine sought carefully making them repeat their names which some did guiltily they foresaw how soon the lady would find out no letters ever came for these names there was no letter for any one present im sorry truly said jessamine behind the railing for you seemed real anxious to get news better luck next time and if i make mistakes please everybody set me straight for of course i dont understand things yet yes mm goodday mm thank yu mm they got themselves out of the station and into their saddles no she dont understand things yet soliloquized the virginian oh dear no he turned his slow dark eyes upon us you lin mclean said he in his gentle voice you have certnly fooled me plumb through this mawnin then the horde rode out of town chastened and orderly till it was quite small across the sagebrush when reaction seized it it sped suddenly and vanished in dust with far hilarious cries and here were lin and i and here towered the watertank shining and shining thus did separs vigilante take possession and vindicate lins knowledge of his kind it was not three days until the virginian that lynx observer fixed his grave eyes upon mclean neighbor is as cute a name for a sixshooter as ever i heard said he but shell never have need of your gun in separ only to shoot up peaceful playincyards while she hearkens to your courtin that was his way of congratulation to a brother lover plumb strange he said to me one morning after an hour of riding in silence how a man will win two women while another man gets aged waitin for one your hair seems black as ever said i my hopes aint so glossy any more he answered lin has done better this second trip mrs lusk dont count said i i reckon she counted mighty plentiful when he thought hed got her clamped to him by lawful marriage but lins lucky and the virginian fell silent again lucky lin bestirred him over his work his plans his ranch on box elder that was one day to be a home for his lady he came and went seeing his idea triumph and his girl respected not only was she a girl but a good shot too and as if she and her small neat home were a sort of possession the cowpunchers would boast of her to strangers they would have dealt heavily now with the wretch who should trifle with the watertank when camp came within visiting distance you would see one or another shaving and parting his hair they wrote unnecessary letters and brought them to mail as excuses for an afternoon call honey wiggin more original would look in the door with his grin and hold up an ace of clubs i thought maybe yu could spare a minute for a shootinmatch he would insinuate and separ now heard no more objectionable shooting than this texas brought her presents of game antelope sagechickens but shyness intervening he left them outside the door and entering dressed in all the sunday that he had would sit dumbly in the ladys presence i remember his emerging from one of these placid interviews straight into the hands of his tormentors if she dont notice your clothes texas said the virginian just mention them to her now yerve done offended her shrilled manassas donohoe she heard that shell hear you singin sooprano said honey wiggin its good this country has reformed or theyd have you warblin in some dancehall and corrupt your morals you scacely can corrupt the morals of a soprano man observed the virginian go and play with billy till you can talk bass but it was the boldest adults that billy chose for playmates texas he found immature moreover when next he came he desired play with no one summer was done septembers full moon was several nights ago he had gone on his hunt with lin and now spellingbooks were at hand but more than this clouded his mind he had been brought to say goodbye to jessamine buckner who had scarcely seen him and to give her a wolvereneskin a hunting trophy she can have it he told me i like her then he stole a look at his guardian if they get married and send me back to mother said he ill run away sure so school and this old dread haunted the child while for the man lin the lucky who suspected nothing of it time was ever bringing love nearer to his hearth his jessamine had visited box elder and even said she wanted chickens there since when mr mclean might occasionally have been seen at his cabin worrying over barnyard fowls feeding and cursing them with equal care spring would see him married he told me this time right he exclaimed and i want her to know billy some more before he goes to bear creek ah bear creek said billy acidly why cant i stay home home sounds kind o slick said lin to me dont it now home is closer than neighbor you bet billy put the horses in the corral and ask miss buckner if we can come and see her after supper if youre good maybe shell take yu for a ride tomorrow and kid ask her about laramie again suspicion quivered over billys face and he dragged his horses angrily to the corral lin nudged me laughing i can rile him every time about laramie said he affectionately i wouldnt have believed the kid set so much store by me nor i didnt need to ask jessamine to love him for my sake what do yu suppose before id got far as thinking of billy at all right after edgeford when my head was just a whirl of joy jessamine says to me one day read that it was governor barker writin to her about her brother and her sorrow lin paused and about me i cant never tell you but he said a heap i didnt deserve and he told her about me picking up billy in denver streets that time and doing for him because his own home was not a good one governor barker wrote jessamine all that and she said why did you never tell me and i said it wasnt anything to tell and she just said to me it shall be as if he was your son and i was his mother and thats the first regular kiss she ever gave me i didnt have to take myself god bless her god bless her as we ate our supper young billy burst out of brooding silence i didnt ask her about laramie so there well well kid said the cowpuncher patting his head yu neednt to i guess but billys eye remained sullen and jealous he paid slight attention to the picturebook of soldiers and war that jessamine gave him when we went over to the station she had her own books some flowers in pots a rockingchair and a cosey lamp that shone on her bright face and dark dress we drew stools from the office desks and billy perched silently on one scanty room for company jessamine said but we must make out this way till we have another way she smiled on lin and billys face darkened do you know she pursued to me with all those chickens mr mclean tells me about never a one has he thought to bring here livin or dead do you want em inquired lin oh ill not bother you mr donohoe says he will texas chickens him then hell have to steal em and we all laughed together you wont make me go back to laramie will you spoke billy suddenly from his stool id like to see anybody try to make you exclaimed jessamine who says any such thing lin did said billy jessamine looked at her lover reproachfully what a way to tease him she said and you so kind why youve hurt his feelings i never thought said lin the boisterous i wouldnt have come sit here billy said jessamine whenever he teases you tell me and well make him behave honest persisted billy shake hands on it said jessamine cause ill go to school but i wont go back to laramie for no one and youre agoing to be lins wife honest honest honest and jessamine laughing grew red beside her lamp then i guess mother cant never come back to lin either stated billy relieved jessamine let fall the childs hand cause she liked him onced and he liked her jessamine gazed at lin its simple said the cowpuncher its all right but jessamine sat by her lamp very pale its all right repeated lin in the silence shifting his foot and looking down once i made a fool of myself worse than usual billy whispered jessamine then you but his name is lusk course it is said billy father and mother are living in laramie its all straight said the cowpuncher i never saw her till three years ago i havent anything to hide only only only it dont come easy to tell i rose miss buckner said i he will tell you but he will not tell you he paid dearly for what was no fault of his it has been no secret it is only something his friends and his enemies have forgotten but all the while i was speaking this jessamines eyes were fixed on lin and her face remained white i left the girl and the man and the little boy together and crossed to the hotel but its air was foul and i got my roll of camp blankets to sleep in the clean night if sleepingtime should come meanwhile i walked about in the silence to have taken a wife once in good faith ignorant she was anothers left no stain raised no barrier i could have told jessamine the same old story myself or almost but what had it to do with her at all why need she know reasoning thus yet with something left uncleared by reason that i could not state i watched the moon edge into sight heavy and richhued a melonslice of glow seemingly near like a great lantern tilted over the plain the smell of the sagebrush flavored the air the hush of wyoming folded distant and near things and all separ but those three inside the lighted window were in bed dark windows were everywhere else and looming above rose the watertank a dull mass in the night and forever somehow to me a sphinx emblem the vision i instantly see when i think of separ soon i heard a door creaking it was billy coming alone and on seeing me he walked up and spoke in a halfawed voice shes acrying said he i withheld from questions and as he kept along by my side he said im sorry do you think shes mad with lin for what hes told her she just sat and when she started crying he made me go away i dont believe shes mad i told billy and i sat down on my blanket he beside me talking while the moon grew small as it rose over the plain and the light steadily shone in jessamines window soon young billy fell asleep and i looked at him thinking how in a way it was he who had brought this trouble on the man who had saved him and loved him but that man had no such untender thoughts once more the door opened and it was he who came this time alone also she did not follow him and stand to watch him from the threshold though he forgot to close the door and coming over to me stood looking down what i said at length i dont know that he heard me he stooped over billy and shook him gently wake son said he you and i must get to our camp now now said billy cant we wait till morning no son we cant wait here any more go and get the horses and put the saddles on as billy obeyed lin looked at the lighted window she is in there he said shes in there so near he looked and turned to the hotel from which he brought his chaps and spurs and put them on i understand her words he continued her words the meaning of them but not what she means i guess it will take studyin over why she dont blame me he suddenly said speaking to me instead of to himself lin i answered she has only just heard this you see wait awhile thats not the trouble she knows what kind of man i have been and she forgives that just the way she did her brother and she knows how i didnt intentionally conceal anything billy hasnt been around and she never realized about his mother and me weve talked awful open but that was not pleasant to speak of and the whole country knew it so long and i never thought she dont blame me she says she understands but she says i have a wife livin that is nonsense i declared yu mustnt say that said he she dont claim shes a wife either she just shakes her head when i asked her why she feels so it must be different to you and me from the way it seems to her i dont see her view maybe i never can see it but shes made me feel she has it and that shes honest and loves me true his voice broke for a moment she said shed wait you cant have a marriage broken that was never tied i said but perhaps governor barker or judge henry no said the cowpuncher law couldnt fool her shes thinking of something back of law she said shed wait always and when i took it in that this was all over and done and when i thought of my ranch and the chickens well i couldnt think of things at all and i came and waked billy to clear out and quit what did you tell her i asked tell her nothin i guess i dont remember getting out of the room why heres actually her pistol and shes got mine man man said i go back and tell her to keep it and that youll wait too always would yu look i pointed to jessamine standing in the door i saw his face as he turned to her and i walked toward billy and the horses presently i heard steps on the wooden station and from its black brief shadow the two came walking lin and his sweetheart into the moonlight they were not speaking but merely walked together in the clear radiance hand in hand like two children i saw that she was weeping and that beneath the tyranny of her resolution her whole loving ample nature was wrung but the strange narrow fibre in her would not yield i saw them go to the horses and jessamine stood while billy and lin mounted then quickly the cowpuncher sprang down again and folded her in his arms lin dear lin dear neighbor she sobbed she could not withhold this last goodbye i do not think he spoke in a moment thehorses started and were gone flying rushing away into the great plain until sight and sound of them were lost and only the sagebrush was there bathed in the high bright moon the last thing i remember as i lay in my blankets was jessamines window still lighted and the watertank clearlined and black standing over separ destiny at drybone part i children have many special endowments and of these the chiefest is to ask questions that their elders must skirmish to evade married people and aunts and uncles commonly discover this but mere instinct does not guide one to it a maiden of twentythree will not necessarily divine it now except in one unhappy hour of stress and surprise miss jessamine buckner had been more than equal to life thus far but never yet had she been shut up a whole day in one room with a boy of nine had this experience been hers perhaps she would not have written to mr mclean the friendly and singular letter in which she hoped he was well and said that she was very well and how was dear little billy she was glad mr mclean had stayed away that was just like his honorable nature and what she expected of him and she was perfectly happy at separ and yours sincerely and always neighbor postscript talking of billy lusk if lin was busy with gathering the cattle why not send billy down to stop quietly with her she would make him a bed in the ticketoffice and there she would be to see after him all the time she knew lin did not like his adopted child to be too much in cowcamp with the men she would adopt him too for just as long as convenient to lin until the school opened on bear creek if lin so wished jessamine wrote a good deal about how much better care any woman can take of a boy of billys age than any man knows the stagecoach brought the answer to this remarkably soon young billy with a trunk and a letter of twelve pages in pencil and ink the only writing of this length ever done by mr mclean i can write a lot quicker than lin said billy upon arriving he was fussing at that away late by the fire in camp an waked me up crawling in our bed an then he had to finish it next night when he went over to the cabin for my clothes you dont say said jessamine and billy suffered her to kiss him again when not otherwise occupied jessamine took the letter out of its locked box and read it or looked at it thus the first days had gone finely at separ the weather being beautiful and billy much outofdoors but sometimes the weather changes in wyoming and now it was that miss jessamine learned the talents of childhood soon after breakfast this stormy morning billy observed the twelve pages being taken out of their box and spoke from his sudden brain honey wiggin says lins losing his grip about girls he remarked he says you couldnt a downed him onced youd a had to marry him honey says lin aint worked it like he done in old times now i shouldnt wonder if he was right said jessamine buoyantly and that being the case im going to set to work at your things till it clears and then well go for our ride yes said billy when does a man get too old to marry im only a girl you see i dont know yes honey said he wouldnt a thought lin was that old but i guess he must be thirty old exclaimed jessamine and she looked at a photograph upon her table but lin aint been married very much pursued billy mothers the only one they speak of you dont have to stay married always do you its better to said jessamine ah i dont think so said billy with disparagement you ought to see mother and father i wish you would leave lin marry you though said the boy coming to her with an impulse of affection why wont you if he dont mind she continued to parry him but this was not a very smooth start for eight in the morning moments of lull there were when the telegraph called her to the front room and billys young mind shifted to inquiries about the cipher alphabet and she gained at least an hour teaching him to read various words by the sound at dinner too he was refreshingly silent but such silences are unsafe and the weather was still bad four oclock found them much where they had been at eight please tell me why you wont leave lin marry you he was at the window kicking the wall thats nine times since dinner she replied with tireless good humor now if you ask me twelve youll tell said the boy swiftly she broke into a laugh no ill go riding and youll stay at home when i was little and would ask things beyond me they only gave me three times ive got two more anyway haha better save em up though what did they do to you ah i dont want to go ariding its nasty all over he stared out at the day against which separs doors had been tight closed since morning eight hours of furious wind had raised the dust like a sea i wish the old train would come observed billy continuing to kick the wall i wish i was going somewheres smoky level and hot the south wind leapt into separ across five hundred unbroken miles the plain was blanketed in a tawny eclipse each minute the near buildings became invisible in a turbulent herd of clouds above this travelling blur of the soil the top of the watertank alone rose bulging into the clear sun the sand spirals would lick like flames along the bulk of the lofty tub and soar skyward it was not shipping season the freightcars stood idle in a long line no cattle huddled in the corrals no strangers moved in town no cowponies dozed in front of the saloon their riders were distant in ranch and camp human noise was extinct in separ beneath the thunder of the sultry blasts the place lay dead in its flapping shroud of dust why wont you tell me droned billy for some time he had been returning like a mosquito brushed away thats ten times said jessamine promptly oh goodness pretty soon ill not be glad i came im about twiced as less glad now well said jessamine theres a man coming today to mend the government telegraphline between drybone and mckinney maybe he would take you back as far as box elder if you want to go very much shall i ask him billy was disappointed at this cordial seconding of his mood he did not make a direct rejoinder i guess ill go outside now said he with a threat in his tone she continued mending his stockings finished ones lay rolled at one side of her chair and upon the other were more waiting her attention and im going to turn back handsprings on top of all the freightcars he stated more loudly she indulged again in merriment laughing sweetly at him and without restraint and im sick of what you all keep asaying to me he shouted just as if i was a baby why billy who ever said you were a baby all of you do honey and lin and you now and everybody what makes you say thats nine times billy oh billy thats ten times if you dont mean im a baby and you laugh me off just like they do and just like i was a regular baby you wont tell me billy listen did nobody ever ask you something you did not want to tell them thats not a bit the same because because because i treat em square and because its not their business but every time i ask anybody most anything they say im not old enough to understand and ill be ten soon and it is my business when its about the kind of a mother im agoing to have suppose i quit acting square an told em when they bothered me they werent young enough to understand wish i had guess i will too and watch em step around for a moment his mind dwelt upon this and he whistled a revengeful strain goodness billy said jessamine at the sight of the next stocking the whole heel is scorched off he eyed the ruin with indifference ah that was last month when i and lin shot the bear in the swamp willows he made me dry off my legs chuck it away and spoil the pair no indeed mother always chucked em an fatherd buy new ones till i skipped from home lin kind o mends em does he said jessamine softly and she looked at the photograph yes what made you write him for to let me come and bring my stockins and things dont you see billy there is so little work at this station that id be looking out of the window all day just the pitiful way you do oh billy pondered and so i said to lin he continued why didnt he send down his own clothes too an let you fix em all and honey wiggin laughed right in his coffeecup so it all sploshed out and the cook he asked me if mother used to mend lins clothes but i guess she chucked em like she always did fathers and mine i was with father you know when mother was married to lin that time he paused again while his thoughts and fears struggled but lin says i neednt ever go back he went on reasoning and confiding to her lin dont like mother any more i guess his pondering grew still deeper and he looked at jessamine for some while then his face wakened with a new theory dont lin like you any more he inquired oh cried jessamine crimsoning yes why he sent you to me well he got hot in camp when i said that about sending his clothes to you he quit supper pretty soon and went away off a walking and thats another time they said i was too young but lin dont come to see you any more why i hope he loves me murmured jessamine always well i hope so too said billy earnestly for i like you when i seen him show you our cabin on box elder and the room he had fixed for you i was glad you were coming to be my mother mother used to be awful i wouldnt a minded her licking me if shed done other things ah pshaw i wasnt going to stand that billy now came close to jessamine i do wish you would come and live with me and lin said he lins awful nice dont i know it said jessamine tenderly cause i heard you say you were going to marry him went on billy and i seen him kiss you and you let him that time we went away when you found out about mother and youre not mad and hes not and nothing happens at all all the same wont you tell me please jessamines eyes were glistening and she took him in her lap she was not going to tell him that he was too young this time but whatever things she had shaped to say to the boy were never said through the noise of the gale came the steadier sound of the train and the girl rose quickly to preside over her ticketoffice and duties behind the railing in the front room of the station the boy ran to the window to watch the great event of separs day the locomotive loomed out from the yellow clots of drift paused at the watertank and then with steam and humming came slowly on by the platform slowly its long dustchoked train emerged trundling behind it and ponderously halted there was no one to go no one came to buy a ticket of jessamine the conductor looked in on business but she had no telegraphic orders for him the express agent jumped off and looked in for pleasure he received his daily smile and nod of friendly discouragement then the light bundle of mail was flung inside the door separ had no mail to go out as she was picking up the letters young billy passed her like a shadow and fled out two passengers had descended from the train a man and a large woman his clothes were loose and careless upon him he held valises and stood uncertainly looking about him in the storm her firm heavy body was closely dressed in her hat was a large handsome feather along between the several cars brakemen leaned out watched her and grinned to each other but her big hardshining blue eyes were fixed curiously upon the station where jessamine was its all night we may be here is it she said to the man harshly how am i to help that he retorted ill help it if this hotels the sty it used to be ill walk to tommys ive not saw him since i left bear creek she stalked into the hotel while the man went slowly to the station he entered and found jessamine behind her railing sorting the slim mail goodevening he said excuse me there was to be a wagon sent here for the telegraphmender yes sir it came tuesday youre to find the polewagon at drybone this news was good and all that he wished to know he could drive out and escape a night at the hotel brunswick but he lingered because jessamine spoke so pleasantly to him he had heard of her also governor barker has not been around here he said not yet sir we understand he is expected through on a huntingtrip i suppose there is room for two and a trunk on that wagon i reckon so sir jessamine glanced at the man and he took himself out most men took themselves out if jessamine so willed and it was mostly achieved thus in amity on the platform the man found his wife again then i neednt to walk to tommys she said and well eat as we travel but youll wait till im through with her she made a gesture toward the station why why what do you want with her dont you know who she is it was me told you who she was james lusk youll wait till ive been and asked her after lin mcleans health and till ive saw how the likes of her talks to the likes of me he made a feeble protest that this would do no one any good sew yourself up james lusk if it has been your idea i come with yus clear from laramie to watch yus plant telegraphpoles in the sagebrush why youre off i aint heard much o lin since the day he learned it was you and not him that was my husband and ive come back in this country to have a look at my old friends and she laughed loudly and nodded at the station my old friends new friends thus ordered the husband wandered away to find his wagon and the horse jessamine in the office had finished her station duties and returned to her needle she sat contemplating the scorched sock of billys and heard a heavy step at the threshold she turned and there was the large woman with the feather quietly surveying her the words which the stranger spoke then were usual enough for a beginning but there was something of threat in the strong animal countenance something of laughter ready to break out much beauty of its kind had evidently been in the face and now as substitute for what was gone was the brag look of assertion that it was still all there many stranded travellers knocked at jessamines door and now as always she offered the hospitalities of her neat abode the only room in separ fit for a woman as she spoke and the guest surveyed and listened the door blew shut with a crash outside in a shed billy had placed the wagon between himself and his father how you have grown the man was saying and he smiled come shake hands i did not think to see you here dare you to touch me billy screamed no ill never come with you lin says i neednt to the man passed his hand across his forehead and leaned against the wheel lord lord he muttered his son warily slid out of the shed and left him leaning there part ii lin mclean bachelor sat out in front of his cabin looking at a small bright pistol that lay in his hand he held it tenderly cherishing it and did not cease slowly to polish it revery filled his eyes and in his whole face was sadness unmasked because only the animals were there to perceive his true feelings sunlight and waving shadows moved together upon the green of his pasture cattle and horses loitered in the opens by the stream down box elders course its valley and goldenchimneyed bluffs widened away into the level and the blue of the greater valley upstream the branches and shining quiet leaves entered the mountains where the rock chimneys narrowed to a gateway a citadel of shafts and turrets crimson and gold above the filmy emerald of the trees through there the road went up from the cottonwoods into the cool quaking asps and pines and so across the range and away to separ along the ridgepole of the new stable two hundred yards downstream sat mcleans turkeys and cocks and hens walked in front of him here by his cabin and fenced garden slow smoke rose from the cabins chimney into the air in which were no sounds but the running water and the afternoon chirp of birds amid this framework of a home the cowpuncher sat lonely inattentive polishing the treasured weapon as if it were not already long clean his target stood some twenty steps in front of him a small cottonwoodtree its trunk chipped and honeycombed with bullets which he had fired into it each day for memorys sake presently he lifted the pistol and looked at its name the word neighbor engraved upon it i wonder said he aloud if she keeps the rust off mine then he lifted it slowly to his lips and kissed the word neighbor the clank of wheels sounded on the road and he put the pistol quickly down dreaminess vanished from his face he looked around alertly but no one had seen him the clanking was still among the trees a little distance up box elder it approached deliberately while he watched for the vehicle to emerge upon the open where his cabin stood and then they came a man and a woman at sight of her mr mclean half rose but sat down again neither of them had noticed him sitting as they were in silence and the drowsiness of a long drive the man was weakfaced with good looks sallowed by dissipation and a vanquished glance of the eye as the woman had stood on the platform at separ so she sat now upright bold and massive the brag of past beauty was a habit settled upon her stolid features both sat inattentive to each other and to everything around them the wheels turned slowly and with a dry dead noise the reins bellied loosely to the shafts the horses head hung low so they drew close then the man saw mclean and color came into his face and went away goodevening said he clearing his throat we heard you was in cowcamp the cowpuncher noted how he tried to smile and a freakish change crossed his own countenance he nodded slightly and stretched his legs out as he sat you look natural said the woman familiarly seem to be fixed nice here continued the man hadnt heard of it well well be going along glad to have seen you your wheel wants greasing said mclean briefly his eye upon the man cant stop i expect shell last to drybone goodevening stay to supper said mclean always seated on his chair cant stop thank you i expect we can last to drybone he twitched the reins mclean levelled a pistol at a chicken and knocked off its head better stay to supper he suggested very distinctly its business i tell you ive got to catch governor barker before he the pistol cracked and a second chicken shuffled in the dust better stay to supper drawled mclean the man looked up at his wife so yus need me she broke out aint got heart enough in yer playedout body to stand up to a man well eat here get down the husband stepped to the ground i didnt suppose youd want ho want whats lin or you or anything to me help me out both men came forward she descended leaning heavily upon each her blue staring eyes fixed upon the cowpuncher no yus aint changed she said same in your looks and same in your actions was you expecting you could scare me you lin mclean i just wanted chickens for supper said he mrs lusk gave a hard high laugh ill eat em its not i that cares as for she stopped her eye had fallen upon the pistol and the name neighbor as for you she continued to mr lusk dont you be standing dumb same as the horse better take him to the stable lusk said mclean he picked the chickens up showed the woman to the best chair in his room and went into his kitchen to cook supper for three he gave his guests no further attention nor did either of them come in where he was nor did the husband rejoin the wife he walked slowly up and down in the air and she sat by herself in the room lins steps as he made ready round the stove and table and lusks slow tread out in the setting sunlight were the only sounds about the cabin when the host looked into the door of the next room to announce that his meal was served the woman sat in her chair no longer but stood with her back to him by a shelf she gave a slight start at his summons and replaced something he saw that she had been examining neighbor and his face hardened suddenly to fierceness as he looked at her but he repeated quietly that she had better come in thus did the three sit down to their meal occasionally a word about handing some dish fell from one or other of them but nothing more until lusk took out his watch and mentioned the hour yuve not ate especially hearty said lin resting his arms upon the table im going asserted lusk governor barker may start out ive got my interests to look after why sure said lin i cant hope youll waste all your time on just me lusk rose and looked at his wife itll be ten now before we get to drybone said he and he went down to the stable the woman sat still pressing the crumbs of her bread i know you seen me she said without looking at him saw you when i knowed it and i seen how you looked at me she sat twisting and pressing the crumb sometimes it was round sometimes it was a cube now and then she flattened it to a disk mr mclean seemed to have nothing that he wished to reply if you claim that pistol is yourn she said next ill tell you i know better if you ask me whose should it be if not yourn i would not have to guess the name she has talked to me and me to her she was still looking away from him at the breadcrumb or she could have seen that mcleans hand was trembling as he watched her leaning on his arms oh yes she was willing to talk to me the woman uttered another sudden laugh i knowed about her all things get heard of in this world did not all about you and me come to her knowledge in its own good time and it done and gone how many years my my my her voice grew slow and absent she stopped for a moment and then more rapidly resumed it had travelled around about you and her like it always will travel it was known how you had asked her and how she had told you she would have you and then told you she would not when she learned about you and me folks that knowed yus and folks that never seen yus in their lives had to have their word about her facing you down you had another wife though she knowed the truth about me being married to lusk and him livin the day you married me and ten and twenty marriages could not have tied you and me up no matter how honest you swore to no hinderance folks said it was plain she did not want yus it give me a queer feelin to see that girl it give me a wish to tell her to her face that she did not love yus and did not know love wait wait lin yu never hit me yet no said the cowpuncher nor now im not lusk yu looked so so bad lin i never seen yu look so bad in old days wait now and i must tell it i wished to laugh in her face and say what do you know about love so i walked in lin she does love yus yes breathed mclean she was sittin back in her room at separ not the ticketoffice but i know the cowpuncher said his eyes were burning its snug the way she has it goodafternoon i says is this miss jessamine buckner at his sweethearts name the glow in lins eyes seemed to quiver to a flash and she spoke pleasant to me pleasant and gaylike but a woman can tell sorrow in a womans eyes and she asked me would i rest in her room there and what was my name they tell me you claim to know it better than i do i says they tell me you say it is mrs mclean she put her hand on her breast and she keeps lookin at me without never speaking maybe i am not so welcome now i says one minute says she let me get used to it and she sat down lin she is a squarelookin girl ill say that for her i never thought to sit down onced myself i dont know why but i kep astanding and i took in that room of hers she had flowers and things around there and i seen your picture standing on the table and i seen your sixshooter right by it and oh lin hadnt i knowed your face before ever she did and that gun you used to let me shoot on bear creek it took me that sudden why it rushed over me so i spoke right out different from what id meant and what i had ready fixed up to say why did you do it i says to her while she was asitting how could you act so and you a woman she just sat and her sad eyes made me madder at the idea of her you have had real sorrow says i if they report correct you have knowed your share of death and misery and hard work and all great god aint there things enough that come to yus uncalled for and natural but you must run around huntin up more that was leavin yus alone and givin yus a chance i knowed him onced i knowed your lin mclean and when that was over i knowed for the first time how men can be different im started lin im started leave me go on and when im through ill quit some of em anyway i says to her has hearts and selfrespect and aint hogs clean through i know she says thoughtfullike and at her whispering that way i gets madder you know i says then what is it that you know do you know that you have hurt a good mans heart for onced i hurt it myself though different and hurts in them kind of hearts stays some hearts is that luscious and pasty you can stab em and it closes up so yud never suspicion the place but lin mclean nor yet dont yus believe his is the kind that breaks if any kind does that you may sit till the gray hairs and you may wall up your womanhood but if a man has got manhood like him he will never sit till the gray hairs grief over losin the best will not stop him from searchin for a second best after a while he wants a home and he has got a right to one says i to miss jessamine you have not walled up lin mclean i says to her wait lin wait yus neednt to tell me thats a lie i know a man thinks hes walled up for a while she could have told you it was a lie said the cowpuncher she did not let him get a home says she i want him to be happy that flash in your eyes talks different says i sure enough yus wants him to be happy sure enough but not happy along with miss second best lin she looked at me that piercin and i goes on for i was wound away up and he will be happy too i says miss second best will have a talk with him about your picture and little neighbor which hell not send back to yus because the hurt in his heart is there and he will keep em out of sight somewheres after his talk with miss second best lin lin i laughed at them words of mine but i was that wound up i was strange to myself and she watchin me that way and i says to her miss second best will not be the crazy thing to think i am any wife of his standing in her way he will tell her about me he will tell how onced he thought he was solid married to me till lusk came back and she will drop me out of sight along with the rest that went nameless they was not uncomprehensible to you was they you have learned something by livin i guess and lin your lin not mine nor never mine in heart for a day so deep as hes yourn right now he has been gay gay as any ive knowed why look at that face of his could a boy with a face like that help bein gay but that dont touch whats the true lin deep down nor will his deepdown love for you hinder him like it will hinder you dont you know men and us is different when it comes to passion were all one thing then but they aint simple they keep along with lots of other things i cant make yus know and i guess it takes a woman like i have been to learn their nature but you did know he loved you and you sent him away and youll be homeless in yer house when he has done the right thing by himself and found another girl lin all the while i was talkin all i knowed to her without knowin what id be sayin next for it come that unexpected she was lookin at me with them steady eyes and all she says when i quit was if i saw him i would tell him to find a home didnt she tell yu shed made me promise to keep away from seeing her asked the cowpuncher mrs lusk laughed oh you innocent said she she said if i came she would leave separ muttered mclean brooding again the large woman laughed out but more harshly i have kept my promise lin continued keep it some more sit here rotting in your chair till she goes away maybe shes gone whats that said lin but still she only laughed harshly i could be there by tomorrow night he murmured then his face softened she would never do such a thing he said to himself he had forgotten the woman at the table while she had told him matters that concerned him he had listened eagerly now she was of no more interest than she had been before her story was begun she looked at his eyes as he sat thinking and dwelling upon his sweetheart she looked at him and a longing welled up into her face a certain youth and heavy beauty relighted the features you are the same same lin everyways she said a woman is too many for you still lin she whispered at her summons he looked up from his revery lin i would not have treated you so the caress that filled her voice was plain his look met hers as he sat quite still his arms on the table then he took his turn at laughing you he said at least ive had plenty of education in you lin lin dont talk that brutal to me today if yus knowed how near i come shooting myself with neighbor that would have been funny i knowed yus wanted to tear that pistol out of my hand because it was hern but yus never did such things to me fer theres a gentleman in you somewheres lin and yus didnt never hit me not even when you come to know me well and when i seen you so unexpected again tonight and you just the same old lin scaring lusk with shooting them chickens so comic and splendid i could a just killed lusk sittin in the wagon say lin what made yus do that anyway i cant hardly say said the cowpuncher only noticing him so turruble anxious to quit me well a man acts without thinking you always did lin you was always a comical genius lin them were good times which times you know you cant tell me you have forgot i have not forgot much whats the sense in this yus never loved me she exclaimed shucks lin lin is it all over you know yus loved me on bear creek say you did only say it was once that way and as he sat she came and put her arms round his neck for a moment he did not move letting himself be held and then she kissed him the plates crashed as he beat and struck her down upon the table he was on his feet cursing himself as he went out of the door she lay where she had fallen beneath his fist looking after him and smiling mclean walked down box elder creek through the trees toward the stable where lusk had gone to put the horse in the wagon once he leaned his hand against a big cottonwood and stood still with halfclosed eyes then he continued on his way lusk he called presently and in a few steps more lusk then as he came slowly out of the trees to meet the husband he began with quiet evenness your wife wants to know but he stopped no husband was there wagon and horse were not there the door was shut the bewildered cowpuncher looked up the stream where the road went and he looked down out of the sky where daylight and stars were faintly shining together sounded the long cries of the night hawks as they sped and swooped to their hunting in the dusk from among the trees by the stream floated a cooler air and distant and close by sounded the splashing water about the meadow where lin stood his horses fed quietly crunching he went to the door looked in and shut it again he walked to his shed and stood contemplating his own wagon alone there then he lifted away a piece of trailing vine from the gate of the corral while the turkeys moved their heads and watched him from the roof a rope was hanging from the corral and seeing it he dropped the vine he opened the corral gate and walked quickly back into the middle of the field where the horses saw him and his rope and scattered but he ran and herded them whirling the rope and so drove them into the corral and flung his noose over two he dragged two saddles mens saddles from the stable and next he was again at his cabin door with the horses saddled she was sitting quite still by the table where she had sat during the meal nor did she speak or move when she saw him look in at the door lusk has gone said he i dont know what he expected you would do or i would do but we will catch him before he gets to drybone she looked at him with her dumb stare gone she said get up and ride said mclean you are going to drybone drybone she echoed her voice was toneless and dull he made no more explanations to her but went quickly about the cabin soon he had set it in order the dishes on their shelves the table clean the fire in the stove arranged and all these movements she followed with a sort of blank mechanical patience he made a small bundle for his own journey tied it behind his saddle brought her horse beside a stump when at his sharp order she came out he locked his cabin and hung the key by a window where travellers could find it and be at home she stood looking where her husband had slunk off then she laughed its about his size she murmured her old lover helped her in silence to mount into the mans saddle this they had often done together in former years and so they took their way down the silent road they had not many miles to go and after the first two lay behind them when the horses were limbered and had been put to a canter they made time quickly they had soon passed out of the trees and pastures of box elder and came among the vast low stretches of the greater valley not even by day was the rivers course often discernible through the ridges and cheating sameness of this wilderness and beneath this halfdarkness of stars and a quarter moon the sage spread shapeless to the looming mountains or to nothing i will ask you one thing said lin after ten miles the woman made no sign of attention as she rode beside him did i understand that she miss buckner i mean mentioned she might be going away from separ how do i know what you understood i thought you said dont you bother me lin mclean her laugh rang out loud and forlorn one brief burst that startled the horses and that must have sounded far across the sagebrush you men are rich she said they rode on side by side and saying nothing after that the drybone road was a broad trail a worn strip of bareness going onward over the endless shelvings of the plain visible even in this light and presently moving upon its grayness on a hill in front of them they made out the wagon they hastened and overtook it put your carbine down said mclean to lusk its not robbers its your wife im bringing you he spoke very quietly the husband addressed no word to the cowpuncher get in then he said to his wife towns not far now said lin maybe you would prefer riding the balance of the way id but the note of pity that she felt in mcleans question overcame her and her utterance choked she nodded her head and the three continued slowly climbing the hill together from the narrows of the steep sandy weatherbeaten banks that the road slanted upward through for a while they came out again upon the immensity of the tableland here abruptly like an ambush was the whole unsuspected river close below to their right as if it had emerged from the earth with a circling sweep from somewhere out in the gloom it cut in close to the lofty mesa beneath tall cleangraded descents of sand smooth as a railroad embankment as they paused on the level to breathe their horses the wet gulp of its eddies rose to them through the stillness upstream they could make out the light of the drybone bridge but not the bridge itself and two lights on the farther bank showed where stood the hogranch opposite drybone they went on over the tableland and reached the next herald of the town drybones chief historian the graveyard beneath its slanting headboards and windshifted sand lay many more people than lived in drybone they passed by the fence of this shelterless acre on the hill and shoutings and high music began to reach them at the foot of the hill they saw the sparse lights and shapes of the town where ended the gray strip of road the many sounds feet voices and music grew clearer unravelling from their muffled confusion and the fiddling became a tune that could be known theres a dance tonight said the wife to the husband hurry he drove as he had been driving perhaps he had not heard her im telling you to hurry she repeated my new dress is in that wagon therell be folks to welcome me here thats older friends than you she put her horse to a gallop down the broad road toward the music and the older friends the husband spoke to his horse cleared his throat and spoke louder cleared his throat again and this time his sullen voice carried and the animal started so lusk went ahead of lin mclean following his wife with the new dress at as good a pace as he might if he did not want her company perhaps to be alone with the cowpuncher was still less to his mind it aint only her hes stopped caring for mused lin as he rode slowly along he dont care for himself any more part iii today drybone has altogether returned to the dust even in that day its hour could have been heard beginning to sound but its inhabitants were rather deaf gamblers saloonkeepers murderers outlaws male and female all were so busy with their cards their lovers and their bottles as to make the place seem young and vigorous but it was second childhood which had set in drybone had known a wholesome adventurous youth where manly lives and deaths were plenty it had been an army post it had seen horse and foot and heard the trumpet brave wives had kept house for their captains upon its bluffs winter and summer they had made the best of it when the war department ordered the captains to catch indians the wives bade them godspeed when the interior department ordered the captains to let the indians go again still they made the best of it you must not waste indians indians were a source of revenue to so many people in washington and elsewhere but the process of catching indians armed with weapons sold them by friends of the interior department was not entirely harmless therefore there came to be graves in the drybone graveyard the pale weatherwashed headboards told all about it sacred to the memory of private soandso killed on the dry cheyenne may or it would be mrs soandso found scalped on sage creek but even the financiers at washington could not wholly preserve the indian in drybones neighborhood as the cattle by ten thousands came treading with the next step of civilization into this huge domain the soldiers were taken away some of them went west to fight more indians in idaho oregon or arizona the battles of the others being done they went east in better coffins to sleep where their mothers or their comrades wanted them though wind and rain wrought changes upon the hill the readymade graves and boxes which these soldiers left behind proved heirlooms as serviceable in their way as were the tenements that the living had bequeathed to drybone into these empty barracks came to dwell and do business every joy that made the cowpunchers holiday and every hunted person who was baffling the sheriff for the sheriff must stop outside the line of drybone as shall presently be made clear the captains quarters were a saloon now professional cards were going in the adjutants office night and day and the commissary building made a good dancehall and hotel instead of guardmounting you would see a horserace on the paradeground and there was no provostsergeant to gather up the broken bottles and old boots heaps of these choked the rusty fountain in the tufts of yellow ragged grass that dotted the place plentifully were lodged many aces and queens and tenspots which the drybone wind had blown wide from the doors out of which they had been thrown when a new pack was called for inside among the grass tufts would lie visitors who had applied for beds too late at the dancehall frankly sleeping their whiskey off in the morning air above on the hill the graveyard quietly chronicled this new epoch of drybone soandso was seldom killed very far out of town and of course scalping had disappeared sacred to the memory of fourace johnston accidently shot sep perhaps one is still there unaltered sacred to the memory of mrs ryans babe aged two months this unique corpse had succeeded in dying with its boots off but a succession of graves was not always needed to read the changing tale of the place and how people died there one grave would often be enough the soldiers of course had kept treeless drybone supplied with wood but in these latter days wood was very scarce none grew nearer than twenty or thirty miles none that is to make boards of a sufficient width for epitaphs and twenty miles was naturally far to go to hew a board for a man of whom you knew perhaps nothing but what he said his name was and to whom you owed nothing perhaps but a trifling poker debt hence it came to pass that headboards grew into a sort of directory they were light to lift from one place to another a single coat of white paint would wipe out the first tenants name sufficiently to paint over it the next comers by this thrifty habit the original boards belonging to the soldiers could go round keeping pace with the new civilian population and though at first sight you might be puzzled by the layers of names still visible beneath the white paint you could be sure that the clearest and blackest was the one to which the present tenant had answered so there on the hill lay the graveyard steadily writing drybones history and making that history lay the town at the bottom one thin line of houses framing three sides of the old parade ground in these slowly rotting shells people rioted believing the golden age was here the age when everybody should have money and nobody should be arrested for drybone soil you see was still government soil not yet handed over to wyoming and only government could arrest there and only for government crimes but government had gone and seldom worried drybone the spot was a postagestamp of sanctuary pasted in the middle of wyomings big map a paradise for the fourace johnstons only you must not steal a horse that was really wicked and brought you instantly to the notice of drybones one official the coroner for they did keep a coroner judge slaghammer he was perfectly illegal and lived next door in albany county but that county paid fees and mileage to keep tally of drybones casualties his wife owned the dancehall and between their industries they made out a living and all the citizens made out a living the happy cowpunchers on ranches far and near still earned and instantly spent the high wages still paid them with their bodies full of youth and their pockets full of gold they rode into town by twenties by fifties and out again next morning penniless always and happy and then the fourace johnstons would sit cardplaying with each other till the innocents should come to town again tonight the innocents had certainly come to town and drybone was furnishing to them all its joys their many horses stood tied at every post and corner patient experienced cowponies well knowing it was an allnight affair the talk and laughter of the riders was in the saloons they leaned joking over the bars they sat behind their cards at the tables they strolled to the posttraders to buy presents for their easy sweethearts their boots were keeping audible time with the fiddle at mrs slaghammers from the multitude and vigor of the sounds there the dance was being done regularly regularly meant that upon the conclusion of each set the gentleman led his lady to the bar and invited her to choose and it was also regular that the lady should choose beer and whiskey were the alternatives lin mcleans horse took him across the square without guiding from the cowpuncher who sat absently with his hands folded upon the horn of his saddle this horse too was patient and experienced and could not know what remote thoughts filled his masters mind he looked around to see why his master did not get off lightly as he had done during so many gallant years and hasten in to the conviviality but the lonely cowpuncher sat mechanically identifying the horses of acquaintances toothpick kid is here said he and limber jim and the doughie youd think hed stay away after the trouble he i expect that pinto is jerky bills go home said a hearty voice mclean eagerly turned for the moment his face lighted from its sombreness id forgot youd be here said he and he sprang to the ground its fine to see you go home repeated the governor of wyoming shaking his ancient friends hand you in drybone tonight and claim youre reformed yu seem to be on hand yourself said the cowpuncher bracing to be jocular if he could me ive gone fishing dont you read the papers if we poor governors cant lock up the state house and take a whirl now and then doc interrupted lin its plumb fine to see yu again he shook hands why yes weve met here before you and i his excellency the hon amory w barker md stood laughing familiar and genial his sound white teeth shining but behind his round spectacles he scrutinized mclean for in this second handshaking was a fervor that seemed a grasp a reaching out for comfort barker had passed through separ though an older acquaintance than billy he had asked jessamine fewer and different questions but he knew what he knew well drybones the same old drybone said he sweetscented hole of iniquity lets see how you walk nowadays lin took a few steps pooh i said youd never get over it and his excellency beamed with professional pride in his doctor days barker had set the boy mcleans leg and before it was properly knit the boy had escaped from the hospital to revel loose in drybone on such another night as this soon he had been carried back with the fracture split open again it shows does it said lin well it dont usually not except when im when im down suggested his excellency yes doc down the cowpuncher confessed barker looked into his friends clear hazel eyes beneath their dauntless sparkle was something that touched the governors good heart ive got some whiskey along on the trip eastern whiskey said he come over to my room awhile i used to sleep all night onced said mclean as they went then i come to know different but id never have believed just mere thoughts could make yu make yu feel like the steam was only half on i eat yu know he stated suddenly and i expect one or two in camp lately have not found my muscle lacking feel me doc barker dutifully obeyed and praised the excellent sinews across from the dancehall the whining of the fiddle came high and gay feet blurred the talk of voices and voices rose above the trampling of feet here and there some lurking form stumbled through the dark among the rubbish and clearest sound of all the light crack of billiard balls reached dry and far into the night barker contemplated the stars and calm splendid dimness of the plain though every prospect pleases and only man is vile he quoted but dont tell the republican party i said so its awful true though doc im vile myself yu dont know why i didnt know and then they sat down to confidences and whiskey for so long as the world goes round a man must talk to a man sometimes and both must drink over it the cowpuncher unburdened himself to the governor and the governor filled up his friends glass with the eastern whiskey and nodded his spectacles and listened and advised and said he should have done the same and like the good governor that he was never remembered he was governor at all with political friends here who had begged a word or two he became just dr barker again the young hospital surgeon the hospital that now stood a ruin and lin was again his patientlin the sunburnt freelance of nineteen reckless engaging disobedient his leg broken and his heart light with no jessamine or conscience to rob his salt of its savor while he now told his troubles the quadrilles fiddled away careless as ever and the crack of the billiard balls sounded as of old nobody has told you about this i expect said the lover he brought forth the little pistol neighbor he did not hand it across to barker but walked over to barkers chair and stood holding it for the doctor to see when barker reached for it to see better since it was half hidden in the cowpunchers big hand lin yielded it to him but still stood and soon drew it back i take it around he said and when one of those stories comes along like theres plenty of that she wants to get rid of me i just kind o take a look at neighbor when im off where its handy and it busts the story right out of my mind i have to tell you what a fool i am the whiskeys your side said barker go on but doc my courage has quit me they see what im thinking about just like i was a tenderfoot trying his first bluff i cant stick it out no more and im going to see her come what will ive got to im going to ride right up to her window and shoot off neighbor and if she dont come out ill know a knocking came at the governors room and judge slaghammer entered not been to our dance governor said he the governor thought that perhaps he was tired that perhaps this evening he must forego the pleasure it may be wiser in your position it may be advisable said the coroner theyre getting on rollers over there we do not like trouble in drybone but trouble comes to us as everywhere shooting suggested his excellency recalling his hospital practice well governor you know how it is our boys are as bighearted as any in this bighearted western country you know governor those generous warmblooded spirits are ever ready for anything especially after mrs slaghammers whiskey remarked the governor the coroner shot a shrewd eye at wyomings chief executive it was not politically harmonious to be reminded that but for his wifes liquor a number of fine young men with nothing save youth untrained and health the matter with them would today be riding their horses instead of sleeping on the hill but the coroner wanted support in the next campaign boys will be boys said he they aint pulled any guns tonight but i come away though some of ems making up pretty free to mrs lusk it aint suitable for me to see too much lusk says hes after you he mentioned incidentally to lin hes fillin up and says hes after you mclean nodded placidly and with scant politeness he wished this visitor would go but judge slaghammer had noticed the whiskey he filled himself a glass governor it has my compliments said he ambrosier honeydoo mrs slaghammer seems to have a large gathering said barker good boys good boys the judge blew importantly and waved his arm bullwhackers cowpunchers muleskinners tinhorns all spending generous governor once more ambrosier honeydoo he settled himself deep in a chair and closed his eyes mclean rose abruptly goodnight said he im going to separ separ exclaimed slaghammer rousing slightly oh stay with us stay with us he closed his eyes again but sustained his smile of office you know how well i wish you said barker to lin ill just see you start forthwith the friends left the coroner quiet beside his glass and walked toward the horses through drybones gaping quadrangle the dead ruins loomed among the lights of the cardhalls and always the keen jockey cadences of the fiddle sang across the night but a calling and confusion were set up and the tune broke off just like old times said his excellency wheres the dumppile it was where it should be close by and the two stepped behind it to be screened from wandering bullets a man dont forget his habits declared the governor makes me feel young again makes me feel old said mclean hark sounds like my name said barker they listened oh yes of course thats it theyre shouting for the doctor but well just spare them a minute or so to finish their excitement i didnt hear any shooting said mclean its something though as they waited no shots came but still the fiddle was silent and the murmur of many voices grew in the dancehall while single voices wandered outside calling the doctors name im the governor on a fishingtrip said he but its to be done i suppose they left their dumphill and proceeded over to the dance the musician sat high and solitary upon two starchboxes fiddle on knee staring and waiting half the floor was bare on the other half the revellers were densely clotted at the crowds outer rim the young horsemen flushed and swaying retained their gaudy dance partners strongly by the waist to be ready when the music should resume what is it they asked who is it and they looked in across heads and shoulders inattentive to the caresses which the partners gave them mrs lusk was who it was and she had taken poison here in their midst after many dances and drinks heres doc cried an older one heres doc chorused the young blood that had come into this country since his day and the throng caught up the words heres doc heres doc in a moment mclean and barker were sundered from each other in this flood barker sucked in toward the centre but often eddied back by those who meant to help him heard the mixed explanations pass his ear unfinished versions contradictions a score of facts it had been wolfpoison it had been rough on rats it had been something in a bottle there was little steering in this clamorous sea but barker reached his patient where she sat in her new dress hailing him with wild inebriate gayety i must get her to her room friends said he he must get her to her room went the word leave doc get her to her room and they tangled in their eagerness around him and his patient give us buffalo girls shouted mrs lusk buffalo girls you fiddler well come back said barker to her buffalo girls i tell yus ho theres no sense looking at that bottle doc take yer dance while theres time she was holding the chair help him said the crowd help doc they took her from her chair and she fought a big pink mass of ribbons fluttering and wrenching itself among them she has six ounces of laudanum in her barker told them at the top of his voice it wont wait all night im a whirlwind said mrs lusk thats my game and you done your share she cried to the fiddler heres my regards old man buffalo girls once more she flung out her hand and from it fell notes and coins rolling and ringing around the starch boxes some dragged her on while some fiercely forbade the musician to touch the money because it was hers and she would want it when she came to thus they gathered it up for her but now she had sunk down asking in a new voice where was lin mclean and when one grinning intimate reminded her that lusk had gone to shoot him she laughed out richly and the crowd joined her mirth but even in the midst of the joke she asked again in the same voice where was lin mclean he came beside her among more jokes he had kept himself near and now at sight of him she reached out and held him tell them to leave me go to sleep lin said she barker saw a chance persuade her to come along said he to mclean minutes are counting now oh ill come she said with a laugh overhearing him and holding still to lin the rest of the old friends nudged each other back seats for us they said but weve had our turn in front ones then thinking they would be useful in encouraging her to walk they clustered again rendering barker and mclean once more wellnigh helpless clumsily the escort made its slow way across the quadrangle cautioning itself about stones and holes thus presently she was brought into the room the escort set her down crowding the little place as thick as it would hold the rest gathered thick at the door and all of them had no thought of departing the notion to stay was plain on their faces barker surveyed them give the doctor a show now boys said he youve done it all so far dont crowd my elbows ill want you he whispered to mclean at the argument of fairplay obedience swept over them like a veering of wind dont crowd his elbows they began to say at once and told each other to come away well sure give the doc room you dont want to be shovin your auger in chalkeye you want to get yourself pretty near absent the room thinned of them forthwith fix her up good doc they said over their shoulders they shuffled across the threshold and porch with roundabout schemes to tread quietly when one or other stumbled on the steps and fell he was jerked to his feet you want to tame yourself was the word then suddenly chalkeye and toothpick kid came precipitately back her cash they said and leaving the notes and coins they hastened to catch their comrades on the way back to the dance i want you repeated barker to mclean him cried mrs lusk flashing alert again jessamine wants him about now i guess dont keep him from his girl and she laughed her hard rich laugh looking from one to the other not the two of yus cant save me she stated defiantly but even in these last words a sort of thickness sounded walk her up and down said barker keep her moving ill look what i can find keep her moving brisk at once he was out of the door and before his running steps had died away the fiddle had taken up its tune across the quadrangle buffalo girls exclaimed the woman old times old times come said mclean walk and he took her her head was full of the music forgetting all but that she went with him easily and the two made their first turns around the room whenever he brought her near the entrance she leaned away from him toward the open door where the old fiddle tune was coming in from the dark but presently she noticed that she was being led and her face turned sullen walk said mclean do you think so said she laughing but she found that she must go with him thus they took a few more turns youre hurting me she said next then a look of drowsy cunning filled her eyes and she fixed them upon mcleans dogged face hes gone lin she murmured raising her hand where barker had disappeared she knew mclean had heard her and she held back on the quickened pace that he had set leave me down you hurt she pleaded hanging on him the cowpuncher put forth more strength just the floor she pleaded again just one minute on the floor hell think you could not keep me lifted still mclean made no answer but steadily led her round and round as he had undertaken hes playing out she exclaimed youll be played out soon she laughed herself halfawake the man drew a breath and she laughed more to feel his hand and arm strain to surmount her increasing resistance jessamine she whispered to him jessamine docll never suspicion you lin talk sense said he its sense im talking leave me go to sleep ah ah im going ill go you cant walk walk he repeated he looked at the door an ache was numbing his arms oh yes walk what can you and all your muscle ah walk me to glory then craziness im going ill go im quitting this outfit for keeps lin youre awful handsome tonight ill bet ill bet she has never seen you look so let me let me watch yus anyway she knows i came first he grasped her savagely first you and twenty of yu dont god what do i talk to her for because because im going ill go he slung me off but he had to sling you cant stop her head was rolling while the lips smiled her words came through deeper and deeper veils fearless defiant a challenge inarticulate a continuous mutter again he looked at the door as he struggled to move with her dragging weight the drops rolled on his forehead and neck his shirt was wet his hands slipped upon her ribbons suddenly the drugged body folded and sank with him pulling him to his knees while he took breath so the mutter went on and through the door came the jigging fiddle a fire of desperation lighted in his eyes buffalo girls he shouted hoarsely in her ear and got once more on his feet with her as though they were two partners in a quadrille still shouting her to wake he struck a tottering sort of step and so with the bending load in his grip strove feebly to dance the laudanum away feet stumbled across the porch and lusk was in the room so ive got you he said he had no weapon but made a dive under the bed and came up with a carbine the two men locked wrenching impotently and fell together the carbines loud shot rang in the room but did no harm and mclean lay sick and panting upon lusk as barker rushed in thank god said he and flung lusks pistol down the man deranged and encouraged by drink had come across the doctor delayed him threatened him with his pistol and when he had torn it away had left him suddenly and vanished but barker had feared and come after him here he glanced at the woman slumbering motionless beside the two men the husbands brief courage had gone and he lay beneath mclean who himself could not rise barker pulled them apart lin boy youre not hurt he asked affectionately and lifted the cowpuncher mclean sat passive with dazed eyes letting himself be supported youre not hurt repeated barker no answered the cowpuncher slowly i guess not he looked about the room and at the door i got interrupted he said youll be all right soon said barker nobody cares for me cried lusk suddenly and took to querulous weeping get up ordered barker sternly dont accuse me governor screamed lusk im innocent and he rose barker looked at the woman and then at the husband ill not say there was much chance for her he said but any she had is gone through you shell die nobody cares for me repeated the man he has learned my boy to scorn me he ran out aimlessly and away into the night leaving peace in the room stay sitting said barker to mclean and went to mrs lusk but the cowpuncher seeing him begin to lift her toward the bed without help tried to rise his strength was not sufficiently come back and he sank as he had been i guess i dont amount to much said he i feel like i was nothing well im something said barker coming back to his friend out of breath and i know what she weighs he stared admiringly through his spectacles at the seated man the cowpunchers eyes slowly travelled over his body and then sought barkers face doc said he aint i young to have my nerve quit me this way his excellency broke into his broad smile i know ive racketed some but aint it ruther early pursued mclean wistfully you sixfoot infant said barker look at your hand lin stared at it the fingers quivering and bloody and the skin grooved raw between them that was the buckle of her belt which in the struggle had worked round and been held by him unknowingly both his wrists and his shirt were ribbed with the pink of her sashes he looked over at the bed where lay the woman heavily breathing it was a something a sound not like the breath of life and barker saw the cowpuncher shudder she is strong he said her system will fight to the end two hours yet maybe queer world he moralized people half killing themselves to keep one in it who wanted to go and one that nobody wanted to stay mclean did not hear he was musing his eyes fixed absently in front of him i would not want he said with hesitating utterance id not wish for even my enemy to have a thing like what ive had to do tonight barker touched him on the arm if there had been another man i could trust trust broke in the cowpuncher why doc it is the best turn yu ever done me i know i am a man now if my nerve aint gone ive known you were a man since i knew you said the hearty governor and he helped the still unsteady sixfoot to a chair as for your nerve ill bring you some whiskey now and after he glanced at the bed and tomorrow youll go try if miss jessamine wont put the nerve yes doc ill go there i know but dont yu dont lets while shes im going to be glad about this doc after awhile but at the sight of a newcomer in the door he stopped in what his soul was stammering to say what do you want judge he inquired coldly i understand began slaghammer to barker i am informed speak quieter judge said the cowpuncher i understand repeated slaghammer more official than ever that there was a case for the coroner youll be notified put in mclean again meanwhile youll talk quiet in this room slaghammer turned and saw the breathing mass on the bed you are a little early judge said barker but but your ten dollars are safe said mclean the coroner shot one of his shrewd glances at the cowpuncher and sat down with an amiable countenance his fee was indeed ten dollars and he was desirous of a second term under the apprehension that it had already occurred the misapprehension i took steps to impanel a jury said he addressing both barker and mclean they are ah waiting outside responsible men governor and have sat before drybone has few responsible men tonight but i procured these at a little game where they were ah losing you may go back gentlemen said he going to the door i will summon you in proper time he looked in the room again is the husband not intending thats enough judge said mclean theres too many here without adding him judge spoke a voice at the door aint she ready yet she is still passing away observed slaghammer piously because i was thinking said the man i was just you see us jury is dry and dead broke doggonedest cards ive held this year and judge would there be anything out of the way in me touching my fee in advance if its a sure thing i see none my friend said slaghammer benevolently since it must be he shook his head and nodded it by turns then with fullblown importance he sat again and wrote a paper his coroners certificate next door in albany county these vouchers brought their face value of five dollars to the holder but on drybones neutral soil the saloons would always pay four for them and it was rare that any juryman could withstand the temptation of four immediate dollars this one gratefully received his paper and cherishing it like a bird in the hand he with his colleagues bore it where they might wait for duty and slake their thirst in the silent room sat lin mclean his body coming to life more readily than his shaken spirit barker seeing that the cowpuncher meant to watch until the end brought the whiskey to him slaghammer drew documents from his pocket to fill the time but was soon in slumber over them in all precincts of the quadrangle drybone was keeping it up late the fiddle the occasional shouts and the crack of the billiardballs travelled clear and far through the vast darkness outside presently steps unsteadily drew near and round the corner of the door a voice plaintive and diffident said judge aint she most pretty near ready wake up judge said barker your jury has gone dry again the man appeared round the door a handsome dishevelled fellow with hat in hand balancing himself with respectful anxiety thus was a second voucher made out and the messenger strayed back happy to his friends barker and mclean sat wakeful and slaghammer fell at once to napping from time to time he was roused by new messengers each arriving more unsteady than the last until every juryman had got his fee and no more messengers came the coroner slept undisturbed in his chair mclean and barker sat on the bed the mass with its pink ribbons breathed and breathed while moths flew round the lamp tapping and falling with light sounds so did the heart of the darkness wear itself away and through the stonecold air the dawn began to filter and expand barker rose bent over the bed and then stood seeing him mclean stood also judge said barker quietly you may call them now and with careful steps the judge got himself out of the room to summon his jury for a short while the cowpuncher stood looking down upon the woman she lay lumped inher gaudiness the ribbons darkly stained by the laudanum but into the stolid bold features death had called up the faintcolored ghost of youth and mclean remembered all his bear creek days hind sight is a turruble clear way o seein things said he i think ill take a walk go said barker the jury only need me and ill join you but the jury needed no witness their long waiting and the advance pay had been too much for these responsible men like brothers they had shared each others vouchers until responsibility had melted from their brains and the whiskey was finished then no longer entertained and growing weary of drybone they had remembered nothing but their distant beds each had mounted his pony holding trustingly to the saddle and thus unguided the experienced ponies had taken them right across the wide sagebrush and up and down the river they were now asleep or riding dispersed irrevocably but the coroner was here he duly received barkers testimony brought his verdict in and signed it and even while he was issuing to himself his own proper voucher for ten dollars came chalkeye and toothpick kid on their ponies galloping eager in their hopes and good wishes for mrs lusk life ran strong in them both the night had gone well with them here was the new day going to be fine it must be well with everybody you dont say they exclaimed taken aback too bad they sat still in their saddles and upon their reckless kindly faces thought paused for a moment her gone they murmured hard to get used to the idea whats anybody doing about the coffin mr lusk answered slaghammer doubtless lusk hell not know anything this forenoon hes out there in the grass she didnt think nothing of him tell bill not dollar bill jerky bill yu know hes over the bridge to fix up a hearse and well be back the two drove their spurs in with vigorous heels and instantly were gone rushing up the road to the graveyard the fiddle had lately ceased and no dancers stayed any longer in the hall eastward the rose and gold began to flow down upon the plain over the tops of the distant hills of the revellers many had never gone to bed and many now were already risen from their excesses to revive in the cool glory of the morning some were drinking to stay their hunger until breakfast some splashed and sported in the river calling and joking and across the river some were holding horseraces upon the level beyond the hogranch drybone air rang with them their lusty wandering shouts broke out in gusts of hilarity their pistols aimed at cans or prairie dogs or anything cracked as they galloped at large their speeding clearcut forms would shine upon the bluffs and descending merge in the dust their horses had raised yet all this was nothing in the vastness of the growing day beyond their voices the rim of the sun moved above the violet hills and drybone amid the quiet long new fields of radiance stood august and strange down along the tall bare slant from the graveyard the two horsemen were riding back they could be seen across the river and the horseracers grew curious as more and more watched the crowd began to speak it was a calf the two were bringing it was too small for a calf it was dead it was a coyote they had roped see it swing see it fall on the road its a coffin boys said one shrewd at guessing at that the event of last night drifted across their memories and they wheeled and spurred their ponies their crowding hoofs on the bridge brought the swimmers from the waters below and dressing they climbed quickly to the plain and followed the gathering by the door already were jerky bill and limber jim and the doughie and always more dashing up with their ponies halting with a sharp scatter of gravel to hear and comment barker was gone but the important coroner told his news and it amazed each comer and set him speaking and remembering past things with the others dead each one began her does he say why pshaw why frenchy said doc had her cured jack saunders claimed she had rode to box elder with lin mclean dead why pshaw seems doc couldnt swim her out couldnt swim her out thats it doc couldnt swim her out well theres one less of us sure she was one of the boys she grubstaked me when i went broke in she gave me fifty dollars onced at lander to buy a saddle i run agin her when she was a biscuitshooter sidney nebraska i run again her there too i knowed her at laramie wheres lin he knowed her all the way from bear creek to cheyenne they laughed loudly at this thats a lonesome coffin said the doughie that the best you could do youd say so said toothpick kid choices are getting scarce up there said chalkeye we looked the lot over they were arriving from their search among the old dugup graves on the hill now they descended from their ponies with the box roped and rattling between them wheres your hearse jerky asked chalkeye have her round in a minute said the cowboy and galloped away with three or four others turruble lonesome coffin all the same repeated the doughie and they surveyed the box that had once held some soldier she did like fixins said limber jim fixins said toothpick kid thats easy while some six of them with chalkeye bore the light halfrotted coffin into the room many followed toothpick kid to the posttraders store breaking in here they found men sleeping on the counters these had been able to find no other beds in drybone and lay as they had stretched themselves on entering they sprawled in heavy slumber some with not even their hats taken off and some with their boots against the rough hair of the next one they were quickly pushed together few waking and so there was space for spreading cloth and chintz stuffs were unrolled and flung aside till many folds and colors draped the motionless sleepers and at length a choice was made unmeasured yards of this drab chintz were ripped off money treble its worth was thumped upon the counter and they returned bearing it like a streamer to the coffin while the noise of their hammers filled the room the hearse came tottering to the door pulled and pushed by twenty men it was an ambulance left behind by the soldiers and of the oldfashioned shape concave in body its top blown away in winds of long ago and as they revolved its wheels dished in and out like hoops about to fall while some made a harness from ropes and throwing the saddles off two ponies backed them to the vehicle the body was put in the coffin now covered by the chintz but the laudanum upon the front of her dress revolted those who remembered their holidays with her and turning the woman upon her face they looked their last upon her flashing colored ribbons and nailed the lid down so they carried her out but the concave body of the hearse was too short for the coffin the end reached out and it might have fallen but limber jim taking the reins sat upon the other end waiting and smoking for all drybone was making ready to follow in some way they had sought the husband the chief mourner he however still lay in the grass of the quadrangle and despising him as she had done they left him to wake when he should choose those men who could sit in their saddles rode escort the old friends nearest and four held the heads of the frightened cowponies who were to draw the hearse they had never known harness before and they plunged with the men who held them behind the hearse the women followed in a large ranchwagon this moment arrived in town two mares drew this and their foals gambolled around them the great flattopped dray for hauling poles came last with its four government mules the cowboys had caught sight of it and captured it rushing to the posttraders they carried the sleeping men from the counter and laid them on the dray then searching drybone outside and in for any more incapable of following they brought them and the dray was piled limber jim called for another drink and with his cigar between his teeth cracked his long bullwhacker whip the ponies terrified sprang away scattering the men that held them and the swaying hearse leaped past the husband over the stones and the many playingcards in the grass masterfully steered it came safe to an open level while the throng cheered the unmoved driver on his coffin his cigar between his teeth stay with it jim they shouted youre a king a steep ditch lay across the flat where he was veering abrupt and nearly hidden but his eye caught the danger in time and swinging from it leftward so that two wheels of the leaning coach were in the air he faced the open again safe as the rescue swooped down upon him the horsemen came at the ditch a body of daring a sultry blast of youth wheeling at the brink they turned whirling their long ropes the skilful nooses flew and the ponies caught by the neck and foot were dragged back to the quadrangle and held in line so the pageant started the wild ponies quivering but subdued by the tightened ropes and the coffin steady in the ambulance beneath the driver the escort in their fringed leather and broad hats moved slowly beside and behind it many of them swaying their faces full of health and the sun and the strong drink the women followed whispering a little and behind them the slow dray jolted with its heaps of men waking from the depths of their whiskey and asking what this was so they went up the hill when the riders reached the tilted gate of the graveyard they sprang off and scattered among the hillocks stumbling and eager they nodded to barker and mclean quietly waiting there and began choosing among the open weatherdrifted graves from which the soldiers had been taken their figures went up and down the uneven ridges calling and comparing here said the doughie heres a good hole heres a deep one said another weve struck a well here said some more put her in here the sandhills became clamorous with voices until they arrived at a choice when some one with a spade quickly squared the rainwashed opening with lariats looping the coffin round they brought it and were about to lower it when chalkeye too near the edge fell in and one end of the box rested upon him he could not rise by himself and they pulled the ropes helplessly above mclean spoke to barker id like to stop this said he but a man might as well might as well stop a cloudburst said barker yes doc but it feels it feels like i was looking at ten dozen lin mcleans and seeing them still helpless with chalkeye he joined them and lifted the cowboy out i think said slaghammer stepping forward this should proceed no further without some perhaps some friend would recite now i lay me they dont use that on funerals said the doughie will some gentleman give the lords prayer inquired the coroner foreheads were knotted triad mutterings ran among them but some one remembered a prayer book in one of the rooms in drybone and the notion was hailed four mounted and raced to bring it they went down the hill in a flowing knot shirts ballooning and elbows flapping and so returned but the book was beyond them take it you you take it each one said false beginnings were made big thumbs pushed the pages back and forth until impatience conquered them they left the book and lowered the coffin helped again by mclean the weight sank slowly decently steadily down between the banks the sound that it struck the bottom with was a slight sound the grating of the load upon the solid sand and a little sand strewed from the edge and fell on the box at the same moment the rattle came up from below compact and brief a single jar quietly smiting through the crowd smiting it to silence one removed his hat and then another and then all they stood eying each his neighbor and shifting their eyes looked away at the great valley then they filled in the grave brought a headboard from a grave near by and wrote the name and date upon it by scratching with a stone she was sure one of us said chalkeye lets give her the lament and they followed his lead once in the saddle i used to go dashing once in the saddle i used to go gay first took to drinking and then to cardplaying got shot in the body and now here i lay beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly sound the dead march as you bear me along take me to boothill and throw the sod over me im but a poor cowboy i know i done wrong when the song was ended they left the graveyard quietly and went down the hill the morning was growing warm their work waited them across many sunny miles of range and plain soon their voices and themselves had emptied away into the splendid vastness and silence and they were gone ready with all their might to live or to die to be animals or heroes as the hours might bring them opportunity in drybones deserted quadrangle the sun shone down upon lusk still sleeping and the wind shook the aces and kings in the grass part iv over at separ jessamine buckner had no more stockings of billys to mend and much time for thinking and a change of mind the day after that strange visit when she had been told that she had hurt a good mans heart without reason she took up her work and while her hands despatched it her thoughts already accused her could she have seen that visitor now she would have thanked her she looked at the photograph on her table why did he go away so quickly she sighed but when young billy returned to his questions she was buoyant again and more than a match for him he reached the forbidden twelfth time of asking why lin mclean did not come back and marry her nor did she punish him as she had threatened she looked at him confidentially and he drew near full of hope billy ill tell you just why it is said she lin thinks im not a real girl a ah drawled billy backing from her with suspicion indeed thats what it is billy if he knew i was a real girl a ah went the boy entirely angry anybody can tell youre a girl and he marched out mystified and nursing a sense of wrong nor did his dignity allow him to reopen the subject today two miles out in the sagebrush by himself he was shooting jackrabbits but began suddenly to run in toward separ a horseman had passed him and he had loudly called but the rider rode on intent upon the little distant station man and horse were soon far ahead of the boy and the man came into town galloping no need to fire the little pistol by her window as he had once thought to do she was outside before he could leap to the ground and as he held her she could only laugh and cry and say forgive me oh why have you been so long she took him back to the room where his picture was and made him sit and sat herself close what is it she asked him for through the love she read something else in his serious face so then he told her how nothing was wrong and as she listened to all that he had to tell she too grew serious and held very close to him dear dear neighbor she said as they sat so happy with deepening happiness but not gay yet young billy burst open the door there he cried i knowed lin knowed you were a girl thus did billy also have his wish for had he not told jessamine that he liked her and urged her to come and live with him and lin that cabin on box elder became a home in truth with a woman inside taking the only care of mr mclean that he had known since his childhood though singularly enough he has an impression that it is he who takes care of jessamine in the afterdays the black pines stand high up the hills the white snow sifts their columns deep while through the canyons riven cleft from there beyond the rose clouds sweep serene above their paling shapes one star hath wakened in the sky and here in the gray world below over the sage the wind blows by rides through the cottonwoods ghostranks and hums aloft a sturdy tune among the rivers tawny bluffs untenanted as is the moon far neath the huge invading dusk comes silence awful through the plain but yonder horsemans heart is gay and he goes singing might and main
