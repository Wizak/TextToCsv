 the strength of gideon and other stories by paul laurence dunbar to my good friend and teacher captain charles b stivers contents strength of gideon mammy peggys pride vineys free papers the fruitful sleeping of the rev elisha edwards the ingrate the case of caline the finish of patsy barnes one mans fortunes jims probation uncle simons sundays out mr cornelius johnson officeseeker an oldtime christmas a mess of pottage the trustfulness of polly the tragedy at three forks the finding of zach johnsonham junior the faith cure man a council of state silas jackson the strength of gideon old mam henry and her word may be taken said that it was de powerfulles sehmont she ever had hyeahd in all huh bon days that was saying a good deal for the old woman had lived many years on the stone place and had heard many sermons from preachers white and black she was a judge too it really must have been a powerful sermon that brother lucius preached for aunt doshy scott had fallen in a trance in the middle of the aisle while merlatter mag who was famed all over the place for having white folks religion and never waking up had broken through her reserve and shouted all over the camp ground several times cassie had shown signs of giving way but because she was frail some of the solicitous sisters held her with selfcongratulatory care relieving each other now and then that each might have a turn in the rejoicings but as the preacher waded out deeper and deeper into the spiritual stream cassies efforts to make her feelings known became more and more decided he told them how the spears of the midianites had clashed upon de shiels of de gideonites an aftah while wid de powah of de lawd behin him de man gideon triumphed mightily and swaying then and wailing in the dark woods with grim branches waving in the breath of their own excitement they could hear above the tumult the clamor of the fight the clashing of the spears and the ringing of the shields they could see the conqueror coming home in triumph then when he cried awho i say awho is in gideons ahmy today and the wailing chorus took up the note awho it was too much even for frail cassie and deserted by the solicitous sisters in the words of mam henry she broke aloose and faihly tuk de place gideon had certainly triumphed and when a little boy baby came to cassie two or three days later she named him gideon in honor of the great hebrew warrior whose story had so wrought upon her all the plantation knew the spiritual significance of the name and from the day of his birth the child was as one set apart to a holy mission on earth say what you will of the influences which the circumstances surrounding birth have upon a child upon this one at least the effect was unmistakable even as a baby he seemed to realize the weight of responsibility which had been laid upon his little black shoulders and there was a complacent dignity in the very way in which he drew upon the sweets of his dirty sugarteat when the maternal breast was far off bending over the sheaves of the field he was a child early destined to sacrifice and selfeffacement and as he grew older and other youngsters came to fill cassies cabin he took up his lot with the meekness of an infantile moses like a moses he was too leading his little flock to the promised land when he grew to the age at which barefooted and oneshifted he led or carried his little brothers and sisters about the quarters but the promised land never took him into the direction of the stables where the other pickaninnies worried the horses or into the region of the hencoops where eggsucking was a common crime no boy ever rolled or tumbled in the dirt with a heartier glee than did gideon but no warrior not even his illustrious prototype himself ever kept sterner discipline in his ranks when his followers seemed prone to overstep the bounds of right at a very early age his shrill voice could be heard calling in admonitory tones caught from his mothers very lips you nelius don you let me ketch you thowin at ol mis guineahens no mo you hyeah me or hiam you come offen de top er dat shed fo you fall an brek yo naik all to pieces it was a common sight in the evening to see him sitting upon the low rail fence which ran before the quarters his shift blowing in the wind and his black legs lean and bony against the whitewashed rails as he swayed to and fro rocking and singing one of his numerous brothers to sleep and always his song was of war and victory albeit crooned in a low soothing voice sometimes it was turn back pharaohs army at others jinin gideons band the latter was a favorite for he seemed to have a proprietary interest in it although despite the martial inspiration of his name gideons band to him meant an aggregation of people with horns and fiddles steve who was cassies man declared that he had never seen such a child and being quite as religious as cassie herself early began to talk scripture and religion to the boy he was aided in this when his master dudley stone a man of the faith began a little sunday class for the religiously inclined of the quarters where the old familiar stories were told in simple language to the slaves and explained at these meetings gideon became a shining light no one listened more eagerly to the teachers words or more readily answered his questions at review no one was widermouthed or whitereyed his admonitions to his family now took on a different complexion and he could be heard calling across a lot to a mischievous sister bettah tek keer daih lucy jane gawds awatchin you bettah tek keer the appointed man is always marked and so gideon was by always receiving his full name no one ever shortened his scriptural appellation into gid he was always gideon from the time he bore the name out of the heat of campmeeting fervor until his master discovered his worthiness and filled cassies breast with pride by taking him into the house to learn mannahs and potment as a house servant he was beyond reproach and next to his religion his mas dudley and miss ellen claimed his devotion and fidelity the young mistress and young master learned to depend fearlessly upon his faithfulness it was good to hear old dudley stone going through the house in a mock fury crying well i never saw such a house it seems as if there isnt a soul in it that can do without gideon here ive got him up here to wait on me and its gideon here and gideon there and every time i turn around some of you have sneaked him off gideon come here and the black boy smiled and came but all his days were not days devoted to mens service for there came a time when love claimed him for her own when the clouds took on a new color when the sough of the wind was music in his ears and he saw heaven in marthas eyes it all came about in this way gideon was young when he got religion and joined the church and he grew up strong in the faith almost by the time he had become a valuable house servant he had grown to be an invaluable servant of the lord he had a good clear voice that could lead a hymn out of all the labyrinthian wanderings of an ignorant congregation even when he had to improvise both words and music and he was a mighty man of prayer it was thus he met martha martha was brown and buxom and comely and her rich contralto voice was loud and high on the sisters side in meeting time it was the voices that did it at first there was no hymn or spiritual that gideon could start to which martha could not sing an easy blending second and never did she open a tune that gideon did not swing into it with a wonderfully sweet flowing natural bass often he did not know the piece but that did not matter he sang anyway perhaps when they were out he would go to her and ask sis martha what was that hymn you stahrted today and she would probably answer oh dat was jes one o my mammys ol songs well it sholy was mighty pretty indeed it was oh thanky brothah gidjon thanky then a little later they began to walk back to the masters house together for martha too was one of the favored ones and served not in the field but in the big house the old women looked on and conversed in whispers about the pair for they were wise and what their old eyes saw they saw oomph said mam henry for she commented on everything dem too is jes natchelly singin demseves togeddah deys lak de monin stahs interjected aunt sophy how bout dat sniffed the older woman for she objected to any ones alluding to subjects she did not understand why mam henry ain you nevah hyeahd tell o de monin stahs whut sung deyseves

named chile humph glong gal taint in de name de biggest devil i evah knowed was named moses aaron taint in de name hits all in de man hissef but notwithstanding what the gossips said of him gideon went on his way and knew not that the one great power of earth had taken hold of him until they gave the great party down in the quarters and he saw martha in all her glory then love spoke to him with no uncertain sound it was a dancingparty and because neither he nor martha dared countenance dancing they had strolled away together under the pines that lined the white road whiter now in the soft moonlight he had never known the pinecones smell so sweet before in all his life she had never known just how the moonlight flecked the road before this was lovers lane to them he didnt understand why his heart kept throbbing so furiously for they were walking slowly and when a shadow thrown across the road from a bystanding bush frightened her into pressing close up to him he could not have told why his arm stole round her waist and drew her slim form up to him or why his lips found hers as eye looked into eye for their simple hearts loves mystery was too deep as it is for wiser ones some few stammering words came to his lips and she answered the best she could then why did the moonlight flood them so and why were the heavens so full of stars out yonder in the black hedge a mockingbird was singing and he was translating oh so poorly the song of their hearts they forgot the dance they forgot all but their love an you wont may nobody else but me martha you know i wont gidjon but i mus wait de yeah out yes an den dont you think mas stonell let us have a little cabin of ouah own jest outside de quahtahs wont it be blessid wont it be blessid he cried and then the kindly moon went under a cloud for a moment and came out smiling for he had peeped through and had seen what passed then they walked back hand in hand to the dance along the transfigured road and they found that the first part of the festivities were over and all the people had sat down to supper every one laughed when they went in martha held back and perspired with embarrassment but even though he saw some of the older heads whispering in a corner gideon was not ashamed a new light was in his eyes and a new boldness had come to him he led martha up to the grinning group and said in his best singing voice whut you laughin at yes is popped de question an she says yes an long bout a yeah fom now you kin all spec a invitation this was a formal announcement a shout arose from the happygolucky people who sorrowed alike in each others sorrows and joyed in each others joys they sat down at a table and their health was drunk in cups of cider and persimmon beer over in the corner mam henry mumbled over her pipe whad i tell you whad i tell you and aunt sophy replied hits de paable of de monin stahs dont talk to me bout no monin stahs the mammy snorted gawd jes fitted dey voices togeddah an den jined dey heats de monin stahs aint got nothin to do wid it mam henry said aunt sophy impressively yous a oldah ooman den i is an i ain sputin hit but i say dey done filled scripter bout de monin stahs deys done sung deyseves togeddah the old woman sniffed the next sunday at meeting some one got the start of gideon and began a new hymn it ran at de maige of de lamb oh lawd god done gin his sent dey dressed de lamb all up in white god done gin his sent oh wasnt dat a happy day oh wasnt dat a happy day good lawd oh wasnt dat a happy day de maige of de lamb the wailing minor of the beginning broke into a joyous chorus at the end and gideon wept and laughed in turn for it was his weddingsong the young man had a confidential chat with his master the next morning and the happy secret was revealed what you scamp said dudley stone why youve got even more sense than i gave you credit for youve picked out the finest girl on the plantation and the one best suited to you you couldnt have done better if the match had been made for you i reckon this must be one of the marriages that are made in heaven marry her yes and with a preacher i dont see why you want to wait a year gideon told him his hopes of a near cabin better still his master went on with you two joined and up near the big house ill feel as safe for the folks as if an army was camped around and gideon my boy he put his arms on the black mans shoulders if i should slip away some day the slave looked up startled i mean if i should die im not going to run off dont be alarmed i want you to help your young mas dud look after his mother and miss ellen you hear now thats the one promise i ask of you come what may look after the women folks and the man promised and went away smiling his year of engagement the happiest time of a young mans life began on golden wings there came rumors of war and the wings of the gladhued year drooped sadly sadly they drooped and seemed to fold when one day between the rumors and predictions of strife dudley stone the old master slipped quietly away out into the unknown there were wife daughter son and faithful slaves about his bed and they wept for him sincere tears for he had been a good husband and father and a kind master but he smiled and conscious to the last whispered to them a cheery goodbye then turning to gideon who stood there bowed with grief he raised one weak finger and his lips made the word remember they laid him where they had laid one generation after another of the stones and it seemed as if a pall of sorrow had fallen upon the whole place then still grieving they turned their longdistracted attention to the things that had been going on around and lo the ominous mutterings were loud and the cloud of war was black above them it was on an april morning when the storm broke and the plantation master and man stood dumb with consternation for they had hoped they had believed it would pass and now there was the buzz of men who talked in secret corners there were hurried saddlings and feverish rides to town somewhere in the quarters was whispered the forbidden word freedom and it was taken up and dropped breathlessly from the ends of a hundred tongues some of the older ones scouted it but from some who held young children to their breasts there were deepsouled prayers in the dead of night over the meetings in the woods or in the log church a strange reserve brooded and even the prayers took on a guarded tone even from the fulness of their hearts which longed for liberty no open word that could offend the mistress or the young master went up to the almighty he might know their hearts but no tongue in meeting gave vent to what was in them and even gideon sang no more of the gospel army he was sad because of this new trouble coming hard upon the heels of the old and martha was grieved because he was finally the trips into town budded into something and on a memorable evening when the sun looked peacefully through the pines young dudley stone rode into the yard dressed in a suit of gray and on his shoulders were the straps of office the servants gathered around him with a sort of awe and followed him until he alighted at the porch only mam henry who had been nurse to both him and his sister dared follow him in it was a sad scene within but such a one as any southern home where there were sons might have shown that awful year the mother tried to be brave but her old hands shook and her tears fell upon her sons brown head tears of grief at parting but through which shone the fire of a noble pride the young ellen hung about his neck with sobs and caresses would you have me stay he asked her no no i know where your place is but oh my brother ellen said the mother in a trembling voice you are the sister of a soldier now the girl dried her tears and drew herself up we wont burden your heart dudley with our tears but we will weight you down with our love and prayers it was not so easy with mam henry without protest she took him to her bosom and rocked to and fro wailing my baby my baby and the tears that fell from the young mans eyes upon her grey old head cost his manhood nothing gideon was behind the door when his master called him his sleeve was traveling down from his eyes as he emerged gideon said his master pointing to his uniform you know what this means yes suh i wish i could take you along with me but mas dud gideon threw out his arms in supplication you remember fathers charge to you take care of the womenfolks he took the servants hand and black man and white they looked into each others eyes and the compact was made then gideon gulped and said yes suh again another boy held the masters horse and rode away behind him when he vaulted into the saddle and the man of battlesong and warrior name went back to mind the womenfolks then began the disintegration of the plantations population first yellow bob slipped away and no one pursued him a few blamed him but they soon followed as the year rolled away more were missing every time a union camp lay near and great tales were told of the chances for young negroes who would go as bodyservants to the yankee officers gideon heard all and was silent then as the time of his marriage drew near he felt a greater strength for there was one who would be with him to help him keep his promise and his faith the spirit of freedom had grown strong in martha as the days passed and when her lover went to see her she had strange things to say was he going to stay was he going to be a slave when freedom and a livelihood lay right within his grasp would he keep her a slave yes he would do it all all she asked him to wait another year began and one day they brought dudley stone home to lay beside his father then most of the remaining negroes went there was no master now the two bereaved women wept and gideon forgot that he wore the garb of manhood and wept with them martha came to him gidjon she said is waited a long while now mos eveybody else is gone aint you goin no but gidjon i wants to be free i know how good deyve been to us but oh i wants to own mysef theyre talkin bout settin us free every hour i can wait theys a camp right near here i promised the ofcers wants bodyservants gidjon go martha if you want to but i stay she went away from him but she or some one else got word to young captain jack griswold of the near camp that there was an excellent servant on the plantation who only needed a little persuading and he came up to see him look here he said i want a bodyservant ill give you ten dollars a month ive got to stay here but you fool what have you to gain by staying here im goin to stay why youll be free in a little while anyway all right of all fools said the captain ill give you fifteen dollars i do want it well your girls going anyway i dont blame her for leaving such a fool as you are gideon turned and looked at him the camp is going to be moved up on this plantation and there will be a requisition for this house for officers quarters so ill see you again and captain griswold went his way martha going martha going gideon could not believe it he would not he saw her and she confirmed it she was going as an aid to the nurses he gasped and went back to mind the womenfolks they did move the camp up nearer and captain griswold came to see gideon again but he could get no word from him save im goin to stay and he went away in disgust entirely unable to understand such obstinacy as he called it illustration its freedom gideon but the slave had his moments alone when the agony tore at his breast and rended him should he stay the others were going he would soon be free every one had said so even his mistress one day then martha was going martha martha his heart called the day came when the soldiers were to leave and he went out sadly to watch them go all the plantation that had been white with tents was dark again and everywhere were moving bluecoated figures once more his tempter came to him ill make it twenty dollars he said but gideon shook his head then they started the drums tapped away they went the flag kissing the breeze martha stole up to say goodbye to him her eyes were overflowing and she clung to him come gidjon she plead fu my sake oh my god wont you come with us its freedom he kissed her but shook his head hunt me up when you do come she said crying bitterly fu i do love you gidjon but i must go out yonder is freedom and she was gone with them he drew out a pace after the troops and then turning looked back at the house he went a step farther and then a womans gentle voice called him gideon he stopped he crushed his cap in his hands and the tears came into his eyes then he answered yes mis ellen is acomin he stood and watched the dusty column until the last blue leg swung out of sight and over the grey hills the last drumtap died away and then turned and retraced his steps toward the house gideon had triumphed mightily mammy peggys pride in the failing light of the midsummer evening two women sat upon the broad veranda that ran round three sides of the old virginia mansion one was young and slender with the slightness of delicate girlhood the other was old black and ample a typical mammy of the old south the girl was talking in low subdued tones touched with a note of sadness that was strange in one of her apparent youth but which seemed as if somehow in consonance with her sombre garments no no peggy she was saying we have done the best we could as well as even papa could have expected of us if he had been here it was of no use to keep struggling and straining along trying to keep the old place from going out of a sentiment which however honest it might have been was neither common sense nor practical poor people and we are poor in spite of the little we got for the place cannot afford to have feelings of course i hate to see strangers take possession of the homestead and and papas and mammas and brother phils graves are out there on the hillside it is hard hard but what was i to do i couldnt plant and hoe and plow and you couldnt so i am beaten beaten the girl threw out her hands with a despairing gesture and burst into tears mammy peggy took the brown head in her lap and let her big hands wander softly over the girls pale face sh sh she said as if she were soothing a baby dont go on lak dat wy whuts de mattah wid you miss mime pears lak you done los all yo speit whut you reckon yo pappy ud tink ef he could see you cain on dis away didn he put his han on yo haid an call you his own brave little

cant everything i turn my hand to fails ive tried sewing but here every one sews for herself now ive even tried writing and here a crimson glow burned in her cheeks but oh the awful regularity with which everything came back to me why i even put you in a story mammy peggy you dear old good unselfish thing and the hardhearted editor had the temerity to decline you with thanks i wouldnta nevah lef you nohow honey mima laughed through her tears the strength of her first grief had passed and she was viewing her situation with a whimsical enjoyment of its humorous points i dont know she went on it seems to me that its only in stories themselves that destitute young southern girls get on and make fame and fortune with their pens im sure i couldnt of course you couldnt whut else do you spect whut

take possession of the old virginia mansion he was welcomed at the door and ushered into the broad parlor by mammy peggy stiff and unbending in the faded finery of her familys better days miss mimell be down in a minute she told him and as he sat in the great old room and looked about him at the evidences of ancient affluence his spirit was subdued by the silent tragedy which his possession of it evinced but he could not but feel a thrill at the bit of comedy which is on the edge of every tragedy as he thought of mammy peggy and her formal reception she let me into my own house he thought to himself with the air of granting me a favor and then there was a step on the stair the door opened and miss mima stood before him proud cold white and beautiful he found his feet and went forward to meet her mr northcope she said and offered her hand daintily hesitatingly he took it and thought even in that flash of a second what a soft tiny hand it was yes he said and i have been sitting here overcome by the vastness of your fine old house the your was delicate she thought but she only said let me help you to recovery with some tea mammy will bring some and then she blushed very red my old nurse is the only servant i have with me and she is always mammy to me she remembered and throwing up her proud little head rang for the old woman directly mammy peggy came marching in like a grenadier she bore a tray with the tea things on it and after she had set it down hovered in the room as if to chaperon her mistress bartley felt decidedly uncomfortable mimas manners were all that politeness could require but he felt as if she resented his coming even to his own and he knew that mammy looked upon him as an interloper illustration mammy peggy came marching in like a grenadier mima kept up well only the paleness of her face showed what she felt at leaving her home her voice was calm and impassive only once it trembled when she wished that he would be as happy in the house as she had been i feel very much like an interloper he said but i hope you wont feel yourself entirely shut out from your beautiful home my father who comes on in a few days is an invalid and gets about very little and i am frequently from home so pray make use of the grounds when you please and as much of the house as you find convenient a cold thank you fell from mimas lips but then she went on hesitatingly i should like to come sometimes to the hill out there behind the orchard her voice choked but she went bravely on some of my dear ones are buried there go there and elsewhere as much as you please that spot shall be sacred from invasion you are very kind she said and rose to go mammy carried away the tea things and then came and waited silently by the door i hope you will believe me miss harrison said bartley as mima was starting when i say that i do not come to your home as a vandal to destroy all that makes its recollection dear to you for there are some associations about it that are almost as much to me as to you since my eyes have been opened i do not understand you she replied i can explain for some years past my fathers condition has kept me very closely bound to him and both before and after the beginning of the war we lived abroad a few years ago i came to know and love a man who i am convinced now was your brother am i mistaken in thinking that you are a sister of philip harrison no no he was my brother my only brother i met him in venice just before the war and we came to be dear friends but in the events that followed so tumultuously and from participation in which i was cut off by my fathers illness i lost sight of him but i dont believe i remember hearing my brother speak of you and he was not usually reticent you would not remember me as bartley northcope unless you were familiar with the very undignified sobriquet with which your brother nicknamed me said the young man smiling nickname what you are not you cant be budge i am budge or old budge as phil called me mima had her hand on the doorknob but she turned with an impulsive motion and went back to him i am so glad to see you she said giving him her hand again and mammy she called mr northcope is an old friend of brother phils the effect of this news on mammy was like that of the april sun on an icicle she suddenly melted and came overflowing back into the room her smiles and grins and nods trickling everywhere under the genial warmth of this new friendliness before one who had been a friend of mas phils mammy peggy needed no pride la chile she exclaimed settling and patting the cushions of the chair in which he had been sitting wy didn you say so befo i wasnt sure that i was standing in the house of my old friend i only knew that he lived somewhere in virginia he is among those out on the hill behind the orchard said mima sadly mammy peggy wiped her eyes and went about trying to add some touches of comfort to the already perfect room you have no reason to sorrow miss harrison said northcope gently for a brother who died bravely in battle for his principles had fate allowed me to be here i should have been upon the other side but believe me i both understand and appreciate your brothers heroism the young girls eyes glistened with tears through which glowed her sisterly pride wont you come out and look at his grave it is the desire that was in my mind together they walked out with mammy following to the old burying plot all her talk was of her brothers virtues and he proved an appreciative listener she pointed out favorite spots of her brothers childhood as they passed along and indicated others which his boyish pranks had made memorable though the eyes of the man were oftener on her face than on the landscape but it was with real sympathy and reverence that he stood with bared head beside the grave of his friend and the tears that she left fall unchecked in his presence were not all tears of grief they did not go away from him that afternoon until mammy peggy seconded by mima had won his consent to let the old servant come over and do for him until he found suitable servants to think of his having known philip said mima with shining eyes as they entered the new cottage and somehow it looked pleasanter brighter and less mean to her than it had ever before now sposin youd a run off widout seein him whaih would you been den you wouldn nevah knowed whut you knows youre right mammy peggy and im glad i stayed and faced him for it doesnt seem now as if a stranger had the house and it has given me a great pleasure it seemed like having phil back again to have him talked about so by one who lived so near to him i tell you chile mammy supplemented in an oracular tone de right kin o pride allus pays mima laughed heartily the old woman looked at her bright face then she put her big hand on the girls small one it was trembling she shook her head mima blushed bartley went out and sat on the veranda a long time after they were gone he took in the great expanse of lawn about the house and the dark background of the pines in the woods beyond he thought of the conditions through which the place had become his and the thought saddened him even in the first glow of the joy of possession then his mind went on to the old friend who was sleeping his last sleep back there on the sunbathed hill his recollection went fondly over the days of their comradeship in venice and colored them anew with glory these southerners he mused aloud cannot understand that we sympathize with their misfortunes but we do they forget how our sympathies have been trained we were first taught to sympathize with the slave and now that he is free and needs less perhaps of our sympathy this by a transition as easy as it is natural is transferred to his master poor poor phil there was a strange emotion halfsad halfpleasant tugging at his heart a mist came before his eyes and hid the landscape for a moment and he he referred it all to the memories of the brother yes he thought he was thinking of the brother and he did not notice or did not pretend to notice that a pair of appealing eyes looking out beneath waves of brown hair that a soft fair hand pressed in his own floated nebulously at the back of his consciousness it was not until he had set out to furnish his house with a complement of servants against the coming of his father that bartley came to realize the full worth of mammy peggys offer to do for him the old woman not only got his meals and kept him comfortable trudging over and back every day from the little cottage but she proved invaluable in the choice of domestic help she knew her people thereabouts just who was spry and who was trifling and with the latter she would have nothing whatever to do she acted rather as if he were a guest in his own house and what was more would take no pay for it of course there had to be some return for so much kindness and it took the form of various gifts of flowers and fruit from the old place to the new cottage and sometimes when bartley had forgotten to speak of it before mammy had left he would arrange his baskets and carry his offering over himself mima thought it was very thoughtful and kind of him and she wondered on these occasions if they ought not to keep mr northcope to tea and if mammy would not like to make some of those nice muffins of hers that he had liked so and mammy always smiled on her charge and said yes honey yes but hit do pear lak dat mistah nothcope do fugit mo an mo to sen de tings ovah by me wen is daih but mammy found her special charge when the elder northcope came it seemed that she could never do enough for the pale stooped old man and he declared that he had never felt better in his life than he grew to feel under her touch an injury to his spine had resulted in partially disabling him but his mind was a rich store of knowledge and his disposition was tender and cheerful so it pleased his son sometimes to bring mima over to see him the warm impulsive heart of the southern girl went out to him and they became friends at once he found in her that soft caressing humoring quality that even his sons devotion could not supply and his superior age knowledge and wisdom made up to her the lost fathers care for which peggys love illy substituted the tenderness grew between them through the long afternoons she would read to him from his favorite books or would listen to him as he talked of the lands where he had been and the things he had seen sometimes mammy peggy grumbled at the reading and said it wuz jes lak doin hiahed wok but mima only laughed and went on bartley saw the sympathy between them and did not obtrude his presence but often in the twilight when she started away he would slip out of some corner and walk home with her these little walks together were very pleasant and on one occasion he had asked her the question that made her pale and red by turns and sent her heart beating with convulsive throbs that made her gasp maybe im over soon in asking you mima dear he faltered but but i couldnt wait any longer youve become a part of my life i have no hope no joy no thought that you are not of wont you be my wife they were pausing at her gate and she was trembling from what emotion he only dared guess but she did not answer she only returned the pressure of his hand and drawing it away rushed into the house she durst not trust her voice bartley went home walking on air mima did not go directly to mammy peggy with her news she must compose herself first this was hard to do so she went to her room and sat down to think it over he loves me he loves me she kept saying to herself and with each repetition of the words the red came anew into her cheeks they were still a suspicious hue when she went into the kitchen to find mammy who was slumbering over the waiting dinner what meks you so long honey asked the old woman coming wide awake out of her catnap oh i i i dont know answered the young girl blushing furiously i i stopped to talk why dey ain no one in de house to talk to i hyeahed you wen you come home you have been a powahful time sence you come in whut meks you so red then a look of intelligence came into mammys fat face oomph she said oh mammy dont look that way i couldnt help it bartley mr northcope has asked me to be his wife asked you to be his wife oomph whut did you tell him i didnt tell him anything i was so ashamed i couldnt talk i just ran away like a silly oomph said mammy again an whut you gwine to tell him oh

say no ez ef you wasn nevah gwine to say nothin else you jes say a holin off no i like mr northcope as a friend and my no to him will be final the dinner did not go down very well with mima that evening it stopped in her throat and when she swallowed it brought the tears to her eyes when it was done she hurried away to her room she was so disappointed but she would not confess it to herself and she would not weep he proposed to me because he pitied me oh the shame of it he turned me out of doors and then thought i would be glad to come back at any price when he read her cold formal note bartley knew that he had offended her and the thought burned him like fire he cursed himself for a blundering fool she was only trying to be kind to father and me he said and i have taken advantage of her goodness he would never have confessed to himself before that he was a coward but that morning when he got her note he felt that he could not face her just yet and commending his father to the tender mercies of mammy peggy and the servants he took the first train to the north it would be hard to say which of the two was the most disappointed when the truth was known it might better be said which of the three for mima went no more to the house and the elder northcope fretted and was restless without her he availed himself of an invalids privilege to be disagreeable and nothing mammy peggy could do now would satisfy him indeed between the two the old woman had a hard time of it for mima was tearful and morose and would not speak to her except to blame her as the days went on she wished to all the powers that she had left the harrison pride in the keeping of the direct members of the family it had proven a dangerous thing in her hands mammy soliloquized when she was about her work in the kitchen men ain whut dey used to be she said whod a tought o de young man a runnin off dat away jes cause a ooman tol him no he orter had sense enough to know dat a ooman has seval kins o

home autumn was painting the trees about the place before the necessity of being at his fathers side called him from his voluntary exile and then he did not go to see mima he was still bowed with shame at what he thought his unmanly presumption and he did not blame her that she avoided him his attention was arrested one day about a week after his return by the peculiar actions of mammy peggy she hung around him and watched him following him from place to place like a spaniel finally he broke into a laugh and said why whats the matter aunt peggy are you afraid im going to run away no i ain afeared o dat said mammy meekly but i been had somepn to say to you dis long wile well go ahead im listening mammy gulped and went on ask huh agin she said it were my fault she tol you no i minded huh

cottage mimas heart gave a great throb when she saw him coming up the walk and she tried to harden herself against him but her lips would twitch and her voice would tremble as she said how do you do mr northcope he looked keenly into her eyes have i been mistaken mima he said in believing that i greatly offended you by asking you to be my wife do you can you care for me darling the words stuck in her throat and he went on i thought you were angry with me because i had taken advantage of your kindness to my father or presumed upon any kindness that you may have felt for me out of respect to your brothers memory believe me i was innocent of any such intention oh it wasnt it wasnt that she gasped then wont you give me a different answer he said taking her hand i cant i cant she cried why mima he asked because because of the harrison pride bartley your mammy peggy has confessed all to me mammy peggy yes she tried hard to stiffen herself then it is all out of the question she began dont let any little folly or pride stand between us he broke in drawing her to him she gave up the struggle and her head dropped upon his shoulder for a moment then she lifted her eyes shining with tears to his face and said bartley it wasnt my pride it was mammy peggys he cut off further remarks when he was gone and mammy came in after a while mima ran to her crying oh mammy mammy you bad stupid dear old goose and she buried her head in the old womans lap oomph grunted mammy i said de right kin o pride allus pays but de wrong kin oomph well youd bettah look out vineys free papers part i there was joy in the bosom of ben raymond he sang as he hoed in the field he cheerfully worked overtime and his labors did not make him tired when the quitting horn blew he executed a double shuffle as he shouldered his hoe and started for his cabin while the other men dragged wearily over the ground he sprang along as if all day long he had not been bending over the hoe in the hot sun with the sweat streaming from his face in rivulets and this had been going on for two months now two happy months ever since viney had laid her hand in his had answered with a coquettish yes and the master had given his consent his blessing and a fivedollar bill it had been a long and trying courtship that is it had been trying for ben because viney loved pleasure and hungered for attention and the field was full of rivals she was a merry girl and a pretty one no one could dance better no girl on the place was better able to dress her dark charms to advantage or to show them off more temptingly the toss of her head was an invitation and a challenge in one and the way she smiled back at them over her shoulder set the young mens heads dancing and their hearts throbbing so her suitors were many but through it all ben was patient unflinching and faithful and finally after leading him a life full of doubt and suspense the coquette surrendered and gave herself into his keeping she was maid to her mistress but she had time nevertheless to take care of the newly whitewashed cabin in the quarters to which ben took her and it was very pleasant to lean over and watch him at work making things for the little house a chair from a barrel and a wonderful box of shelves to stand in the corner and she knew how to say merry things and later outside his door ben would pick his banjo and sing low and sweetly in the musical voice of his race altogether such another honeymoon there had never been for once the old women hushed up their prophecies of evil although in the beginning they had shaken their wise old turbaned heads and predicted that marriage with such a flighty creature as viney could come to no good they had said among themselves that ben would better marry some good solidminded strongarmed girl who would think more about work than about pleasures and coquetting i low honey an old woman had said shell mek his heart ache many a time shell comb his haid wid a threelegged stool an bresh it wid de broom uh huh putty is she you may huh cause she putty kiyi she fix you putty women fu putty tricks and the old hag smacked her lips over the spice of malevolence in her words some women and they are not all black and ugly never forgive the world for letting them grow old but in spite of all prophecies to the contrary two months of unalloyed joy had passed for ben and viney and tonight the climax seemed to have been reached ben hurried along talking to himself as his hoe swung over his shoulder kin i do it he was saying kin i do it then he would stop his walk and his cogitations would bloom into a mirthful chuckle something very pleasant was passing through his mind as he approached viney was standing in the door of the little cabin whose white sides with green madeira clambering over them made a pretty frame for the dark girl in her print dress the husband bent double at sight of her stopped took off his hat slapped his knee and relieved his feelings by a sounding whoee whats de mattah wid you ben you ac lak you mighty happy bettah come on in hyeah an git yo suppah fo hit gits col for answer the big fellow dropped the hoe and seizing the slight form in his arms swung her around until she gasped for breath oh ben she shrieked you done tuk all my win dah now he said letting her down dats what you gits fu talkin sassy to me nev min im goin to fix you fu dat fus time i

set to wok an buy my free papahs oh kin you do it kin you do it kin you do it kin i do it he repeated he stretched out his arm with the sleeve rolled to the shoulder and curved it upward till the muscles stood out like great knots of oak then he opened and shut his fingers squeezing them together until the joints cracked kin i do it he looked down on her calmly and smiled simply happily she threw her arms around his waist and sank on her knees at his feet sobbing ben ben my ben i nevah even thought of it hit seemed so far away but now were goin to be free free free he lifted her up gently its gwine to tek a powful long time he said i don keer she cried gaily we know its comin an we kin wait the womans serious mood had passed as quickly as it had come and she spun around the cabin executing a series of steps that set her husband agrin with admiration and joy and so ben began to work with renewed vigor he had found a purpose in life and there was something for him to look for beyond dinner a dance and the end of the day he had always been a good hand but now he became a model no shirking no shiftlessness and because he was so earnest his master did what he could to help him numerous little plans were formulated whereby the slave could make or save a precious dollar viney too seemed inspired by a new hope and if this little house had been pleasant to ben nothing now was wanting to make it a palace in his eyes only one sorrow he had and that one wrung hard at his great heart no baby came to them but instead he made a great baby of his wife and went on his way hiding his disappointment the best he could the banjo was often silent now for when he came home his fingers were too stiff to play but sometimes when his heart ached for the laughter of a child he would take down his old friend and play low soothing melodies until he found rest and comfort viney had once tried to console him by saying that had she had a child it would have taken her away from her work but he had only answered we could a stood that but bens patient work and frugality had their reward and it was only a little over three years after he had set out to do it that he put in his masters hand the price of vineys freedom and there was sound of rejoicing in the land a fat shoat honestly come by for it was the masters gift was killed and baked great jugs of biting persimmon beer were brought forth and the quarters held high carnival to celebrate vineys newfound liberty after the merrymakers had gone and when the cabin was clear again ben held out the paper that had been on exhibition all evening to viney hyeah hyeahs de docyment dat meks you yo own ooman tek it during all the time that it had been out for show that night the people had looked upon it with a sort of awe as if it was possessed of some sort of miraculous power even now viney did not take hold of it but shrunk away with a sort of gasp no ben you keep it i cant tek keer o no sich precious thing ez dat put hit in yo chist tek hit and feel of hit anyhow sos youll know dat yous free she took it gingerly between her thumb and forefinger ben suddenly let go dah now he said you keep dat docyment its yos keep hit undah yo own sponsibility no no ben she cried i jes cant you mus dats de way to git used to bein free whenevah you looks at yosef an feels lak you ain no diffent fom whut you been you tek dat papah out an look at hit an say to yosef dat means freedom carefully reverently silently viney put the paper into her bosom now de nex ting fu me to do is to set out to git one dem papahs fu mysef hitll be a long try cause i cant buy mine so cheap as i got yos dough de lawd knows why a great big ol hunk lak me should cos mon a precious mossell lak you hits because deys so much of you ben an evah bit of yous woth its weight in gol heish chile don put my valy so high er ill be twell jedgment day apayin hit off part ii so ben went forth to battle for his own freedom undaunted by the task before him while viney took care of the cabin doing what she could outside armed with her new dignity she insisted upon her friends recognizing the change in her condition thus when mandy so far forgot herself as to address her as viney raymond the new free womans head went up and she said with withering emphasis mis viney allen if you please viney allen exclaimed her visitor huccum yous viney allen now cause i don belong to de raymonds no mo an i kin tek my own name now ben longs to de raymonds an his name ben raymond an you his wife how you git aroun dat mis viney allen bens name goin to be mistah allen soons he gits his free papahs oomph you done gone now yo naik so stiff you cant hadly ben it i don see how dat papah mek sich a change in anybodys actions yo face ain got no whitah no but is free an i kin do as i please mandy went forth and spread the news that viney had changed her name from raymond to allen shes mis viney allen if you please was her comment great was the indignation among the older heads whose fathers and mothers and grandfathers before them had been raymonds the younger element was greatly amused and took no end of pleasure in repeating the new name or addressing each other by fantastic cognomens vineys popularity did not increase some rumors of this state of things drifted to bens ears and he questioned his wife about them she admitted what she had done but viney said ben raymonds good enough name fu me don you see ben she answered dat i don belong to de raymonds no mo so i ain viney raymond ain you goin change wen you git free i don know i talk about dat when is free and freedoms a mighty long weary way off yet evahbody dats free has dey own name an i ain nevah goin feel frees long ez is atotin aroun de raymonds name well change den said ben but wait ontwell i kin change wid you viney tossed her head and that night she took out her free papers and studied them long and carefully she was incensed at her friends that they would not pay her the homage that she felt was due her she was incensed at ben because he would not enter into her feelings about the matter she brooded upon her fancied injuries and when a chance for revenge came she seized upon it eagerly there were two or three free negro families in the vicinity of the raymond place but there had been no intercourse between them and the neighboring slaves it was to these people that viney now turned in anger against her own friends it first amounted to a few visits back and forth and then either because the association became more intimate or because she was instigated to it by her new companions she refused to have anything more to do with the raymond servants boldly and without concealment she shut the door in mandys face and hearing this few of the others gave her a similar chance ben remonstrated with her and she answered him no suh i ain goin sociate wid slaves is free but you cuttin out yo own husban dats diffent is jined to my husban and then petulantly i do wish youd huy up an git yo free papahs ben deyll be a long time acomin he said yeahs fom now mebbe id abettah got mine fust she looked up at him with a quick suspicious glance when she was alone again she took her papers and carefully hid them is free she whispered to herself an i don expec to nevah be a slave no mo she was further excited by the moving north of one of the free families with which she had been associated the emigrants had painted glowing pictures of the eldorado to which they were going and now vineys only talk in the evening was of the glories of the north ben would listen to her unmoved until one night she said you ought to go north when you gits yo papahs then he had answered her with kindling eyes no i wont go nawth i was bon an raised in de souf an in de souf i stay ontwell i die ef i have to go nawth to injoy my freedom i wont have it ill quit wokin fu it ben was positive but he felt uneasy and the next day he told his master of the whole matter and mr raymond went down to talk to viney she met him with a determination that surprised and angered him to everything he said to her she made but one answer is got my free papahs an is agoin nawth finally her former master left her with the remark well i dont care where you go but im sorry for ben he was a fool for working for you you dont half deserve such a man i won have him long she flung after him with a laugh the opposition with which she had met seemed to have made her more obstinate and in spite of all ben could do she began to make preparations to leave him the money for the chickens and eggs had been growing and was to have gone toward her husbands ransom but she finally sold all her laying hens to increase the amount then she calmly announced to her husband is got money enough an is agoin nawth next week you kin stay down hyeah an be a slave ef you want to but is agoin nawth even ef i wanted to go nawth you know i ain half paid out yit well i cant hep it i cant spen all de bes pat o my life down hyeah where dey ain no vantages i reckon deys vantages everywhah fu anybody dat wants to wuk yes but what kin o wages does yo git why de johnsons say dey had a lettah fom miss smiff an deys gettin long fine in de nawth de johnsons ain gwine si johnson is then the woman stopped suddenly oh hits si johnson huh he ain goin wid me hes jes goin to see dat i git stated right aftah i git thaih hits si johnson he repeated taint said the woman hits freedom ben got up and went out of the cabin mens so spicious she said i ain goin nawth cause sis agoin i aint when mr raymond found out how matters were really going he went to ben where he was at work in the field now look here ben he said youre one of the best hands on my place and id be sorry to lose you i never did believe in this buying business from the first but you were so bent on it that i gave in but before ill see her cheat you out of your money ill give you your free papers now you can go north with her and you can pay me back when you find work no replied ben doggedly ef she caint wait fu me she don want me an i wont roller her erroun an be in de way youre a fool said his master i loves huh said the slave and so this plan came to naught then came the night on which viney was getting together her belongings ben sat in a corner of the cabin silent his head bowed in his hands every once in a while the woman cast a halffrightened glance at him he had never once tried to oppose her with force though she saw that grief had worn lines into his face the door opened and si johnson came in he had just dropped in to see if everything was all right he was not to go for a week let me look at yo free papahs he said for si could read and liked to show off his accomplishment at every opportunity he stumbled through the formal document to the end reading at the last this is a present from ben to his beloved wife viney she held out her hand for the paper when si was gone she sat gazing at it trying in her ignorance to pick from the to her senseless scrawl those last words ben had not raised his head still she sat there thinking and without looking her mind began to take in the details of the cabin that box of shelves there in the corner ben had made in the first days they were together yes and this chair on which she was sitting she remembered how they had laughed over its funny shape before he had padded it with cotton and covered it with the piece of linsey old mis had given him the very chest in which her things were packed he had made and when the last nail was driven he had called it her trunk and said she should put her finery in it when she went traveling like the white folks she was going traveling now and ben ben there he sat across from her in his chair bowed and broken his great shoulders heaving with suppressed grief then before she knew it viney was sobbing and had crept close to him and put her arms around his neck he threw out his arms with a convulsive gesture and gathered her up to his breast and the tears gushed from his eyes when the first storm of weeping had passed viney rose and went to the fireplace she raked forward the coals ben she said hits been dese pleggoned free papahs i want you to see em bun no no he said but the papers were already curling and in a moment they were in a blaze thaih she said thaih now viney raymond ben gave a great gasp then sprang forward and took her in his arms and kicked the packed chest into the corner and that night singing was heard from bens cabin and the sound of the banjo the fruitful sleeping of the rev elisha edwards there was great commotion in zion church a body of christian worshippers usually noted for their harmony but for the last six months trouble had been brewing between the congregation and the pastor the rev elisha edwards had come to them two years before and he had given good satisfaction as to preaching and pastoral work only one thing had displeased his congregation in him and that was his tendency to moments of meditative abstraction in the pulpit however much fire he might have displayed before a brother minister arose to speak and however much he might display in the exhortation after the brother was done with the labors of hurling phillipics against the devil he sat between in the same way with head bowed and eyes closed there were some who held that it was a sign in him of deep thoughtfulness and that he was using these moments for silent prayer and meditation but others less generous said that he was either jealous of or indifferent to other speakers so the discussion rolled on about the rev elisha but it did not reach him and he went on in the same way until one hapless day one tragic one nevertobeforgotten day while uncle isham dyer was exhorting the people to repent of their sins the disclosure came the old man had arisen on the wings of his eloquence and was painting hell for the sinners in the most terrible colors when to the utter surprise of the whole congregation a loud and penetrating snore broke from the throat of the pastor of the church it rumbled down the silence and startled the congregation into sudden and indignant life like the surprising cannon of an invading host horrorstricken eyes looked into each other hands were thrown into the air and heavy lips made round os of surprise and anger this was his meditation the rev elisha edwards was asleep uncle isham dyer turned around and looked down on his pastor in disgust and then turned again to his exhortations but he was disconcerted and soon ended lamely illustration uncle isham dyer exhorts as for the rev elisha himself his snore rumbled on through the church his head drooped lower until with a jerk he awakened himself he sighed religiously patted his foot upon the floor rubbed his hands together and looked complacently over the aggrieved congregation old ladies moaned and old men shivered but the pastor did not know what they had discovered and shouted amen because he thought something uncle isham had said was affecting them then when he arose to put the cap sheaf on his local brothers exhortations he was strong fiery eloquent but it was of no use not a cry not a moan not an amen could he gain from his congregation only the local preacher himself thinking over the scene which had just been enacted raised his voice placed his hands before his eyes and murmured lord hep we po sinnahs brother edwards could not understand this unresponsiveness on the part of his people they had been wont to weave and moan and shout and sigh when he spoke to them and when in the midst of his sermon he paused to break into spirited song they would join with him until the church rang again but this day he sang alone and ominous glances were flashed from pew to pew and from aisle to pulpit the collection that morning was especially small no one asked the minister home to dinner an unusual thing and so he went his way puzzled and wondering before church that night the congregation met together for conference the exhorter of the morning himself opened proceedings by saying brothahs an sistahs de lawd has opened ouah eyes to wickedness in high places oom oom oom he have opened ouah eyes moaned an old sister we have been puhmitted to see de man who was intrusted wid de guidance of dis flock asleepin in de houah of duty an we feels grieved ternight he sholy were asleep sister hannah johnson broke in dey aint no way to spute dat dat man sholy were asleep i kin testify to it said another sister i pintly did hyeah him sno an i hyeahed him snot wen he waked up an we been givin him praise fu meditation pursued brother isham dyer who was only a local preacher in fact but who had designs on ordination and the pastoring of zion church himself it aint de sleepin itsef he went on ef you member in de gyarden of gethsemane endurin de agony of ouah lawd dem what he tuk wid him fu to watch while he prayed went to sleep on his hans but he fugive em fu he said de sperit is willin but de flesh is weak we know dat dey is times wen de eyes grow sandy an de haid grow heavy an we aint accusin ouah brothah nor ablamin him fu noddin but what we do blame him fu is fu ceivin us an mekin us believe he was prayin an meditatin wen he wasn doin a blessed thing but snoozin dats it dats it broke in a chorus of voices he ceived us dats what he did the meeting went stormily on the accusation and the anger of the people against the minister growing more and more one or two were for dismissing him then and there but calmer counsel prevailed and it was decided to give him another trial he was a good preacher they had to admit he had visited them when they were sick and brought sympathy to their afflictions and a genial presence when they were well they would not throw him over without one more chance at least of vindicating himself this was well for the rev elisha for with the knowledge that he was to be given another chance one trembling little woman who had listened in silence and fear to the tirades against him crept out of the church and hastened over in the direction of the parsonage she met the preacher coming toward the church hymnbook in hand and his bible under his arm with a gasp she caught him by the arm and turned him back come hyeah she said come hyeah dey been talkin bout you an i want to tell you why sis dicey said the minister complacently what is the mattah is you troubled in sperit is troubled in sperit now she answered but youll be troubled in a minute dey done had a church meetin befo services dey foun out you was sleepin dis mornin in de pulpit you aint only snoed but you snoted an dey lowin to give you one mo trial an ef you falls fom grace agin dey gwine ax you fu to sign fom de pastorship the minister staggered under the blow and his brow wrinkled to leave zion church it would be very hard and to leave there in disgrace where would he go his career would be ruined the story would go to every church of the connection in the country and he would be an outcast from his cloth and his kind he felt that it was all a mistake after all he loved his work and he loved his people he wanted to do the right thing but oh sometimes the chapel was hot and the hours were long then his head would grow heavy and his eyes would close but it had been only for a minute or two then this morning he remembered how he had tried to shake himself awake how gradually the feeling had overcome him then then he had snored he had not tried wantonly to deceive them but the book said let not thy right hand know what thy left hand doeth he did not think it necessary to tell them that he dropped into an occasional nap in church now however they knew all he turned and looked down at the little woman who waited to hear what he had to say thankye maam sis dicey he said thankye maam i believe ill go back an pray ovah this subject and he turned and went back into the parsonage whether he had prayed over it or whether he had merely thought over it and made his plans accordingly when the rev elisha came into church that night he walked with a new spirit there was a smile on his lips and the light of triumph in his eyes throughout the deacons long prayer his loud and insistent amens precluded the possibility of any sleep on his part his sermon was a masterpiece of fiery eloquence and as sister green stepped out of the church door that night she said well ef brothah eddards slep dis mornin he sholy prached a wakenin up sermon ternight the congregation hardly remembered that their pastor had ever been asleep but the pastor knew when the first flush of enthusiasm was over that their minds would revert to the crime of the morning and he made plans accordingly for the next sunday which should again vindicate him in the eyes of his congregation the sunday came round and as he ascended to the pulpit their eyes were fastened upon him with suspicious glances uncle isham dyer had a smile of triumph on his face because the day was a particularly hot and drowsy one it was on this account the old man thought that the rev elisha asked him to say a few words at the opening of the meeting shirkin again said the old man to himself i reckon he wants to go to sleep again but ef he dont sleep dis day to his own confusion i aint hyeah so he arose and burst into a wonderful exhortation on the merits of a christian life he had scarcely been talking for five minutes when the ever watchful congregation saw the pastors head droop and his eyes close for the next fifteen minutes little or no attention was paid to brother dyers exhortation the angry people were nudging each other whispering and casting indignant glances at the sleeping pastor he awoke and sat up just as the exhorter was finishing in a fiery period if those who watched him were expecting to see any embarrassed look on his face or show of timidity in his eyes they were mistaken instead his appearance was one of sudden alertness and his gaze that of a man in extreme exaltation one would have said that it had been given to him as to the inspired prophets of old to see and to hear things far and beyond the ken of ordinary mortals as brother dyer sat down he arose quickly and went forward to the front of the pulpit with a firm step still with the look of exaltation on his face he announced his text ef he sleep he shell do well the congregation which a moment before had been all indignation suddenly sprang into the most alert attention there was a visible pricking up of ears as the preacher entered into his subject he spoke first of the benefits of sleep what it did for the worn human body and the weary human soul then turning off into a halfhumorous halfquizzical strain which was often in his sermons he spoke of how many times he had to forgive some of those who sat before him today for nodding in their pews then raising his voice like a good preacher he came back to his text exclaiming but ef he sleep he shell do well he went on then and told of jacobs sleep and how at night in the midst of his slumbers the visions of angels had come to him and he had left a testimony behind him that was still a solace to their hearts then he lowered his voice and said you all condemns a man when you sees him asleep not knowin what visions is agoin thoo his mind nor what feelins is agoin thoo his heart you aint considein that mebbe hes adoin mo in the soul wok when hes asleep then when hes awake mebbe he sleep wen you think he ought to be up awokin mebbe he slumber wen you think he ought to be up an erbout mebbe he sno an mebbe he snot but im ahyeah to tell you in de wods of the book that they aint no sputin ef he sleep he shell do well yes lawd amen sleep on edards some one shouted the church was in smiles of joy they were rocking to and fro with the ecstasy of the sermon but the rev elisha had not yet put on the cap sheaf hol on he said befo you shouts er befo you sanctions fu you may yet have to tun yo backs erpon me an say lawd hep the man is ahyeah to tell you that manys the time in this very pulpit right under yo very eyes i has gone fom meditation into slumber but what was the reason was i ashirkin er was i lazy shouts of no no from the congregation no no pursued the preacher i wasnt ashirkin ner i wasnt alazy but the soul within me was a wokin wid the min an as we all gwine ter do some day befo long early in de mornin i done fugit this ol body my haid fall on my breas my eyes close an i see visions of anothah day to come i see visions of a new heaven an a new earth when we shell all be clothed in white raimen an we shell play haps of gol an walk de golden streets of the new jerusalem thats what been a runnin thoo my min wen i set up in the pulpit an sleep under the wod but i want to ax you was i wrong i want to ax you was i sinnin i want to pint you right hyeah to the wod as it are read out in yo hyeahin terday ef he sleep he shell do well the rev elisha ended his sermon amid the smiles and nods and tears of his congregation no one had a harsh word for him now and even brother dyer wiped his eyes and whispered to his next neighbor dat man sholy did sleep to some pupose although he knew that the dictum was a deathblow to his own pastoral hopes the people thronged around the pastor as he descended from the pulpit and held his hand as they had done of yore one old woman went out still mumbling under her breath sleep on edards sleep on there were no more church meetings after that and no tendency to dismiss the pastor on the contrary they gave him a donation party next week at which sister dicey helped him to receive his guests the ingrate i mr leckler was a man of high principle indeed he himself had admitted it at times to mrs leckler she was often called into counsel with him he was one of those large souled creatures with a hunger for unlimited advice upon which he never acted mrs leckler knew this but like the good patient little wife that she was she went on paying her poor tribute of advice and admiration today her husbands mind was particularly troubled as usual too over a matter of principle mrs leckler came at his call mrs leckler he said i am troubled in my mind i in fact i am puzzled over a matter that involves either the maintaining or relinquishing of a principle well mr leckler said his wife interrogatively if i had been a scheming calculating yankee i should have been rich now but all my life i have been too generous and confiding i have always let principle stand between me and my interests mr leckler took himself all too seriously to be conscious of his pun and went on now this is a matter in which my duty and my principles seem to conflict it stands thus josh has been doing a piece of plastering for mr eckley over in lexington and from what he says i think that city rascal has misrepresented the amount of work to me and so cut down the pay for it now of course i should not care the matter of a dollar or two being nothing to me but it is a very different matter when we consider poor josh there was deep pathos in mr lecklers tone you know josh is anxious to buy his freedom and i allow him a part of whatever he makes so you see its he thats affected every dollar that he is cheated out of cuts off just so much from his earnings and puts further away his hope of emancipation if the thought occurred to mrs leckler that since josh received only about onetenth of what he earned the advantage of just wages would be quite as much her husbands as the slaves she did not betray it but met the naпve reasoning with the question but where does the conflict come in mr leckler just here if josh knew how to read and write and cipher mr leckler are you crazy listen to me my dear and give me the benefit of your judgment this is a very momentous question as i was about to say if josh knew these things he could protect himself from cheating when his work is at too great a distance for me to look after it for him but teaching a slave yes thats just what is against my principles i know how public opinion and the law look at it but my conscience rises up in rebellion every time i think of that poor black man being cheated out of his earnings really mrs leckler i think i may trust to joshs discretion and secretly give him such instructions as will permit him to protect himself well of course its just as you think best said his wife i knew you would agree with me he returned its such a comfort to take counsel with you my dear and the generous man walked out on to the veranda very well satisfied with himself and his wife and prospectively pleased with josh once he murmured to himself ill lay for eckley next time josh the subject of mr lecklers charitable solicitations was the plantation plasterer his master had given him his trade in order that he might do whatever such work was needed about the place but he became so proficient in his duties having also no competition among the poor whites that he had grown to be in great demand in the country thereabout so mr leckler found it profitable instead of letting him do chores and field work in his idle time to hire him out to neighboring farms and planters josh was a man of more than ordinary intelligence and when he asked to be allowed to pay for himself by working overtime his master readily agreed for it promised more work to be done for which he could allow the slave just what he pleased of course he knew now that when the black man began to cipher this state of affairs would be changed but it would mean such an increase of profit from the outside that he could afford to give up his own little peculations anyway it would be many years before the slave could pay the two thousand dollars which price he had set upon him should he approach that figure mr leckler felt it just possible that the market in slaves would take a sudden rise when josh was told of his masters intention his eyes gleamed with pleasure and he went to his work with the zest of long hunger he proved a remarkably apt pupil he was indefatigable in doing the tasks assigned him even mr leckler who had great faith in his plasterers ability marveled at the speed which he had acquired the three rs he did not know that on one of his many trips a free negro had given josh the rudimentary tools of learning and that since the slave had been adding to his store of learning by poring over signs and every bit of print that he could spell out neither was josh so indiscreet as to intimate to his benefactor that he had been anticipated in his good intentions it was in this way working and learning that a year passed away and mr leckler thought that his object had been accomplished he could safely trust josh to protect his own interests and so he thought that it was quite time that his servants education should cease you know josh he said i have already gone against my principles and against the law for your sake and of course a man cant stretch his conscience too far even to help another whos being cheated but i reckon you can take care of yourself now oh yes suh i reckon i kin said josh and it wouldnt do for you to be seen with any books about you now oh no suh sutny not he didnt intend to be seen with any books about him it was just now that mr leckler saw the good results of all he had done and his heart was full of a great joy for eckley had been building some additions to his house and sent for josh to do the plastering for him the owner admonished his slave took him over a few examples to freshen his memory and sent him forth with glee when the job was done there was a discrepancy of two dollars in what mr eckley offered for it and the price which accrued from joshs measurements to the employers surprise the black man went over the figures with him and convinced him of the incorrectness of the payment and the additional two dollars were turned over some o lecklers work said eckley teaching a nigger to cipher closefisted old reprobate ive a mind to have the law on him mr leckler heard the story with great glee i laid for him that time the old fox but to mrs leckler he said you see my dear wife my rashness in teaching josh to figure for himself is vindicated see what he has saved for himself what did he save asked the little woman indiscreetly her husband blushed and stammered for a moment and then replied well of course it was only twenty cents saved to him but to a man buying his freedom every cent counts and after all it is not the amount mrs leckler its the principle of the thing yes said the lady meekly ii unto the body it is easy for the master to say thus far shalt thou go and no farther gyves chains and fetters will enforce that command but what master shall say unto the mind here do i set the limit of your acquisition pass it not who shall put gyves upon the intellect or fetter the movement of thought joshua leckler as custom denominated him had tasted of the forbidden fruit and his appetite had grown by what it fed on night after night he crouched in his lonely cabin by the blaze of a fat pine brand poring over the few books that he had been able to secure and smuggle in his fellowservants alternately laughed at him and wondered why he did not take a wife but joshua went on his way he had no time for marrying or for love other thoughts had taken possession of him he was being swayed by ambitions other than the mere fathering of slaves for his master to him his slavery was deep night what wonder then that he should dream and that through the ivory gate should come to him the forbidden vision of freedom to own himself to be master of his hands feet of his whole body something would clutch at his heart as he thought of it and the breath would come hard between his lips but he met his master with an impassive face always silent always docile and mr leckler congratulated himself that so valuable and intelligent a slave should be at the same time so tractable usually intelligence in a slave meant discontent but not so with josh who more content than he he remarked to his wife you see my dear this is what comes of treating even a nigger right meanwhile the white hills of the north were beckoning to the chattel and the north winds were whispering to him to be a chattel no longer often the eyes that looked away to where freedom lay were filled with a wistful longing that was tragic in its intensity for they saw the hardships and the difficulties between the slave and his goal and worst of all an iniquitous law libertys compromise with bondage that rose like a stone wall between him and hope a law that degraded every freethinking man to the level of a slavecatcher there it loomed up before him formidable impregnable insurmountable he measured it in all its terribleness and paused but on the other side there was liberty and one day when he was away at work a voice came out of the woods and whispered to him courage and on that night the shadows beckoned him as the white hills had done and the forest called to him follow it seems to me that josh might have been able to get home tonight said mr leckler walking up and down his veranda but i reckon its just possible that he got through too late to catch a train in the morning he said well hes not here yet he must have had to do some extra work if he doesnt get here by evening ill run up there in the evening he did take the train for joshuas place of employment where he learned that his slave had left the night before but where could he have gone that no one knew and for the first time it dawned upon his master that josh had run away he raged he fumed but nothing could be done until morning and all the time leckler knew that the most valuable slave on his plantation was working his way toward the north and freedom he did not go back home but paced the floor all night long in the early dawn he hurried out and the hounds were put on the fugitives track after some nosing around they set off toward a stretch of woods in a few minutes they came yelping back pawing their noses and rubbing their heads against the ground they had found the trail but josh had played the old slave trick of filling his tracks with cayenne pepper the dogs were soothed and taken deeper into the wood to find the trail they soon took it up again and dashed away with low bays the scent led them directly to a little wayside station about six miles distant here it stopped burning with the chase mr leckler hastened to the station agent had he seen such a negro yes he had taken the northbound train two nights before but why did you let him go without a pass almost screamed the owner i didnt replied the agent he had a written pass signed james leckler and i let him go on it forged forged yelled the master he wrote it himself humph said the agent how was i to know that our niggers round here dont know how to write mr leckler suddenly bethought him to hold his peace josh was probably now in the arms of some northern abolitionist and there was nothing to be done now but advertise and the disgusted master spread his notices broadcast before starting for home as soon as he arrived at his house he sought his wife and poured out his griefs to her you see mrs leckler this is what comes of my goodness of heart i taught that nigger to read and write so that he could protect himself and look how he uses his knowledge oh the ingrate the ingrate the very weapon which i give him to defend himself against others he turns upon me oh its awful awful ive always been too confiding heres the most valuable nigger on my plantation gone gone i tell you and through my own kindness it isnt his value though im thinking so much about i could stand his loss if it wasnt for the principle of the thing the base ingratitude he has shown me oh if i ever lay hands on him again mr leckler closed his lips and clenched his fist with an eloquence that laughed at words just at this time in one of the underground railway stations six miles north of the ohio an old quaker was saying to josh lie still theell be perfectly safe there here comes john trader our local slave catcher but i will parley with him and send him away thee need not fear none of thy brethren who have come to us have ever been taken back to bondage goodevening friend trader and josh heard the old quakers smooth voice roll on while he lay back half smothering in a bag among other bags of corn and potatoes it was after ten oclock that night when he was thrown carelessly into a wagon and driven away to the next station twentyfive miles to the northward and by such stages hiding by day and traveling by night helped by a few of his own people who were blessed with freedom and always by the good quakers wherever found he made his way into canada and on one nevertobeforgotten morning he stood up straightened himself breathed gods blessed air and knew himself free iii to joshua leckler this life in canada was all new and strange it was a new thing for him to feel himself a man and to have his manhood recognized by the whites with whom he came into free contact it was new too this receiving the full measure of his worth in work he went to his labor with a zest that he had never known before and he took a pleasure in the very weariness it brought him ever and anon there came to his ears the cries of his brethren in the south frequently he met fugitives who like himself had escaped from bondage and the harrowing tales that they told him made him burn to do something for those whom he had left behind him but these fugitives and the papers he read told him other things they said that the spirit of freedom was working in the united states and already men were speaking out boldly in behalf of the manumission of the slaves already there was a growing army behind that noble vanguard sumner phillips douglass garrison he heard the names of lucretia mott and harriet beecher stowe and his heart swelled for on the dim horizon he saw the first faint streaks of dawn so the years passed then from the surcharged clouds a flash of lightning broke and there was the thunder of cannon and the rain of lead over the land from his home in the north he watched the storm as it raged and wavered now threatening the north with its awful power now hanging dire and dreadful over the south then suddenly from out the fray came a voice like the trumpet tone of god to him thou and thy brothers are free free free with the freedom not cherished by the few alone but for all that had been bound free with the freedom not torn from the secret night but open to the light of heaven when the first call for colored soldiers came joshua leckler hastened down to boston and enrolled himself among those who were willing to fight to maintain their freedom on account of his ability to read and write and his general intelligence he was soon made an orderly sergeant his regiment had already taken part in an engagement before the public roster of this band of uncle sams niggers as they were called fell into mr lecklers hands he ran his eye down the column of names it stopped at that of joshua leckler sergeant company f he handed the paper to mrs leckler with his finger on the place mrs leckler he said this is nothing less than a judgment on me for teaching a nigger to read and write i disobeyed the law of my state and as a result not only lost my nigger but furnished the yankees with a smart officer to help them fight the south mrs leckler i have sinned and been punished but i am content mrs leckler it all came through my kindness of heart and your mistaken advice but oh that ingrate that ingrate the case of caline a kitchen monologue the man of the house is about to go into the diningroom when he hears voices that tell him that his wife has gone down to give the hired help a

rustle of his wifes skirts as she beats a retreat and he goes upstairs and into the library whistling see the conquering hero comes the finish of patsy barnes his name was patsy barnes and he was a denizen of little africa in fact he lived on douglass street by all the laws governing the relations between people and their names he should have been irish but he was not he was colored and very much so that was the reason he lived on douglass street the negro has very strong within him the instinct of colonization and it was in accordance with this that patsys mother had found her way to little africa when she had come north from kentucky patsy was incorrigible even into the confines of little africa had penetrated the truant officer and the terrible penalty of the compulsory education law time and time again had poor eliza barnes been brought up on account of the shortcomings of that son of hers she was a hardworking honest woman and day by day bent over her tub scrubbing away to keep patsy in shoes and jackets that would wear out so much faster than they could be bought but she never murmured for she loved the boy with a deep affection though his misdeeds were a sore thorn in her side she wanted him to go to school she wanted him to learn she had the notion that he might become something better something higher than she had been but for him school had no charms his school was the cool stalls in the big livery stable near at hand the arena of his pursuits its sawdust floor the height of his ambition to be a horseman either here or in the racing stables at the fairgrounds he spent his truant hours it was a school that taught much and patsy was as apt a pupil as he was a constant attendant he learned strange things about horses and fine sonorous oaths that sounded eerie on his young lips for he had only turned into his fourteenth year a man goes where he is appreciated then could this slim black boy be blamed for doing the same thing he was a great favorite with the horsemen and picked up many a dime or nickel for dancing or singing or even a quarter for warming up a horse for its owner he was not to be blamed for this for first of all he was born in kentucky and had spent the very days of his infancy about the paddocks near lexington where his father had sacrificed his life on account of his love for horses the little fellow had shed no tears when he looked at his fathers bleeding body bruised and broken by the fiery young twoyearold he was trying to subdue patsy did not sob or whimper though his heart ached for over all the feeling of his grief was a mad burning desire to ride that horse his tears were shed however when actuated by the idea that times would be easier up north they moved to dalesford then when he learned that he must leave his old friends the horses and their masters whom he had known he wept the comparatively meagre appointments of the fairgrounds at dalesford proved a poor compensation for all these for the first few weeks patsy had dreams of running away back to kentucky and the horses and stables then after a while he settled himself with heroic resolution to make the best of what he had and with a mighty effort took up the burden of life away from his beloved home eliza barnes older and more experienced though she was took up her burden with a less cheerful philosophy than her son she worked hard and made a scanty livelihood it is true but she did not make the best of what she had her complainings were loud in the land and her wailings for her old home smote the ears of any who would listen to her they had been living in dalesford for a year nearly when hard work and exposure brought the woman down to bed with pneumonia they were very poor too poor even to call in a doctor so there was nothing to do but to call in the city physician now this medical man had too frequent calls into little africa and he did not like to go there so he was very gruff when any of its denizens called him and it was even said that he was careless of his patients patsys heart bled as he heard the doctor talking to his mother now there cant be any foolishness about this he said youve got to stay in bed and not get yourself damp how long you think i got to lay hyeah doctah she asked im a doctor not a fortuneteller was the reply youll lie there as long as the disease holds you but i cant lay hyeah long doctah case i aint got nuffin to go on well take your choice the bed or the boneyard eliza began to cry you neednt sniffle said the doctor i dont see what you people want to come up here for anyhow why dont you stay down south where you belong you come up here and youre just a burden and a trouble to the city the south deals with all of you better both in poverty and crime he knew that these people did not understand him but he wanted an outlet for the heat within him there was another angry being in the room and that was patsy his eyes were full of tears that scorched him and would not fall the memory of many beautiful and appropriate oaths came to him but he dared not let his mother hear him swear oh to have a stone to be across the street from that man when the physician walked out patsy went to the bed took his mothers hand and bent over shamefacedly to kiss her he did not know that with that act the recording angel blotted out many a curious damn of his the little mark of affection comforted eliza unspeakably the motherfeeling overwhelmed her in one burst of tears then she dried her eyes and smiled at him honey she said mammy ain gwine lay hyeah long she be all right putty soon nevah you min said patsy with a choke in his voice i can do somepn an well have anothah doctah la listen at de chile what kin you do im goin down to mccarthys stable and see if i kin git some horses to exercise a sad look came into elizas eyes as she said youd bettah not go patsy dem hossesll kill you yit des lak dey did yo pappy but the boy used to doing pretty much as he pleased was obdurate and even while she was talking put on his ragged jacket and left the room patsy was not wise enough to be diplomatic he went right to the point with mccarthy the liveryman the big redfaced fellow slapped him until he spun round and round then he said ye little devil ye ive a mind to knock the whole head off o ye ye want harses to exercise do ye well git on that un an see what ye kin do with him the boys honest desire to be helpful had tickled the big generous irishmans peculiar sense of humor and from now on instead of giving patsy a horse to ride now and then as he had formerly done he put into his charge all the animals that needed exercise it was with a kings pride that patsy marched home with his first considerable earnings they were small yet and would go for food rather than a doctor but eliza was inordinately proud and it was this pride that gave her strength and the desire of life to carry her through the days approaching the crisis of her disease as patsy saw his mother growing worse saw her gasping for breath heard the rattling as she drew in the little air that kept going her clogged lungs felt the heat of her burning hands and saw the pitiful appeal in her poor eyes he became convinced that the city doctor was not helping her she must have another but the money that afternoon after his work with mccarthy found him at the fairgrounds the spring races were on and he thought he might get a job warming up the horse of some independent jockey he hung around the stables listening to the talk of men he knew and some he had never seen before among the latter was a tall lanky man holding forth to a group of men no suh he was saying to them generally im goin to withdraw my hoss because thaih aint nobody to ride him as he ought to be rode i havent brought a jockey along with me so ive got to depend on pickups now the talents set agin my hoss black boy because hes been losin regular but that hoss has lost for the want of ridin thats all the crowd looked in at the slimlegged rawboned horse and walked away laughing the fools muttered the stranger if i could ride myself id show em patsy was gazing into the stall at the horse what are you doing thaih called the owner to him look hyeah mistah said patsy aint that a bluegrass hoss of cose it is an one o the fastest that evah grazed ill ride that hoss mistah what do you know bout ridin i used to ginally be roun mistah boones paddock in lexington an aroun boones paddock what look here little nigger if you can ride that hoss to a winnin ill give you more money than you ever seen before ill ride him patsys heart was beating very wildly beneath his jacket that horse he knew that glossy coat he knew that rawboned frame and those flashing nostrils that black horse there owed something to the orphan he had made the horse was to ride in the race before the last somehow out of odds and ends his owner scraped together a suit and colors for patsy the colors were maroon and green a curious combination but then it was a curious horse a curious rider and a more curious combination that brought the two together long before the time for the race patsy went into the stall to become better acquainted with his horse the animal turned its wild eyes upon him and neighed he patted the long slender head and grinned as the horse stepped aside as gently as a lady he sholy is full o ginger he said to the owner whose name he had found to be brackett hell show em a thing or two laughed brackett his dam was a fast one said patsy unconsciously brackett whirled on him in a flash what do you know about his dam he asked the boy would have retracted but it was too late stammeringly he told the story of his fathers death and the horses connection therewith well said brackett if you dont turn out a hoodoo youre a winner sure but ill be blessed if this dont sound like a story but ive heard that story before the man i got black boy from no matter how i got him youre too young to understand the ins and outs of poker told it to me when the bell sounded and patsy went out to warm up he felt as if he were riding on air some of the jockeys laughed at his getup but there was something in him or under him maybe that made him scorn their derision he saw a sea of faces about him then saw no more only a shining white track loomed ahead of him and a restless steed was cantering with him around the curve then the bell called him back to the stand they did not get away at first and back they trooped a second trial was a failure but at the third they were off in a line as straight as a chalkmark there were essex and firefly queen bess and mosquito galloping away side by side and black boy a neck ahead patsy knew the family reputation of his horse for endurance as well as fire and began riding the race from the first black boy came of blood that would not be passed and to this his rider trusted at the eighth the line was hardly broken but as the quarter was reached black boy had forged a length ahead and mosquito was at his flank then like a flash essex shot out ahead under whip and spur his jockey standing straight in the stirrups the crowd in the stand screamed but patsy smiled as he lay low over his horses neck he saw that essex had made her best spurt his only fear was for mosquito who hugged and hugged his flank they were nearing the threequarter post and he was tightening his grip on the black essex fell back his spurt was over the whip fell unheeded on his sides the spurs dug him in vain black boys breath touches the leaders ear they are neck and neck nose to nose the black stallion passes him another cheer from the stand and again patsy smiles as they turn into the stretch mosquito has gained a head the colored boy flashes one glance at the horse and rider who are so surely gaining upon him and his lips close in a grim line they are halfway down the stretch and mosquitos head is at the stallions neck for a single moment patsy thinks of the sick woman at home and what that race will mean to her and then his knees close against the horses sides with a firmer dig the spurs shoot deeper into the steaming flanks black boy shall win he must win the horse that has taken away his father shall give him back his mother the stallion leaps away like a flash and goes under the wire a length ahead then the band thundered and patsy was off his horse very warm and very happy following his mount to the stable there a little later brackett found him he rushed to him and flung his arms around him you little devil he cried you rode like you were kin to that hoss weve won weve won and he began sticking banknotes at the boy at first patsys eyes bulged and then he seized the money and got into his clothes goin out to spend it asked brackett im goin for a doctah fu my mother said patsy shes sick dont let me lose sight of you oh ill see you again so long said the boy an hour later he walked into his mothers room with a very big doctor the greatest the druggist could direct him to the doctor left his medicines and his orders but when patsy told his story it was elizas pride that started her on the road to recovery patsy did not tell his horses name one mans fortunes part i when bertram halliday left the institution which in the particular part of the middle west where he was born was called the state university he did not believe as young graduates are reputed to that he had conquered the world and had only to come into his kingdom he knew that the battle of life was in reality just beginning and with a common sense unusual to his twentythree years but born out of the exigencies of a nonetooeasy life he recognized that for him the battle would be harder than for his white comrades looking at his own position he saw himself the member of a race dragged from complacent savagery into the very heat and turmoil of a civilization for which it was in nowise prepared bowed beneath a yoke to which its shoulders were not fitted and then without warning thrust forth into a freedom as absurd as it was startling and overwhelming and yet he felt as most young men must feel an individual strength that would exempt him from the workings of the general law his outlook on life was calm and unfrightened because he knew the dangers that beset his way he feared them less he felt assured because with so clear an eye he saw the weak places in his armor which the world he was going to meet would attack and these he was prepared to strengthen was it not the fault of youth and selfconfessed weakness he thought to go into the world always thinking of it as a foe was not this great cosmopolis this dragon of a thousand talons kind as well as cruel had it not friends as well as enemies yes that was it the outlook of young men of colored young men in particular was all wrong they had gone at the world in the wrong spirit they had looked upon it as a terrible foeman and forced it to be one he would do it oh so differently he would take the world as a friend he would even take the old old world under his wing they sat in the room talking that night he and webb davis and charlie mclean it was the last night they were to be together in so close a relation the commencement was over they had their sheepskins they were pitched there on the bed very carelessly to be the important things they were the reward of four years digging in greek and mathematics they had stayed after the exercises of the day just where they had first stopped this was at mcleans rooms dismantled and topsyturvy with the business of packing the pipes were going and the talk kept pace old men smoke slowly and in great whiffs with long intervals of silence between their observations young men draw fast and say many and bright things for young men are wise while they are young now its just like this davis was saying to mclean here we are all three of us turned out into the world like a lot of little sparrows pitched out of the nest and what are we going to do of course its easy enough for you mclean but what are my grave friend with the nasty black briar and i your humble servant to do in what wilderness are we to pitch our tents and where is our manna coming from oh well the world owes us all a living said mclean hackneyed but true of course it does but every time a colored man goes around to collect the world throws up its hands and yells insolvent eh halliday halliday took his pipe from his mouth as if he were going to say something then he put it back without speaking and looked meditatively through the blue smoke im right davis went on to begin with we colored people havent any show here now if we could go to central or south america or some place like that but hang it all who wants to go thousands of miles away from home to earn a little bread and butter theres india and the young englishmen if i remember rightly said mclean oh yes thats all right with the cabots and drake and sir john franklin behind them their traditions their blood all that they know makes them willing to go where there aint no ten commandments and a man can raise a thirst but for me home if i can call it home well then stick it out thats easy enough to say mclean but ten to one youve got some snap picked out for you already now fess up aint you well of course im going in with my father i cant help that but ive got to be sure broke in davis you go in with your father well if all i had to do was to step right out of college into my fathers business with an assured salary however small i shouldnt be falling on my own neck and weeping tonight but thats just the trouble with us we havent got fathers before us or behind us if youd rather more luck to you youll be a father before or behind some one else youll be an ancestor its more profitable being a descendant i find a glow came into mcleans face and his eyes sparkled as he replied why man if i could id change places with you you dont deserve your fate what is before you hardships perhaps and long waiting but then you have the zest of the fight the joy of the action and the chance of conquering now what is before me me whom you are envying i go out of here into a dull countingroom the way is prepared for me perhaps i shall have no hardships but neither have i the joy that comes from pains endured perhaps i shall have no battle but even so i lose the pleasure of the fight and the glory of winning your fate is infinitely to be preferred to mine ah now you talk with the voluminous voice of the centuries bantered davis you are but echoing the breath of your nelsons your cabots your drakes and your franklins why cant you see you sentimental idiot that its all different and has to be different with us the anglosaxon race has been producing that fine frenzy in you for seven centuries and more you come with the blood of merchants pioneers and heroes in your veins to a normal battle but for me my forebears were savages two hundred years ago my people learn to know civilization by the lowest and most degrading contact with it and thus equipped or unequipped i tempt an abnormal contest cant you see the disproportion if i do i can also see the advantage of it for the sake of common sense halliday said davis turning to his companion dont sit there like a clam open up and say something to convince this don quixote who because he himself sees only windmills cannot be persuaded that we have real dragons to fight do you fellows know henley asked halliday with apparent irrelevance i know him as a critic said mclean i know him as a name echoed the worldly davis but i mean his poems resumed halliday he is the most virile of the presentday poets kipling is virile but he gives you the man in hot blood with the brute in him to the fore but the strong masculinity of henley is essentially intellectual it is the mind that is conquering always well now that you have settled the relative place in english letters of kipling and henley might i be allowed humbly to ask what in the name of all that is good has that to do with the question before the house i dont know your mans poetry said mclean but i do believe that i can see what you are driving at wonderful perspicacity oh youth if webb will agree not to run ill spring on you the poem that seems to me to strike the keynote of the matter in hand oh well curiosity will keep me i want to get your position and i want to see mclean annihilated in a low even tone but without attempt at dramatic effect halliday began to recite out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods there be for my unconquerable soul in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not winced nor cried aloud under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody but unbowed beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid it matters not how strait the gate how charged with punishments the scroll i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul thats it exclaimed mclean leaping to his feet thats what i mean thats the sort of a stand for a man to take davis rose and knocked the ashes from his pipe against the windowsill well for two poetryspouting poetryconsuming sentimental idiots commend me to you fellows master of my fate captain of my soul be dashed old jujube with his bonepointed hunting spear began determining a couple of hundred years ago what i should be in this year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and ninetyfour j webb davis senior added another brick to this structure when he was picking cotton on his masters plantation forty years ago and now said halliday also rising dont you think it fair that you should start out with the idea of adding a few bricks of your own and all of a better make than those of your remote ancestor jujube or that nearer one your father spoken like a man said mclean oh you two are so hopelessly young laughed davis part ii after the two weeks rest which he thought he needed and consequently promised himself halliday began to look about him for some means of making a start for that success in life which he felt so sure of winning with this end in view he returned to the town where he was born he had settled upon the law as a profession and had studied it for a year or two while at college he would go back to broughton now to pursue his studies but of course he needed money no difficulty however presented itself in the getting of this for he knew several fellows who had been able to go into offices and by collecting and similar duties make something while they studied webb davis would have said but they were white but halliday knew what his own reply would have been what a white man can do i can do even if he could not go to studying at once he could go to work and save enough money to go on with his course in a year or two he had lots of time before him and he only needed a little start what better place then to go to than broughton where he had first seen the light broughton that had known him boy and man broughton that had watched him through the common school and the high school and had seen him go off to college with some pride and a good deal of curiosity for even in middle west towns of such a size that is between seventy and eighty thousand souls a smart negro was still a freak so halliday went back home because the people knew him there and would respect his struggles and encourage his ambitions he had been home two days and the old town had begun to take on its remembered aspect as he wandered through the streets and along the river banks on this second day he was going up main street deep in a brown study when he heard his name called by a young man who was approaching him and saw an outstretched hand why how de do bert how are you glad to see you back i hear you have been astonishing them up at college hallidays reverie had been so suddenly broken into that for a moment the young fellows identity wavered elusively before his mind and then it materialized and his consciousness took hold of it he remembered him not as an intimate but as an acquaintance whom he had often met upon the football and baseball fields how do you do its bob dickson he said shaking the proffered hand which at the mention of the name had grown unaccountably cold in his grasp yes im mr dickson said the young man patronizingly you seem to have developed wonderfully you hardly seem like the same bert halliday i used to know yes but im the same mr halliday oh ah yes said the young man well im glad to have seen you ah goodbye bert goodbye bob presumptuous darky murmured mr dickson insolent puppy said mr halliday to himself but the incident made no impression on his mind as bearing upon his status in the public eye he only thought the fellow a cad and went hopefully on he was rather amused than otherwise in this frame of mind he turned into one of the large officebuildings that lined the street and made his way to a business suite over whose door was the inscription hg featherton counsellor and attorneyatlaw mr featherton had shown considerable interest in bert in his school days and he hoped much from him as he entered the public office a man sitting at the large desk in the centre of the room turned and faced him he was a fair man of an indeterminate age for you could not tell whether those were streaks of grey shining in his light hair or only the glint which it took on in the sun his face was dry lean and intellectual he smiled now and then and his smile was like a flash of winter lightning so cold and quick it was it went as suddenly as it came leaving the face as marbly cold and impassive as ever he rose and extended his hand why why ah bert how de do how are you very well i thank you mr featherton hum im glad to see you back sit down going to stay with us you think im not sure mr featherton it all depends upon my getting something to do you want to go to work do you hum well thats right its work makes the man what do you propose to do now since youve graduated bert warmed at the evident interest of his old friend well in the first place mr featherton he replied i must get to work and make some money i have heard of fellows studying and supporting themselves at the same time but i musnt expect too much im going to study law the attorney had schooled his face into hiding any emotion he might feel and it did not betray him now he only flashed one of his quick cold smiles and asked dont you think youve taken rather a hard profession to get on in no doubt but anything i should take would be hard its just like this mr featherton he went on i am willing to work and to work hard and i am not looking for any snap mr featherton was so unresponsive to this outburst that bert was ashamed of it the minute it left his lips he wished this man would not be so cold and polite and he wished he would stop putting the ends of his white fingers together as carefully as if something depended upon it i say the law is a hard profession to get on in and as a friend i say that it will be harder for you your people have not the money to spend in litigation of any kind i should not cater for the patronage of my own people alone yes but the time has not come when a white person will employ a colored attorney do you mean to say that the prejudice here at home is such that if i were as competent as a white lawyer a white person would not employ me i say nothing about prejudice at all its nature they have their own lawyers why should they go outside of their own to employ a colored man but i am of their own i am an american citizen there should be no thought of color about it oh my boy that theory is very nice but state university democracy doesnt obtain in real life mores the pity then for real life perhaps but we must take things as we find them not as we think they ought to be you people are having and will have for the next ten or a dozen years the hardest fight of your lives the sentiment of remorse and the desire for atoning which actuated so many white men to help negroes right after the war has passed off without being replaced by that sense of plain justice which gives a black man his due not because of nor in spite of but without consideration of his color i wonder if it can be true as my friend davis says that a colored man must do twice as much and twice as well as a white man before he can hope for even equal chances with him that white mediocrity demands black genius to cope with it i am afraid your friend has philosophized the situation about right well we have dealt in generalities said bert smiling let us take up the particular and personal part of this matter is there any way you could help me to a situation well i should be glad to see you get on bert but as you see i have nothing in my office that you could do now if you dont mind beginning at the bottom thats just what i expected to do why i could speak to the headwaiter of the hotel where i stay hes a very nice colored man and i have some influence with him no doubt charlie could give you a place but thats a work i abhor yes but you must begin at the bottom you know all young men must to be sure but would you have recommended the same thing to your nephew on his leaving college ah ah thats different yes said halliday rising it is different theres a different bottom at which black and white young men should begin and by a logical sequence a different top to which they should aspire however mr featherton ill ask you to hold your offer in abeyance if i can find nothing else ill ask you to speak to the headwaiter goodmorning ill do so with pleasure said mr featherton and goodmorning as the young man went up the street an announcement card in the window of a publishing house caught his eye it was the announcement of the next sundays number in a series of addresses which the local business men were giving before the ymca it read how a christian young man can get on in the law an address by a christian lawyer hg featherton bert laughed i should like to hear that address he said i wonder if hell recommend them to his headwaiter no thats different all the addresses and all the books written on how to get on are written for white men we blacks must solve the question for ourselves he had lost some of the ardor with which he had started out but he was still full of hope he refused to accept mr feathertons point of view as general or final so he hailed a passing car that in the course of a half hour set him down at the door of the great factory which with its improvements its army of clerks and employees had built up one whole section of the town he felt especially hopeful in attacking this citadel because they were constantly advertising for clerks and their placards plainly stated that preference would be given to graduates of the local high school the owners were philanthropists in their way well what better chance could there be before him he had graduated there and stood well in his classes and besides he knew that a number of his classmates were holding good positions in the factory so his voice was cheerful as he asked to see mr stockard who had charge of the clerical department mr stockard was a fat wheezy young man with a reputation for humor based entirely upon his size and his rubicund face for he had really never said anything humorous in his life he came panting into the room now with a well what can i do for you i wanted to see you about a situation began halliday oh no no you dont want to see me broke in stockard you want to see the head janitor but i dont want to see the head janitor i want to see the head of the clerical department you want to see the head of the clerical department yes sir i see you are advertising for clerks with preference given to the high school boys well i am an old high school boy but have been away for a few years at college mr stockard opened his eyes to their widest extent and his jaw dropped evidently he had never come across such presumption before we have nothing for you he wheezed after awhile very well i should be glad to drop in again and see you said halliday moving to the door i hope you will remember me if anything opens mr stockard did not reply to this or to berts goodbye he stood in the middle of the floor and stared at the door through which the colored man had gone then he dropped into a chair with a gasp well im dumbed he said a doubt had begun to arise in bertram hallidays mind that turned him cold and then hot with a burning indignation he could try nothing more that morning it had brought him nothing but rebuffs he hastened home and threw himself down on the sofa to try and think out his situation do they still require of us bricks without straw i thought all that was over well i suspect that i will have to ask mr featherton to speak to his headwaiter in my behalf i wonder if the headwaiter will demand my diploma webb davis you were nearer right than i thought he spent the day in the house thinking and planning part iii halliday was not a man to be discouraged easily and for the next few weeks he kept up an unflagging search for work he found that there were more feathertons and stockards than he had ever looked to find everywhere that he turned his face anything but the most menial work was denied him he thought once of going away from broughton but would he find it any better anywhere else he asked himself he determined to stay and fight it out there for two reasons first because he held that it would be cowardice to run away and secondly because he felt that he was not fighting a local disease but was bringing the force of his life to bear upon a national evil broughton was as good a place to begin curative measures as elsewhere there was one refuge which was open to him and which he fought against with all his might for years now from as far back as he could remember the colored graduates had gone south to teach this course was now recommended to him indeed his own family quite approved of it and when he still stood out against the scheme people began to say that bertram halliday did not want work he wanted to be a gentleman but halliday knew that the south had plenty of material and year by year was raising and training her own teachers he knew that the time would come if it were not present when it would be impossible to go south to teach and he felt it to be essential that the north should be trained in a manner looking to the employment of her own negroes so he stayed but he was only human and when the tide of talk anent his indolence began to ebb and flow about him he availed himself of the only expedient that could arrest it when he went back to the great factory where he had seen and talked with mr stockard he went around to another door and this time asked for the head janitor this individual a genial irishman took stock of halliday at a glance but what do ye want to be doin sich wurruk for whin yeve been through school he asked i am doing the only thing i can get to do was the answer well said the irishman yeve got sinse anyhow bert found himself employed as an under janitor at the factory at a wage of nine dollars a week at this he could pay his share to keep the house going and save a little for the period of study he still looked forward to the people who had accused him of laziness now made a martyr of him and said what a pity it was for a man with such an education and with so much talent to be so employed menially he did not neglect his studies but read at night whenever the days work had not made both brain and body too weary for the task in this way his life went along for over a year when one morning a note from mr featherton summoned him to that gentlemans office it is true that halliday read the note with some trepidation his bitter experience had not yet taught him how not to dream he was not yet old enough for that maybe he thought mr featherton has relented and is going to give me a chance anyway or perhaps he wanted me to prove my metal before he consented to take me up well ive tried to do it and if thats what he wanted i hope hes satisfied the note which seemed written all over with joyful tidings shook in his hand the genial manner with which mr featherton met him reaffirmed in his mind the belief that at last the lawyer had determined to give him a chance he was almost deferential as he asked bert into his private office and shoved a chair forward for him well youve been getting on i see he began oh yes replied bert i have been getting on by hook and crook hum done any studying lately yes but not as much as i wish to coke and wharton arent any clearer to a head grown dizzy with bending over mops brooms and heavy trucks all day no i should think not ah oh well bert how should you like to come into my office and help around do such errands as i need and help copy my papers i should be delighted it would only pay you five dollars a week less than what you are getting now i suppose but it will be more genteel oh now that i have had to do it i dont care so much about the lack of gentility of my present work but i prefer what you offer because i shall have a greater chance to study well then you may as well come in on monday the office will be often in your charge as i am going to be away a great deal in the next few months you know i am going to make the fight for nomination to the seat on the bench which is vacant this fall indeed i have not so far taken much interest in politics but i will do all in my power to help you with both nomination and election thank you said mr featherton i am sure you can be of great service to me as the vote of your people is pretty heavy in broughton i have always been a friend to them and i believe i can depend upon their support i shall be glad of any good you can do me with them bert laughed when he was out on the street again for value received he said he thought less of mr feathertons generosity since he saw it was actuated by selfinterest alone but that in no wise destroyed the real worth of the opportunity that was now given into his hands featherton he believed would make an excellent judge and he was glad that in working for his nomination his convictions so aptly fell in with his inclinations his work at the factory had put him in touch with a larger number of his people than he could have possibly met had he gone into the office at once over them his naturally bright mind exerted some influence as a simple laborer he had fellowshipped with them but they acknowledged and availed themselves of his leadership because they felt instinctively in him a power which they did not have among them now he worked sedulously he held that the greater part of the battle would be in the primaries and on the night when they convened he had his friends out in force in every ward which went to make up the third judicial district men who had never seen the inside of a primary meeting before were there actively engaged in this the diurnal said next morning that the active interest of the hardworking churchgoing colored voters who wanted to see a christian judge on the bench had had much to do with the nomination of mr featherton the success at the primaries did not tempt halliday to relinquish his efforts on his employers behalf he was indefatigable in his cause on the west side where the colored population had largely colonized he made speeches and held meetings clear up to election day the fight had been between two factions of the party and after the nomination it was feared that the defection of the part defeated in the primaries might prevent the ratification of the nominee at the polls but before the contest was half over all fears for him were laid what he had lost in the districts where the skulking faction was strong he made up in the wards where the colored vote was large he was overwhelmingly elected halliday smiled as he sat in the office and heard the congratulations poured in upon judge featherton well its wonderful said one of his visitors how the colored boys stood by you yes i have been a friend to the colored people and they know it said featherton it would be some months before his honor would take his seat on the bench and during that time halliday hoped to finish his office course he was surprised when featherton came to him a couple of weeks after the election and said well bert i guess i can get along now ill be shutting up this office pretty soon here are your wages and here is a little gift i wish to add out of respect to you for your kindness during my run for office bert took the wages but the added ten dollar note he waved aside no i thank you mr featherton he said what i did i did from a belief in your fitness for the place and out of loyalty to my employer i dont want any money for it then let us say that i have raised your wages to this amount no that would only be evasion i want no more than you promised to give me very well then accept my thanks anyway what things he had at the office halliday took away that night a couple of days later he remembered a book which he had failed to get and returned for it the office was as usual mr featherton was a little embarrassed and nervous at hallidays desk sat a young white man about his own age he was copying a deed for mr featherton pary iv bertram halliday went home burning with indignation at the treatment he had received at the hands of the christian judge he has used me as a housemaid would use a lemon he said squeezed all out of me he could get and then flung me into the street well webb was nearer right than i thought he was now out of everything his place at the factory had been filled and no new door opened to him he knew what reward a search for work brought a man of his color in broughton so he did not bestir himself to go over the old track again he thanked his stars that he at least had money enough to carry him away from the place and he determined to go his spirit was quelled but not broken just before leaving he wrote to davis my dear webb the letter ran you after all were right we have little or no show in the fight for life among these people i have struggled for two years here at broughton and now find myself back where i was when i first stepped out of school with a foolish faith in being equipped for something one thing my eyes have been opened anyway and i no longer judge so harshly the shiftless and unambitious among my people i hardly see how a people who have so much to contend with and so little to hope for can go on striving and aspiring but the very fact that they do breeds in me a respect for them i now see why so many promising young men class orators valedictorians and the like fall by the wayside and are never heard from after commencement day i now see why the sleeping and diningcar companies are supplied by men with better educations than half the passengers whom they serve they get tired of swimming always against the tide as who would not and are content to drift i know that a good many of my friends would say that i am whining well suppose i am thats the business of a whipped cur the dog on top can bark but the under dog must howl nothing so breaks a mans spirit as defeat constant unaltering hopeless defeat thats what ive experienced i am still studying law in a halfhearted way for i dont know what i am going to do with it when i have been admitted diplomas dont draw clients we have been taught that merit wins but i have learned that the adages as well as the books and the formulas were made by and for others than us of the black race they say too that our brother americans sympathize with us and will help us when we help ourselves bah the only sympathy that i have ever seen on the part of the white man was not for the negro himself but for some portion of white blood that the colored man had got tangled up in his veins but there perhaps my disappointment has made me sour so think no more of what i have said i am going now to do what i abhor going south to try to find a school its awful but i dont want any one to pity me there are several thousands of us in the same position i am glad you are prospering you were better equipped than i was with a deal of materialism and a dearth of ideals give us a line when you are in good heart yours halliday ps just as i finished writing i had a note from judge featherton offering me the court messengership at five dollars a week i am twentyfive the place was held before by a white boy of fifteen i declined southward ho davis was not without sympathy as he read his friends letter in a city some distance away he had worked in a hotel saved money enough to start a barbershop and was prospering his white customers joked with him and patted him on the back and he was already known to have political influence yes he sympathized with bert but he laughed over the letter and jingled the coins in his pockets thank heaven he said that i have no ideals to be knocked into a cocked hat a colored man has no business with ideals not in this nineteenth century jims probation for so long a time had jim been known as the hardest sinner on the plantation that no one had tried to reach the heart under his outward shell even in campmeeting and revival times even good old brother parker who was ever looking after the lost and straying sheep gave him up as beyond recall dat jim he said oomph de debbil done got his stamp on dat boy an dey ain no use in tryin to scratch hit off but parker said his master thats the very sort of man you want to save dont you know its your business as a man of the gospel to call sinners to repentance lawd mas mordaunt exclaimed the old man my vice done got hoase callin jim too long ergo to talk erbout you jes got to let him go long maybe some o dese days he gwine slip up on de gospel an fall plum inter salvation even mandy jims wife had attempted to urge the old man to some more active efforts in her husbands behalf she was a pillar of the church herself and was woefully disturbed about the condition of jims soul indeed it was said that half of the time it was mandys prayers and exhortations that drove jim into the woods with his dog and his axe or an old gun that he had come into possession of from one of the younger mordaunts jim was unregenerate he was a fighter a hard drinker fiddled on sunday and had been known to go out hunting on that sacred day so it startled the whole place when mandy announced one day to a few of her intimate friends that she believed jim was under conviction he had stolen out hunting one sunday night and in passing through the swamp had gotten himself thoroughly wet and chilled and this had brought on an attack of acute rheumatism which mandy had pointed out to him as a direct judgment of heaven jim scoffed at first but mandy grew more and more earnest and finally with the racking of the pain he waxed serious and determined to look to the state of his soul as a means to the good of his body hit do seem mandy said dat jim feel de weight o his sins mos powahful i reckon hits de rheumatics said dinah illustration jim don mek no diffunce what de instument is mandy replied hits de sult hits de sult when the news reached stuart mordaunts ears he became intensely interested anything that would convert jim and make a model christian of him would be providential on that plantation it would save the overseers many an hours worry his horses many a secret ride and the other servants many a broken head so he again went down to labor with parker in the interest of the sinner is he mounin yit said parker no not yet but i think now is a good time to sow the seeds in his mind oomph said the old man reckon you bettah let jim alone twell dem sins o hisn git him to tossin an cryin an a mounin denll be time enough to strive wid him is allus willin to do my pat mas stuart but wen hit comes to ol time sinnahs lak jim i believe in layin off an lettin de sperit do de strivin but parker said his master you yourself know that the bible says that the spirit will not always strive well la den mas you don spec i gwine outdo de sperit but stuart mordaunt was particularly anxious that jims steps might be turned in the right direction he knew just what a strong hold over their minds the negroes own emotional religion had and he felt that could he once get jim inside the pale of the church and put him on guard of his salvation it would mean the loss of fewer of his shoats and pullets so he approached the old preacher and said in a confidential tone now look here parker ive got a fine lot of that good old tobacco you like so up to the big house and ill tell you what ill do if youll just try to work on jim and get his feet in the right path you can come up and take all you want oomoomph said the old man dat sho is monstous fine terbaccer mas stuat yes it is and you shall have all you want of it well ill have a little wisit wid jim an des see how much he fected an if dey any stroke to be put in fu de gospel ahmy you des count on me ez a mighty strong waior dat boy been layin heavy on my mind fu lo dese many days as a result of this agreement the old man went down to jims cabin on a night when that interesting sinner was suffering particularly from his rheumatic pains well jim the preacher said how you come on poly poly said jim i des plum racked an stracted fom haid to foot uh huh hit do seem lak to me de bible don tell nuffin else but de trufe what de bible been sayin now asked jim suspiciously des what it been sayin all de res o de time yo sins will fin you out jim groaned and turned uneasily in his chair the old man saw that he had made a point and pursued it don you reckon now jim ef you was a bettah man dat you wouldn suffah so i do know i do know nuffin bout hit now des look at me i ben atrompin erlong in dis low groun o sorrer fu mo den seventy yeahs an i haint got a ache ner a pain nevah had no rheumatics in my life an yere you is a young man in a mannah o speakin all twinged up wid rheumatics now what dat pint to hit mean de lawd tek keer o dem dats hisn now jim you bettah come ovah on de lawds side an git erway fom yo ebil doins jim groaned again and lifted his swollen leg with an effort just as brother parker said let us pray the prayer itself was less effective than the request was just at that time for jim was so stiff that it made him fairly howl with pain to get down on his knees the old mans supplication was loud deep and diplomatic and when they arose from their knees there were tears in jims eyes but whether from cramp or contrition it is not safe to say but a day or two after the visit bore fruit in the appearance of jim at meeting where he sat on one of the very last benches his shoulders hunched and his head bowed unmistakable signs of the convicted sinner the usual term of mourning passed and jim was converted much to mandys joy and brother parkers delight the old man called early on his master after the meeting and announced the success of his labors stuart mordaunt himself was no less pleased than the preacher he shook parker warmly by the hand patted him on the shoulder and called him a sly old fox and then he took him to the cupboard and gave him of his store of good tobacco enough to last him for months something else too he must have given him for the old man came away from the cupboard grinning broadly and ostentatiously wiping his mouth with the back of his hand great work youve done parker a great work yes yes mas grinned the old man now ef jim can des stan out his pobation hitll be montrous fine his probation exclaimed the master oh yes suh yes suh we has all de young convuts stan a pobation o six months fo we teks em reglar inter de chuch now ef jim will des stan strong in de faif parker said mordaunt youre an old wretch and ive got a mind to take every bit of that tobacco away from you no ill tell you what ill do he went back to the cupboard and got as much again as he had given parker and handed it to him saying i think it will be better for all concerned if jims probation only lasts two months get him into the fold parker get him into the fold and he shoved the ancient exhorter out of the door it grieved jim that he could not go possum hunting on sundays any more but shortly after he got religion his rheumatism seemed to take a turn for the better and he felt that the result was worth the sacrifice but as the pain decreased in his legs and arms the longing for his old wicked pleasures became stronger and stronger upon him though mandy thought that he was living out the period of his probation in the most exemplary manner and inwardly rejoiced it was two weeks before he was to be regularly admitted to church fellowship his industrious spouse had decked him out in a bleached cotton shirt in which to attend divine service in the morning jim was there the sermon which brother parker preached was powerful but somehow it failed to reach this new convert his gaze roved out of the window toward the dark line of the woods beyond where the frost still glistened on the trees and where he knew the persimmons were hanging ripe jim was present at the afternoon service also for it was a great day and again he was preoccupied he started and clasped his hands together until the bones cracked when a dog barked somewhere out on the hill the sun was going down over the tops of the woodland trees throwing the forest into gloom as they came out of the log meetinghouse jim paused and looked lovingly at the scene and sighed as he turned his steps back toward the cabin that night mandy went to church alone jim had disappeared nowhere around was his axe and spot his dog was gone mandy looked over toward the woods whose tops were feathered against the frosty sky and away off she heard a dog bark brother parker was feeling his way home from meeting late that night when all of a sudden he came upon a man creeping toward the quarters the man had an axe and a dog and over his shoulders hung a bag in which the outlines of a possum could be seen hi oh brothah jim at it agin jim did not reply well des heish up an go long we got to mek some lowances fu you young convuts wen you gwine cook dat possum brothah jim i do know brothah pahkah he so po i low i haveter keep him and fatten him fu awhile uh huh well so long jim so long brothah pahkah jim chuckled as he went away i low i fool dat ol fox wanter come down an eat up my one little possum do he huh uh so that very night jim scraped his possum and hung it outofdoors and the next day brown as the forest whence it came it lay on a great platter on jims table it was a fat possum too jim had just whetted his knife and mandy had just finished the blessing when the latch was lifted and brother parker stepped in hi oh brothah jim is des in time jim sat with his mouth open draw up a cheer brothah pahkah said mandy her husband rose and put his hand over the possum wha whad you come hyeah fu he asked i thought id des come in an tek a bite wid you ain gwine tek no bite wid me said jim heish said mandy wha kin o way is dat to talk to de preachah preachah er no preachah you hyeah what i say and he took the possum and put it on the highest shelf whas de mattah wid you jim dats one o de quiahments o de chuch the angry man turned to the preacher is it one o de quiahments o de chuch dat you eat hyeah ternight hit sholy am usual fu de shepherd to sup wherevah he stop said parker suavely vey well vey well said jim i wants you to know dat i specs to stay out o yo chuch is got two weeks mo pobation you tek hit back an gin hit to de nex niggah you ketches wid a possum mandy was horrified the preacher looked longingly at the possum and took up his hat to go there were two disappointed men on the plantation when he told his master the next day the outcome of jims probation uncle simons sundays out mr marston sat upon his wide veranda in the cool of the summer sabbath morning his hat was off the soft breeze was playing with his brown hair and a fragrant cigar was rolled lazily between his lips he was taking his ease after the fashion of a true gentleman but his eyes roamed widely and his glance rested now on the bluegreen sweep of the great lawn again on the bright blades of the growing corn and anon on the waving fields of tobacco and he sighed a sigh of ineffable content the breath had hardly died on his lips when the figure of an old man appeared before him and hat in hand shuffled up the wide steps of the porch it was a funny old figure stooped and so onesided that the tail of the long and shabby coat he wore dragged on the ground the face was black and shrewd and little patches of snowwhite hair fringed the shiny pate goodmorning uncle simon said mr marston heartily mornin mas gawge how you come on im firstrate how are you how are your rheumatics coming on oh my deys mos nigh well dey don trouble me no mo most nigh well dont trouble you any more dat is none to speak of why uncle simon who ever heard tell of a man being cured of his aches and pains at your age i ain so powahful ol mas i ain so powahful ol youre not so powerful old why uncle simon whats taken hold of you youre eighty if a day sh sh talk dat kin o low mastah don spress yosef so loud and the old man looked fearfully around as if he feared some one might hear the words the master fell back in his seat in utter surprise and why i should like to know may i not speak of your age aloud uncle simon showed his two or three remaining teeth in a broad grin as he answered well mastah is fraid ol man time mought hyeah you an tink he done let me run too long he chuckled and his master joined him with a merry peal of laughter all right then simon he said ill try not to give away any of your secrets to old man time but isnt your age written down somewhere i reckon its in dat ol bible yo pa gin me oh let it alone then even time wont find it there the old man shifted the weight of his body from one leg to the other and stood embarrassedly twirling his ancient hat in his hands there was evidently something more that he wanted to say he had not come to exchange commonplaces with his master about age or its ailments well what is it now uncle simon the master asked heeding the servants embarrassment i know youve come up to ask or tell me something have any of your converts been backsliding or has buck been misbehaving again no suh de converts all seem to be stanin strong in de faif and buck he actin right good now doesnt lize bring your meals regular and cook them good oh yes suh lize ain done nuffin dey ain nuffin de mattah at de quahtahs nuffin tal well what on earth then hol on mas hol on i

huccume you read me so nigh right oh thats not reading anything thats just truth but what do you mean uncle simon you dont mean to say that you want to resign why what would your old wife think if she

butll mek it strong enough fu de oldes ewes and with a profound bow the old man went down the steps and hobbled away as soon as uncle simon was out of sight george marston threw back his head and gave a long shout of laughter i wonder he mused what crotchet that old darkey has got into his head now he comes with all the air of a white divine to ask for a vacation well i reckon he deserves it he had me on the religious argument too hes got his grace stored and another peal of her husbands laughter brought mrs marston from the house george george what is the matter what amuses you so that you forget that this is the sabbath day oh dont talk to me about sunday any more when it comes to the pass that the reverend simon marston wants a vacation it seems that the cares of his parish have been too pressing upon him and he wishes to be away for some time he does not say whether he will visit europe or the holy land however we shall expect him to come back with much new and interesting material for the edification of his numerous congregation i wish you would tell me what you mean by all this thus adjured george marston curbed his amusement long enough to recount to his wife the particulars of his interview with uncle simon well well and you carry on so only because one of the servants wishes his sundays to himself for awhile shame on you mrs marston said her husband solemnly you are hopeless positively undeniably hopeless i do not object to your failing to see the humor in the situation for you are a woman but that you should not be curious as to the motives which actuate uncle simon that you should be unmoved by a burning desire to know why this staunch old servant who has for so many years pictured hell each sunday to his fellowservants should wish a vacation that i can neither understand nor forgive oh i can see why easily enough and so could you if you were not so intent on laughing at everything the poor old man is tired and wants rest thats all and mrs marston turned into the house with a stately step for she was a proud and dignified lady and that reason satisfies you ah mrs marston mrs marston you discredit your sex her husband sighed mockingly after her there was perhaps some ground for george marstons perplexity as to uncle simons intentions his request for sundays off was so entirely out of the usual order of things the old man with the other servants on the plantation had been bequeathed to marston by his father even then uncle simon was an old man and for many years in the elder marstons time had been the plantation exhorter in this position he continued and as his age increased did little of anything else he had a little log house built in a stretch of woods convenient to the quarters where sunday after sunday he held forth to as many of the hands as could be encouraged to attend with time the importance of his situation grew upon him he would have thought as soon of giving up his life as his pulpit to any one else he was never absent a single meeting day in all that time sunday after sunday he was in his place expounding his doctrine he had grown officious too and if any of his congregation were away from service monday morning found him early at their cabins to find out the reason why after a life then of such punctilious rigidity it is no wonder that his master could not accept mrs marstons simple excuse for uncle simons dereliction that the old man needed rest for the time being the good lady might have her way as all good ladies should but as for him he chose to watch and wait and speculate mrs marston however as well as her husband was destined to hear more that day of uncle simons strange move for there was one other person on the place who was not satisfied with uncle simons explanation of his conduct and yet could not as easily as the mistress formulate an opinion of her own this was lize who did about the quarters and cooked the meals of the older servants who were no longer in active service it was just at the dinner hour that she came hurrying up to the big house and with the freedom of an old and privileged retainer went directly to the diningroom look hyeah mis mree she exclaimed without the formality of prefacing her remarks i wants to know whuts de mattah wif brothah simon what mek him ac de way he do why i do not know eliza what has uncle simon been doing why some o you all mus know lessn he couldn a done hit ain he ax you nuffin marse gawge yes he did have some talk with me some talk i reckon he did have some talk wif somebody tell us lize mr marston said what has uncle simon done he done brung somebody else dat young merrit darky to ocpy his pupit he injuce him an en he say dat he gwine be absent a few sundays an en he tek hissef off outen de chuch widout even waitin fu de sehmont well didnt you have a good sermon it mought a been a good sehmont but dat ain whut i ax you i want to know whut de mattah wif brothah simon why he told me that the man he put over you was one of the most powerful kind warranted to make you shout until the last bench was turned over oh some o dem dey shouted enough dey shouted dey fill but dat ain whut is drivin at yit whut i wan o know whut mek brothah simon do dat well ill tell you lize marston began but his wife cut him off now george she said you shall not trifle with eliza in that manner then turning to the old servant she said eliza it means nothing do not trouble yourself about it you know uncle simon is old he has been exhorting for you now for many years and he needs a little rest these sundays it is getting toward midsummer and it is warm and wearing work to preach as uncle simon does lize stood still with an incredulous and unsatisfied look on her face after a while she said dubiously shaking her head huh uh miss mree dat may splain tings to you but hit ain mek em light to me yit now mrs marston began her husband chuckling hush i tell you george its really just as i tell you eliza the old man is tired and needs rest again the old woman shook her head huh uh she said ef youd a seen him gwine lickety split outen de meetinhouse you wouldn a thought he was so tiahed marston laughed loud and long at this well mrs marston he bantered even lize is showing a keener perception of the fitness of things than you there are some things i can afford to be excelled in by my husband and my servants for my part i have no suspicion of uncle simon and no concern about him either one way or the other scuse me miss mree said lize i didn mean no ham to you but i ain a trustin ol brothah simon i tell you im not blaming you eliza you are sensible as far as you know ahem said mr marston eliza went out mumbling to herself and mr marston confined his attentions to his dinner he chuckled just once but mrs marston met his levity with something like a sniff on the first two sundays that uncle simon was away from his congregation nothing was known about his whereabouts on the third sunday he was reported to have been seen making his way toward the west plantation now what did this old man want there the west plantation so called was a part of the marston domain but the land there was worked by a number of slaves which mrs marston had brought with her from louisiana where she had given up her fathers gorgeous home on the bayou lafourche together with her proud name of marie st pierre for george marstons love there had been so many bickerings between the marston servants and the contingent from louisiana that the two sets had been separated the old remaining on the east side and the new ones going to the west so to those who had been born on the soil the name of the west plantation became a reproach it was a synonym for all that was worldly wicked and unregenerate the east plantation did not visit with the west the east gave a dance the west did not attend the marstons and st pierres in black did not intermarry if a marston died a st pierre did not sit up with him and so the division had kept up for years it was hardly to be believed then that uncle simon marston the very patriarch of the marston flock was visiting over the border but on another sunday he was seen to go straight to the west plantation at her first opportunity lize accosted him look ahyeah brothah simon whuts dis i been hyeahin bout you huh well sis lize i reckon youll have to tell me dat yo sef case i do know whut you been hyeahin brothah simon yous a ol man yous ol well sis lize dah was methusalem i ain jokin brothah simon i ain jokin is a talkin right straightfowad yo conduc don look right hit ain becomin to you as de shepherd of a flock but whut i been doin sistah whut i been doin you know i reckon i do but i wan see whethah you does er not you been gwine ovah to de wes plantation dats whut you been doin you can ny dat yous been seed i do wan ny it is dat all is dat all lize stood aghast then she said slowly and wonderingly brothah simon is you losin yo senses er yo grace i ain losin one ner tothah but i do see no ham in gwine ovah to de wes plantation you do see no ham in gwine ovah to de wes plantation you stan hyeah in sight o gawd an say dat dont git so cited sis lize you mus membah dat deys souls on de wes plantation jes same as dey is on de eas yes an deys souls in hell too the old woman fired back cose dey is but deys already damned but deys souls on de wes plantation to be saved oomph uh uh uh grunted lize you done called me de shepherd aint you sistah well sayin i is when deys little lambs out in de col an dey ain got sense nough to come in er dey do know de way whut do de shepherd do why he go out an he hunt up de po shiverin bleatin lambs and brings em into de fol dont you bothah bout de wes plantation sis lize and uncle simon hobbled off down the road with surprising alacrity leaving his interlocutor standing with mouth and eyes wide open well i nevah she exclaimed when she could get her lips together i do believe de day of jedgmen is at han of course this conversation was duly reported to the master and mistress and called forth some strictures from mrs marston on lizes attempted interference with the old mans good work you ought to be ashamed of yourself eliza that you ought after the estrangement of all this time if uncle simon can effect a reconciliation between the west and the east plantations you ought not to lay a straw in his way i am sure there is more of a real christian spirit in that than in shouting and singing for hours and then coming out with your heart full of malice you need not laugh mr marston you need not laugh at all i am very much in earnest and i do hope that uncle simon will continue his ministrations on the other side if he wants to he can have a room built in which to lead their worship but you do want him to leave us altogethah if you do not care to share your meetinghouse with them they can have one of their own but look hyeah missy dem lousiany people dey bad an dey hoodoo folks an dey cathlics eliza scuse me missy chile bless yo heat you know i do mean no ham to you but somehow i do feel right in my heat bout brothah simon never mind eliza it is only evil that needs to be watched the good will take care of itself it was not one nor two nor three sundays that brother simon was away from his congregation but six passed before he was there again he was seen to be very busy tinkering around during the week and then one sunday he appeared suddenly in his pulpit the church nodded and smiled a welcome to him there was no change in him if anything he was more fiery than ever but there was a change lize who was newsgatherer and carrier extraordinary bore the tidings to her owners she burst into the big house with the cry of whut i tell you whut i tell you well what now exclaimed both mr and mrs marston didn i tell you ol simon was up to somepn out with it exclaimed her master out with it i knew he was up to something too george try to remember who you are brothah simon come in chuch dis monin an he scended up de pulpit well what of that are you not glad he is back hol on lemme tell you he scended up de pupit an menced his discose well he hadnt no

plantation befo evahbodys face now whut you call dat i call it politeness that is what i call it what are you laughing at mr marston i have no doubt that the old man was merely trying to set an example of courtesy to some of the younger men or to protect the woman from the insults that the other members of the congregation would heap upon her mr marston i do wish you would keep your face serious there is nothing to laugh at in this matter a worthy old man tries to do a worthy work his fellowservants cavil at him and his master who should encourage him laughs at him for his pains i assure you my dear im not laughing at uncle simon then at me perhaps that is infinitely better and not at you either im amused at the situation well manette caied him off dis monin resumed eliza manette exclaimed mrs marston it was manette he was a beauin evahbody say he likin huh moughty well an dat he look at huh all thoo preachin oh my manettes one of the nicest girls i brought from st

young man but ef a ol man come a coutin huh id keep my own two eyes open eliza youre a philosopher said mr marston youre one of the few reasoners of your sex it is all nonsense said his wife why uncle simon is old enough to be manettes grandfather love laughs at years and you laugh at everything thats the difference between love and me my dear mrs marston do not pay any attention to your master eliza and do not be so suspicious of every one it is all right uncle simon had manette over because he thought the service would do her good yesm i low shes one o de young lambs dat he gone out in de col to fotch in well he tekn moughty good keer o dat lamb mrs marston was compelled to laugh in spite of herself but when eliza was gone she turned to her husband and said george dear do you really think there is anything in it i thoroughly agree with you mrs marston in the opinion that uncle simon needed rest and i may add on my own behalf recreation pshaw i do not believe it all doubts however were soon dispelled the afternoon sun drove mr marston to the back veranda where he was sitting when uncle simon again approached and greeted him well uncle simon i hear that youre back in your pulpit again yes suh is done sumed my labohs in de mastahs vineyad have you had a good rest of it well i ain ezzackly been restin said the aged man scratching his head is been pusuin othah ployments oh yes

er yeahs thatll do ill see what your mistress says come back in an hour a little touched and a good deal amused marston went to see his wife he kept his face straight as he addressed her mrs marston manettes hand has been proposed for george the rev simon marston has this moment come and solemnly laid his heart at my feet as proxy for manette he shall not have her he shall not have her exclaimed the lady rising angrily but remember mrs marston it will keep her coming to meeting i do not care he is an old hypocrite that is what he is think too of what a noble work he is doing it brings about a reconciliation between the east and west plantations for which we have been hoping for years you really oughtnt to lay a straw in his way hes a sneaking insidious old scoundrel such poor encouragement from his mistress for a worthy old man who only needs rest george cried mrs marston and she sank down in tears which turned to convulsive laughter as her husband put his arm about her and whispered he is showing the true christian spirit dont you think wed better call manette and see if she consents she is one of his lambs you know oh george george do as you please if the horrid girl consents i wash my hands of the whole affair you know these old men have been learning such a long while by this time mrs marston was as much amused as her husband manette was accordingly called and questioned the information was elicited from her that she loved brothah simon and wished to marry him love laughs at age quoted mr marston again when the girl had been dismissed mrs marston was laughingly angry but speechless for a moment finally she said well manette seems willing so there is nothing for us to do but to consent although mind you i do not approve of this foolish marriage do you hear after a while the old man returned for his verdict he took it calmly he had expected it the disparity in the years of him and his betrothed did not seem to strike his consciousness at all he only grinned now look here uncle simon said his master i want you to tell me how you an old badlooking halfdead darky won that likely young girl the old man closed one eye and smiled mastah i don blieve you looks erroun you he said now mongst white folks you knows a preachah mongst de ladies is mos nigh isistible but mongst coled dey aint no posble way to git erroun de gospel man wen he go ahuntin fu anything mr cornelius johnson officeseeker it was a beautiful day in balmy may and the sun shone pleasantly on mr cornelius johnsons very spruce prince albert suit of grey as he alighted from the train in washington he cast his eyes about him and then gave a sigh of relief and satisfaction as he took his bag from the porter and started for the gate as he went along he looked with splendid complacency upon the less fortunate mortals who were streaming out of the day coaches it was a pullman sleeper on which he had come in out on the pavement he hailed a cab and giving the driver the address of a hotel stepped in and was rolled away be it said that he had cautiously inquired about the hotel first and found that he could be accommodated there as he leaned back in the vehicle and allowed his eyes to roam over the streets there was an air of distinct prosperity about him it was in evidence from the tips of his ample patentleather shoes to the crown of the soft felt hat that sat rakishly upon his head his entrance into washington had been long premeditated and he had got himself up accordingly it was not such an imposing structure as he had fondly imagined before which the cab stopped and set mr johnson down but then he reflected that it was about the only house where he could find accommodation at all and he was content in alabama one learns to be philosophical it is good to be philosophical in a place where the proprietor of a cafй fumbles vaguely around in the region of his hip pocket and insinuates that he doesnt want ones custom but the visitors ardor was not cooled for all that he signed the register with a flourish and bestowed a liberal fee upon the shabby boy who carried his bag to his room look here boy he said i am expecting some callers soon if they come just send them right up to my room you take good care of me and look sharp when i ring and youll not lose anything mr cornelius johnson always spoke in a large and important tone he said the simplest thing with an air so impressive as to give it the character of a pronouncement indeed his voice naturally was round mellifluous and persuasive he carried himself always as if he were passing under his own triumphal arch perhaps more than anything else it was these qualities of speech and bearing that had made him invaluable on the stump in the recent campaign in alabama whatever it was that held the secret of his power the man and principles for which he had labored triumphed and he had come to washington to reap his reward he had been assured that his services would not be forgotten and it was no intention of his that they should be after a while he left his room and went out returning later with several gentlemen from the south and a washington man there is some freemasonry among these officeseekers in washington that throws them inevitably together the men with whom he returned were such characters as the press would designate as old wheelhorses or pillars of the party they all adjourned to the bar where they had something at their hosts expense then they repaired to his room whence for the ensuing two hours the bell and the bellboy were kept briskly going the gentleman from alabama was in his glory his gestures as he held forth were those of a gracious and condescending prince it was his first visit to the city and he said to the washington man i tell you sir youve got a mighty fine town here of course theres no opportunity for anything like local pride because its the outsiders or the whole country rather that makes it what it is but thats nothing its a fine town and im right sorry that i cant stay longer how long do you expect to be with us professor inquired col mason the horse who had bent his force to the party wheel in the georgia ruts oh about ten days i reckon at the furthest i want to spend some time sightseeing ill drop in on the congressman from my district tomorrow and call a little later on the president uh huh said col mason he had been in the city for some time yes sir i want to get through with my little matter and get back home im not asking for much and i dont anticipate any trouble in securing what i desire you see its just like this theres no way for them to refuse us and if any one deserves the good things at the hands of the administration who more than we old campaigners who have been helping the party through its fights from the time that we had our first votes who indeed said the washington man i tell you gentlemen the administration is no fool it knows that we hold the colored vote down there in our vest pockets and it aint going to turn us down no of course not but sometimes there are delays delays to be sure where a man doesnt know how to go about the matter the thing to do is to go right to the centre of authority at once dont you see certainly certainly chorused the other gentlemen before going the washington man suggested that the newcomer join them that evening and see something of society at the capital you know he said that outside of new orleans washington is the only town in the country that has any colored society to speak of and i feel that you distinguished men from different sections of the country owe it to our people that they should be allowed to see you it would be an inspiration to them so the matter was settled and promptly at oclock mr cornelius johnson joined his friends at the door of his hotel the grey prince albert was scrupulously buttoned about his form and a shiny top hat replaced the felt of the afternoon thus clad he went forth into society where he need be followed only long enough to note the magnificence of his manners and the enthusiasm of his reception when he was introduced as prof cornelius johnson of alabama in a tone which insinuated that he was the only really great man his state had produced it might also be stated as an effect of this excursion into vanity fair that when he woke the next morning he was in some doubt as to whether he should visit his congressman or send for that individual to call upon him he had felt the subtle flattery of attention from that section of colored society which imitates only imitates it is true but better than any other copies the kindnesses and cruelties the niceties and deceits of its white prototype and for the time like a man in a fog he had lost his sense of proportion and perspective but habit finally triumphed and he called upon the congressman only to be met by an undersecretary who told him that his superior was too busy to see him that morning but too busy repeated the secretary mr johnson drew himself up and said tell congressman barker that mr johnson mr cornelius johnson of alabama desires to see him i think he will see me well i can take your message said the clerk doggedly but i tell you now it wont do you any good he wont see any one but in a few moments an inner door opened and the young man came out followed by the desired one mr johnson couldnt resist the temptation to let his eyes rest on the underling in a momentary glance of triumph as congressman barker hurried up to him saying why why cornelius howdo howdo ah you came about that little matter didnt you well well i havent forgotten you i havent forgotten you the colored man opened his mouth to speak but the other checked him and went on im sorry but im in a great hurry now im compelled to leave town today much against my will but i shall be back in a week come around and see me then always glad to see you you know sorry im so busy now goodmorning goodmorning mr johnson allowed himself to be guided politely but decidedly to the door the triumph died out of his face as the reluctant goodmorning fell from his lips as he walked away he tried to look upon the matter philosophically he tried to reason with himself to prove to his own consciousness that the congressman was very busy and could not give the time that morning he wanted to make himself believe that he had not been slighted or treated with scant ceremony but try as he would he continued to feel an obstinate nasty sting that would not let him rest nor forget his reception his pride was hurt the thought came to him to go at once to the president but he had experience enough to know that such a visit would be vain until he had seen the dispenser of patronage for his district thus there was nothing for him to do but to wait the necessary week a whole week his brow knitted as he thought of it in the course of these cogitations his walk brought him to his hotel where he found his friends of the night before awaiting him he tried to put on a cheerful face but his disappointment and humiliation showed through his smile as the hollows and bones through the skin of a cadaver well what luck asked col mason cheerfully are we to congratulate you put in mr perry not yet not yet gentlemen i have not seen the president yet the fact is ahem my congressman is out of town he was not used to evasions of this kind and he stammered slightly and his yellow face turned brickred with shame it is most annoying he went on most annoying mr barker wont be back for a week and i dont want to call on the president until i have had a talk with him certainly not said col mason blandly there will be delays this was not his first pilgrimage to mecca mr johnson looked at him gratefully oh yes of course delays he assented most natural have something at the end of the appointed time the officeseeker went again to see the congressman this time he was admitted without question and got the chance to state his wants but somehow there seemed to be innumerable obstacles in the way there were certain other men whose wishes had to be consulted the leader of one of the party factions who for the sake of harmony had to be appeased of course mr johnsons worth was fully recognized and he would be rewarded according to his deserts his interests would be looked after he should drop in again in a day or two it took time of course it took time mr johnson left the office unnerved by his disappointment he had thought it would be easy to come up to washington claim and get what he wanted and after a glance at the town hurry back to his home and his honors it had all seemed so easy before election but now a vague doubt began to creep into his mind that turned him sick at heart he knew how they had treated davis of louisiana he had heard how they had once kept brotherton of texas a man who had spent all his life in the service of his party waiting clear through a whole administration at the end of which the opposite party had come into power all the stories of disappointment and disaster that he had ever heard came back to him and he began to wonder if some one of these things was going to happen to him every other day for the next two weeks he called upon barker but always with the same result nothing was clear yet until one day the bland legislator told him that considerations of expediency had compelled them to give the place he was asking for to another man but what am i to do asked the helpless man oh you just bide your time ill look out for you never fear until now johnson had ignored the gentle hints of his friend col mason about a boardinghouse being more convenient than a hotel now he asked him if there was a room vacant where he was staying and finding that there was he had his things moved thither at once he felt the change keenly and although no one really paid any attention to it he believed that all washington must have seen it and hailed it as the first step in his degradation for a while the two together made occasional excursions to a glittering palace down the street but when the money had grown lower and lower col mason had the knack of bringing a little something to their rooms without a loss of dignity in fact it was in these hours with the old man over a pipe and a bit of something that johnson was most nearly cheerful hitch after hitch had occurred in his plans and day after day he had come home unsuccessful and discouraged the crowning disappointment though came when after a long session that lasted even up into the hot days of summer congress adjourned and his one hope went away johnson saw him just before his departure and listened ruefully as he said i tell you cornelius now youd better go on home get back to your business and come again next year the clouds of battle will be somewhat dispelled by then and we can see clearer what to do it was too early this year we were too near the fight still and there were party wounds to be bound up and little factional sores that had to be healed but next year cornelius next year well see what we can do for you his constituent did not tell him that even if his pride would let him go back home a disappointed applicant he had not the means wherewith to go he did not tell him that he was trying to keep up appearances and hide the truth from his wife who with their two children waited and hoped for him at home when he went home that night col mason saw instantly that things had gone wrong with him but here the tact and delicacy of the old politician came uppermost and without trying to draw his story from him for he already divined the situation too well he sat for a long time telling the younger man stories of the ups and downs of men whom he had known in his long and active life they were stories of hardship deprivation and discouragement but the old man told them ever with the touch of cheeriness and the note of humor that took away the ghastly hopelessness of some of the pictures he told them with such feeling and sympathy that johnson was moved to frankness and told him his own pitiful tale now that he had some one to whom he could open his heart johnson himself was no less willing to look the matter in the face and even during the long summer days when he had begun to live upon his wardrobe piece by piece he still kept up although some of his pomposity went along with the prince albert coat and the shiny hat he now wore a shiny coat and less showy headgear for a couple of weeks too he disappeared and as he returned with some money it was fair to presume that he had been at work somewhere but he could not stay away from the city long it was nearing the middle of autumn when col mason came home to their rooms one day to find his colleague more disheartened and depressed than he had ever seen him before he was lying with his head upon his folded arm and when he looked up there were traces of tears upon his face why why whats the matter now asked the old man no bad news i hope nothing worse than i should have expected was the choking answer its a letter from my wife shes sick and one of the babies is down but his voice broke she tells me to stay and fight it out my god mason i could stand it if she whined or accused me or begged me to come home but her patient longsuffering bravery breaks me all up col mason stood up and folded his arms across his big chest shes a brave little woman he said gravely i wish her husband was as brave a man johnson raised his head and arms from the table where they were sprawled as the old man went on the hard conditions of life in our race have taught our women a patience and fortitude which the women of no other race have ever displayed they have taught the men less and i am sorry very sorry the thing that as much as anything else made the blacks such excellent soldiers in the civil war was their patient endurance of hardship the softer education of more prosperous days seems to have weakened this quality the man who quails or weakens in this fight of ours against adverse circumstances would have quailed before no he would have run from an enemy on the field why mason your mood inspires me i feel as if i could go forth to battle cheerfully for the moment johnsons old pomposity had returned to him but in the next a wave of despondency bore it down but thats just it a body feels as if he could fight if he only had something to fight but here you strike out and hit nothing its only a contest with time its waiting waiting waiting in this case waiting is fighting well even that granted it matters not how grand his cause the soldier needs his rations forage shot forth the answer like a command ah mason thats well enough in good country but the army of officeseekers has devastated washington it has left a track as bare as lay behind shermans troopers johnson rose more cheerfully im going to the telegraph office he said as he went out a few days after this he was again in the best of spirits for there was money in his pocket what have you been doing asked mr toliver his friend laughed like a boy something very imprudent im sure you will say ive mortgaged my little place down home it did not bring much but i had to have money for the wife and the children and to keep me until congress assembles then i believe that everything will be all right col masons brow clouded and he sighed on the reassembling of the two houses congressman barker was one of the first men in his seat mr cornelius johnson went to see him soon what you here already cornelius asked the legislator i havent been away was the answer well youve got the hangon and thats what an officerseeker needs well ill attend to your matter among the very first ill visit the president in a day or two the listeners heart throbbed hard after all his waiting triumph was his at last he went home walking on air and col mason rejoiced with him in a few days came word from barker your appointment was sent in today ill rush it through on the other side come up tomorrow afternoon cornelius and mr toliver hugged each other it came just in time said the younger man the last of my money was about gone and i should have had to begin paying off that mortgage with no prospect of ever doing it the two had suffered together and it was fitting that they should be together to receive the news of the longdesired happiness so arm in arm they sauntered down to the congressmans office about five oclock the next afternoon in honor of the occasion mr johnson had spent his last dollar in redeeming the grey prince albert and the shiny hat a smile flashed across barkers face as he noted the change well cornelius he said im glad to see you still prosperouslooking for there were some alleged irregularities in your methods down in alabama and the senate has refused to confirm you i did all i could for you but the rest of the sentence was lost as col masons arms received his friends fainting form poor devil said the congressman i should have broken it more gently somehow col mason got him home and to bed where for nine weeks he lay wasting under a complete nervous givedown the little wife and the children came up to nurse him and the womans ready industry helped him to such creature comforts as his sickness demanded never once did she murmur never once did her faith in him waver and when he was well enough to be moved back it was money that she had earned increased by what col mason in his generosity of spirit took from his own narrow means that paid their secondclass fare back to the south during the feverfits of his illness the wasted politician first begged piteously that they would not send him home unplaced and then he would break out in the most extravagant and pompous boasts about his position his congressman and his influence when he came to himself he was silent morose and bitter only once did he melt it was when he held col masons hand and bade him goodbye then the tears came into his eyes and what he would have said was lost among his broken words as he stood upon the platform of the car as it moved out and gazed at the white dome and feathery spires of the city growing into grey indefiniteness he ground his teeth and raising his spent hand shook it at the receding view damn you damn you he cried damn your deceit your fair cruelties damn you you hard white liar an oldtime christmas when the holidays came round the thoughts of liza ann lewis always turned to the good times that she used to have at home when following the precedent of antibellum days christmas lasted all the week and good cheer held sway she remembered with regret the gifts that were given the songs that were sung to the tinkling of the banjo and the dances with which they beguiled the night hours and the eating could she forget it the great turkey with the fat literally bursting from him the yellow yam melting into deliciousness in the mouth or in some more fortunate season even the juicy possum grinning in brown and greasy death from the great platter in the ten years she had lived in new york she had known no such feastday food was strangely dear in the metropolis and then there was always the weekly rental of the poor room to be paid but she had kept the memory of the old times green in her heart and ever turned to it with the fondness of one for something irretrievably lost that is how jimmy came to know about it jimmy was thirteen and small for his age and he could not remember any such times as his mother told him about although he said with great pride to his partner and rival blinky scott chee blink you ought to hear my ol lady talk about de times dey have down were we come from at christmas nyoick aint in it wid dem you kin jist bet and blinky who was a new yorker clear through with a new yorkers contempt for anything outside of the city had promptly replied with a downward spreading of his right hand aw fugit it jimmy felt a little crestfallen for a minute but he lifted himself in his own estimation by threatening to do blinky and the cloud rolled by liza ann knew that jimmy couldnt ever understand what she meant by an oldtime christmas unless she could show him by some faint approach to its merrymaking and it had been the dream of her life to do this but every year she had failed until now she was a little ahead her plan was too good to keep and when jimmy went out that christmas eve morning to sell his papers she had disclosed it to him and bade him hurry home as soon as he was done for they were to have a real oldtime christmas jimmy exhibited as much pleasure as he deemed consistent with his dignity and promised to be back early to add his earnings to the fund for celebration when he was gone liza ann counted over her savings lovingly and dreamed of what she would buy her boy and what she would have for dinner on the next day then a voice a colored mans voice she knew floated up to her some one in the alley below her window was singing the old folks at home all up an down the whole creation sadly i roam still longing for the old plantation an for the old folks at home she leaned out of the window and listened and when the song had ceased and she drew her head in again there were tears in her eyes the tears of memory and longing but she crushed them away and laughed tremulously to herself as she said what a reglar ol fool im agittin to be then she went out into the cold snowcovered streets for she had work to do that day that would add a mite to her little christmas store down in the street jimmy was calling out the morning papers and racing with blinky scott for prospective customers these were only transients of course for each had his regular buyers whose preferences were scrupulously respected by both in agreement with a strange silent compact the electric cars went clanging to and fro the streets were full of shoppers with bundles and bunches of holly and all the sights and sounds were pregnant with the message of the joyous time people were full of the holiday spirit the papers were going fast and the little colored boys pockets were filling with the desired coins it would have been all right with jimmy if the policeman hadnt come up on him just as he was about to toss the bones and when blinky scott had him faded to the amount of five hardearned pennies well they were trying to suppress youthful gambling in new york and the officer had to do his duty the others scuttled away but jimmy was so absorbed in the game that he didnt see the cop until he was right on him so he was pinched he blubbered a little and wiped his grimy face with his grimier sleeve until it was one long brown smear you know this was jimmys first time the big bluecoat looked a little bit ashamed as he marched him down the street followed at a distance by a few hooting boys some of the holiday shoppers turned to look at them as they passed and murmured poor little chap i wonder what hes been up to now others said sarcastically it seems strange that copper didnt call for help a few of his brother officers grinned at him as he passed and he blushed but the dignity of the law must be upheld and the crime of gambling among the newsboys was a growing evil yes the dignity of the law must be upheld and though jimmy was only a small boy it would be well to make an example of him so his name and age were put down on the blotter and over against them the offence with which he was charged then he was locked up to await trial the next morning its shameful the bearded sergeant said how the kids are carryin on these days people are feelin pretty generous an theyll toss em a nickel er a dime fur their paper an tell em to keep the change fur christmas an foist thing you know the little beggars are shootin craps er pitchin pennies weve got to make an example of some of em liza ann lewis was tearing through her work that day to get home and do her christmas shopping and she was singing as she worked some such old song as she used to sing in the good old days back home she reached her room late and tired but happy visions of a wakening up time for her and jimmy were in her mind but jimmy wasnt there i wunner whah that little scamp is she said smiling i tol him to huy home but i reckon hes stayin out latah wid de evenin papahs sos to bring home mo money hour after hour passed and he did not come then she grew alarmed at two oclock in the morning she could stand it no longer and she went over and awakened blinky scott much to that young gentlemans disgust who couldnt see why any woman need make such a fuss about a kid he told her laconically that chimmie was pinched fur trowin de bones she heard with a sinking heart and went home to her own room to walk the floor all night and sob in the morning with all her christmas savings tied up in a handkerchief she hurried down to jefferson market court room there was a full blotter that morning and the judge was rushing through with it he wanted to get home to his christmas dinner but he paused long enough when he got to jimmys case to deliver a brief but stern lecture upon the evil of childgambling in new york he said that as it was christmas day he would like to release the prisoner with a reprimand but he thought that this had been done too often and that it was high time to make an example of one of the offenders well it was fine or imprisonment liza ann struggled up through the crowd of spectators and her christmas treasure added to what jimmy had paid his fine and they went out of the court room together when they were in their room again she put the boy to bed for there was no fire and no coal to make one then she wrapped herself in a shabby shawl and sat huddled up over the empty stove down in the alley she heard the voice of the day before singing oh darkies how my heart grows weary far from the old folks at home and she burst into tears a mess of pottage it was because the democratic candidate for governor was such an energetic man that he had been able to stir little africa which was a republican stronghold from centre to circumference he was a man who believed in carrying the war into the enemys country instead of giving them a chance to attack him he went directly into their camp leaving discontent and disaffection among their allies he believed in his principles he had faith in his policy for the government of the state and more than all he had a convincing way of making others see as he saw no other democrat had ever thought it necessary to assail the stronghold of little africa he had merely put it into his forecast as solidly against sent a little money to be distributed desultorily in the district and then left it to go its way never doubting what that way would be the opposing candidates never felt that the place was worthy of consideration for as the chairman of the central committee said holding up his hand with the fingers close together whats the use of wasting any speakers down there weve got em just like that it was all very different with mr lane gentlemen he said to the campaign managers that black district must not be ignored those people go one way because they are never invited to go another oh i tell you now lane said his closest friend itll be a waste of material to send anybody down there they simply go like a flock of sheep and nothing is going to turn them whats the matter with the bellwether said lane sententiously thats just exactly what is the matter their bellwether is an old deacon named isham swift and you couldnt turn him with a fortyhorsepower crank theres nothing like trying there are many things very similar to failing but none so bad im willing to take the risk well all right but whom will you send we cant waste a good man ill go myself what you yes i why youd be the laughingstock of the state all right put me down for that office if i never reach the gubernatorial chair say lane what was the name of that spanish fellow who went out to fight windmills and all that sort of thing never mind widner you may be a good political hustler but youre dead bad on your classics said lane laughingly so they put him down for a speech in little africa because he himself desired it widner had not lied to him about deacon swift as he found when he tried to get the old man to preside at the meeting the deacon refused with indignation at the very idea but others were more acquiescent and mount moriah church was hired at a rental that made the rev ebenezer clay and all his trustees rub their hands with glee and think well of the candidate also they looked at their shiny coats and thought of new suits there was much indignation expressed that mount moriah should have lent herself to such a cause and there were murmurs even among the congregation where the rev ebenezer clay was usually an unquestioned autocrat but because eve was the mother of all of us and the thing was so new there was a great crowd on the night of the meeting the rev ebenezer clay presided lane had said if i cant get the bellwether to jump the way i want ill transfer the bell this he had tried to do the effort was very like him the rev mr clay looking down into more frowning faces than he cared to see spoke more boldly than he felt he told his people that though they had their own opinions and ideas it was well to hear both sides he said the brothah meaning the candidate had a few thoughts to pussent and he hoped theyd listen to him quietly then he added subtly of cose brothah lane knows we coloed folks re goin to think our own way anyhow the people laughed and applauded and lane went to his work they were quiet and attentive every now and then some old brother grunted and shook his head but in the main they merely listened lane was pleasing plausible and convincing and the brass band which he had brought with him was especially effective the audience left the church shaking their heads with a different meaning and all the way home there were remarks such as he sholy tol de truth dat man was right they aint no way to ny a word he said just at that particular moment it looked very dark for the other candidate especially as the brass band lingered around an hour or so and discoursed sweet music in the streets where the negroes most did congregate twenty years ago such a thing could not have happened but the ties which had bound the older generation irrevocably to one party were being loosed upon the younger men the old men said we know the young ones said we have heard and so there was hardly anything of the blind allegiance which had made even free thought seem treason to their fathers now all of this was the reason of the great indignation that was rife in the breasts of other little africans and which culminated in a mass meeting called by deacon isham swift and held at bethel chapel a few nights later for two or three days before this congregation of the opposing elements there were ominous mutterings on the streets little knots of negroes stood and told of the terrible thing that had taken place at mount moriah shoulders were grasped heads were wagged and awful things prophesied as the result of this compromise with the general enemy no one was louder in his denunciation of the treacherous course of the rev ebenezer clay than the republican bellwether deacon swift he saw in it signs of the breakup of racial integrity and he bemoaned the tendency loud and long his son tom did not tell him that he had gone to the meeting himself and had been one of those to come out shaking his head in acquiescent doubt at the truths he had heard but he went as in duty bound to his fathers meeting the church was one thronging mass of colored citizens on the platform from which the pulpit had been removed sat deacon swift and his followers on each side of him were banners bearing glowing inscriptions one of the banners which the schoolmistress had prepared read his temples are our forts and towers which frown upon a tyrant foe the schoolmistress taught in a mixed school they had mixed it by giving her a room in a white school where she had only colored pupils therefore she was loyal to her party and was known as a woman of public spirit the meeting was an enthusiastic one but no such demonstration was shown through it all as when old deacon swift himself arose to address the assembly he put moses jackson in the chair and then as he walked forward to the front of the platform a great whitehaired rugged black figure he was heroic in his very crudeness he wore a long old prince albert coat which swept carelessly about his thin legs his turndown collar was disputing territory with his tie and his waistcoat his head was down and he glanced out of the lower part of his eyes over the congregation while his hands fumbled at the sides of his trousers in an embarrassment which may have been pretended or otherwise mistah cheerman he said fu mysef i aint no speakah i aint nevah been riz up dat way i has plowed an i has sowed an latah on i has laid cyahpets an i has whitewashed but ladies an gentmen i is a man an as a man i want to

pot o cabbage what more deacon swift said is hardly worth the telling for the whole church was in confusion and little more was heard but he carried everything with him and lanes work seemed all undone on a back seat of the church tom swift the son of the presiding officer sat and smiled at his father unmoved because he had gone as far as the sixth grade in school and thought he knew more as the reporters say the meeting came to a close amid great enthusiasm the day of election came and little africa gathered as usual about the polls in the precinct the republicans followed their plan of not bothering about the district they had heard of the deacons meeting and chuckled to themselves in their committeeroom little africa was all solid as usual but lane was not done yet his emissaries were about as thick as insurance agents and they as well as the republican workers had money to spare and to spend some votes which counted only for numbers were fifty cents apiece but when tom swift came down they knew who he was and what his influence could do they gave him five dollars and lane had one more vote and a deal of prestige the young man thought he was voting for his convictions he had just cast his ballot and the crowd was murmuring around him still at the wonder of it for the australian ballot has tongues as well as ears when his father came up with two or three of his old friends each with the old ticket in his hands he heard the rumor and laughed then he came up to tom huh he said dey been sayin roun hyeah you voted de democratic ticket go mek em out a lie i did vote the democratic ticket said tom steadily the old man fell back a step and gasped as if he had been struck you did he cried you did yes said tom visibly shaken every man has a right evah man has a right to what cried the old man to vote as he thinks he ought to was his sons reply deacon swifts eyes were bulging and reddening you you tell me dat his slender form towered above his sons and his knotted toilhardened hands opened and closed you tell me dat you with yo bringin up vote de way you think youre right you lie tell me what dey paid you or befo de lawd ill taih you to pieces right hyeah tom wavered he was weaker than his father he had not gone through the same things and was not made of the same stuff they they give me five dollahs he said but it want fu votin fi dollahs fi dollahs my son sell hissef fu fi dollahs an forty yeahs ago i brung fifteen hunerd an dat was only my body but you sell body an soul fu fi dollahs horror and scorn and grief and anger were in the old mans tone tears trickled down his wrinkled face but there was no weakness in the grip with which he took hold of his sons arms tek it back to em he said tek it back to em but pap tek it back to em i say or yo blood be on yo own haid and then shamefaced before the crowd driven by his fathers anger he went back to the man who had paid him and yielded up the precious banknote then they turned the one headhung the other proud in his very indignation and made their way homeward there was prayermeeting the next wednesday night at bethel chapel it was nearly over and the minister was about to announce the doxology when old deacon swift arose des a minute brothahs he said i want to mek a fession i was too had an too brash in my talk de othah night an de lawd visited my sins upon my haid he struck me in de bosom o my own fambly my own son went wrong pray fu me the trustfulness of polly polly jackson was a model woman she was practical and hardworking she knew the value of a dollar could make one and keep one sometimes fate permitting fate was usually sam and sam was pollys husband any morning at six oclock she might be seen basket on arm wending her way to the homes of her wealthy patrons for the purpose of bringing in their washing for by this means did she gain her livelihood she had been a person of hard common sense which suffered its greatest lapse when she allied herself with the man whose name she bore after that the lapses were more frequent how she could ever have done so no one on earth could tell sam was her exact opposite he was an easygoing happygolucky individual who worked only when occasion demanded and inclination and the weather permitted the weather was usually more acquiescent than inclination he was sanguine of temperament highly imaginative and a dreamer of dreams indeed he just missed being a poet a man who dreams takes either to poetry or policy not being able quite to reach the former sam had declined upon the latter and instead of meter feet and rhyme his mind was taken up with hosses gigs and straddles he was always jes behin dem policy shaks an ill be boun polly but i gwine to ketch em dis time polly heard this and saw the same result so often that even her stalwart faith began to turn into doubt but sam continued to reassure her and promise that some day luck would change an when hit do change he would add impressively its gwine change fu sho an well have one wakenin up time den i bet youll git dat silk dress you been wantin so long polly did have ambitions in the direction of some such finery and this plea always melted her trust was restored again and hope resumed her accustomed place it was however not through the successful culmination of any of sams policy manipulations that the opportunity at last came to polly to realize her ambitions a lady for whom she worked had a secondhand silk dress which she was willing to sell cheap another woman had spoken for it but if polly could get the money in three weeks she would let her have it for seven dollars to say that the companion of sam jackson jumped at the offer hardly indicates the attitude of eagerness with which she received the proposition yasm i kin sholy git dat much money together in thee weeks de way is awokin well now polly be sure for if you are not prompt i shall have to dispose of it where it was first promised was the admonition oh you kin pend on me mis moton fu when i sets out to save money i kin save i tell you polly was not usually so sanguine but what changes will not the notion of the possession of a brown silk dress trimmed with passementrie make in the disposition of a woman polly let sam into the secret and be it said to his credit he entered into the plan with an enthusiasm no less intense than her own he had always wanted to see her in a silk dress he told her and then in a quizzically injured tone of voice but you ought to waited tell i ketched dem policy shaks an id a got you a new one he even went so far as to go to work for a week and bring polly his earnings of course after certain little debts which he mentioned but did not specify had been deducted but in spite of all this when washing isnt bringing an especially good price when one must eat and food is high when a grasping landlord comes around once every week and exacts tribute for the privilege of breathing foul air from an alley in a room up four flights when i say all this is true and it generally is true in the new york tenderloin seven whole dollars are not easily saved there was much raking and scraping and pinching during each day that at night polly might add a few nickels or pennies to the store that jingled in a blue jug in one corner of her closet she called it her bank and sam had laughed at the conceit telling her that that was one bank anyhow that couldnt bust as the days went on how she counted her savings and exulted in their growth she already saw herself decked out in her new gown the envy and admiration of every woman in the neighborhood she even began to wish that she had a fulllength glass in order that she might get the complete effect of her own magnificence so saving hoping dreaming the time went on until a few days before the limit and there was only about a dollar to be added to make the required amount this she could do easily in the remaining time so polly was jubilant now everything would have been all right and matters would have ended happily if sam had only kept on at work but no he must needs stop and give his mind the chance to be employed with other things and that is just what happened for about this time having nothing else to do like that old king of bible renown he dreamed a dream but unlike the royal dreamer he asked no seer or prophet to interpret his dream to him he merely drove his hand down into his inside pocket and fished up an ancient dreambook greasy and tattered with use over this he pored until his eyes bulged and his hands shook with excitement got em at last he exclaimed dey aint no way fu dem to git away fom me is behind em is behind em i tell you and then his face fell and he sat for a long time with his chin in his hand thinking thinking polly said he when his wife came in dyou know what i dremp bout las night la sam jackson you aint gone to dreamin agin i thought you done quit all dat foolishness now jes listen at you runnin on you aint never axed me what i dremp bout yit hit don make much diffunce to me less n you kin dream bout a dollah mo into my pocket dey has been sich things did said sam sententiously he got up and went out if there is one thing above another that your professional dreamer does demand it is appreciation sam had failed to get it from polly but he found a balm for all his hurts when he met bob davis what exclaimed bob dreamed of a nakid black man fu de lawd sake sam don let de chance pass you got em dis time sho ill put somepn on it mysef whad you think ef wed win de capital that was enough the two parted and sam hurried home he crept into the house polly was busy hanging clothes on the roof where now are the guardian spirits that look after the welfare of trusting women where now are the enchanted belongings that even in the hands of the thief cry out to their unsuspecting owners gone all gone with the ages of faith that gave them birth without an outcry without even so much as a warning jingle the contents of the blue jug and the embodied hope of a womans heart were transferred to the gaping pocket of sam jackson polly went on hanging up clothes on the roof sam chuckled to himself she wont never have a chanst to scol me ill git de drawins early dis evenin an go machin home wif a new silk fu huh an money besides i do want my wife waihin no white folks seconhan clothes nohow my but wont she be suprised an tickled i kin jes see huh now oh mistah policyshak i got you now i been layin fu you fu a long time but yous my meat at las he marched into the policy shop like a conqueror to the amazement of the clerk he turned out a pocketful of small coin on the table and played it all in gigs straddles and combinations ill call on you about ha pas fou mr mcfadden he announced exultantly as he went out faith sor said mcfadden to his colleague if that nagur does ketch it hell break us sure sam could hardly wait for halfpast four a minute before the time he burst in upon mcfadden and demanded the drawings they were handed to him he held his breath as his eye went down the column of figures then he gasped and staggered weakly out of the room the policy sharks had triumphed again sam walked the streets until nine oclock that night he was afraid to go home to polly he knew that she had been to the jug and found he groaned but at last his very helplessness drove him in polly with swollen eyes was sitting by the table the empty jug lying on its side before her sam she exclaimed whaihs my money whaihs my money i been wokin fu all dis time why why polly don go beatin roun de bush i want o know whaih my money is you tuck it polly i dremp i do keer what you dremp i want my money fu my dress his face was miserable i thought sho dem numbers ud come out an the woman flung herself upon the floor and burst into a storm of tears sam bent over her nemmine polly he said nemmine i thought id suprise you dey beat me dis time his teeth clenched but when i ketch dem policy shaks the tragedy at three forks it was a drizzly disagreeable april night the wind was howling in a particularly dismal and malignant way along the valleys and hollows of that part of central kentucky in which the rural settlement of three forks is situated it had been trying to rain all day in a halfhearted sort of manner and now the drops were flying about in a cold spray the night was one of dense inky blackness occasionally relieved by flashes of lightning it was hardly a night on which a girl should be out and yet one was out scudding before the storm with clenched teeth and wild eyes wrapped head and shoulders in a great blanket shawl and looking as she sped along like a restless dark ghost for her the night and the storm had no terrors passion had driven out fear there was determination in her every movement and purpose was apparent in the concentration of energy with which she set her foot down she drew the shawl closer about her head with a convulsive grip and muttered with a half sob taint the first time taint the first time shes tried to take me down in compny but and the sob gave way to the dry sharp note in her voice ill fix her if it kills me she thinks i aint her ekals does she cause her paps got money an has good crops on his lan an my pap aint never had no luck but ill show er ill show er that good luck cant allus last plegtake er shes jealous cause im better lookin than she is an pearter in every way so she tries to make me little in the eyes of people well youll find out what it is to be pore to have nothin seliny williams if you live the black night hid a gleam in the girls eyes and her shawl hid a bundle of something light which she clutched very tightly and which smelled of kerosene the dark outline of a house and its outbuildings loomed into view through the dense gloom and the increased caution with which the girl proceeded together with the sudden breathless intentness of her conduct indicated that it was with this house and its occupants she was concerned the house was cellarless but it was raised at the four corners on heavy blocks leaving a space between the ground and the floor the sides of which were partly closed by banks of ashes and earth which were thrown up against the weatherboarding it was but a few minutes work to scrape away a portion of this earth and push under the pack of shavings into which the mysterious bundle resolved itself a match was lighted sheltered until it blazed and then dropped among them it took only a short walk and a shorter time to drop a handful of burning shavings into the hay at the barn then the girl turned and sped away muttering i reckon ive fixed you seliny williams mebbe next time you meet me out at a dance you wont snub me mebbe next time youll be ez pore ez i am anll be willin to dance crost from even ole lias hunsters gal the constantly falling drizzle might have dampened the shavings and put out the fire had not the wind fanned the sparks into too rapid a flame which caught eagerly at shingle board and joist until house and barn were wrapped in flames the whinnying of the horses first woke isaac williams and he sprang from bed at sight of the furious light which surrounded his house he got his family up and out of the house each seizing what he could of wearing apparel as he fled before the flames nothing else could be saved for the fire had gained terrible headway and its fierceness precluded all possibility of fighting it the neighbors attracted by the lurid glare came from far and near but the fire had done its work and their efforts availed nothing house barn stock all were a mass of ashes and charred cinders isaac williams who had a day before been accounted one of the solidest farmers in the region went out that night with his family homeless kindly neighbors took them in and by morning the news had spread throughout all the countryside incendiarism was the only cause that could be assigned and many were the speculations as to who the guilty party could be of course isaac williams had enemies but who among them was mean ay daring enough to perpetrate such a deed as this conjecture was rife but futile until old lias hunster who though he hated williams was shocked at the deed voiced the popular sentiment by saying look a here folks i tell you thats the work o niggers i kin see their hand in it niggers o course exclaimed every one else why didnt we think of it before its jest like em public opinion ran high and fermented until saturday afternoon when the county paper brought the whole matter to a climax by coming out in a sulphurous account of the affair under the scarehead a terrible outrage most dastardly deed ever committed in the history of barlow county a highly respected unoffending and wellbeloved family burned out of house and home negroes undoubtedly the perpetrators of the deed the article went on to give the facts of the case and many more supposed facts which had originated entirely in the mind of the correspondent among these facts was the intelligence that some strange negroes had been seen lurking in the vicinity the day before the catastrophe and that a party of citizens and farmers were scouring the surrounding country in search of them they would if caught concluded the correspondent be summarily dealt with notwithstanding the utter falsity of these statements it did not take long for the latter part of the article to become a prophecy fulfilled and soon excited inflamed and misguided parties of men and boys were scouring the woods and roads in search of strange niggers nor was it long before one of the parties raised the cry that they had found the culprits they had come upon two strange negroes going through the woods who seeing a band of mounted and armed men had instantly taken to their heels this one act had accused tried and convicted them the different divisions of the searching party came together and led the negroes with ropes around their necks into the centre of the village excited crowds on the one or two streets which the hamlet boasted cried lynch em lynch em hang the niggers up to the first tree jane hunster was in one of the groups as the shivering negroes passed and she turned very pale even under the sunburn that browned her face the lawabiding citizens of barlow county who composed the capturing party were deaf to the admonitions of the crowd they filed solemnly up the street and delivered their prisoners to the keeper of the jail sheriff by courtesy and scamp by the seal of satan and then quietly dispersed there was something ominous in their very orderliness late that afternoon the man who did duty as prosecuting attorney for that county visited the prisoners at the jail and drew from them the story that they were farmlaborers from an adjoining county they had come over only the day before and were passing through on the quest for work the bad weather and the lateness of the season having thrown them out at home uh huh said the prosecuting attorney at the conclusion of the tale your storys all right but the only trouble is that it wont do here they wont believe you now im a friend to niggers as much as any white man can be if theyll only be friends to themselves an i want to help you two all i can theres only one way out of this trouble you must confess that you did this but mistah said the bolder of the two negroes how kin we fess when we wasn nowhahs nigh de place now there you go with regular nigger stubbornness didnt i tell you that that was the only way out of this if you persist in saying you didnt do it theyll hang you whereas if you own youll only get a couple of years in the pen which ud you rather have a couple o years to work out or your necks stretched oh well fess mistah well fess we done it please please dont let em hang us cried the thoroughly frightened blacks well thats something like it said the prosecuting attorney as he rose to go ill see what can be done for you with marvelous and mysterious rapidity considering the reticence which a prosecuting attorney who was friendly to the negroes should display the report got abroad that the negroes had confessed their crime and soon after dark ominous looking crowds began to gather in the streets they passed and repassed the place where stationed on the little wooden shelf that did duty as a doorstep jane hunster sat with her head buried in her hands she did not raise up to look at any of them until a hand was laid on her shoulder and a voice called her jane oh hits you is it bud she said raising her head slowly howdy howdy yoreself said the young man looking down at her tenderly bresh off yore pants an set down said the girl making room for him on the step the young man did so at the same time taking hold of her hand with awkward tenderness jane he said i jest cant wait fur my answer no longer you got to tell me tonight either one way or the other dock heaters has been ablowin hit aroun that he has beat my time with you i dont believe it jane fur after keepin me waitin all these years i dont believe youd go back on me you know ive allus loved you ever sence we

ill be the happiest man in the state well yes then bud for youre my choice even ef i have fooled with you fur a long time an im glad now that i kin make somebody happy the girl was shivering and her hands were cold but she made no movement to rise or enter the house bud put his arms around her and kissed her shyly and just then a shout arose from the crowd down the street whats that she asked its the boys gittin worked up i reckon theyre going to lynch them niggers tonight that burned ole man williams out the girl leaped to her feet they mustnt do it she cried they aint never been tried set down janey said her lover theyve owned up to it i dont believe it she exclaimed somebodys jest a lyin on em to git em hung because theyre niggers sh jane youre excited you aint well i noticed that

i aint right well well you might be in better business than settin out here talkin to bud mason dont know how as to that said his rival seein as were engaged youre a liar flashed dock heaters bud mason half rose then sat down again his triumph was sufficient without a fight to him liar was a hard name to swallow without resort to blows but he only said his flashing eyes belying his calm tone mebbe i am a liar jest ast jane is that the truth jane asked heaters angrily yes hit is dock heaters an i dont see what youve got to say about it i haint never promised you nothin shore heaters turned toward the gate without a word bud sent after him a mocking laugh and the bantering words youd better go down an hep hang them niggers thats all youre good fur and the rival really did bend his steps in that direction another shout arose from the throng down the street and rising hastily bud mason exclaimed i must be goin that yell means business dont go down there bud cried jane dont go fur my sake dont go she stretched out her arms and clasped them about his neck you dont want me to miss nothin like that he said as he unclasped her arms dont you be worried ill be back past here and in a moment he was gone leaving her cry of bud bud come back to smite the empty silence when bud mason reached the scene of action the mob had already broken into the jail and taken out the trembling prisoners the ropes were round their necks and they had been led to a tree see ef theyll do anymore houseburnin cried one as the ends of the ropes were thrown over the limbs of the tree reckon theyll like dancin hemp a heap better mocked a second justice an pertection yelled a third the mills of the gods grind swift enough in barlow county said the schoolmaster the scene the crowd the flaring lights and harsh voices intoxicated mason and he was soon the most enthusiastic man in the mob at the word his was one of the willing hands that seized the rope and jerked the negroes off their feet into eternity he joined the others with savage glee as they emptied their revolvers into the bodies then came the struggle for pieces of the rope as keepsakes the scramble was awful bud mason had just laid hold of a piece and cut it off when some one laid hold of the other end it was not at the ropes end and the other man also used his knife in getting a hold mason looked up to see who his antagonist was and his face grew white with anger it was dock heaters let go this rope he cried let go yoreself i cut it first an im a goin to have it they tugged and wrestled and panted but they were evenly matched and neither gained the advantage let go i say screamed heaters wild with rage ill die first you dirty dog the words were hardly out of his mouth before a knife flashed in the light of the lanterns and with a sharp cry bud mason fell to the ground heaters turned to fly but strong hands seized and disarmed him hes killed him murder murder arose the cry as the crowd with terrorstricken faces gathered about the murderer and his victim lynch him suggested some one whose thirst for blood was not yet appeased no cried an imperious voice who knows what may have put him up to it give a white man a chance for his life the crowd parted to let in the town marshal and the sheriff who took charge of the prisoner and led him to the little rickety jail whence he escaped later that night while others improvised a litter and bore the dead man to his home the news had preceded them up the street and reached janes ears as they passed her home she gazed at them with a stony vacant stare muttering all the while as she rocked herself to and fro i knowed it i knowed it the press was full of the double lynching and the murder conservative editors wrote leaders about it in which they deplored the rashness of the hanging but warned the negroes that the only way to stop lynching was to quit the crimes of which they so often stood accused but only in one little obscure sheet did an editor think to say there was salem and its witchcraft there is the south and its lynching when the blind frenzy of a people condemn a man as soon as he is accused his enemies need not look far for a pretext the finding of zach the rooms of the banner club an organization of social intent but with political streaks were a blaze of light that christmas eve night on the lower floor some one was strumming on the piano and upstairs where the ladies sat and where the sunday smokers were held a man was singing one of the latest coon songs the banner always got them first mainly because the composers went there and often the air of the piece itself had been picked out or patched together with the help of the banners piano before the song was taken out for somebody to set the companiment to it the proprietor himself had just gone into the parlor to see that the christmas decorations were all that he intended them to be when a door opened and an old man entered the room in one hand he carried an ancient carpetbag which he deposited on the floor while he stared around at the grandeur of the place he was a typical old uncle of the south from the soles of his heavy brogans to the shiny top of his bald pate with its fringe of white wool it was plain to be seen that he was not a denizen of the town or of that particular quarter they do not grow old in the tenderloin he paused long enough to take in the appointments of the place then suddenly remembering his manners he doffed his hat and bowed with oldfashioned courtesy to the splendid proprietor why howdo uncle said the genial mr turner extending his hand where did you stray from howdy son howdy returned the old man gravely i hails fom missippi mysef a mighty long ways fom hyeah his voice and oldtime intonation were good to listen to and mr turners thoughts went back to an earlier day in his own life he was from maryland himself he drew up a chair for the old man and took one himself a few other men passed into the room and stopped to look with respectful amusement at the visitor he was such a perfect bit of old plantation life and so obviously out of place in a tenderloin club room well uncle are you looking for a place to stay pursued turner not zackly honey not zackly i come up hyeah alookin fu a son o mine dat been away fom home nigh on to five years he live hyeah in noo yok an dey tell me

shackelford zach shackelford exclaimed some of the men and there was a general movement among them but a glance from turner quieted the commotion why yes i know your son he said hes in here almost every night and hes pretty sure to drop in a little later on he has been singing with one of the colored companies here until a couple of weeks ago heish up you dont say so well well well but den zachariah allus did have a mighty sweet voice he tuk hit aftah his mammy well i sholy is hopin to see dat boy he was allus my favorite aldough i reckon a body ain got no livin right to have favorites among dey chilluns but zach was allus sich a good boy the men turned away they could not remember a time since they had known zach shackelford when by any stretch of imagination he could possibly have been considered good he was known as one of the wildest young bucks that frequented the club with a deft hand at cards and dice and a smooth throat for whisky but turner gave them such a defiant glance that they were almost ready to subscribe to anything the old man might say dis is a mighty fine place you got hyeah hit mus be a kind of a hotel or boadin house aint hit yes something like we don have nuffin lak dis down ouah way cose wes jes common folks we woks out in de fiel and dats about all we knows fiel chuch an cabin but is mighty glad my zach s gittin up in de worl he nevah were no great han fu wok hit kin o seemed to go agin his natur you know dey is folks lak dat lots of em lots of em said mr turner the crowd of men had been augmented by a party from out of the card room and they were listening intently to the old fellows chatter they felt now that they ought to laugh but somehow they could not and the twitching of their careless faces was not from suppressed merriment the visitor looked around at them and then remarked my what a lot of boadahs you got they dont all stay here answered turner seriously some of them have just dropped in to see their friends den i low zachll be drappin in presently you mus scuse me fu talkin bout him but is mighty anxious to clap my eyes on him is been gittin on right smat dese las two yeahs an my ol ooman she daid an

man do you ever would you er ive got some pretty good liquor here ah zachs father smiled a sly smile i do know suh he said crossing his leg high is baptis mysf but long o dese crismus holidays is right fond of a little toddy a half dozen eager men made a break for the bar but turners uplifted hand held them he was an autocrat in his way excuse me gentlemen he said but i think i remarked some time ago that mr shackelford was my guest and he called the waiter all the men had something and tapped rims with the visitor pears to me you people is mighty clevah up hyeah tain no wondah zachariah don wan to come home just then they heard a loud whoop outside the door and a voice broke in upon them singing thickly oh this spotin life is surely killin me the men exchanged startled glances turner looked at them and there was a command in his eye several of them hurried out and he himself arose saying ive got to go out for a little while but you just make yourself at home uncle you can lie down right there on that sofa and push that button there see this way if you want some more toddy it shant cost you anything oh ill res myself but i ain gwine sponge on you dat away i got some money and the old man dug down into his long pocket but his host laid a hand on his arm your moneys no good up here wh wh why i thought dis money passed any whah in de nunited states exclaimed the bewildered old man thats all right but you cant spend it until we run out oh why bless yo soul suh you skeered me you sho is clevah turner went out and came upon his emissaries where they had halted the singing zach in the hallway and were trying to get into his muddled brain that his father was there whash de ol man doin at de banner gittin gay in his ol days hic that was enough for turner to hear look ahere he said dont you get flip when you meet your father hes come a long ways to see you and im damned if he shant see you right remember youre stoppin at my house as long as the old man stays and if you make a break while hes here ill spoil your mug for you bring him along boys zach had started in for a christmas celebration but they took him into an empty room they sent to the drug store and bought many things when the young man came out an hour later he was straight but sad why pap he said when he saw the old man ill be hem said turner ill be blessed zach finished the old man looked him over tsch tsch tsch dis is a crismus gif fu sho his voice was shaking is so glad to see you honey but chile you smell lak a pothacay shop i aint been right well lately said zach sheepishly to cover his confusion turner called for eggnog when it came the old man said well is baptis mysef but seein its crismus johnsonham junior now any one will agree with me that it is entirely absurd for two men to fall out about their names but then circumstances alter cases it had its beginning in and it has just ended in the first place ike and jim had been good friends on the plantation but when the time came for them to leave and seek homes for themselves each wanted a name the masters name was johnson and they both felt themselves entitled to it when ike went forth to men as isaac johnson and jim not to be outdone became james johnsonham the rivalry began each married and became the father of a boy who took his fathers name when both families moved north and settled in little africa their children had been taught that there must be eternal enmity between them on account of their names and just as lasting a friendship on every other score but with boys it was natural that the rivalry should extend to other things when they went to school it was a contest for leadership both in the classroom and in sports and when isaac johnson left school to go to work in the brickyard james johnsonham not to be outdone in industry also entered the same field of labor later it was questioned all up and down douglass street which by the way is the social centre of little africa as to which of the two was the better dancer or the more gallant beau it was a piece of good fortune that they did not fall in love with the same girl and bring their rivalry into their affairs of the heart for they were only men and nothing could have kept them friends but they came quite as near it as they could for matilda benson was as bright a girl as martha mason and when ike married her she was an evenrunning contestant with her friend martha for the highest social honors of their own particular set it was a foregone conclusion that when they were married and settled they should live near each other so the houses were distant from each other only two or three doors it was because every one knew every one elses business in that locality that sandy worthington took it upon himself to taunt the two men about their bone of contention mr johnson he would say when coming from the downtown store where he worked he would meet the two coming from their own labors in the brickyard how are you an mistah johnsonham mekin it ovah yo names well i don know that johnsonham is so much of a name ike would say and jim would reply i low its mo name than johnson anyhow so is stealin ham mo than stealin was the others rejoinder and then his friends would double up with mirth sometimes the victorious repartee was jims and then the laugh was on the other side but the two went at it all goodnaturedly until one day one foolish day when they had both stopped too often on the way home jim grew angry at some little fling of his friends and burst into hot abuse of him at first ike was only astonished and then his eyes red with the dust of the brickfield grew redder the veins of his swarthy face swelled and with a take that mistah johnsonham he gave jim a resounding thwack across the face it took only a little time for a crowd to gather and with their usual tormentor to urge them on the men forgot themselves and went into the fight in dead earnest it was a hardfought battle both rolled in the dust caught at each others short hair pummeled bit and swore they were still rolling and tumbling when their wives apprised of the goings on appeared upon the scene and marched them home after that because they were men they kept a sullen silence between them but matilda and martha because they were women had much to say to each other and many unpleasant epithets to hurl and hurl again across the two yards that intervened between them finally neither little family spoke to the other and then one day there was a great bustle about jims house a wise old woman went waddling in and later the doctor came that night the proud husband and father was treating his friends and telling them it was a boy and his name was to be james johnsonham junior for a week jim was irregular and unsteady in his habits when one night full of gin and pride he staggered up to a crowd which was surrounding his rival and said in a loud voice james johnsonham junior how does that strike you any bettah than isaac johnson junior asked some one slapping the happy ike on the shoulder as the crowd burst into a loud guffaw jims head was sadly bemuddled and for a time he gazed upon the faces about him in bewilderment then a light broke in upon his mind and with a whooee he said no ike grinned a defiant grin at him and led the way to the nearest place where he and his friends might celebrate jim went home to his wife full of a sullen heavy anger ike johnson got a boy at his house too he said an he done put junior to his name martha raised her head from the pillow and hugged her own baby to her breast closer it do beat all she made answer airily we cant do a blessed thing but them thaih johnsons has to follow right in ouah steps anyhow i dont believe their baby is no sich healthy lookin chile as this one is bress his little heat cause i knows matilda benson nevah was any too strong she was right matilda benson was not so strong the doctor went oftener to ikes house than he had gone to jims and three or four days after an undertaker went in they tried to keep the news from marthas ears but somehow it leaked into them and when jim came home on that evening she looked into her husbands face with a strange new expression oh jim she cried weakly tildy done gone an me jes speakin had bout huh a little while ago an that po baby lef thaih to die aint it awful nev min said jim

response he only gripped the hand tighter a little while later jim came hastily from the house with something small wrapped closely in a shawl the faith cure man hope is tenacious it goes on living and working when science has dealt it what should be its deathblow in the close room at the top of the old tenement house little lucy lay wasting away with a relentless disease the doctor had said at the beginning of the winter that she could not live now he said that he could do no more for her except to ease the few days that remained for the child but martha benson would not believe him she was confident that doctors were not infallible anyhow this one wasnt for she saw life and health ahead for her little one did not the preacher at the mission home say ask and ye shall receive and had she not asked and asked again the life of her child her last and only one at the hands of him whom she worshipped no lucy was not going to die what she needed was country air and a place to run about in she had been housed up too much these long northern winters were too severe for her and that was what made her so pinched and thin and weak she must have air and she should have it po little lammie she said to the child mammys little gal boun to git well mammy gwine sen huh out in de country when the spring comes whaih she kin roll in de grass an pick flowers an git good an strong don baby want

her mother kissed her little thin forehead and tiptoed out sending in a child from across the hall to take care of lucy while she was at work for sick as the little one was she could not stay at home and nurse her hope grasps at a straw and it was quite in keeping with the condition of marthas mind that she should open her ears and her heart when they told her of the wonderful works of the faithcure man people had gone to him on crutches and he had touched or rubbed them and they had come away whole he had gone to the homes of the bedridden and they had risen up to bless him it was so easy for her to believe it all the only religion she had ever known the wild emotional religion of most of her race put her credulity to stronger tests than that her only question was would such a man come to her humble room but she put away even this thought he must come she would make him already she saw lucy strong and running about like a mouse the joy of her heart and the light of her eyes as soon as she could get time she went humbly to see the faith doctor and laid her case before him hoping fearing trembling yes he would come her heart leaped for joy there is no place said the faith curist too humble for the messenger of heaven to enter i am following one who went among the humblest and the lowliest and was not ashamed to be found among publicans and sinners i will come to your child madam and put her again under the law the law of life is health and no one who will accept the law need be sick i am not a physician i do not claim to be i only claim to teach people how not to be sick my fee is five dollars merely to defray my expenses thats all you know the servant is worthy of his hire and in this little bottle here i have an elixir which has never been known to fail in any of the things claimed for it since the world has got used to taking medicine we must make some concessions to its prejudices but this in reality is not a medicine at all it is only a symbol it is really liquefied prayer and faith martha did not understand anything of what he was saying she did not try to she did not want to she only felt a blind trust in him that filled her heart with unspeakable gladness tremulous with excitement she doled out her poor dollars to him seized the precious elixir and hurried away home to lucy to whom she was carrying life and strength the little one made a weak attempt to smile at her mother but the light flickered away and died into greyness on her face now mammys little gal gwine to git well fu sho mammy done bring huh somepn good awed and reverent she tasted the wonderful elixir before giving it to the child it tasted very like sweetened water to her but she knew that it was not and had no doubt of its virtues lucy swallowed it as she swallowed everything her mother brought to her poor little one she had nothing to buoy her up or to fight science with in the course of an hour her mother gave her the medicine again and persuaded herself that there was a perceptible brightening in her daughters face mrs mason carolines mother called across the hall how lucy dis evenin mis benson oh i think lucy air right peart martha replied come over an look at huh mrs mason came and the mother told her about the new faith doctor and his wonderful powers why mis mason she said pears like i could see de change in de child de minute she swallowed dat medicine her neighbor listened in silence but when she went back to her own room it was to shake her head and murmur po marfy she jes ez blind ez a bat she jes go long holdin on to dat chile wid all huh might an i see death in lucys face now dey aint no faif nur prayer nur jackleg doctors nuther gwine to save huh but martha needed no pity then she was happy in her selfdelusion on the morrow the faith doctor came to see lucy she had not seemed so well that morning even to her mother who remained at home until the doctor arrived he carried a conquering air and a baggy umbrella the latter of which he laid across the foot of the bed as he bent over the moaning child give me some brown paper he commanded martha hastened to obey and the priestly practitioner dampened it in water and laid it on lucys head all the time murmuring prayers or were they incantations to himself then he placed pieces of the paper on the soles of the childs feet and on the palms of her hands and bound them there when all this was done he knelt down and prayed aloud ending with a peculiar version of the lords prayer supposed to have mystic effect martha was greatly impressed but through it all lucy lay and moaned the faith curist rose to go well we can look to have her out in a few days remember my good woman much depends upon you you must try to keep your mind in a state of belief are you saved oh yes suh im a puffessor said martha and having completed his mission the man of prayers went out and caroline again took marthas place at lucys side in the next two days martha saw or thought she saw a steady improvement in lucy according to instructions the brown paper was moved every day moistened and put back martha had so far spurred her faith that when she went out on saturday morning she promised to bring lucy something good for her christmas dinner and a pair of shoes against the time of her going out and also a little doll she brought them home that night caroline had grown tired and lighting the lamp had gone home i done brung my little lady bird huh somepn nice said martha heres a lil doll and de lil shoes honey hows de baby feel lucy did not answer you sleep martha went over to the bed the little face was pinched and ashen the hands were cold lucy lucy called the mother lucy oh gawd it aint true she aint daid my little one my las one she rushed for the elixir and brought it to the bed the thin dead face stared back at her unresponsive she sank down beside the bed moaning daid daid oh my gawd gi me back my chile oh dont i believe you enough oh lucy lucy my little lamb i got you yo gif oh lucy the next day was set apart for the funeral the mission preacher read the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord and some one said amen but martha could not echo it in her heart lucy was her last her one treasured lamb a council of state part i luther hamilton was a great political power he was neither representative in congress senator nor cabinet minister when asked why he aspired to none of these places of honor and emolument he invariably shrugged his shoulders and smiled inscrutably in fact he found it both more pleasant and more profitable simply to boss his party it gave him power position and patronage and yet put him under obligations to no narrow constituency as he sat in his private office this particular morning there was a smile upon his face and his little eyes looked out beneath the heavy grey eyebrows and the massive cheeks with gleams of pleasure his whole appearance betokened the fact that he was feeling especially good even his mail lay neglected before him and his eyes gazed straight at the wall what wonder that he should smile and dream had he not just the day before utterly crushed a troublesome opponent had he not ruined the career of a young man who dared to oppose him driven him out of public life and forced his business to the wall if this were not food for selfcongratulation pray what is mr hamiltons reverie was broken in upon by a tap at the door and his secretary entered well frank what is it now i havent gone through my mail yet miss kirkman is in the outer office sir and would like to see you this morning oh miss kirkman heh well show her in at once the secretary disappeared and returned ushering in a young woman whom the boss greeted cordially ah miss kirkman goodmorning goodmorning always prompt and busy i see have a chair miss kirkman returned his greeting and dropped into a chair she began at once fumbling in a bag she carried well get right to business she said i know youre busy and so am i and i want to get through ive got to go and hunt a servant for mrs senator dutton when i leave here she spoke in a loud voice and her words rushed one upon the other as if she were in the habit of saying much in a short space of time this is a trick of speech frequently acquired by those who visit public men miss kirkmans whole manner indicated bustle and hurry even her attire showed it she was a plump woman aged one would say about thirty her hair was brown and her eyes a steely grey not a bad face but one too shrewd and aggressive perhaps for a woman one might have looked at her for a long time and never suspected the truth that she was allied to the colored race neither features hair nor complexion showed it but then colored is such an elastic word and miss kirkman in reality was colored for revenue only she found it more profitable to ally herself to the less important race because she could assume a position among them as a representative woman which she could never have hoped to gain among the whites so she was colored and without having any sympathy with the people whom she represented spoke for them and uttered what was supposed by the powers to be the thoughts that were in their breasts well from the way youre tossing the papers in that bag i know youve got some news for me yes i have but i dont know how important youll think it is here we are she drew forth a paper and glanced at it its just a memorandum a list of names of a few men who need watching the afroamerican convention is to meet on the d thats thursday of next week bishop carter is to preside the thing has resolved itself into a fight between those who are officeholders and those who want to be yes well whats the convention going to do theyre going to denounce the administration hem well in your judgment what will that amount to miss kirkman they are the representative talking men from all sections of the country and they have their following and so theres no use disputing that they can do some harm hum what are they going to denounce the administration for oh theres a spirit of general discontent and theyve got to denounce something so it had as well be the administration as anything else there was a new gleam in mr hamiltons eye that was not one of pleasure as he asked who are the leaders in this movement thats just what i brought this list for theres courtney editor of the new york beacon who is rabid theres jones of georgia gray of ohio whew whistled the boss gray of ohio why hes on the inside yes and i cant see whats the matter with him hes got his position and he ought to keep his mouth shut oh there are ways of applying the screw go on then too theres shackelford of mississippi duncan of south carolina stowell of kentucky and a lot of smaller fry who are not worth mentioning are they organized yes courtney has seen to that the forces are compact we must split them how is the bishop neutral any influence lots of it hows your young man the one for whom youve been soliciting a place whats his name miss kirkman did her womanhood the credit of blushing joseph aldrich you mean you can trust to me to see that hes on the right side happy is the man who has the right woman to boss him and who has sense enough to be bossed by her his path shall be a path of roses and his bed a flowery bed of ease now to business they must not denounce the administration what are the conditions of membership in this convention any one may be present but it costs a fee of five dollars for the privilege of the floor mr hamilton turned to the desk and made out a check he handed it to miss kirkman saying cash this and pack that convention for the administration i look to you and the people you may have behind you to check any rash resolutions they may attempt to pass i want you to be there every day and take notes of the speeches made and their character and tenor i shall have mr richardson there also to help you the record of each mans speech will be sent to his central committee and we shall know how to treat him in the future you know miss kirkman it is our method to help our friends and to crush our enemies i shall depend upon you to let me know which is which goodmorning goodmorning mr hamilton and oh miss kirkman just a moment frank the secretary came in bring me that jewel case out of the safe here miss kirkman mrs hamilton told me if you came in to ask if you would mind running past the safety deposit vaults and putting these in for her certainly not said miss kirkman this was one of the ways in which miss kirkman was made to remember her race and the relation to that race which nothing in her face showed came out strongly in her willingness thus to serve the confidence itself flattered her and she was never tired of telling her acquaintances how she had put such and such a senators wifes jewels away or got a servant for a cabinet minister when her other duties were done she went directly to a small dingy office building and entered a room over which was the sign joseph aldrich counselor and attorney at law how do joe why miss kirkman im glad to see you said mr aldrich coming forward to meet her and setting a chair he was a slender young man of a complexion which among the varying shades bestowed among colored people is termed a light brown skin a mustache and a short vandyke beard partially covered a mouth inclined to weakness looking at them an observer would have said that miss kirkman was the stronger man of the two what brings you out this way today questioned aldrich ill tell you youve asked me to marry you havent you yes well im going to do it annie you make me too happy thats enough said miss kirkman waving him away we havent any time for romance now i mean business youre going to the convention next week yes and youre going to speak of course thats right let me see your speech he drew a typewritten manuscript from the drawer and handed it to her she ran her eyes over the pages murmuring to herself uh huh wavering weak vaciliating adminstration have not given us the protection our rights as citizens demanded while our brothers were murdered in the south nero fiddled while rome burned while this modern uh huh oh yes just as i thought and with a sudden twist miss kirkman tore the papers across and pitched them into the grate miss kirkman annie what do you mean i mean that if youre going to marry me im not going to let you go to the convention and kill yourself but my convictions look here dont talk to me about convictions the colored man is the under dog and the under dog has no right to have convictions listen youre going to the convention next week and youre going to make a speech but it wont be that speech i have just come from mr hamiltons that convention is to be watched closely he is to have his people there and they are to take down the words of every man who talks and these words will be sent to his central committee the man who goes there with an imprudent tongue goes down youd better get to work and see if you cant think of something good the administration has done and dwell on that whew well im off but annie about the wedding goodmorning well talk about the wedding after the convention the door closed on her last words and joseph aldrich sat there wondering and dazed at her manner then he began to think about the administration there must be some good things to say for it and he would find them yes annie was right and wasnt she a hustler though part ii it was on the morning of the d and near nine oclock the hour at which the convention was to be called to order but mr gray of ohio had not yet gone in he stood at the door of the convention hall in deep converse with another man his companion was a young looking sort of person his forehead was high and his eyes were keen and alert the face was mobile and the mouth nervous it was the face of an enthusiast a man with deep and intense beliefs and the boldness or perhaps rashness to uphold them i tell you gray he was saying its an outrage nothing less life liberty and the pursuit of happiness bah its all twaddle why we cant even be secure in the first two how can we hope for the last youre right elkins said gray soberly and though i hold a position under the administration when it comes to a consideration of the wrongs of my race i cannot remain silent i cannot and will not i hold nothing from them and i owe them nothing i am only a bookkeeper in a commercial house where their spite cannot reach me so you may rest assured that i shall not bite my tongue nor shall i we shall all be colored men here together and talk i hope freely one to the other shall you introduce your resolution today i wont have a chance unless things move more rapidly than i expect them to it will have to come up under new business i should think hardly get yourself appointed on the committee on resolutions good but how can i ill see to that i know the bishop pretty well ah goodmorning miss kirkman how do you do aldrich gray pursued turning to the newcomers who returned his greeting and passed into the hall thats miss kirkman youve heard of her she fetches and carries for luther hamilton and his colleagues and has been suspected of doing some spying also who was that with her oh thats her man friday otherwise joseph aldrich by name a fellow shes trying to make something of before she marries him shes got the pull to do it too why dont you turn them down ah my boy youre young youre young you show it dont you know that a wind strong enough to uproot an oak only ripples the leaves of a creeper against the wall outside of the race that woman is really considered one of the leaders and she trades upon the fact but why do you allow this base deception to go because elkins my child gray put his hand on the others shoulder with mock tenderness because these seemingly sagacious whites among whom we live are really a very credulous people and the first one who goes to them with a good front and says look here i am the leader of the colored people i am their oracle and prophet they immediately exalt and say thats so now do you see why miss kirkman has a pull i see but come on lets go in there goes the gavel the convention hall was already crowded and the air was full of the bustle of settling down when the time came for the payment of their fees by those who wanted the privilege of the floor there was a perfect rush for the secretarys desk bank notes fluttered everywhere miss kirkman had on a suspiciously new dress and bonnet but she had done her work well nevertheless she looked up into the gallery in a corner that overlooked the stage and caught the eye of a young man who sat there notebook in hand he smiled and she smiled then she looked over at mr aldrich who was not sitting with her and they both smiled complacently theres nothing like being on the inside after the appointment of committees the genial bishop began his opening address and a very careful pretty address it was too well worded well balanced dealing in broad generalities and studiously saying nothing that would indicate that he had any intention of directing the policy of the meetings of course it brought forth all the applause that a bishops address deserves and the ladies in the back seats fluttered their fans and said the dear man how eloquent he is gray had succeeded in getting elkins placed on the committee on resolutions but when they came to report the fiery resolution denouncing the administration for its policy toward the negro was laid on the table the young man had succeeded in engineering it through the committee but the chairman decided that its proper place was under the head of new business where it might be taken up in the discussion of the administrations attitude toward the negro illustration the bishops address we are here gentlemen pursued the bland presiding officer to make public sentiment but we must not try to make it too fast so if our young friend from ohio will only hold his resolution a little longer it will be acted upon at the proper time we must be moderate and conservative gray sprang to his feet and got the chairmans eye his face was flushed and he almost shouted conservatism be hanged we have rolled that word under our tongues when we were being trampled upon we have preached it in our churches when we were being shot down we have taught it in our schools when the right to use our learning was denied us until the very word has come to be a reproach upon a black mans tongue there were cries of order order and sit down and the gavel was rattling on the chairmans desk then some one rose to a point of order so dear to the heart of the negro debater the point was sustained and the ohioan yielded the floor but not until he had gazed straight into the eyes of miss kirkman as they rose from her notebook she turned red he curled his lip and sat down but the blood burned in his face and it was not the heat of shame but of anger and contempt that flushed his cheeks this outbreak was but the precursor of other storms to follow every one had come with an idea to exploit or some proposition to advance each one had his panacea for all the aches and pains of his race each man who had paid his five dollars wanted his full five dollars worth of talk the chairman allowed them five minutes apiece and they thought time dear at a dollar a minute but there were speeches to be made for buncombe and they made the best of the seconds they howled they raged they stormed they waxed eloquent or pathetic jones of georgia was swearing softly and feelingly into shackelfords ear shackelford was sympathetic and nervous as he fingered a large bundle of manuscript in his back pocket he got up several times and called mr chairman but his voice had been drowned in the tumult amid it all calm and impassive sat the man who of all others was expected to be in the heat of the fray it had been rumored that courtney of the new york beacon had come to washington with blood in his eyes but there he sat silent and unmoved his swarthy eaglelike face with its frame of irongrey hair as unchanging as if he had never had a passionate thought i dont like jim courtneys silence whispered stowell to a colleague theres never so much devil in him as when he keeps still you look out for him when he does open up but all the details of the convention do not belong to this narrative it is hardly relevant even to tell how stowells prediction came true and at the second days meeting courtneys calm gave way and he delivered one of the bitterest speeches of his life it was in the morning and he was down for a set speech on the negro in the higher walks of life he started calmly but as he progressed the memory of all the wrongs personal and racial that he had suffered the knowledge of the disabilities that he and his brethren had to suffer and the vision of toil unrequited love rejected and loyalty ignored swept him off his feet he forgot his subject forgot everything but that he was a crushed man in a crushed race the auditors held their breath and the reporters wrote much turning to them he said and to the press of washington to whom i have before paid my respects let me say that i am not afraid to have them take any word that i may say i came here to meet them on their own ground i will meet them with pen i will meet them with pistol and then raising his tall spare form he shouted yes even though there is but one hundred and thirtyfive pounds of me i will meet them with my fists this was all very rash of courtney his paper did not circulate largely so his real speech which he printed was not widely read while through the columns of the local press a garbled and distorted version of it went to every corner of the country purposely distorted who shall say he had insulted the press and then mr hamilton was a very wealthy man when the time for the consideration of elkins resolution came courtney jones and shackelford threw themselves body and soul into the fight with gray and its author there was a formidable array against them all the men in office and all of those who had received even a crumb of promise were for buttering over their wrongs and making their address to the public a prophecy of better things jones suggested that they send an apology to lynchers for having negroes where they could be lynched this called for reproof from the other side and the discussion grew hot and acrimonious gray again got the floor and surprised his colleagues by the plainness of his utterances elkins followed him with a biting speech that brought aldrich to his feet mr aldrich had chosen well his time and had carefully prepared his speech he recited all the good things that the administration had done hoped to do tried to do or wanted to do and showed what a very respectable array it was he counseled moderation and conservatism and his peroration was a flowery panegyric of the noble man whose hand is on the helm guiding the grand old ship of state into safe harbor the officeholders went wild with enthusiasm no selfinterest there the opposition could not argue that this speech was made to keep a job because the speaker had none then jim courtney got up and spoiled it all by saying that it may be that the speaker had no job but wanted one aldrich was not moved he saw a fat salary and annie kirkman for him in the near future the young lady had done her work well and when the resolution came to a vote it was lost by a good majority aldrich was again on his feet and offering another the forces of the opposition were discouraged and disorganized and they made no effort to stop it when the rules were suspended and it went through on the first reading then the convention shouted that is part of it did and miss kirkman closed her notebook and glanced up at the gallery again the young man had closed his book also their work was done the administration had not been denounced and they had their blacklist for mr hamiltons knife there were some more speeches made just so that the talkers should get their moneys worth but for the masses the convention had lost its interest and after a few feeble attempts to stir it into life again a motion to adjourn was entertained but before a second appeared elkins arose and asked leave to make a statement it was granted gentlemen he said we have all heard the resolution which goes to the public as the opinion of the negroes of the country there are some of us who do not believe that this expresses the feelings of our race and to us who believe this mr courtney has given the use of his press in new york and we shall print our resolution and scatter it broadcast as the minority report of this convention but the majority report of the race miss kirkman opened her book again for a few minutes and then the convention adjourned i wish youd find out miss kirkman said hamilton a couple of days later just what firm that young elkins works for i have already done that i thought youd want to know and she handed him a card ah yes he said i have some business relations with that firm i know them very well miss anderson he called to his stenographer will you kindly take a letter for me by the way miss kirkman i have placed mr aldrich he will have his appointment in a few days oh thank you mr hamilton is there anything more i can do for you nothing goodmorning goodmorning a week later in his ohio home william elkins was surprised to be notified by his employers that they were cutting down forces and would need his services no longer he wrote at once to his friend gray to know if there was any chance for him in washington and received the answer that gray could hardly hold his own as great pressure was being put upon him to force him to resign i think wrote gray that the same hand is at the bottom of all our misfortunes this is hamiltons method miss kirkman and mr aldrich were married two weeks from the day the convention adjourned mr gray was removed from his position on account of inefficiency he is still trying to get back but the very men to whom his case must go are in the hands of mr hamilton silas jackson i silas jackson was a young man to whom many opportunities had come had he been a less fortunate boy as his little world looked at it he might have spent all his days on the little farm where he was born much as many of his fellows did but no fortune had marked him for her own and it was destined that he should be known to fame he was to know a broader field than the few acres which he and his father worked together and where he and several brothers and sisters had spent their youth mr harold marston was the instrument of fate in giving silas his first introduction to the world marston who prided himself on being besides a man of leisure something of a sportsman was shooting over the fields in the vicinity of the jackson farm during the week he spent in the region needing the services of a likely boy he came to know and like silas upon leaving he said its a pity for a boy as bright as you are to be tied down in this godforsaken place howd you like to go up to the springs si and work in a hotel the very thought of going to such a place and to such work fired the boys imagination although the idea of it daunted him id like it powahful well mistah maston he replied well im going up there and the proprietor of one of the best hotels the fountain house is a very good friend of mine and ill get him to speak to his head waiter in your behalf you want to get out of here and see something of the world and not stay cooped up with nothing livelier than rabbits squirrels and quail and so the work was done the black boys ambitions that had only needed an encouraging word had awakened into buoyant life he looked his destiny squarely in the face and saw that the great world outside beckoned to him from that time his dreams were eaglewinged the farm looked narrower to him the cabin meaner and the clods were harder to his feet he learned to hate the plough that he had followed before in dumb content and there was no longer joy in the woods he knew and loved once out of pure joy of living he had gone singing about his work but now when he sang it was because his heart was longing for the city of his dreams and hope inspired the song however after mr marston had been gone for over two weeks and nothing had been heard from the springs the hope died in silass heart and he came to believe that his benefactor had forgotten him and yet he could not return to the old contentment with his mode of life mr marston was right and he was cooped up there with nothing better than rabbits squirrels and quail the idea had never occurred to him before but now it struck him with disconcerting force that there was something in him above his surroundings and the labor at which he toiled day by day he began to see that the cabin was not over clean and for the first time recognized that his brothers and sisters were positively dirty he had always looked on it with unconscious eyes before but now he suddenly developed the capacity for disgust when young lishy noticing his brothers moroseness attributed it to his strong feeling for a certain damsel silas turned on him in a fury ambition had even driven out all other feelings and dely manly seemed poor and commonplace to the dark swain who a month before would have gone any length to gain a smile from her he compared everything and everybody to the glory of what he dreamed the springs and its inhabitants to be and all seemed cheap beside then on a day when his spirits were at their lowest ebb a passing neighbor handed him a letter which he had found at the little village post office it was addressed to mr si jackson and bore the springs postmark silas was immediately converted from a raw backwoods boy to a man of the world save the little notes that had been passed back and forth from boy to girl at the little log schoolhouse where he had gone four fitful sessions this was his first letter and it was the first time he had ever been addressed as mr he swelled with a pride that he could not conceal as with trembling hands he tore the missive open illustration his brother and sister he read it through with glowing eyes and a growing sense of his own importance it was from the head waiter whom mr marston had mentioned and was couched in the most elegant and highsounding language it said that mr marston had spoken for silas and that if he came to the springs and was quick to learn to acquire knowledge was the head waiters phrase a situation would be provided for him the family gathered around the fortunate son and gazed on him with awe when he imparted the good news he became on the instant a new being to them it was as if he had only been loaned to them and was now being lifted bodily out of their world the elder jackson was a bit doubtful about the matter of cose ef you wants to go silas i aint agwine to gainsay you an i hope its all right but sence freedom dis hyeah piece o grouns been good enough fu me an i reckon you mought a got erlong on it but pap you see its diffent now its diffent all i wanted was a chanst well i reckon you got it si i reckon you got it the younger children whispered long after they had gone to bed that night wondering and guessing what the great place to which brother si was going could be like and they could only picture it as like the great whitedomed city whose picture they had seen in the gaudy bible foisted upon them by a passing agent as for silas he read and reread the letter by the light of a tallow dip until he was too sleepy to see and every word was graven on his memory then he went to bed with the precious paper under his pillow in spite of his drowsiness he lay awake for some time gazing with heavy eyes into the darkness where he saw the great city and his future then he went to sleep to dream of it from then on great were the preparations for the boys departure so little happened in that vicinity that the matter became a neighborhood event and the black folk for three miles up and down the road manifested their interest in silass good fortune i hyeah you gwine up to de springs said old hiram jones when he met the boy on the road a day or two before his departure yes suh is gwine up thaih to wok in a hotel mistah maston he got me the job the old man reined in his horse slowly and deposited the liquid increase of a quid of tobacco before he said i hyeah tell its powahful wicked up in dem big cities oh i reckon i aint agoin to do nuffin wrong is goin thaih to wok well you has been riz right commented the old man doubtfully but den boys will be boys he drove on and the prospect of a near view of wickedness did not make the springs less desirable in the boys eyes raised as he had been almost away from civilization he hardly knew the meaning of what the world called wickedness not that he was strong or good there had been no occasion for either quality to develop but that he was simple and primitive and had been close to what was natural and elemental his faults and sins were those of the gentle barbarian he had not yet learned the subtler vices of a higher civilization silas however was not without the pride of his kind and although his father protested that it was a useless extravagance he insisted upon going to the nearest village and investing part of his small savings in a new suit of clothes it was quaint and peculiar apparel but it was the boys first store suit and it filled him with unspeakable joy his brothers and sisters regarded his new magnificence with envying admiration it would be a long while before they got away from bagging homespun and copperascolored cotton whacked out into some semblance of garments by their mammy and so armed with a light bundle in which were his few other belongings and fearfully and wonderfully arrayed silas jackson set out for the springs his fathers parting injunctions were ringing in his ears and the memory of his mammys wet eyes and sad face lingered in his memory she had wanted him to take the gaudy bible away but it was too heavy to carry especially as he was to walk the whole thirty miles to the land of promise at the last his feeling of exaltation gave way to one of sorrow and as he went down the road he turned often to look at the cabin until it faded from sight around the bend then a lump rose in his throat and he felt like turning and running back to it he had never thought the old place could seem so dear but he kept his face steadily forward and trudged on toward his destiny the springs was the fashionable resort of virginia where the aristocrats who thought they were ill went to recover their health and to dance compared with large cities of the north it was but a small town even including the transient population but in the eyes of the rural blacks and the poor whites of the region it was a place of large importance hither on the morning after his departure from the home gate came silas jackson a little footsore and weary but hopeful withal in spite of the pains that he had put upon his dressing he was a quaint figure on the city streets many an amused smile greeted him as he went his way but he saw them not inquiring the direction he kept on until the many windows and broad veranda of the great hotel broke on his view and he gasped in amazement and awe at the sight of it and a sudden faintness seized him he was reluctant to go on but the broad grins with which some colored men who were working about the place regarded him drove him forward in spite of his embarrassment he found his way to the kitchen and asked in trembling tones for the head waiter breakfast being over that individual had leisure to come to the kitchen there with the grinning waiters about him he stopped and calmly surveyed silas he was a very pompous head waiter silas had never been selfconscious before but now he became distressfully aware of himself of his awkwardness of his clumsy feet and dangling hands of the difference between his clothes and the clothes of the men about him after a survey which seemed to the boy of endless duration the head waiter spoke and his tone was the undisputed child of his looks i pussoom said mr buckner that you are the pusson mistah maston spoke to the popietor about yes suh i reckon i is he pomised to git me a job up hyeah an i got yo lettah here silas who had set his bundle on the floor in coming into the presence began to fumble in his pockets for the letter he searched long in vain because his hands trembled and he was nervous under the eyes of this great personage who stood unmoved and looked calmly at him finally the missive was found and produced though not before the perspiration was standing thick on silass brow the head waiter took the sheet vey well suh vey well you are evidently the poper pusson as i reconize this as my own chirography the upcountry boy stood in awed silence he thought he had never heard such fine language before i caculate that you have nevah had no experience in hotel work pursued mr buckner somewhat more graciously is nevah done nuffin but wok on a farm but evahbody lows is right handy the fear that he would be sent back home without employment gave him boldness i see i see said the head waiter well well endeavor to try an see how soon you can learn mistah smith will you take this young man in charge an show him how to get about things until we are ready to try him in the dininroom a rather pleasantfaced yellow boy came over to silas and showed him where to put his things and what to do i guess itll be a little strange at first if youve never been a hotel man but youll ketch on just you keep your eye on me all that day as silas blundered about slowly and awkwardly he looked with wonder and admiration at the ease and facility with which his teacher and the other men did their work they were so calm so precise and so selfsufficient he wondered if he would ever be like them and felt very hopeless as the question presented itself to him they were a little prone to laugh at him but he was so humble and so sensible that he thought he must be laughable so he laughed a little shamefacedly at himself and only tried the harder to imitate his companions once when he dropped a dish upon the floor he held his breath in consternation but when he found that no one paid any attention to it he picked it up and went his way he was tired that night more tired than ploughing had ever made him and was thankful when smith proposed to show him at once to the rooms apportioned to the servants here he sank down and fell into a doze as soon as his companion left him with the remark that he had some studying to do he found afterward that smith was only a temporary employee at the springs coming there during the vacations of the school which he attended in order to eke out the amount which it cost him for his education silas thought this a very wonderful thing at first but when he grew wiser as he did finally he took the point of view of most of his fellows and thought that smith was wasting both time and opportunities it took a very short time for silass unfamiliarity with his surroundings to wear off and for him to become acquainted with the duties of his position he grew at ease with his work and became a favorite both in diningroom and kitchen then began his acquaintance with other things and there were many other things at the springs which an unsophisticated young man might learn silass social attainments were lamentably sparse but being an apt youngster he began to acquire them quite as he acquired his new duties and different forms of speech he learned to dance almost a natural gift of the negro and he was introduced into the subtleties of flirtation at first he was a bit timid with the nursegirls and maids whom the wealthy travelers brought with them but after a few lessons from very able teachers he learned the manly art of ogling to his own satisfaction and soon became as proficient as any of the other black coxcombs if he ever thought of dely manly any more it was with a smile that he had been able at one time to consider her seriously the people at home be it said to his credit he did not forget a part of his wages went back every month to help better the condition of the cabin but silas himself had no desire to return and at the end of a year he shuddered at the thought of it he was quite willing to help his father whom he had now learned to call the old man but he was not willing to go back to him ii early in his second year at the springs marston came for a stay at the hotel when he saw his protйgй he exclaimed why that isnt si is it yes suh smiled silas well well well what a change why boy youve developed into a regular fashionplate i hope youre not advertising for any of the richmond tailors theyre terrible jews you know you see a man has to be neat aroun the hotel mistah maston whew and youve developed dignity too by the lord harry if id have made that remark to you about a year and a half ago there at the cabin youd have just grinned ah silas im afraid for you youve grown too fast youve gained a certain poise and ease at the expense of of i dont know what but something that i liked better down there at home you were just a plain darky up here you are trying to be like me and you are colored of cose mistah maston said silas politely but deprecatingly the worl dont stan still platitudes the last straw exclaimed mr marston tragically theres an old darky preacher up at richmond who says it does and im sure i think more of his old foghorn blasts than i do of your parrot tones ah si this is the last time that i shall ever fool with good raw material however dont let this bother you as i remember you used to sing well im going to have some of my friends up at my rooms tonight get some of the boys together and come and sing for us and remember nothing hifalutin just the same old darky songs you used to sing all right suh well be up silas was very glad to be rid of his old friend and he thought when marston had gone that he was after all not such a great man as he had believed but the decline in his estimation of mr marstons importance did not deter him from going that night with three of his fellowwaiters to sing for that gentleman two of the quartet insisted upon singing fine music in order to show their capabilities but silas had received his cue and held out for the old songs silas jacksons tenor voice rang out in the old plantation melodies with the force and feeling that old memories give the concert was a great success and when marston pressed a generoussized banknote into his hand that night he whispered well im glad theres one thing you havent lost and thats your voice that was the beginning of silass supremacy as manager and first tenor of the fountain hotel quartet and he flourished in that capacity for two years longer then came mr j robinson frye looking for talent and silas by reason of his prominence fell in this way mr j robinson frye was an educated and enthusiastic young mulatto gentleman who having studied music abroad had made art his mistress as well as he was able he wore the shock of hair which was the sign manual of his profession he was a plausible young man of large ideas and had composed some things of which the critics had spoken well but the chief trouble with his work was that his one aim was money he did not love the people among whom american custom had placed him but he had respect for their musical ability why he used to exclaim in the sudden bursts of enthusiasm to which he was subject why these people are the greatest singers on earth theyve got more emotion and more passion than any other people and they learn easier i could take a chorus of forty of them and with two months training make them sing the roof off the metropolitan opera house when mr frye was in new york he might be seen almost any day at the piano of one or the other of the negro clubs either working at some new inspiration or playing one of his own compositions and all black clubdom looked on him as a genius his latest scheme was the training of a colored company which should do a years general singing throughout the country and then having acquired poise and a reputation produce his own opera it was for this he wanted silas and in spite of the warning and protests of friends silas went with him to new york for he saw his future loom large before him the great city frightened him at first but he found there some like himself drawn from the smaller towns of the south others in the company were the relics of the old days of negro minstrelsy and still others recruited from the church choirs in the large cities silas was an adaptable fellow but it seemed a little hard to fall in with the ways of his new associates most of them seemed as far away from him in their knowledge of worldly things as had the waiters at the springs a few years before he was half afraid of the chorus girls because they seemed such different beings from the nurse girls down home however there was little time for moping or regrets mr frye was it must be said an indefatigable worker they were rehearsing every day silas felt himself learning to sing meanwhile he knew that he was learning other things a few more elegancies and vices he looked upon the rounders with admiration and determined to be one so after rehearsals were over other occupations held him he came to be known at the clubs and was quite proud of it and he grew bolder with the chorus girls because he was to be a star after three weeks of training the company opened and silas who had never sung anything heavier than bright sparkles in the churchyard was dressed in a fauntleroy suit and put on to sing in a scene from rigoletto every night he was applauded to the echo by the unskilful until he came to believe himself a great singer this belief was strengthened when the girl who performed the spanish dance bestowed her affections upon him he was very happy and very vain and for the first time he forgot the people down in a little old virginia cabin in fact he had other uses for his money for the rest of the season either on the road or in and about new york he sang steadily most of the things for which he had longed and had striven had come to him he was known as a rounder his highest ambition his waistcoats were the loudest to be had he was possessed of a factitious ease and selfpossession that was almost aggression the hot breath of the city had touched and scorched him and had dried up within him whatever was good and fresh the pity of it was that he was proud of himself and utterly unconscious of his own degradation he looked upon himself as a man of the world a fine product of the large opportunities of a great city once in those days he heard of smith his oldtime companion at the springs he was teaching at some small place in the south silas laughed contemptuously when he heard how his old friend was employed poor fellow he said what a pity he didnt come up here and make something out of himself instead of starving down there on little or nothing and he mused on how much better his fate had been the season ended after a brief period of rest the rehearsals for fryes opera were begun silas confessed to himself that he was tired he had a cough too but mr frye was still enthusiastic and this was to be the great triumph both for the composer and the tenor why i tell you man said frye its going to be the greatest success of the year i am the only man who has ever put grandopera effects into comic opera with success just listen to the chords of this opening chorus and so he inspired the singer with some of his own spirit they went to work with a will silas might have been reluctant as he felt the strain upon him grow but that he had spent all his money and frye as he expressed it was putting up for him until the opening of the season then one day he was taken sick and although frye fumed the rehearsals had to go on without him for awhile his companions came to see him and then they gradually ceased to come so he lay for two months even sadie his dancing sweetheart seemed to have forgotten him one day he sent for her but the messenger returned to say she could not come she was busy she had married the man with whom she did a turn at the roofgarden the news came too that the opera had been abanboned and that mr frye had taken out a company with a new tenor whom he pronounced far superior to the former one silas gazed blankly at the wall the hollowness of his life all came suddenly before him all his false ideals crumbled and he lay there with nothing to hope for then came back the yearnings for home for the cabin and the fields and there was no disgust in his memory of them when his strength partly returned he sold some of the few things that remained to him from his prosperous days and with the money purchased a ticket for home then spent broken hopeless all contentment and simplicity gone he turned his face toward his native fields
