 prologu landed on sun glacier about noon the flight in rattled the hangover right out of me and severed those strangling roots of reality that is the world below the skys clear like blue crystal the kind of sky they slap on postcards to lure the tourists in complete with a shimmering sun dog around the cold white sun im taking it as a sign that this climb was meant to be the winds about ten knots temps a balmy ten below glaciers broad as whoring kates ass and icy as her heart even so kate gave us a proper sendoff last night even gave us what you could call a group rate dont know what the hell were doing here except you gotta be somewhere doing something a winter climb on no names as good a something as any and better than most a man needs a weeks adventuring now and then adventuring that excludes bad liquor and loose women how else are you going to appreciate the liquor and the women if you dont get away from them for a while and bumping into a couple of fellow lunatics turned not only my luck at the table but my mood in general theres little that bums me more than working a job for a daily wage like the rest of the mice on the wheel but the woman sure will push the buttons my windfall should satisfy my girls so now im taking a few days with pals just for me going up against the elements risking life and limb in the company of other men just as foolish is something ive got to have just to remind me im alive to do it not for pay not for duty not because a womans nagging your balls blue but just for pure idiocy is what keeps the spirit sparked its getting too crowded below roads going where they never used to go people living where they never used to live when i first came there werent so many and the damn feds werent regulating everything a permit to climb to walk on a mountain screw that and screw the tightassed feds with their rules and their paperwork the mountains were here long before some government bureaucrat figured out a way to make a buck off them and theyll be here long after hes winding red tape in hell and im here now on this land that belongs to no one holy ground never can if there was a way to live on the mountain id plant my tent and never leave but holy or not shell kill you quicker than a nagging wife and with less mercy so ill take my week with likeminded men climbing this peak that has no name and rises above the town and the river and the lakes that skirts the boundaries the feds throw up on land that mocks their puny attempts to tame and preserve alaska belongs to none but itself no matter how many roads or signs or rules are erected on her she is the last of the wild women and god love her for it i do weve established our base camp and already the suns dropped below the great peaks and plunged us into the dark of winter huddled in our tent we eat well pass a joint around and talk of tomorrow tomorrow we climb one en route to lunacy december strapped into the quivering soup can laughingly called a plane bouncing his way on the pummeling air through the stingy window of light that was winter through the gaps and breaks in snowsheathed mountains toward a town called lunacy ignatious burke had an epiphany he wasnt nearly as prepared to die as hed believed it was a hell of a thing to realize when his fate hung precariously in the hands of a stranger who was buried in a canary yellow parka and whose face was nearly concealed by a battered leather bush hat perched on top of a purple watch cap the stranger had seemed competent enough in anchorage and had given nates hand a hearty slap before wagging a thumb at the soup can with propellers then hed told nate to just call me jerk thats when the initial unease had set in what kind of an idiot got into a flying tin can piloted by a guy named jerk but flying was the only sure way to reach lunacy this late in the year or so mayor hopp had informed him when hed conferred with her over his travel arrangements the plane dipped hard to the right and as nates stomach followed he wondered just how mayor hopp defined sure hed thought he hadnt given a good damn one way or the other live or die what did it matter in the big scheme when hed boarded the big jet at baltimorewashington hed resigned himself that he was heading to the end of his life in any case the department shrink had warned him about making major decisions when he was suffering from depression but hed applied for the position as chief of police in lunacy for no reason other than that the name seemed apt and hed accepted the position with a whogivesashit shrug even now reeling with nausea shivering with his epiphany nate realized it wasnt so much death that worried him but the method he just didnt want to end the whole deal by smashing into a mountain in the fucking gloom at least if hed stayed in baltimore had danced more affably with the shrink and his captain he couldve gone down in the line of duty that wouldnt have been so bad but no hed tossed in his badge hadnt just burned his bridges but had incinerated them and now he was going to end up a bloody smear somewhere in the alaska range gonna get a little rough through here jerk said with a drawnout texas drawl nate swallowed bile and its been so smooth up to now jerk grinned winked this aint nothing ought to try it fighting a headwind no thanks how much longer not much the plane bucked and shuddered nate gave up and closed his eyes he prayed he wouldnt add to the indignity of his death by puking on his boots first he was never going up in a plane again if he lived hed drive out of alaska or walk or crawl but he was never going into the air again the plane gave a kind of jerking leap that had nates eyes popping open and he saw through the windscreen the triumphant victory of the sun a wondrous sort of lessening of gloom that turned the sky pearly so that the world below was denned in long ripples of white and blue sudden rises shimmering swarms of icy lakes and what had to be miles of snowdraped trees just east the sky was all but blotted out by the mass the locals called denali or just the mountain even his sketchy research had told him only outsiders referred to it as mckinley his only coherent thought as they shuddered along was that nothing real should be that massive as the sun beamed god fingers through the heavy sky around it the shadows began to drip and spread blue over white and its icy face glinted something shifted inside him so that for a moment he forgot the roiling of his belly the constant buzzing roar of the engine even the chill that had hung in the plane like fog big bastard aint he yeah nate let out a breath big bastard they eased west but he never lost sight of the mountain he could see now that what hed taken as an icy road was a winding frozen river and near its bank the spread of man with its houses and buildings and cars and trucks it looked to him like the inside of a snow globe that had yet to be shaken with everything still and white and waiting something clunked under the floor what was that landing gear thats lunacy the plane roared into a descent that had nate gripping his seat bracing his feet what were landing where where on the river frozen solid this time of year no worries but going in on the skis skis nate abruptly remembered he hated winter sports wouldnt skates make more sense jerk let out a wild laugh as the plane zeroed in on the ribbon of ice wouldnt that be some shit skate plane hot damn the plane bumped skidded slid along with nates belly then glided gracefully to a stop jerk cut the engines and in the sudden silence nate could hear his own heart tattooing in his ears they cant pay you enough nate managed they cant possibly pay you enough hell he slapped nate on the arm aint about the pay welcome to lunacy chief youre damn right he decided against kissing the ground not only would he look ridiculous but hed probably freeze to it instead he swung his weak legs out into the unspeakable cold and prayed theyd hold him up until he could get somewhere warm still and sane his main problem was crossing the ice without breaking his leg or his neck dont worry about your stuff chief jerk called out ill haul it for you thanks steadying himself nate spotted a figure standing in the snow it was wrapped in a brown hooded parka with black fur trim and smoking in short impatient puffs using it as a guide nate picked his way over the ripply ice with as much dignity as he could muster ignatious burke the voice was raspy and female and came to him on a puff of vapor he slipped managed to right himself and with his heart banging against his ribs made the snowy bank anastasia hopp she stuck out a mittened hand somehow gripped his with it and pumped righteously little green around the gills yet jerk you play with our new chief on the way from the city no maam had a little weather though always do goodlooking arent you even sickly here have a pull she yanked a silver flask out of her pocket pushed it at him ah go ahead youre not on duty yet little brandyll settle you down deciding it couldnt make things worse he uncapped the flask took a slow sip and felt it punch straight to his quivering belly thanks well get you settled in the lodge give you a chance to catch your breath she led the way along a trompeddown path show you around town later when your heads clear long way from baltimore yeah it is it looked like a movie set to him the green and white trees the river the snow buildings made of split logs smoke pumping out of chimneys and pipes it was all in a dreamy blur that made him realize he was as exhausted as he was sick he hadnt been able to sleep on any of the flights and calculated it had been nearly twentyfour hours since hed last been horizontal good clear day she said mountains put on a show kind of picture brings the tourists in it was postcard perfect and just a little overwhelming he felt like hed walked into that movie or someone elses dream glad to see you geared up good she measured him as she spoke lot of lower ers show up in fancy overcoats and showroom boots and freeze their asses off hed ordered everything he was wearing right down to the thermal underwear along with most of the contents of his suitcase from eddie bauer online after receiving an email list of suggestions from mayor hopp you were pretty specific about what id need she nodded specific too about what we need dont disappoint me ignatious nate i dont intend to mayor hopp just hopp thats what they call me she stepped up on a long wooden porch this is the lodge hotel bar diner social club you got a room here part of your salary you decide you want to live elsewhere thats on you place belongs to charlene hidel she serves a good meal keeps the place clean shell take care of you shell also try to get into your pants excuse me youre a goodlooking man and charlenes got a weakness shes too old for you but she wont think so you decide you dont either thats up to you then she smiled and he saw that under her hood she had a face ruddy as an apple and shaped the same way her eyes were nut brown and lively her mouth long and thin and quirked at the corners we got us a surplus of men like most of alaska that doesnt mean the local female population wont come sniffing youre fresh meat and a lot of them are going to want a taste you do what you please on your free time ignatious just dont go banging the girls on town time ill write that down her laugh was like a foghorn two quick blasts to punctuate it she slapped him on the arm you might do she yanked open the door and led him into blessed warmth he smelled wood smoke and coffee something frying with onions and a womans comegetme perfume it was a wide room informally sectioned into a diner with two and fourtops five booths and a bar with stools lined up with their red seats worn in the center from years of asses settling down there was a wide opening to the right and through it he could see a pool table and what looked like foosball and the starry lights of a jukebox on the right another opening showed what looked like a lobby he saw a section of counter and cubbyholes filled with keys a few envelopes or message sheets a log fire burned briskly and the front windows were angled to catch the spectacular mountain view there was one enormously pregnant waitress with her hair done in a long glossy black braid her face was so arresting so serenely beautiful he actually blinked she looked to him like the native alaskan version of the madonna with her soft dark eyes and golden skin she was topping off coffee for two men in a booth a boy of about four sat at a table coloring in a book a man in a tweed jacket sat at the bar smoking and reading a tattered copy of ulysses at a far table a man with a brown beard that spilled onto the chest of his faded buffalocheck flannel shirt appeared to be holding an angry conversation with himself heads turned in their direction and greetings were called out to hopp as she tossed her hood back to reveal a springy mop of silver hair gazes locked onto nate that ranged from curiosity and speculation to open hostility from the beard this heres ignatious burke our new chief of police hopp announced this as she yanked down the zipper of her parka we got dex trilby and hans finkle there in the booth and thats bing karlovski over there with the scowl on what you can see of his face rose itu is waiting tables hows that baby today rose restless welcome chief burke thanks this is the professor hopp tapped tweed jacket on the shoulder as she crossed to the bar anything different in that book since the last time you read it always something he tipped down a pair of metalframed reading glasses to get a better view of nate long trip it was nate agreed not over yet shoving his glasses back into place the professor went back to his book and this handsome devil is jesse roses boy the boy kept his head bent over his coloring book but lifted his gaze so his big dark eyes peered out under a thick fringe of black bangs he reached out tugged hopps parka so that she bent down to hear his whisper dont you worry well get him one the door behind the bar swung open and a big black truck in a big white apron came out big mike hopp announced hes the cook was a navy man until one of our local girls caught his eye when she was down in kodiak snared me like a trout big mike said with a grin welcome to lunacy thanks were going to want something good and hot for our new chief of police fish chowders good today big mike told her ought to do the trick unless youd rather bite into some red meat chief it took nate a moment to identify himself as chief a moment when he felt every eye in the room focused on him chowders fine sounds good well have it right up for you then he swung back into the kitchen and nate could hear his bonedeep baritone croon out on baby its cold outside stage set postcard he thought or a play anyway you sliced it he felt like some sort of dusty prop hopp held up a finger to hold nate in place before marching into the lobby he watched her scoot around the counter and snag a key from one of the cubbies as she did the door behind the counter swung open and the bombshell walked out she was blonde as nate thought suited bombshells best with the wavy mass of sunlight hair spilling down to brush very impressive breasts that were showcased by the low scoop of her snug blue sweater it took him a minute to get to the face as the sweater was tucked into jeans so tight they must have bruised several internal organs not that he was complaining the face boasted bright blue eyes with an innocence in direct contrast with the plump red lips she was a little generous on the paint and put him in mind of a barbie doll mankiller barbie despite the restriction of the outfit everything that could jiggle did so as she strolled around the counter on skinny backless heels wiggled her way into the diner and posed languidly against the bar well hello handsome her voice was a throaty purr she mustve practiced it designed to drain the blood out of a mans head and send his iq plummeting to that of a green turnip charlene you behave hopp rattled the key this boys tired and half sick he doesnt have the reserves to deal with you right now chief burke charlene hidel this is her place town budgets paying your room and board here as part of your pay so dont feel obliged to offer anything out in trade hopp youre so bad but charlene smiled like a stroked kitten as she said it why dont i just take you up chief burke get you all settled in then well bring you something hot to eat ill take him up deliberately hopp closed her fist around the key letting the big black room number tag dangle jerks bringing in his gear wouldnt hurt to have rose bring him the chowder mikes dishing up for him though come on ignatious you can socialize when youre not so ready to drop he couldve spoken for himself but he didnt see the point he followed hopp through a doorway and up a flight of steps as obediently as a puppy follows its master he heard someone mutter cheechako in the tone a man uses to spit out bad meat he assumed it was an insult but let it go charlene doesnt mean any harm hopp was saying but she does like to tease a man to death given half a chance dont worry about me mom she gave that foghorn laugh again and slid the key into the lock on room man took off on her about fifteen years back left her with a girl to raise on her own did a decent enough job with meg though theyre at each other like shecats half the time had plenty of men since and they get younger every year i said she was too old for you before hopp looked over her shoulder fact is the way shes been going youre too old for her thirtytwo arent you i was when i left baltimore how many years ago was that hopp shook her head pushed open the door charlenes got better than a dozen years on you got a grown daughter nearly your age might want to keep that in mind i thought you women got off when one of your kind bags a younger man shows what you know about females pisses us off is what it does because we didnt bag him first well this is it he stepped into a woodpaneled room with an iron bed a dresser and mirror on one side and a small round table two chairs and a little desk on the other it was clean it was spare and about as interesting as a bag of white rice little kitchen through here hopp walked over yanked back a blue curtain to reveal a pintsized refrigerator a twoburner stove and a sink the size of nates cupped palm unless cookings your passion or hobby id take my meals downstairs foods good here its not the ritz and shes got fancier rooms but were on a budget she crossed to the other side pushed open a door bathroom this one has indoor plumbing woohoo he poked his head in the sink was bigger than the kitchen s but not by much it didnt rate a tub but the shower stall would do him well enough got your gear chief jerk hauled in two suitcases and a duffel as if they were empty he dumped them on the bed where their weight sagged the mattress need me for anything ill be downstairs grabbing a meal ill bunk here tonight fly back to talkeetna in the morning he tapped a finger on his forehead in salute and clomped out again shit hold on nate started to dig into his pocket ill take care of tipping him hopp said till youre on the clock youre a guest of the lunacy town council appreciate it i plan to see you work for it so well see how it goes room service charlene sang it when she carried a tray into the room her hips swayed like a metronome as she walked over to set it on the table brought you up some nice fish chowder chief and a good mansized sandwich coffees hot smells great i appreciate it ms hidel oh now thats charlene to you she batted the baby blues and yeah nate thought she practiced were just one big happy family around here that were the case we wouldnt need a chief of police oh dont go scaring him off hopp is the room all right for you ignatious nate yes thanks its fine put some food in your belly and get some rest hopp advised you get your second wind just give me a call ill show you around your first official duty will be attending the meeting tomorrow afternoon at town hall where well introduce you to everybody who cares to attend youll want to see the station house before that meet your two deputies and peach and well get you that star star jesse wanted to make sure you were getting a star come on charlene lets leave the man alone you call downstairs you need any little thing charlene sent him an invitational smile any little thing behind charlenes back hopp rolled her eyes toward heaven to settle the matter she clamped a hand on charlenes arm yanked her toward the door there was a clatter of heels on wood a feminine squeak then the slam of the door behind them through it nate could hear charlenes hushed and insulted whats the matter with you hopp i was only being friendly theres innkeeper friendly then theres bordello friendly one of these days youre going to figure out the difference he waited until he was sure they were gone before he crossed over to flip the locks then he pulled off his parka let it fall to the floor dragged off his watch cap dropped it unwound his scarf dropped that unzipped his insulated vest and added it to the heap down to shirt pants thermal underwear and boots he went to the table picked up the soup a spoon and carried both to the dark windows threethirty in the afternoon according to the bedside clock and dark as midnight there were streetlights glowing he noted as he spooned up soup and he could make out the shapes of buildings christmas decorations in colored lights in rooftop santas and cartoon reindeers but no people no life no movement he ate mechanically too tired too hungry to notice the taste there was nothing out that window but the movie set he thought the buildings might have been false fronts the handful of people hed met downstairs just characters in the illusion maybe this was all some elaborate hallucination born out of depression grief anger whatever ugly mix had sent him pinwheeling into the void hed wake up back in his own place in baltimore and try to drum up the energy to go through the motions for another day he got the sandwich ate that standing at the window as well looking out at the empty blackandwhite world with its oddly celebrational lights maybe hed walk out there into that empty world hed become a character in the odd illusion then hed fade to black like the last reel of an old movie and it would be over as he stood half thinking it could be over half wishing it would be a figure stepped into frame it wore red bright and bold that seemed to leap out of that colorless scene and thrum movement into it those movements were definite and brisk life with a mission movement with purpose quick competent strides over the white that left the shadow of footprints in the snow i was here im alive and i was here he couldnt tell if it was a man or woman or a child but there was something about the slash of color the confidence of the gait that caught his eye and interest as if sensing observation the figure stopped looked up nate had the impression of white and black again white face black hair but even that was blurred with the dark and the distance there was a long moment of stillness of silence then the figure began to walk again striding toward the lodge and disappearing from view nate yanked the drapes over the glass stepped away from the window after a moments debate he dragged his cases off the bed left them dumped unpacked on the floor he stripped down ignored the chill of the room against his naked skin and crawled under the mountain of blankets the way a bear crawls into his winter cave he lay there a man of thirtytwo with a thick disordered mass of chestnut hair that waved around a long thin face gone lax with exhaustion and a despair that blurred eyes of smoky gray under a days worth of stubble his skin was pale with the drag of fatigue though the food had eased the rawness in his belly his system remained sluggish like that of a man who couldnt quite shake off a debilitating flu he wished barbie charlene had brought up a bottle instead of the coffee he wasnt much of a drinker which he figured is what had saved him from spiraling into alcoholism along with everything else still a couple of good belts would help turn off his brain and let him sleep he could hear the wind now it hadnt been there before but it was moaning at the windows with it he heard the building creak and the sound of his own breathing three lonely sounds only more lonely as a trio tune them out he told himself tune them all out hed get a couple hours sleep he thought then hed shower off the travel grime pump himself full of coffee after that hed decide what the hell he was going to do he turned off the light so the room plunged into the dark within seconds so did he two the dark surrounded him sucked at him like mud when the dream shoved him out of sleep his breath whooshed out as he broke the surface floundered his way to the air his skin was clammy with sweat as he fought his way clear of blankets the scent in the air was unfamiliar cedar stale coffee some underlying tone of lemon then he remembered he wasnt in his baltimore apartment hed gone crazy and he was in alaska the luminous dial of the bedside clock read five fortyeight so hed gotten some sleep before the dream had chased him back to reality it was always dark in the dream too black night pale dirty rain the smell of cordite and blood jesus nate jesus im hit cold rain streaming down his face warm blood oozing through his fingers his blood and jacks blood he hadnt been able to stop the blood from oozing any more than hed been able to stop the rain from streaming they were both beyond him and in that baltimore alley had washed away what had been left of him shouldve been me he thought not jack he shouldve been home with his wife with his kids and it shouldve been me dying in a filthy alley in the filthy rain but hed gotten off with a bullet in the leg and a second inandout punch in the side just above the waist just enough to take him down slow him down so jack had gone in first seconds small mistakes and a good man was dead he had to live with it hed considered ending his own life but it was a selfish solution and did nothing to honor his friend his partner living with it was harder than dying living was more punishment he got up walked into the bathroom he found himself pathetically grateful for the thin spurt of hot water out of the shower head it was going to take a while for the spurt to carve away what felt like layers of grime and sweat but that was okay time wasnt a problem hed get himself dressed go downstairs have some coffee maybe hed give mayor hopp a call and go down to take a look at the station house see if he could be a little more coherent and brush off some of that first impression of a blearyeyed moron he felt more like himself once hed showered and shaved digging out fresh clothes he layered himself into them picking up his outdoor gear he glanced at himself in the mirror chief of police ignatious burke lunacy alaska he shook his head nearly smiled well chief lets go get you a star he headed downstairs surprised at the relative quiet from what hed read places like the lodge were the gathering spots for locals winter nights were long and dark and lonely and hed expected to hear some bar noise maybe the clatter of pool balls some ancient countrywestern tune from the juke but when he stepped in the beautiful alaskan rose was topping off coffee much as shed been before it mightve been for the same two men nate wasnt sure her boy was sitting at a table coloring industriously nate checked the watch hed set to local time seventen rose turned from the table smiled at him chief quiet tonight her whole face lit with a smile its morning im sorry its seven oclock in the morning bet you could use some breakfast takes a while to get used to it she nodded toward the dark windows itll lighten up for a while in a few hours why dont you have a seat ill bring you coffee to start you off hed slept around the clock and didnt know whether to be embarrassed or delighted he couldnt remember the last time hed gotten more than four or five patchy hours of sleep he dumped his outer gear on the bench of a booth then decided to make an effort at community relations walking over to jesses table he tapped the back of a chair this seat taken the boy took a slow underthebangs peek and shook his head with his tongue caught between his teeth he continued to color as nate sat down pretty cool purple cow nate commented studying the current workinprogress cows dont come in purple less you color them that way i heard that you take art in high school jesses eyes rounded i dont go to school yet cause im only four youre kidding four i figured you for about sixteen nate eased back winked at rose as she brought him a thick white mug and poured coffee into it i had a birthday and we had cake and a million balloons right mom thats right jesse she laid a menu beside nates elbow and were having a baby really soon and ive got two dogs and jesse let chief burke look at his menu actually i was going to ask jesse to give me a recommendation whats good for breakfast jesse short stack short stack it is he handed the menu back to rose were fine if that changes you let me know but she was pink in the cheeks with pleasure what kind of dogs nate asked and was entertained with the exploits of jesses pets throughout breakfast a plate of pancakes and a charming young boy were a much better way to start the day than a recurring nightmare his mood improved nate was on the point of calling hopp when she came through the door heard you were up and around she said and tossed back her hood snow showered from her parka you look some sturdier than you did yesterday sorry i faded on you no problem got yourself a good nights sleep decent breakfast good company she added with a grin for jesse you up for a tour sure he got up to pile on his outdoor gear skinnier than i expected he looked over at hopp he knew he looked gaunt a man dropped more than ten pounds from a tunedup onesixty on a fiveten frame gaunt was the usual result wont be i keep eating short stacks lot of hair he pulled on his watch cap it just keeps growing out of my head i like hair on a man she yanked open the door red hair too its brown he corrected automatically and pulled the cap lower all right get off your feet awhile rose she called back then trudged out into the wind and snow the cold struck him like a runaway train jesus christ it freezes your eyeballs he jumped into the ford explorer shed parked at the curb your bloods thin yet it could be thick as paste and itd still be fucking cold sorry i dont blush at frank language of course its fucking cold its december with her blasting laugh she started the engine well start the tour on wheels no point stumbling around in the dark how many do you lose to exposure and hypothermia in a year lost more than one to the mountains but those mostly tourists or crazies man called teek got himself stupid drunk one night three years ago this january and froze to death in his own outhouse reading playboy magazine but he was an idiot people who live here know how to take care of themselves and cheechakos who make it through a winter learn or leave cheechakos newcomers you dont want to take nature casually but you learn to live with it and if youre smart you make it work for you get out in it ski snowshoe skate the river ice fish she shrugged take precautions and enjoy it because its not going anywhere she drove with steady competence on the snowpacked street theres our clinic we got a doctor and a practical nurse nate studied the small squat building and if they cant handle it fly to anchorage weve got a bush pilot lives outside of town meg galloway a woman you sexist ignatious no maybe just asking megs charlenes daughter damn good pilot a little crazy but a good bush pilots got to be in my opinion shedve brought you in from

corner store got everything you need or theyll find a way to get it oldest building in lunacy trappers built it back in the early s and harry and deb have added to it since they bought the place in it was twice as big as the clinic and two stories lights were already gleaming in the windows post office runs out of the bank there for now but were going to break ground for one this summer and the skinny place next to its the italian place good pizza no deliveries outside of town pizza parlor new york italian came up here three years back on a hunting trip fell in love never left johnny trivani

it still looked like that stage set to nate and far from real even farther from being his fire department all volunteer runs out of there and heres the town hall she eased the car to a stop in front of a wide log building my husband helped build this hall thirteen years ago he was the first mayor of lunacy and held that post until he died four years ago next february howd he die heart attack playing hockey out on the lake slapped in a goal keeled over and died just like him nate waited a beat who won hopp hooted with laughter his goal tied it up they never did finish that game she eased the car forward heres your place nate peered out through the dark and the spitting snow it was a trim building wood frame and obviously newer than its companions it was bungalow style with a small enclosed porch and two windows on either side of the door both of them framed with dark green shutters a path had been shoveled out or tromped down from the street to the door and a short driveway recently plowed from the looks of it was already buried under a couple inches of fresh snow a blue pickup truck was parked on it and another narrow walking path snaked its way to the door lights burned against both windows and smoke puffed out a gray cloud from the black chimney pipe in the roof we open for business that you are they know youre coming in today she swung in behind the pickup ready to meet your team as ill ever be he got out found he was just as shocked by the cold this time around breathing through his teeth he walked behind hopp down the singlelane path to the outer door this is what we call an arctic entry up here she stepped inside the enclosure out of the wind and weather helps keep down the heat loss from the main building good place to stow your parka she pulled hers off hung it on a hook beside another nate followed suit then dragged off his gloves stuck them in one of the parkas pockets then came the watch cap the scarf he wondered if hed ever get used to outfitting himself like an explorer on the north pole every time he had to go out a door hopp pushed through the other door and into the scent of wood smoke and coffee the walls were painted industrial beige the floors were speckled linoleum a squat woodstove stood in the back right corner on it a big castiron kettle chugged steam from its spout there were two metal desks kissing each other on the right side of the room and a line of plastic chairs a low table with magazines arranged on the other along the back wall ranged a counter topped with a twoway a computer and ceramic tabletop christmas tree in a green that nature never intended he noted the doors on either side of it the bulletin board where notes and notices were pinned and the three people who were pretending not to stare at him he assumed the two men were his deputies one looked barely old enough to vote and the other looked old enough to have voted for kennedy both wore heavy wool pants sturdy boots and flannel shirts with badges pinned to them the younger one was native alaskan with black rulerstraight hair falling nearly to his shoulders deepset almondshaped eyes dark as midnight and a painfully young innocent look to his fineboned face the older was windburned crew cut sagging in the jowls and was squinting out of faded blue eyes fanned by deep grooves his thick build contrasted with the delicacy of his counterpart nate thought he might be exmilitary the woman was round as a berry with plump pink cheeks and a generous bosom under a pink sweater embroidered with white snowflakes her saltandpepper hair was braided into a topofthehead bun she had a pencil sticking out of it and a plate of sticky buns in her hands well the gangs all here chief ignatious burke this is your staff deputy otto gruber crew cut stepped forward held out a hand chief deputy gruber deputy peter notti chief burke something in the hesitant smile rang a bell deputy are you and rose related yes sir shes

youre feeling better fine thank you ms peach im going to show the chief the rest of the station then ill leave you all to get acquainted ignatious why dont we take a look at your guest quarters she led the way through the door on the right there were two cells both with bunkstyle cots the walls looked freshly painted the floor recently scrubbed he smelled lysol there were no tenants these get much use nate asked her drunks and disorderlies primarily you have to be pretty drunk and disorderly to warrant a night in jail in lunacy youre going to see some assaults occasional vandalism but that ones mostly from bored kids ill let your staff give you the lowdown on crime in lunacy we dont have a lawyer so if somebody wants one bad enough they have to call down to anchorage or over to fairbanks unless they know one somewhere else we do have a retired judge but hes more likely to be off ice fishing than answering legal questions okay boy you going to keep talking my ear off i never could learn to keep my mouth shut with a halfchuckle she shook her head lets take a look at your office they cut back through the main area where everyone was pretending to work on the other side of ms peachs counter just through the doorway stood the weapons cabinet he counted six shotguns five rifles eight handguns and four wickedlooking knives he tucked his hands in his pockets pursed his lips what no broadsword pays to be prepared yeah for the coming invasion she only smiled and walked through the door next to the cabinet heres your office it was about ten feet square with a window behind a gray metal desk the desk held a computer a phone and a black gooseneck lamp two file cabinets were shoved against the side wall with a short counter running beside them it held a coffeemaker already full and two brown stoneware mugs a basket with packaged creamer and sugar there was a corkboard empty two folding chairs for visitors and pegs for hanging coats the lights mirroring against the black window glass made it seem all the more impersonal and foreign peach loaded up your desk but if you need anything else supply cabinets down the hall johns across from it okay got any questions ive got a lot of questions why dont you ask them all right ill ask this one since the rest fall down from it anyway whyd you hire me fair enough mind she said as she gestured to the coffeepot help yourself she poured mugs for both of them handed him one then sat in one of the folding chairs we needed a chief of police maybe were small were remote and we pretty much handle our own but that doesnt mean we dont need structure ignatious that we dont need a line between the right and the wrong and somebody to stand on that line my man worked for that a lot of years before he sank his last puck and now you do thats right now i do added to that having our own police force here means we keep on handling our own keep the feds and the state out of it town like this can get ignored because of what it is and where it is but we got a police force here now a fire department weve got a good school good lodge a weekly newspaper a radio station weather comes in and cuts us off we know how to be selfsufficient but we need order and this building and the people in it are symbols of that order you hired a symbol on one hand thats just what i did her nutbrown eyes held his people feel more secure with symbols on the other i expect you to do your job and a big part of the job besides keeping order is community relations which is why i took the time to show you some of the towns businesses give you names of who runs what theres more bings got a garage fix any engine you bring in and he runs heavy equipment snowplow backhoe lunatic air runs cargo and people and brings supplies into town takes them into the bush lunatic air thats meg for you hopp said with a halfsmile were on the edge of the interior here and weve built ourselves up from a settlement of boomers and hippies and badasses to a solid town youll get to know the people of that town the relationships the grudges and the connections then youll know how to handle them which brings me back why did you hire me why not somebody who knows all that already seems to me somebody who knew all that already might come into this job with an agenda of his or her own grudges connections of his or her own bring somebody from outside they come in fresh youre young that weighed in your favor you dont have a wife and children who might not take to the life here and pressure you to go back to the lower youve got over ten years experience with the police you had the qualifications i was looking for and you didnt haggle over the salary i see your point but theres the other side i dont know what the hell im doing mmm she finished off her coffee you strike me as a bright young man youll figure it out now she pushed to her feet im going to let you get started meetings at two town hall youre going to want to say a few words oh boy one more thing she dug in her pocket pulled out a box youll need this opening it she took out the silver star then pinned it to his shirt see you at two chief he stood where he was in the center of the room contemplating his coffee as he heard the muted voices outside he didnt know what he was doing that was gods truth so the best he could think of was to mark some sort of beginning and go from there hopp was right he had no wife no children he had no one and nothing pulling him back to the lower to the world if he was going to stay here then he had to make good if he blew this this strange chance at the end of the universe there was nowhere left to go nothing left to do his stomach jittered with the same sort of queasy nerves hed experienced on the plane as he carried his coffee out to the communal area ah if i could have a couple minutes he wasnt sure where to stand then realized he shouldnt be standing at all he set down his coffee then walked over to grab two of the plastic chairs after carrying them over to the desks he retrieved his coffee worked up a smile for peach ms peach would you come on over and sit down and though the short stack was heavy in his belly he boosted up the smile maybe you could bring those cinnamon buns with you they sure smell tempting obviously pleased she brought over the plate and a stack of napkins you boys just help yourselves i gotta figure this is at least as awkward for all of you as it is for me nate began as he plopped a bun on a napkin you dont know me dont know what kind of cop i am what kind of man i am im not from around here and i dont know a damn thing about this part of the world and youre supposed to take orders from me youre going to take orders from me he corrected and bit into the bun this is pure sin ms peach its the lard that does it i bet he envisioned every one of his arteries slamming shut its hard to take orders from somebody you dont know dont trust youve got no reason to trust me yet im going to make mistakes i dont mind you pointing them out to me as long as you point them out in private im also going to rely on you all of you to bring me up to speed things i should know people i should know but for right now im going to ask if any of you have a problem with me lets get it out in the open now deal with it otto took a slurp of his coffee i dont know if ive got a problem until i see what youre made of fair enough you find youve got one you tell me maybe ill see it your way maybe ill tell you to go to hell but well know where we stand chief burke nate looked over at peter its nate i hope to god you people arent going to take a page from mayor hopp and call me ignatious all the damn time well i was thinking that maybe at first me or otto should go with you on calls and on patrol until you get to know your way around thats a good idea ms peach and ill start working out a shift schedule week by week you can start calling me peach now id just like to say i expect this place to stay clean and that chores which includes scrubbing the bathroom otto get put on the schedule like everything else mops and buckets and brooms arent tools just for women i signed on as deputy not as a maid she had a soft motherly face and like any mother worth her salt could sear a hole through steel with one firm look and im being paid to work as dispatcher and secretary not to scrub toilets but what has to be done has to be done why dont we rotate those chores for the time being nate interrupted as he could see combat fire light both faces and ill talk to mayor hopp about our budget maybe we can squeeze out enough to hire somebody to come in and swab us out once a week who has the keys to the weapon cabinet theyre locked in my drawer peach told him id like to have them and id like to know what weapons each of you deputies is qualified for if its a gun i can shoot it otto retorted that may be true but were wearing badges he tipped his chair back so he could see the gun otto wore in a belt holster you want to stick with the for your service revolver its my own and it suits me thats fine im going to take the mm sig from the cabinet peter you comfortable with the nine youre carrying yes sir peach can you handle a firearm ive got my fathers colt revolver locked in my desk too he taught me how to shoot when i was five and i can handle anything in that cabinet the same as gi joe here i served in the corps otto retorted with some heat im a marine okay then nate cleared his throat how many residents would you say own weapons the three of them stared at him until finally ottos lips quirked up thatd be about all of them great do we have a list of those residents whore licensed to carry concealed i can get that for you peach offered thatll be good and would there be a copy of town ordinances ill get it one last nate said as peach got up if we have occasion to arrest anyone who sets bail decides on the term the payment of fine and so on there was a long silence before peter spoke i guess you do chief nate blew out a breath wont that be fun he went back into his office taking the paperwork peach gave him it didnt take long to read through it but it gave him something to pin up on his corkboard he was lining up pages tacking them on when peach came in got those keys for you nate these here are for the gun cabinet these are for the station doors front and back the cells and your car everythings labeled my car whatve i got grand cherokee its parked out on the street she dumped keys into his hand hopp said one of us should show you how you work the heat block for the engine hed read about those too heaters designed to keep an engine warm when at rest in subzero temperatures well get to it suns coming up what he turned looked out the window then he just stood his arms at his side the keys weighing down his hand as the sun bloomed orange and rose in the sky the mountains came alive under it massive and white with the gold streaks sliding over them they filled his window left him speechless nothing like your first winter sunrise in alaska i guess not mesmerized he stepped closer to the window he could see the river where hed landed a long saggy dock he hadnt noticed before and the sheen of ice under the lightening sky there were hills of snow a huddle of houses stands of trees and he noted people there were people bundled up so thickly they looked like globs of color gliding over the white there was smoke rising and jesus was that an eagle soaring overahead and as he watched a group of kids went running toward the iced ribbon of river hockey sticks and skates over their shoulders and the mountains stood over it all like gods watching them he forgot about the cold the wind the isolation and his own quiet misery watching them he felt alive three maybe it was too damn cold maybe people were on their best behavior or it might have been that the holiday spirit was entrenched in that week between christmas and new years but it was nearly noon before the first call came in nate peach came to his door holding a couple of knitting needles and a hank of purple wool charlene called from the lodge seems a couple of the boys got into a ruckus over a game of pool some pushyshovey going on all right he got to his feet fishing a quarter out of his pocket as he walked out call it he said to otto and peter heads otto set down his field stream while nate flipped the coin in the air he slapped it on the back of his hand tails okay peter youll come with me little altercation over at the lodge he snagged a twoway hooked it to his belt he stepped into the entry began dragging on gear if it hasnt broken up by the time we get there he said to peter i want you to tell me the players straight off give me the picture is it something thats going to turn nasty or can we resolve it with a few strong words he shoved out the door into the blast of cold air that mine he asked nodding toward the black jeep at the curb yes sir and that cord plugged into that pole there would be attached to the heater on the engine youll need it if its going to sit for any time theres a mylar blanket in the back and thatll cover up the engine and keep the heat in for up to twentyfour hours maybe but sometimes people forget to take them off and then youre going to overheat jumper cables in the back too he continued as he pulled the plug emergency flares and firstaid kit and well go over all that nate interrupted and wondered if navigating down a road called lunatic street would entail the need of emergency flares and first aid lets see if i can get us to the lodge in one piece he climbed behind the wheel stuck the key in the ignition heated seats he noted there is a god the town looked different in the daylight no doubt about it smaller somehow nate thought as he maneuvered on the hardpacked snow exhaust had blacked the white at the curbs and the storefront windows werent exactly sparkling and most of the christmas decorations looked the worse for wear in the sunlight it wasnt a postcard unless you looked beyond to the mountains but it was a few solid steps up from dreary rugged was a better term he decided it was a settlement carved out of ice and snow and rock snugged tight to a winding river flanked by forests where he could easily imagine wolves roaming he wondered if forest meant bear too but decided it wasnt worth worrying about until spring unless all that hibernation talk was bullshit it took less than two minutes to drive from station house to lodge he saw a total often people on the street and passed a brawny pickup a clunky suv and counted three parked snowmobiles and one set of skis propped against the side of the italian place it seemed people didnt exactly hibernate in lunacy whatever the bears did he went to the main door of the lodge and walked through it just ahead of peter it hadnt broken up he could hear that plainly enough through the shouts of encouragement kick his fat ass mackie and the thud of bodies and grunts what nate calculated was that a lunacystyle crowd had gathered consisting of five men in flannel one of which turned out to be a woman on closer inspection encircled by them two men with shaggy brown hair were rolling around on the floor trying to land shortarm punches on each other the only weapon he saw was a broken pool cue mackie brothers peter told him brothers yeah twins theyve been beating the hell out of each other since they were in the womb hardly ever take a swing at anyone else okay nate nudged his way through the press of bodies the sight of him had the shouts toning down to murmurs as he waded in and hauled the top mackie off the bottom mackie all right break it up stay down he ordered but mackie number two was already springing up rearing back he landed a solid roundhouse to his brothers jaw red river numbnuts he shouted then did a victory dance fists lifted high as his brother slumped in nates arms peter for christs sake nate said as his deputy remained immobile oh sorry chief jim settle down instead jim mackie continued to bounce in his wolverines to the cheers of the crowd nate saw money being exchanged but decided to ignore it take this one nate shoved the unconscious man into peter then stepped up to the selfproclaimed champ the deputy gave you an order yeah he grinned showing blood on his teeth and an unholy gleam in a pair of brown eyes so what i dont have to take orders from that shithead yeah you do ill show you why nate spun the man around shoved him against the wall had his hands behind his back and cuffed in under ten seconds hey was the best the reigning champ could manage give me grief and youll sit in a cell for resisting arrest among other things peter bring that one over to the station when he wakes up with no apparent loyalty the crowd shifted its support to nate with catcalls and whistles as he muscled jim mackie toward the door nate paused when he saw charlene ease out of the kitchen you looking to press charges he asked her she stared finally blinked i well hell i dont know nobodys ever asked me that before what kind of charges they broke some stuff back there oh well they always pay for it after but they did run off a couple of tourists who were going to order lunch bill started it oh now jim you both start it every time ive told you i dont want you coming in here fighting and causing a ruckus that runs people off i dont want to press charges exactly i just want this nonsense to stop and payment for damages got it lets go sort this out jim i dont see why i have to nate solved the matter by pushing him out into the cold hey christs sake i need my gear deputy notti will bring it get in the car or stand here and get frostbite up to you he yanked the door open gave jim a heave inside once nate was behind the wheel jim had recovered some dignity despite the bleeding mouth and puffy eye i dont think this is the way to treat people it aint right i dont think its right to coldcock your brother when somebodys holding his arms jim had the grace to look chagrined and dipped his chin onto his chest i was caught up heat of the moment and the son of a bitch pissed me off youre that outsiders come to be chief of police arent you youre a quick study jim jim sulked during the short drive to the station house then he trudged along as nate took him inside lower here he said the minute he spotted otto and peach he doesnt understand how things are done in lunacy why dont you explain it all to him there was a light in ottos eyes it mightve been glee need the firstaid kit step into my office jim nate led him in pushed him into a chair then after unhooking one of the cuffs snapped it onto the arm of the chair aw come on if i was going anywhere i could just take this little dink of a chair with me sure you could then id add stealing police property to the mix jim sulked some more he was a bony man of about thirty with a shaggy mop of brown hair a narrow face sunken at the cheeks his eyes were brown with the left puffing up nicely from one of those shortarmed punches his lip was split and continued to dribble blood i dont like you he decided thats not against the law disturbing the peace destroying property assault those are round here a man wants to pound on his fool of a brother its his business not anymore round here these days a mans going to show respect for private property and public property hes going to show respect for duly designated officers of the law peter that little shithead thats deputy shithead now jim blew a sighing breath that had blood spitting out along with the air christs sake ive known him since before he was born when hes wearing a badge and he tells you to settle down you settle whether or not youve known him in vitro jim managed to look both interested and baffled i dont know what the hell youre talking about i get that he glanced over as peach came in got the firstaid kit and an ice pack she flipped the ice pack to jim set the kit on the desk in front of nate then she fisted her hands on her hips jim mackie you just dont grow any smarter do you it was bill started it flushing he pressed the ice pack to his bleeding lip so you say where is bill peters bringing him along nate said when he wakes up peach sniffed your mothers likely to blacken your other eye when she has to bail you out with that prediction she walked out snapped the door closed jeez youre not going to put me in jail for punching my own brother i could maybe ill cut you some slack seeing as this is my first day on the job nate leaned back what were you fighting about okay listen to this gearing up for his own defense jim slapped his hands on his knees that brainless jackass said how stagecoach was the best western ever made when everybody knows its red river nate said nothing for a long moment thats it well christs sakes just want to be clear you and your brother whaled on each other because you disagreed about the relative merits of stagecoach versus red river in the john wayne oeuvre in his what you were fighting over john wayne movies jim shifted on his seat guess well settle up with charlene can i go now youll settle up with charlene and youll pay a fine of a hundred dollars each for creating a public nuisance oh hell now you cant i can nate leaned forward and jim got a good look at cool quiet gray eyes that made him want to squirm in his seat jim listen to what im saying to you i dont want you or bill fighting in the lodge anywhere else for that matter but for just this minute well pinpoint the lodge theres a young boy who spends most of his day there well hell rose always takes jesse back in the kitchen if theres a ruckus me and bill we wouldnt do nothing to hurt that kid were just you know highspirited youll have to lower those spirits when youre in town a hundred dollars you can pay peach within the next twentyfour hours you dont im going to double the fine for every day youre late meeting the terms if you dont want to pay the fine you can spend the next three days in our fine accommodations here well pay it he muttered shifted sighed but christs sake stagecoach personally i like rio bravo jim opened his mouth shut it again obviously he took a moment to consider the consequences its a damn good movie he said after a moment but it aint no red river if nuisance calls were to be the norm nate considered he might have made the right decision in coming to lunacy sibling brawls were probably his top speed these days he wasnt looking for challenges the mackie brothers hadnt posed one his round with bill had gone along the same lines as his round with jim though bill had argued passionately and with considerable articulation regarding stagecoach he hadnt seemed nearly as upset at being punched in the face as he was about having his favorite movie dissed peter stuck his head in the door chief charlene says you should come over and have lunch on the house i appreciate that but ive got to get ready for this meeting and he hadnt missed the gleam in charlenes eyes when hed hauled off jim mackie id like you to follow this one through peter go on over there get a list of damages and replacement costs from charlene see that the mackie boys get it and pay the freight within fortyeight hours sure thing you handled that real slick chief wasnt much to handle im going to write the report im going to want you to look it over add anything you feel necessary he looked around when he heard a windowrattling roar earthquake volcano nuclear war beaver peter told him i dont care if it is alaska you dont have beavers big enough to sound like that with an appreciative laugh peter gestured to the window meg galloways plane its a beaver shes bringing in supplies swiveling around nate caught sight of the red plane one that looked the size of a toy to him recalling hed actually flown on one of about the same size he felt the little pitch in the belly and turned away again grateful for the distraction he pressed his intercom button when it buzzed yes peach a couple of kids pitching ice balls at the school windows broke one before they ran off we got id yes indeed all three of them he considered a moment worked down the order of things see if otto can take it he looked back at pete question no no sir then he grinned just nice to be doing thats all yeah doings good he kept himself busy doing until it was time to leave for the meeting they were primarily housekeeping and organizational chores but it helped nate feel as if he was making his place for however long the place was his hed signed on for a year but both he and the town council had a sixtyday grace period when either side could opt out it steadied him to know he could leave tomorrow if he chose or next week if he was here at the end of two months he should know if hed stick for the term of contract he opted to walk to town hall it seemed wimpy somehow to drive so short a distance the sky was a clear hard blue that had the white mass of mountains standing against it as if etched with a thin sharp knife the temperatures hovered at inhuman but he saw a couple of kids burst out of the corner store with candy bars in their fists just as kids everywhere burst out of doors with candy full of greed and anticipation the minute they raced down the sidewalk hands appeared at the door to turn the open sign around to closed more cars and trucks were parked on the street now and others easing along the snowpacked road it looked like theyd have a full house at the town meeting he felt a quick twist in his gut one he recognized from his public speaking course in college a hideous mistake as an elective live and learn he enjoyed a reasonable amount of conversation give him a suspect to interrogate a witness to interview no problem or it hadnt been once upon a time but ask him to stand up in front of an audience of some sort and speak in coherent sentences flop sweat was already snaking a line down his back just get through it he ordered himself get through the next hour and youll never have to do this again probably he stepped inside into heat and a hubbub of voices a number of people stood around a lobby area dominated by the biggest fish nate had ever seen he was baffled enough to focus on it wonder if it was perhaps some sort of small mutant whale and how in gods name someone had caught it much less managed to mount it to the wall the distraction saved him from worrying overmuch about the number of people looking in his direction and the number already inside the meeting area sitting on folding chairs and facing a stage and lectern king salmon hopp said from behind him he kept staring at the enormous silver fish that showed its black gums in a kind of sneer thats a salmon ive eaten salmon ive had salmon in restaurants theyre like this big he held out his hands to measure you havent eaten alaskan king salmon then but truth to tell this ones a big son of a bitch my husband caught it came in at ninetytwo pounds two ounces short of the state record but a hell of a prize what did he use a forklift she let out her foghorn laugh slapped him merrily on the shoulder you fish no at all got nothing against it just never have he turned then and his brows shot up shed decked herself out in a sharplooking business suit with tiny black and white checks there were pearls at her ears and a slick coat of red lipstick on her mouth you look impressive mayor a twohundredyearold redwood looks impressive well i was going to say you look hot but i thought it would be inappropriate she smiled broadly youre a clever boy ignatious not really not so much if i can look hot you can be clever its all presentation now why dont we get this show on the road by me introducing you to the town council members then well do our little speeches she took his arm the way a woman might as she led a man through a cocktail party crowd heard you dealt with the mackie brothers already just a little disagreement over westerns i like those clint eastwood movies myself the early ones ed woolcott come over here and meet our new chief of police he met woolcott a toughlooking man in his fifties who gave nates hand a politicians shake his hair was gray and full brushed back from a craggy face a tiny white scar cut through his left eyebrow i run the bank he told nate which explained the navy blue suit and pinstriped tie i expect youll be opening an account with us shortly ill have to take care of that were not here to drum up business ed let me finish showing ignatious off he met deb and harry miner who ran the corner store alan b royce the retired judge walter notti peters father musher and sleddog breeder all of whom were on the town council ken darby our doctor will be along when he can thats okay its going to take a while to keep this all straight anyway then there was bess mackie a beanpole with a shock of hennacolored hair who planted herself in front of him crossed her arms over her thin chest and sniffed you roust my boys today yes maam you could say that she drew another sharp breath through her thin nostrils nodded twice good next time you knock their heads together save me the trouble it was nate decided as she strode off to find a seat a warm enough welcome considering hopp worked him toward the stage where chairs were set up for her and nate and for woolcott who served as deputy mayor debs going to start things off with some town business announcements and such hopp explained then edll have his say introduce me ill have mine introduce you after you say your piece well close it down might be some questions here and there nate felt his stomach sink okay she motioned him to a chair took her own then nodded at deb miner deb a stocky woman with a pretty face framed by wispy blond hair stepped onto the stage took her place behind the lectern the mike buzzed and squeaked while she adjusted it and her throat clearing could be heard echoing through the hall afternoon everybody before we get to our main business i have some announcements the new years eve celebration at the lodge is going to get rolling about nine oclock live musics provided by the caribous well be passing the hat for the entertainment so dont be stingy the schools holding a spaghetti supper a week from friday proceeds going to the uniform fund for the hockey team we got a good chance at making regional champs so lets put the team in uniforms we can be proud of they start serving at five dinner includes the entree a salad a roll and a soft drink adults six dollars children six to twelve four dollars under six eat free she went from there to details about an upcoming movie night being held at town hall nate listened with half an ear tried not to obsess about his turn at the mike then he saw her walk in the red parka and something about the way she moved told him he was looking at the same woman hed seen out his window the night before her hood was black and she wore a black watch cap over her hair a lot of black straight hair her face seemed very pale against the two strong colors her cheekbones very high in that black frame even across the hall he could see her eyes were blue a bright glacial blue she carried a canvas satchel over her shoulder and wore baggy mannish trousers with scarred black boots those icy blue eyes zeroed straight to his held as she strode down the center aisle formed by the folding chairs then scooted into one beside a whippily built man who looked to be native they didnt speak but something told nate they were not intimate not physically but in tune she shrugged out of the parka while deb moved from movie night to announcements about the upcoming hockey game under the parka was an olive green sweater under the sweater if nate was any judge was a tough athletic little body he was trying to decide if she was pretty she shouldnt have been her eyebrows were too straight her nose a little crooked her mouth was topheavy but even as he mentally listed the flaws something stirred in his belly interesting was all he could think hed stayed away from women the last several months which given his state of mind hadnt been a real hardship but this chillylooking woman had his juices flowing again she opened the knapsack took out a brown bag and to nates baffled amusement dipped a hand in and came out with a fistful of popcorn she munched away offering some to her seat companion while deb finished up the announcements while ed took the lectern made his comments about the town council and the progress theyd made the newcomer pulled a silver thermos out of her sack and poured what looked to be black coffee into its cup who the hell was she the daughter of the native guy the ages were about right but there was no family resemblance he could see she didnt flush or flutter when he stared at her but nibbled her snack sipped her coffee and stared right back there was applause as hopp was introduced with an effort nate forced himself to put his head back in the game im not going to waste time politicking up here we decided to incorporate our town because we want to take care of our own in the tradition of our great state we voted to build the police station to form a police department now we went through a lot of debating a lot of hot words on all sides and a lot of good hard sense too on all sides the upshot was we voted to bring in a man from outside a man with experience and no connection to lunacy so hed be fair so hed be smart so hed enforce the law without prejudice and with equality proved that much today when he slapped cuffs on jim mackie for wrestling around with his brother at the lodge there were some chuckles over that and the mackie brothers faces battered grinned from their chairs fined us too jim called out and thats two hundred in the town coffers way you two carry on youll pay for the new fire truck were wanting by yourselves ignatious burke comes to us from baltimore maryland where he served on the baltimore police department for eleven years eight of those years as detective were lucky to have somebody with chief burkes qualifications looking after us lunatics so put your hands together and welcome our new chief of police as they did nate thought oh shit and pushed himself to his feet he stepped toward the lectern his mind as blank as a fresh blackboard and from the crowd someone called out cheechako there were murmurs mutters and a rise of voices poised on argument the irritation that spiked through him carved away the nerves thats right i am cheechako an outsider fresh from the lower the murmurs quieted as he scanned the crowd most of what i know about alaska i got out of a guidebook or off the internet or from movies i dont know much more about this town except its damn cold the mackie brothers like to pound each other and youve got a view thatll stop a mans heart in his chest but i know how to be a cop and thats why im here used to know he thought used to know how and his palms went damp he was going to fumble he could feel it then his gaze met those glacier blue eyes of the woman in red her lips curved just a little and her eyes stayed on his as she lifted the silver cup to sip he heard himself speak maybe it was just to her its my job to protect and serve this town and thats what ill do maybe youll resent me coming from outside and telling you what you cant do but well all have to get used to it ill do my best youre the ones wholl decide if thats good enough thats it there was a sprinkling of applause then it grew nate found his gaze locked with the blueeyed womans again his stomach knotted unknotted knotted up again as that topheavy mouth tipped up at one corner in an odd little smile he heard hopp adjourn the meeting several people surged forward to speak to him and he lost the woman in the crowd when he caught sight of her again it was to see the red parka heading out the back doors who was that he eased back until he could touch hopps arm the woman who came in late red parka black hair blue eyes that would be meg meg galloway charlenes girl shed wanted a good look at him a better look than the one shed caught the day before when hed stood in the window looking like the brooding and bitter hero of some gothic novel he was goodlooking enough for the part she decided but up close he seemed more sad than bitter too bad really bitter was more her style hed handled himself shed give him that rolled with the insult that asshole bing said his piece and after a little hitch moved on she supposed if they had to have a police force poking around lunacy they couldve done worse didnt matter to her as long as he didnt stick his nose in her business since she was in town she decided to run a few errands load up on supplies she saw the closed sign on the corner store sighed heavily then fished her ring of keys out of her bag she found the one marked cs then let herself in grabbing a couple of boxes she began to work her way through the aisle dry cereal pasta eggs canned goods toilet paper flour sugar she dumped one box on the counter filled the second she was hauling over a fiftypound bag of dog chow when the door opened and nate walked in theyre closed meg huffed out as she set the bag on the floor by the counter so i see if you see theyre closed whatre you doing in here funny that was my question need stuff she walked behind the counter picked out a couple of boxes of ammo to add to her box figured that but generally when people who need stuff take it from a closed store its called stealing ive heard that from under the counter she took a large record book nipped through i bet they arrest people for that down the lower they do regularly you intend to implement that policy here in lunacy i do regularly she gave a quick laugh the fog to hopps foghorn found a pen and began writing in the book well just let me finish up here then you can take me in thatll be three arrests for you today gotta be a record he leaned on the counter noted that she was neatly listing all the items in her two boxes be wasting my time yeah but we got plenty of that around here damn forgot the murphys you mind murphys oil soap right over there sure he walked over scanned the contents on the shelves and picked up a bottle i saw you last night out my window she wrote down the murphys i saw you back youre a bush pilot im a lot of things her gaze lifted to his thats one of them what else are you big city cop like you should be able to find that out quick enough got some of it you cook got a dog probably a couple goodsized dogs you like your own space youre honest at least when it suits you you like your coffee black and plenty of butter on your popcorn not much of a scratch on the surface she tapped the pen against the book you looking to scratch some more chief burke direct he thought hed left out direct so hed be direct back thinking about it she smiled the way she had in the hall with the right corner of her mouth lifting before the left charlene jumped you yet excuse me im wondering if you got charlenes special welcome to lunacy last night he wasnt sure which irritated him more the question or the cool way she watched him as she asked no not your type not so much no and im not real comfortable discussing your mother this way got sensitivity do you dont worry about it everybody knows charlene likes to rattle the headboard with every goodlooking man comes through here thing is i tend to steer clear of her leftovers but seeing the way it is for now maybe ill give you a chance to scratch she closed the book replaced it want to give me a hand loading this stuff into the truck sure but i thought you flew in did a friend and i switched modes of transportation okay he hauled the dog food bag over his shoulder she had a brawny red pickup outside with a tarp camping gear snowshoes and a couple of cans of gas already in the bed there was a gun rack in the cab loaded with a shotgun and a rifle you hunt he asked her depends on the game she slapped the gate of the truck bed into place then just grinned at him what the hell are you doing here chief burke nate and ill let you know when i figure it out fair enough maybe ill see you new years eve well see how we socialize she climbed into the truck turned the key aerosmith blasted out about the same old song and dance and she pulled into the street she headed west where the sun was already sliding behind the peaks turning them flaming gold while the light went soft with twilight it was threefifteen in the afternoon four journal entry february fucking cold were not talking about it or well go crazy but ill write about it here then i can look back one day maybe in july when im sitting out with a beer covered in bug dope and slapping at the sparrowsized mosquitoes and staring out at this white bitch ill know i was here that i did it and that beer will taste all the sweeter but right now its february and julys a century away the bitch rules winds taking us down to thirty or forty below once youre down that far it doesnt seem like a few degrees one way or another matters cold broke one of the lanterns and snapped the zipper on my parka with night lasting sixteen hours we make and break camp in the dark taking a piss becomes an exercise in exhaustion and misery still our spirits are holding for the most part you cant buy this kind of experience when the cold is like broken glass lacerating your throat you know youre alive in a way you can only be alive on a mountain when you risk a moment outside shelter and see the northern lights so brilliant so electric that you think you could reach up and grab some of that shimmering green and pull it inside yourself for a charge you know you dont want to be alive anywhere else our progress is slow but were not giving up on the goal of reaching the summit we were slowed by avalanche debris i wondered how many had camped there under what is now buried and barren and how soon the mountain will shift or shimmy and bury the snow cave we fought to hack into her we had a short screaming argument over how to circumvent the debris i took the lead we spent what seemed like two lifetimes getting through and around it but it couldnt have been done any faster no matter what anyone else thinks its a hazardous area known as quicksand pass because the glaciers moving under you you cant see it cant feel it but shes slipping and sliding her way under you and she can suck you down because beneath that world of white are crevices just waiting to make themselves your coffin we picked our way up lonely ridge ice axes ringing frost clinging to our eyelashes and after battling our way around satans chimney had lunch on a picnic blanket of untouched snow the sun was a ball of gold ice i risked a few pictures but was afraid the cold would break the camera there was little grace but plenty of passion in the postlunch climb maybe it was the speed wed popped for dessert but we kicked and cursed the mountain and each other we beat steps into the snow for what seemed like hours while that golden ball began to sink and turn a vicious violent orange that set fire to the snow then left us in the killing dark we used our headlamps to give us enough light to chop a tent ledge into the ice were camped here listening to the wind blow like a storm surf through the night easing our exhaustion with some prime weed and the success of the day weve taken to calling one another by code names from star wars were now han luke and darth im luke we entertained ourselves pretending we were on the ice planet hoth on a mission to destroy an empire stronghold of course that means darths working against us but that adds to the fun hey whatever floats your boat we made good progress today but were getting jumpy it felt good to carve my ice ax into no names belly inching my way up her there was a lot of shouting insults motivational at first then turning on an edge as ice chunks rained down darth took some in the face and cursed me for the next hour for a minute today i thought he was going to lose it and try to bloody my face as i had his even now i can feel him stewing about it boring the occasional dirty look at the back of my head while hans snoring starts to compete with the wind hell get over it were a team and each one of us has the others lives in his hands so hell get over it when we start climbing again maybe we should ease off the speed but a couple of pops gives you a nice rush and helps beat off the cold and fatigue theres nothing like this in the world the blinding sparkle of snow the sound of axes slapping ice or squeaking through snow the scrape of crampon on rock the freefalling wonder of the rope and watching the ice fire with sunset even now huddled in the tent as i write this my belly roiling from our dinner of freezedried stew my body aching from the abuse and fear of frostbite and death gnawing like a rat at the back of my brain i wouldnt be anywhere else by seven nate figured hed put in a long enough day he carried a radio phone with him if anyone called the station after hours the call would be bounced to his phone hed have preferred eating in his room alone in the quiet so his brain could unclog from all the details jammed into it throughout the day and because hed prefer alone but he wasnt going to get anywhere in this town by secluding himself so he slid into an empty booth in the lodge he could hear the crack of pool balls and the whining country on the juke from the next room several men were hoisted on bar stools downing beers while they watched a hockey game on television the eating area was more than half full with a waitress hed yet to meet serving and clearing the man hopp had introduced as the professor wound his way through tables to nates booth he wore his tweed jacket with ulysses tucked in the pocket and carried a mug of beer mind if i join you go ahead john malmont youre after a drink youd get it faster going to the bar youre after food cissyll work her way around here in a minute foods what i want no hurry place is busy tonight is that usual only two places you can get hot food you dont have to cook yourself only one you can get hard liquor well that answers that lunatics are a fairly social lot with each other in any case add the holidays you get full tables halibuts good tonight yeah nate picked up the menu you lived here long sixteen years now pittsburgh originally he said anticipating the question taught at carnegie mellon what did you teach english literature to ambitious young minds many of whom enjoyed the smug position of dissecting and critiquing the longdead white men theyd come to study and now now i teach literature and composition to bored teenagers many of whom would prefer to be groping one another rather than exploring the wonders of the written word hey professor cissy chief burke meet cecilia fisher nice to meet you cissy she was skinny as a broomstick with short spiky hair in several shades of red and a silver ring pierced into her left eyebrow she offered him a sunny smile you too what can i get for you ill have the halibut i hear its good sure is she started scribbling on her pad how do you want it cooked grilled fine you get a house salad with that choice of dressing house dressings real special big mike makes it himself thatd be fine got your choice of baked potato mashed potato fries wild rice ill take the rice get you a drink coffee thanks ill be right back with that nice girl john commented giving his glasses a quick polish with a snowy white handkerchief came into town a couple years ago hanging out with a bunch here to do some climbing boy she was with slapped her around dumped her out with nothing but her knapsack she didnt have the money to get home said she wasnt going back anyhow charlene gave her a room and a job he sipped his beer boy came back for her a week later charlene ran him off charlene keeps an overandunder back in the kitchen the boy decided to leave town without cissy after looking down those barrels for a minute john turned his head and the amusement in his eyes turned to longing just for an instant nate saw the object of it gliding across the room with a coffeepot look at this the two handsomest men in lunacy at the same table charlene poured nates coffee then slid cozily into the booth beside him and what would you two be talking about a beautiful woman naturally john picked up his beer enjoy your dinner chief so charlene angled her body so her breast brushed nates arm what woman would that be john was telling me how cissy came to be working for you oh she traced her tongue over her freshly slicked bottom lip you got your eye on my waitress nate only with the hope she brings my dinner out soon he couldnt scoot away without looking and feeling like an idiot he couldnt move without bumping up against some part of her body the mackie brothers pay you damages yet they came in about an hour ago made it good i want to thank you for taking care of me nate makes me feel secure knowing youre just a phone call away having an overandunder in your kitchen ought to make you feel pretty secure well she dipped her head smiled thats really just for show she angled her body closer so that the comegetme perfume seemed to rise out of her cleavage its hard being a woman alone in a place like this long winter nights they get cold and they get lonely i like knowing a man like yous sleeping under the same roof maybe you and i could keep each other company later charlene thats thats an offer all right her hand slid up his thigh he grabbed her hand pressed it on top of the table even as he went hard and hot lets just take a minute here im hoping itll take longer than a minute ha ha if she kept rubbing that body against him reminding him how long hed been celibate he might not make the full sixty seconds charlene i like you and youre a pleasure to look at but i dont think itd be a good idea for us to keep each other company im just feeling my way around here me too she twined a lock of his hair around her finger you get restless tonight you just give me a call ill show you what i mean about this being a fullservice establishment she kept her baby blues on him as she wiggled out of the booth and managed to slide her hand suggestively along his thigh again nate waited until shed crossed the room in that hiprolling gait before he let out a hoarse whistle of breath he didnt sleep well the motherdaughter tag team kept him churned up and edgy and the dark was endless and complete a primitive dark that urged a man to burrow in a warm cave with a warm woman he kept a light burning late read through town ordinances by it brooded by it and ultimately slept by it until the alarm shrilled he started off the day as he had the one before breakfasting with little jesse it was routine he wanted more than routine he craved a rut where he wouldnt have to think one that got deeper and deeper so he didnt have to see what was beyond it he could go through the motions here handling minor disputes easing through the day with the same faces the same voices the same tasks repeating like a loop he could be the mouse on the wheel and maybe the ridiculous cold would keep him from decomposing that way no one would know he was already dead he liked sitting in his office hours on end juggling among otto peter and himself the scatter of calls that came in when he went out on one he took one of the deputies with him to let him fill in background and set the rhythm he was getting a handle on his staff in any case peter was twentythree had lived in the area all of his life and appeared to know everyone he also appeared to be liked by everyone who knew him otto staff sergeant usmc retired had come to alaska for the hunting and fishing eighteen years before after his first divorce hed decided to make it his permanent home he had three grown children in the lower and four grandchildren hed married again some blonde with a bustline bigger than her iq according to peach and had divorced again in under two years both he and bing had considered themselves qualified for the position nate now held but while bing had gotten pissy about the town councils decision to bring in an outsider otto perhaps more accustomed to taking orders had accepted the job as deputy as for peach herself the source of most of his information shed lived more than thirty years in alaska ever since shed eloped with a boy from macon and hightailed it with him to sitka hed died on her poor lamb lost at sea on a fishing trawler less than six months after the elopement shed married again and had lived with husband number two a strapping handsome grizzly bear of a man whod taken her into the bush where theyd lived off the land with occasional forays into the fledgling town of lunacy when hed died on her too went through the overflow on the lake and froze to death before he could get back to their cabin shed packed up and moved to lunacy shed married again but that was a mistake and she kicked his drunk cheating ass all the way back to north dakota where hed come from shed consider husband number four should the right candidate come along peach gave him tidbits on others ed woolcott wouldve liked the job of mayor but hed have to cool his heels until hopp decided shed had enough his wife arlene was snooty but then she came from money so it wasnt surprising like peter bing had lived here all of his life the son of a russian father and a norwegian mother his mother had run off with a piano player in when bing had been about thirteen his father and that man could down a pint of vodka at one sitting had gone back to russia about twelve years later and taken bings younger sister nadia with him rumor was she was pregnant and thered been whispers the father had been married roses husband david worked as a guide a damn good one and did odd jobs when he had time on his hands harry and deb had two kids the boy was giving them some trouble and deb ruled the roost there was more peach always had more nate figured in a week maybe two hed know whatever he needed to know about lunacy and its population then the work would be another routine digging itself into a comfortable rut but whenever he stood at his window watched the sun rise over the mountains sheening it with gold he felt that spark simmer inside him the little flare of heat that told him there was still life in him afraid it would spread hed turn away to face the blank wall on his third day nate dealt with a vehicular accident involving a pickup an suv and a moose the moose got the best of the bargain and stood about fifty yards from the tangle of metal as if watching the show since it was the first time nate had seen an actual moose bigger and uglier than hed imagined he was more interested in it than the two men currently bitching at each other and passing blame it was eighttwenty am and black as pitch out on the road the locals called lake drive he had the deputy mayor and a mountain guide named hawley going nose to nose a ford explorer tipped into a ditch with its wheelbase buried in the snow its hood crinkled like an accordion and a chevy pickup lying on its side as if it had decided to take a nap both men had blood on their faces and mayhem in their eyes settle down deliberately nate shined his flashlight into the eyes of each man in turn both he noted were going to need stitches i said settle down well sort this out in a minute otto anybody got a tow truck bings got one hes the one handles this sort of thing well give him a call get him out here to haul these vehicles into town i want them off the road asap theyre a hazard now he turned back to the men which one of you can tell me what happened in a calm coherent manner they both started to rant at once but since he smelled the whiskey fumes on hawley he held up a hand then pointed at ed woolcott you start i was driving into work in a reasonable and safe manner load of bullshit hawley commented youll get your turn mr woolcott i saw the headlights coming toward me entirely too fast for safety even as hawley opened his mouth nate stabbed a finger at him then the moose came out of nowhere i slowed and swerved to avoid collision and the next thing i know this this heap is barreling down on me i tried to cut over to the side of the road but he he aimed at me next thing i know he ran me off the road crashed my car that cars only six months old he was driving recklessly and hes been drinking with a sharp nod ed folded his arms and glowered okay bings heading out otto announced good mr woolcott why dont you step over there give your statement to otto hawley nate jerked his head wandered over to the pickup and stood there a moment exchanging baleful glances with the moose you been drinking hawley stood about fiveeight and sported a golden brown beard the blood that had trickled down from the gash on his jaw had frozen well sure i had a couple of belts its shy of nine am shit been ice fishing i dont pay attention to what the hell the time of day is i got some good fish in the cooler in my truck i was heading home to store them get something to eat and turn in then bankerman sees a damn moose in the road and goes into a tailspin hes all over the damn road doing doughnuts and the moose is standing there theyre brainless animals you ask me and i have to swerve went into a little skid and woolcott spun right into me we smashed and this is where we ended up it had been a long time since hed been on traffic and hed never had to do an accident reconstruction in the dark in the snow at somewhere under zero degrees but when he played his light over the road studied the tracks hawleys version hit closer to home fact is youve been drinking were going to have to do a sobriety test you insured yeah but well sort it out nate repeated lets get out of the cold nate drove back to town with hawley and ed sitting stonily silent in the back he pulled off at the clinic left otto with them while they got patched up and went back to the station for a breathalyzer while he was there he called up the driving records of both parties working out the solution in his head he carted the breathalyzer back to the clinic there were a couple people in the waiting room a young woman with a sleeping baby an old man wearing dirt brown coveralls and gnawing on a pipe there was a woman sitting at a chair behind a low counter she was reading a paperback novel with a mostly naked couple in passionate embrace on the cover but she looked up when he entered chief burke yes im joanna doc said you could come on back when you got here if you want hes in exam room one doing hawley nitas in two stitching ed otto hes using the office checking on bing and the tow ill take hawley which ways that ill show you she marked her book with a shiny foil tab then got up to lead him to the door directly to her right right in there she gestured then gave a quick knock doc chief burkes here come on in it was a standard exam room table little sink rolling chair the doctor wore an open flannel shirt over a thermal and glanced over from his work on the cut over hawleys eye he was young midthirties trim and fitlooking with a sandy beard to go with the thatch of curly hair he wore little round metal glasses over green eyes ken darby he said id shake hands but theyre busy nice to meet you hows the patient few cuts and bruises youre a lucky bastard hawley say that when you see my truck goddamn it that damn ed drives like an eightyyearold city woman who lost her bifocals im going to need you to blow into this hawley eyed the breathalyzer dubiously i aint drunk then it wont be a problem will it hawley grumbled but complied as ken fixed a butterfly bandage on the cut well hawley youre right on the edge here makes this a judgment call for me as to whether or not i charge you with driving under the influence ah crock of shit but the fact is since youre on the border here and show no signs of being under the influence particularly im going to issue you a warning instead next time you go ice fishing and have a couple belts you dont get behind the wheel aint got no damn wheel to get behind since i cant write the moose a citation your insurance companys going to have to battle it out with eds youve got a couple of speeding tickets on your plate hawley speed traps anchorage bastards maybe once you get that wheel back you keep your speed to the lt posted limit and get yourself a designated driver when youre drinking well get along fine are you going to need a lift home hawley scratched his neck while ken treated a scrape on his forel head guess i will i need to take a look at my truck talk to bing come by the station after youre done well get you home guess thats fair as it gets ed wasnt as pleased with the decision he sat on the exam table i the air bag burns scoring his cheeks and his lip puffy from where hed bitten into it on impact hed been drinking he was under the legal limit the fact is the culprit heres a moose and i cant give a ticket to the local wildlife it comes down to bad luck two vehicles meeting a moose on a stretch of road youre both insured which is more than the moose is id expect neither one of you is seriously injured comes down to it you both got off lucky i dont consider having my new car in a ditch and my face smashed by an air bag lucky chief burke i guess its a matter of perspective ed slid off the table jerked up his chin and is this how we can expect you to handle law enforcement in lunacy pretty much it seems to me were paying you to do little more than warm a seat in your office i had to warm the seat in my vehicle to come out and look at the wreck i dont like your attitude you can be sure im going to discuss this incident and your behavior with the mayor okay do you need a ride home or to the bank i can get myself where im going ill let you get there then he met up with otto outside the exam room ottos only sign of having heard the conversation was a lift of eyebrows but when they walked out together he cleared his throat didnt make a friend there and i thought i was being so friendly nate shrugged you cant expect a man to be in a cheery mood when his cars smashed and hes getting his face sewn up guess not eds a bit of a blowhard and he likes to throw his weight around got more money than anybody else in the borough and doesnt like you to forget it good to know hawleys all right hes a good man in the bush and he knows how to climb colorful enough to please the tourists who want to take on a mountain and keeps to himself most of the time he drinks but he doesnt drink himself drunk my opinion you handled that fair that matters appreciate it you write this up otto i think ill ride out check on the tow checking on the accident scene was an excuse but nobody had to know but himself he found bing with a gnarled plug of a man working on digging the suv out of the ditch duty meant he had to stop get out and walk over to ask if they needed any more help we know what were doing bing tossed a shovelful of snow on nates boots then ill let you keep doing it asshole bing muttered under his breath as nate walked back to his car nate turned considered briefly is asshole a step up or step down from cheechako the little man snorted out a laugh but only shoved the blade of his shovel into the snow leaned on it as bing measured nate same damn thing just checking nate got back in the car and left bing sneering after him he kept driving away from town around the sharp curve of the lake meg lived out this way hed checked and since he could see her plane resting on the frozen surface he was in the right place he turned into what looked like it might be a road hacked out of the trees and bumped his way along it to a house he didnt know what hed expected but it wasnt this the seclusion wasnt a surprise nor were the heartstopping views in all directions those went with the territory but the house was pretty a kind of sophisticated cabin he supposed wood and glass covered porches bright red shutters framing the windows a walkway had been dug through the snow from drive to front porch he could see where other paths had been tramped down from the house to outbuildings one of those buildings midway from the house to the edge of the forest rose on stilts on the porch was a neatly stacked mountain of split wood the sun was coming up now gloriously bathing the scene with that eerie dawn smoke pumped out of three stone chimneys into the lightening sky fascinated he shut off the engine and heard the music it filled the world a strong sweet female voice twined around strings and pipes lifted with sunrise over the endless white it soared over him when he stepped out of the truck and seemed to come from the air or the earth or the sky then he saw her the sharp red of her parka walking over the white away from the frozen lake with two dogs trotting beside her he didnt call out to her wasnt sure he could have there was a picture here and his mind clicked the shutter the darkhaired woman in red wading through the pristine white with two beautiful dogs flanking her and the glory of the morning mountains at her back the dogs saw or scented him first barking cut the air sliced through the soaring music they shot toward him like two blurry gray bullets he considered leaping back into his truck and wondered if that would cement his status as cheechako asshole there was always the possibility that his outer gear was thick enough to protect his skin from canine teeth should it become an issue he stayed where he was saying good dogs nice dogs over and over in his head like a mantra he braced for a leap hoped it wouldnt be at his throat both dogs spewed snow into the air then stopped a foot in front of him bodies quivering teeth showing full alert both pair of eyes were blue ice crystal blue like their mistresss nates breath streamed out a cloud on the air well god he murmured youre a couple of beauties rock bull meg shouted out friend the dogs relaxed immediately and moved forward to sniff at him will they take my hand off if i touch them he called not now taking it on faith he stroked a gloved hand over each head since they seemed to enjoy it he crouched down and gave them both a good rub while they pressed against him you got balls burke i was hoping that wouldnt be the part theyd chomp on are they sled dogs no her cheeks were pink with cold when she reached him im not a musher but they come from a good line of them they just live the high life out here with me they have your eyes maybe i was a husky in a former life whatre you doing out here i was just whats that music loreena mckennit like it its amazing its like god she laughed youre the first man ive met wholl admit shes a woman out for a holiday drive he straightened holiday new years eve oh no had a little vehicular out on lake drive im looking for the primary witness maybe youve seen him big guy four legs funny hat he made antlers out of his fingers cutie she wondered why do your eyes look so sad even when you smile as it happens ive seen a couple of guys like that in the vicinity in that case i should come in take your statement i might enjoy having you take my statement but itll have to wait ive got to fly i was just bringing the dogs back about to shut off my music where you going im taking some supplies into a village in the bush ive got to move if i want to get there and back before party time she cocked her head want to ride along nate glanced toward the plane and thought in that not even for a chance to sniff at your neck im on duty maybe another time sure rock bull home be right back she told nate the dogs raced off and nate realized one of the outbuildings was an elaborate doghouse decorated with totem figures painted in a primitiveart folksy style high life all right meg disappeared into the cabin a moment later the music shut off she came out again with a pack slung over her shoulder see you chief well see about you taking my statement sometime looking forward to that fly safe she tossed her hair back hiked down to the plane he stayed watching her she tossed the pack inside climbed up he heard the engine catch the stunning roar of it bursting through the stillness the prop whirled and the plane began to skate over the ice circling it circling tipping onto one ski and circling until it lifted off nosed up and climbed he could see the red of her parka the black of her hair through the cockpit window then she was just a blur he tipped his head back as she circled in the air now and dipped a wing in what he assumed was a salute then she was spearing off over the white into the blue five nate could hear the celebration getting underway music a kind of jivey honkytonk piped up the stairs even through the floor vents of his room voices hummed seemed to press against the walls and floorboards laughter slapped out as did the occasional thud he took as dancing feet he sat alone in the dark the depression had crashed down over him without warning without a snicker one minute hed been sitting at his desk reading through files and the next the smothering black weight had dropped down on him it had happened that way before with no vague sense of unease no creeping sadness just that swamping wave of black rolling him under just that harsh switch from light to dark it wasnt hopelessness the concept of hope had to be a factor before you could embrace its absence it wasnt grief or despair or anger he could have handled or battled any of those emotions it was a void immeasurable black airless and it sucked him in he could function through it hed learned how if you didnt function people wouldnt leave you alone and their concern and worry only drove you deeper into the pit he could walk talk exist but he couldnt live thats how it felt to him when he was in the silky clutches of it he felt like walking death the way hed felt in the hospital after jack with the pain bubbling up under the drugs and the awareness of what had happened smearing the path to oblivion but he could function hed finished the day locked up hed driven back to the lodge walked up to his room hed spoken to people he couldnt remember what or who but he knew his mouth had moved words had come out hed gone up to his room locked the door and sat in the winter black what the hell was he doing here in this place this cold dark empty place was he so obvious so pathetic that hed chosen this town of perpetual winter because it so perfectly mirrored what was inside him what did he possibly expect to prove by coming here pinning on a badge and pretending he still cared enough to do a job hiding that was all he was doing hiding from what he was what hed been what hed lost but you couldnt hide from what was with you every minute of every day just waiting to leap out and laugh in your face he had the pills of course hed brought them with him pills for depression pills for anxiety pills to help him sleep down deep where the nightmares couldnt follow pills hed stopped taking because they made him feel less of who he was than the depression or anxiety or insomnia he couldnt go back couldnt go forward so why not sink here deeper and deeper until eventually he couldnt wouldnt crawl out of the void anymore he knew a part of him knew he was comfortable there all settled into the dark and the empty wallowing in his own misery hell he could set up housekeeping there like one of the crazies living in an empty refrigerator box under a bridge life was pretty simple in a cardboard box and nobody expected you to do anything he thought of the old saw about a tree falling in the woods and twisted it around to suit himself if he lost his mind in lunacy would he ever have had it to lose he hated the part of him that thought that way the part of him that wanted to live there if he didnt go down someone would come up that would be worse he cursed at the effort it took just to get to his feet had those little stirrings inside him those quick sparks of life been a kind of mocking fates way of showing him what it was to be alive before it kicked him into the hole again well he still had enough anger to crawl out this time this one more time hed get through this night this last night of the year and if there was nothing in the next he sure as hell wasnt any worse off but tonight he was on duty he closed a hand over the badge hed yet to take off and knew it was ridiculous that a cheap piece of metal should steady him but hed taken even that and hed go through the motions the light burned his eyes when he switched it on and he had to deliberately step away before he gave into the temptation to just turn it off again just settle down in the dark again he went into the bath ran the water cold then splashed it on his face to fool himself into believing it washed away the fatigue that snaked around the depression he studied himself in the mirror for a long time searching for any tells but he saw an average guy no worries a little tired around the eyes maybe a little hollow in the cheeks but nothing major as long as everybody saw the same that would be enough the noise washed over him when he opened his door as with the light he had to force himself to move forward instead of retreating back into his cave hed given both otto and peter the night off eat drink and be merry they both had friends and family people to sweep out the old with since nate had been struggling to sweep out the old on his own for months he didnt see why that should change tonight he carried the lead in his belly down the stairs the music was bright and better than hed expected and the place was packed tables were rearranged to make dancing room and the patrons were taking advantage of it streamers and balloons festooned the ceiling and the dress of the people was just as celebratory he saw some of the oldtimers in what peach had described for him as an alaska tuxedo they were sturdy work suits cleaned up for the occasion some were worn with bolo ties and oddly paper party hats many of the women had fancied things up with sparkly dresses or skirts upswept hair high heels he saw hopp spruced up in a purple cocktail dress dancing foxtrot twostep nate hadnt a clue with a slickedup harry miner rose sat on a highbacked stool behind the bar with the man he concluded was her husband david standing beside her gently rubbing the small of her back he saw her laugh at something the receptionist from the clinic said to her and he saw the way she looked up met her husbands eyes he saw the warmth of love beat between them and he felt cold felt alone hed never had a woman look at him like that even when hed been married the woman hed thought was his had never looked at him with that open unrestricted love he looked away from them his eyes scanned the crowd as cops eyes do measuring detailing filing it was the sort of thing that kept him apart and he knew it it was the sort of thing he couldnt stop doing he saw ed and the allegedly snooty arlene mitch of klun with his streaky blond hair in a ponytail and his arm around a girl who wasnt as pretty as he was ken was wearing a hawaiian lei and having a lively discussion with the professor who wore his usual tweed fellowship nate thought some of it drunken at this point but it was still fellowship and he was outside he caught a hit of charlenes perfume but she followed up on it too fast for him to brace or evade curvy female was wrapped around him warm glossy lips were sliding silky over his with a sly hint of tongue his ass was stroked and squeezed his bottom lip gently nipped then charlene slithered off smiled sleepily at him happy new year nate that was just in case i cant get my hands on you at midnight he couldnt quite form a word and was half afraid he might be blushing he wondered if her obvious and inappropriate comeon had pushed embarrassment through the black just where have you been hiding she laced her arms around his neck partys been in gear more than an hour and you havent danced with me i had things work work work why dont you come play with me i need to speak with the mayor please god help me oh this isnt the time for town politics its a party come on dance with me then well have some champagne i really need to deal with this he put his hands on her hips hoping to nudge her back out of intimacy range and searched the crowd for hopp his savior his gaze struck and locked onto megs she gave him that slow twostep smile and lifted the glass she held in a mock toast then dancing couples whirled in front of her and she was gone ill take a rain check i he spotted a familiar face and latched on like a drowning man otto charlene wants to dance before either of them could speak nate was beating a fast retreat he made it to the other side of the room before he risked taking a breath funny you dont look like a coward meg stepped up beside him she held two glasses now then looks are deceiving she scares me to death i wont say charlenes harmless because shes anything but still if you dont want her tongue down your throat youre going to need to say so loud clear in words of one syllable here got you a drink im on duty she snorted i dont think a glass of cheap champagnes going to change that hell burke just about every soul in lunacys right here got a point he took the glass but he didnt drink he did however manage to focus on her she was wearing a dress he supposed the technical term was dress for the skin of hot red painted on her it showed off that tight athletic body hed imagined in ways that might have been illegal in several jurisdictions shed left her hair down black rain to milkwhite shoulders skyhigh heels the same color as the dress showcased slim muscular legs she smelled like cool secret shadows you look amazing i clean up good if the occasion warrants it you on the other hand look tired and wounded she thought thats how hed struck her when shed seen him come down the stairs like a man who knew there in was a huge gaping wound somewhere on his body but didnt have the energy to find it havent got the sleep pattern down yet he sipped the champagne it tasted like flavored soda water did you come down to relax and party or to stand around looking dour and official mostly door two meg shook her head try the first for a while see what happens she reached out unpinned his badge hey you need a shield you can pull it out she said as she tucked it into his front pocket right now lets dance i dont know how to do what theyre doing out there thats okay ill lead she did just that and made him laugh it felt rusty in his throat but lightened some of the weight is the band local everybodys local thats mindy on the piano she teaches in the elementary school pargo on the guitar works in the bank chucks on fiddle hes a ranger in denali a fed but chucks so affable we pretend hes got a real job and big mikes on drums hes the cook here are you committing all that to memory sorry i can see you tucking those names and faces into a file in your head pays to remember sometimes it pays to forget her gaze flickered to the right im being signalled max and carrie hawbaker they run the lunatic our weekly paper theyve been out of town most of the week they want an interview with the new chief of police i thought this was a party theyll just hunt you down the minute the music stops anyway not if you sneak out with me and we have our own parry elsewhere she shifted looked straight into his eyes i might be interested if you meant that why wouldnt i mean it theres the question ill ask you sometime she didnt give him much choice as she angled around waved she was pulling him along with her to the edge of the impromptu dance floor introductions were made then she slipped away leaving him trapped really good to meet you max gave nates hand an enthusiastic shake carrie and i just got back into town so we havent had a chance to welcome you im going to want a piece of your time for an interview for the lunatic well have to work that out we could sit out in the lobby now and not now max carrie beamed a smile no work tonight but before we get back to the party id like to ask you chief burke if youd have any problem with us running a police log in the paper i think it would show the community what you do how we handle things here now that weve got an official police department we want the lunatic to document it you can get that information from peach meg wound her way back to the bar got another glass of champagne before sliding onto a stool where she could watch the dancing while she drank charlene slid onto the one beside her i saw him first meg kept watching the dancers more who he sees isnt it youre only looking at him because i want him charlene if its got a dick you want it meg tossed back champagne and im not looking at him particularly she smiled into her glass go ahead make your play its no skin off mine first interesting man whos come along in months feeling chatty now charlene leaned closer do you know he has breakfast with little jesse every morning isnt that the sweetest thing and you shouldve seen the way he handled the mackies plus hes got mystery she sighed im a sucker for a man with mystery youre a sucker for a man as long as he can still get it up charlenes mouth twisted in disgust why do you have to be so crude you sat down here to let me know youre hoping to fuck the new chief of police you can put ribbons on it charlene its still crude i just leave off the ribbons youre just like your father so you always say meg murmured as charlene flounced away hopp took charlenes stool the two of you would fight about how much rain came down in the last shower thats a little philosophical for us whatre you drinking i was going to get another glass of that lousy champagne ill get it meg walked around the bar poured another glass and topped off her own she wants to take a nice greedy bite out of burke hopp looked over at nate saw hed managed to escape from the hawbakers only to be caught by joe and lara wise their business their business meg agreed and clinked her glass to hopps the fact that he looks to be more interested in taking one out of you isnt going to improve your relationship with your mother nope meg sipped considering but it should make things exciting for a while she saw hopp cast her eyes to heaven and laughed i cant help it i like trouble he would be hopp turned on the stool when she saw nate being pulled onto the floor again by charlene all that business about still waters blah blah those broody types can be hard to handle hes about the saddest man ive ever seen sadder than that drifter stopped in here a couple of years ago what was his name mckinnon blew his brains out up in hawleys cache and wasnt that a mess ignatious might be sad enough to put the barrel of a in his mouth but hes got too much spine to pull the trigger think hes too polite too thats what youre banking on yeah thats what im banking on well hell im going to do my last good deed of the year and go save him from charlene sad polite men were anything but her type meg told herself she liked reckless men careless men men who didnt expect to stay the night after you could have a couple drinks with a man like that tangle up the sheets if the mood struck then move on no bumps no bruises a man like ignatious burke a roll with him was bound to be bumpy and it was bound to leave bruises still it might be worth it in any case she liked conversations with him and that couldnt be overvalued in her opinion she could happily go days weeks without talking to another human being so she appreciated interesting converge sation and she liked watching the sorrow that haunted his eyes come and go shed seen it lift a few times now when hed stood in front of her house that morning listening to loreena mckennit and again for a few moments when theyd danced sitting there now with the music and the heat of humanity all around her she realized she wanted to see it lift again and that she had a good idea how to make it happen she went behind the bar found an open bottle and two glasses holding them down at her side she slipped out of the room hopp tapped charlene briskly on the shoulder sorry charlene i need an official moment with chief burke charlene only pressed closer to nate he wondered if shed just pop out the back of him town halls closed hopp town halls never closed come on now let the boy out of that stranglehold oh all right i expect you to finish this dance handsome lets find ourselves a corner ignatious hopp waved people aside cut a swatch through the crowd she hunkered down at a table someone had pushed into the pool area want a drink no i think i want the back door you can run but you cant hide in a town this size youre going to have to deal with her sooner or later lets go with later he wanted to go upstairs back to the dark his head was pounding his stomach queasy with the stress and effort of just being i didnt just pull you away to break charlenes headlock youve got my deputy mayor well and truly pissed i know it i handled that situation as seemed most prudent and within the confines of the law im not questioning how you do your job ignatious she waved that off as shed waved off people im just giving you the facts eds pompous selfimportant and a pain in the ass more than half the time still hes a good man and works hard for this town doesnt mean he can drive worth a damn she grinned at that hes always been a lousy driver hes also powerful rich and a grudgeholder he wont forget you crossed him on this business it might seem small potatoes to the type of thing youre used to dealing with but in lunacy this was major i cant be the first to cross him youre not ed and i butt heads all the time but the way hed see that he and i are on equal footing i might even have a leg up youre outside and he expects you to kowtow some on the other hand if youd kowtowed id have been very disappointed puts you between a rock and a hard place ive been there before does kowtow really have anything to do with cows she stared for a moment then barked out a laugh a polite and sneaky way to tell me to mind my own before i do let me add something getting yourself caught between charlene and meg means that rock and hard place are both going to be very hot very sticky and mean as a demon from hell then id better not get caught good thinking her eyebrows lifted when his cell phone beeped calls to the station get transferred to my personal he said as he pulled it out of his pocket burke get your coat meg said meet me out front in five minutes ive got something i want to show you sure okay he stuck the phone back in his pocket as hopp watched him its nothing i think im going to duck out mmmhmm use the door there go through the kitchen thanks and happy new year same to you hopp shook her head as he walked away going to be trouble it took him more than five minutes to get to his room pile on his gear slip out then walk around to the front of the lodge he was halfway there when he realized he hadnt been tempted to just lock the door behind him and burrow back in the dark maybe it was progress or maybe lust was stronger than situational depression she was waiting sitting on one of two folding chairs shed set dead center of the street the bottle of champagne was screwed into the snowpack she sipped from her glass and a thick blanket covered her lap you cant sit out here in that dress even with your coat and the blanket i changed i always carry extra clothes in my pack too bad i was looking forward to seeing you in that dress again another time another place have a seat okay why are we sitting outside in the street at ten minutes to midnight not much for crowds you not really they can be fun for a while on a special occasion but it wears thin for me after a few hours besides she handed him a glass this is better it amazed him the champagne wasnt frozen solid i think it would be better if we were inside where frostbite isnt a factor not that cold out no wind hovering around zero besides you cant really see this from inside see what look up lower he looked where she pointed and lost his breath holy god yeah i always thought it was holy a natural phenom caused by latitude sunspots and so on scientific explanations dont make it less beautiful or magical the lights in the sky were green with shimmers of gold hints of red the long eerie streaks seemed to pulse and breathe bathing the dark with life the northern lights show best in the winter but its usually too damn cold to appreciate them figured this was a good night for the exception ive heard of them seen pictures its not like the pictures the best things never are they show better out of town even better when youre camped up on one of the glaciers one night when i was about seven my father and i hiked up into the mountains and camped just so we could be up there to see we lay on our backs for hours damn near freezing and just watched the sky the otherworldly green continued to shift glow expand shimmer it was raining liquid jewels of color what happened to him you could say one day he took another hike and decided to keep going you got family sort of well we wont spoil this by telling our sad stories well just enjoy the show they sat in silence in the middle of the street spindly chairs balanced on the snowpack while the heavens flamed the flames sparked something inside him stroked away the tension headache settled him on the ridge of wonder where he could breathe she glanced toward the lodge as the noise level grew the shouts of countdown to midnight began looks like its just you and me burke a better end to the year than i expected you want me to pretend im kissing you because its tradition screw tradition she grabbed his hair in two gloved hands yanked him toward her her lips were cold and there was a strange powerful thrill in feeling them warm against his the fullthrottle punch of the kiss jolted his sluggish system into drive churned in his belly snapped through his blood he heard the roar but it was muffled dim and distant when midnight struck bells clanged horns tooted cheers sounded and through them he heard clear as a wish his own heartbeat he dropped the glass in his hand shoved the blanket away so he could reach her the hum of frustration in his throat came from the barrier of thick layers of clothing he wanted that strong curvy body the shape of it the taste and scent of it then the sound of gunshots had him jerking back celebration fire thats all her breath streamed out in clouds as she tried to draw him back this man could kiss and she wanted to hold onto the punchdrunk sensation of having his lips his tongue his teeth ravish her who needed cheap champagne maybe but i have to check she gave a halflaugh then reached down to pick up their glasses yeah you would meg go ahead chief she gave his knee a friendly pat smiled into those fascinating and troubled gray eyes a jobs a job it wont take long she was sure it wouldnt a few shots in the air were usual on holidays at weddings births even at funerals depending on the sentiments toward the dead but it didnt seem wise to wait instead she left the chairs the bottle the glasses on the front porch she carried the blanket back to her truck tossed it in the cab then she drove toward home while the green lights played across the sky and she knew hopp was right nate burke was going to be trouble six

single day then the rest of his second week in the lunatic hed waited for the complaints when the first issue that included the police log had come out but thered been none apparently people didnt mind having their names printed even if it was in conjunction with their indiscretions he slipped the newspaper into a desk drawer with the first issue two weeks down he thought still here sarrie parker leaned on the counter in the corner store shed shed her bunny boots and parka at the door then plucked a pack of blackjack gum from the pointofpurchase display she was there to gossip not to shop and the gum was the cheapest excuse at hand she gave cecil debs king charles spaniel a little pat on the head he lounged as he did every day in his cushioned basket on the counter dont see much of chief burke down at the lodge deb continued to shelve packs of smokes and chewing tobacco her store was a clearinghouse for town news if she didnt know about it it hadnt happened yet doesnt come around here much either keeps to himself has breakfast there every day with roses boy and takes his dinner there most nights not much of an appetite you ask me since she had the pack of gum in her hand anyway sarrie opened it i pick up his room every morning not that theres much to pick up man doesnt have anything but his clothes and shaving gear not a picture not a book since she did the majority of the housekeeping at the lodge sarrie considered herself an expert on human behavior maybe hes having stuff sent dont think i didnt ask sarrie wagged a stick of gum before folding it into her mouth made it a point to i said to him so chief burke you got the rest of your things coming up from the lower and he says to me i brought everything with me doesnt make any phone calls either at least not from his room or get any far as i can see the only thing he does up there is sleep though there was no one else in the store at the moment sarrie dropped her voice leaned in and despite charlenes throwing herself at him hes sleeping alone she gave a sharp nod you change a mans sheets you know what hes up to in the night maybe they do it in the shower or on the floor deb had the pleasure of seeing sarries chipmunkcheeked face register shock no law says youve got to do your screwing in bed being a professional on the gossip circuit sarrie recovered quickly charlene was getting any she wouldnt still be chasing after him like a hound after a rabbit would she pausing to scratch cecil behind his silky ears deb had to concede the point probably not man comes up here hardly more than the clothes on his back holes up hours on end in his room steps around a willing woman and barely says more than boo unless you corner him well theres something strange about that man if you ask me hed hardly be the first of that type to show up here maybe but hes the first we made chief of police she was still a little steamed hed given her son a ticket the week before like twentyfive dollars grew on trees mans hiding something gods sake sarrie do you know anybody around here who isnt i dont care whos hiding what unless hes got the authority to put me and mine in jail impatient now deb jabbed keys on her cash register unless youre planning on walking out of here without paying for that gum youre not breaking any laws so i wouldnt worry about it the man under discussion was still sitting at his desk but now hed been cornered for two weeks hed managed to evade sidestep or outrun max hawbaker he didnt want to be interviewed as far as nate was concerned the press was the press whether it was a smalltown weekly or the baltimore sun maybe the citizens of lunacy didnt mind their names in the paper whatever the reason but hed yet to wash the bad taste out of his mouth that had coated it during his experience with reporters after the shootings and hed known hed have to swallow more when hopp had marched into his office with max at her side max needs an interview the town needs to know something about the man weve got heading up our law and order the lunatic goes to press this time i want this story in there so get to it she marched right out again closing the door smartly behind her max smiled gamely ran into the mayor on my way over to see if you had a few minutes now to talk to me uhhuh since hed been debating whiling away some time with computer solitaire or taking peter up on his offer to give him another snowshoeing lesson nate couldnt claim not to have the time hed pegged max as an eager nerd the sort that had spent most of his high school days being given wedgies he had a round pleasant face with light brown hair receding over it he was carrying about ten extra pounds on a fiveten frame most of it in the belly coffee dont mind if i do nate got up poured two cups what do you take in it couple of those creamers couple of those sugars um what do you think of our new feature the police log its all new to me youve got the facts down seems thorough carrie really wanted to include it im going to record this if thats okay ill be taking notes but i like to have a record fine he doctored maxs coffee brought it over what do you want to know settling in max took a small tape recorder out of his canvas sack he set it on the desk noted the time turned it on then drew a pad and pencil out of his pocket i think our readers would like to know something about the man behind the badge sounds like a movie title sorry he said when maxs brow creased theres not that much to know lets start with the basics you mind giving me your age thirtytwo and you were a detective with the baltimore pd thats right married divorced happens to the best of us kids no baltimore your hometown all my life except these past couple weeks so how does a detective from baltimore end up chief of police in lunacy alaska i got hired maxs face stayed affable his tone conversational had to throw your hat into the ring to get hired i wanted a change a fresh start a last chance some might consider this a pretty dramatic change if youre going for something other than your usual why not make it big i liked the sound of the job the place now ive got the opportunity to do the job i know but in a different setting with a different rhythm we just talked about the police log this cant be anything like what you used to deal with youre not concerned about being bored coming from the pace and action of a big city and into a community of less than seven hundred careful nate thought hadnt he just been sitting here bored or depressed it was hard to tell the difference there were times he wasnt sure there was a difference since both left him with a heavy useless feeling baltimore thinks of itself as a big small town but the fact is a lot of the time youre doing the job with a certain amount of anonymity one cops the same as another one case piled on top of the next and you can never close them all nate thought no matter how many hours you put in you cant close them all and you end up with the open and actives haunting you if someone calls here he continued they know that either i or one of two deputies is going to come out and talk to them to help resolve the situation and im going to know after some more time on the job who needs assistance when the calls come in it wont just be a name on a file itll be a person i know i think this will add another level of satisfaction to the work i do it surprised him to realize hed spoken the pure truth without fully realizing it had been there you hunt no fish not so far max pursed his lips hockey skiing mountain climbing no peters teaching me how to snowshoe he says itll come in handy hes right about that what about hobbies leisuretime activities interests the job hadnt left him much room or he corrected hed allowed the job to consume all his time isnt that why rachel had looked elsewhere im keeping my options open there well start with the snowshoeing see what happens next howd you end up out here me id like to know something about the guy asking the questions thats fair max said after a moment went to berkeley in the sixties sex drugs and rock and roll there was a woman as there should be and we migrated north spent some time in seattle i hooked up with this guy there who was into climbing i caught the bug we kept migrating north the woman and i antiestablishment vegetarians intellectuals he smiled an overweight balding middleaged man who seemed amused by who hed been and who he was now she was going to paint i was going to write novels that exposed mans underbelly while we lived off the land we got married which screwed up everything she ended up back in seattle i ended up here publishing a newspaper instead of writing novels oh im still working on those novels he didnt smile now but looked distant and a little disturbed once in a while i pull them out theyre crap but im still working on them still dont eat meat and im still a greenie environmentalist type which irritates a lot of people met carrie about fifteen years ago we got married his smile came back this one seems to be working out kids girl and a boy twelve and ten now lets get back to you you were with the baltimore pd for eleven years when i spoke with lieutenant foster you spoke to my lieutenant your former lieutenant getting some background he described you as thorough and dogged the kind of cop who closed cases and worked well under pressure not that any of us should mind having those qualities in our chief of police but you seem overqualified for this job that would be my problem nate said flatly thats about all the time i can give you just a couple more you were on medical leave for two months after the incident last april during which your partner jack behan and a suspect were killed and yourself wounded you returned to duty for another four months then resigned i have to assume the incident weighed heavily in your decision to take this position is that accurate i gave you my reasons for taking this position my partners death doesnt have anything to do with anyone in lunacy maxs face was set and nate saw hed underestimated the man a reporter was a reporter he reminded himself whatever the venue and this one smelled a story it has to do with you chief your experiences and motivations your professional history history would be the operative word the lunatic may be smalltime but as publisher i still have to do my homework present an accurate story and a complete one i know the shooting incident was investigated and it was found you fired your weapon justifiably still you killed a man that night and that has to weigh heavy do you think you pick up a badge and a gun for sport hawbaker do you think theyre just for show a cop knows every day when he picks up his weapon that it might be the day he has to use it yeah it weighs heavy temper licked at him turned his voice as cold as the january wind that rattled against the windows its supposed to weigh heavy the weapon and what you might have to do with it do i regret deploying my weapon i do not i regret not being faster if id been faster a good man would still be alive a woman wouldnt be a widow and two children would still have their father max had edged back in his seat and hed moistened his lips several times but he stuck you blame yourself im the only one who came out of that alley alive temper died and left his eyes dull and tired who else is there to blame turn off your recorder were done here max leaned forward shut off the machine im sorry to have hit a sore spot theres not much public around here but what there is has a right to know so you guys always say i need to get back to work max picked up the recorder tucked it away then rose i ah need a picture to run with the story nates silent stare had max clearing his throat carrie can come find you a little later shes the photographer thanks for your time and good luck with the snowshoeing when he was alone nate sat very still he waited for the rage but it wouldnt come back hed have welcomed it the wild blinding heat of fury but he stayed cold he knew what would happen if he stayed frozen he got up his movements slow and controlled he stepped out picked up a twoway ive got to be out awhile he told peach something comes up you can reach me on the twoway or my cell weathers coming in she told him looks to be a bad one you dont want to stray so far youre not tucked back in by dinnertime ill be back he walked out into the entry piled on his gear he kept his mind a blank as he got into his car and drove he pulled over again in front of hopps house walked to her door and knocked she answered wearing a pair of reading glasses on a chain over her thick corduroy shirt ignatious come on in no thanks dont ever ambush me like that again her ringers ran up and down her eyeglass chain as she studied his face come in well talk thats all i have to say all im going to say he turned left her standing in the doorway he drove out of town pulling over when he was clear of houses there were some people skating on the lake he imagined theyd be coming in soon as the light was already going farther out on the plate of ice was somebodys ramshackle icefishing house he didnt see megs plane he hadnt seen her since theyd watched the northern lights he should go back do what he was paid to do even if what he was paid to do wasnt a hell of a lot instead he found himself driving on when he reached megs her dogs were standing at alert guarding the house he climbed out waited to see what their policy on unexpected company might be their heads cocked almost in unison then they loped forward with a friendly edge to their barks after some leaping and circling one of them raced off toward the doghouse bounded up the steps and through the doorway and came back carrying a huge bone in its mouth whats that from a mastodon it was gnarled and chewed and slobbered on but nate took it deducing the game and hurled it like a javelin they took off bumping and bashing each other like a couple of football players racing for the pass they dived into the snow came up covered with it the bone was clamped in both of their jaws now after a quick and spirited tugofwar they pranced back as if they were harnessed together teamwork huh he took the bone again hurled it again and watched the replay he was on his fourth pass when the dogs raced away from him making beelines for the lake seconds later he heard what they had as the rumble of engine grew nate followed the path of the dogs down to the lake he saw the red flash and the dull glint of the lowering sun on the glassto nates eye she seemed to be coming in too fast too low he expected her skis to catch on the treetops at best for her nose to crash into the ice at worst the noise swallowed everything with nerves dancing over his skin he watched her circle angle and slide down on the ice then there was silence so complete he thought he could hear the air shed displaced sighing down again beside him the dogs quivered then bunched then leaped from snow to ice they sprawled and slid and barked in utter and obvious joy when the door opened meg jumped down her boots ringing she squatted allowed herself to be licked while she energetically rubbed fur when she straightened she grabbed a pack out of the plane and only then did she look at nate somebody else crash fenders she called out not that i know of with the dogs dancing around her she crossed the short span of ice climbed up the slight slope of snow been here long few minutes your bloods still too thin to handle this cold lets go inside where were you oh here and there picked up a party a few days ago theyve been shooting caribou photographically took them back to anchorage today just in time she added with a glance toward the sky got a storm coming in air was getting very interesting do you get scared up there no but ive gotten pretty interested from time to time inside the entry she pulled off her parka ever crash ive had to well say put down abruptly she yanked off her boots then taking a towel out of a box squatted down again to wipe off her dogs feet go on in thisll take a minute and its crowded with the four of us in here he stepped inside closing the inner door as hed been taught to keep the heat in the windows were pulling in the last hints of sun of the short day so the room was mixed with light and shadows he could smell flowers not roses but something more primitive and earthy it was mixed with dog and a hint of wood smoke in a strange and appealing combination hed expected rustic and saw even in the halflight hed been well off the mark in the spacious living area the walls were a pale yellow to mimic the sun he supposed and keep the dark at bay the fireplace was built of polished stone in golden hues so that simmering logs glowed inside its frame she had squat candles on the mantel in deeper yellows and dark blues the long sofa picked up the blues and was decked with the toss pillows women insisted on having everywhere a thick throw with her key colors bleeding into each other was draped over the back there were lamps with painted shades gleaming tables a patterned rug and two big chairs watercolors oil paintings pastels all of alaskan scenes decorated the walls to his left stairs led up and he found himself grinning at the newel post carved into a totem the door opened the dogs led the way each prancing over to the chairs and jumping up on one not what i expected he commented too much expected leads to boredom she crossed the room opened a big carved box and hauled out split logs let me get that already got it she bent set the logs then turned to him keeping the fireplace at her back you want food no no thanks drink not especially no she crossed over switched on one of the lamps sex then i why dont you go ahead up second door on the left i just want to put out food and water for my dogs she strolled out leaving him standing there with the dogs staring at him out of crystal eyes hed have sworn they were smirking when she came back he was standing in exactly the same spot cant find the steps some detective you are listen meg i just drove out to he dragged a hand through his hair realizing he didnt have a clue hed left town feeling that black hole gaping in front of him and sometime during his game with the dogs it had closed up again you dont want sex i know a trick question when i hear one well while youre thinking about how youre going to answer it im going upstairs and getting naked she shook her hair off her shoulders and behind her back i look really good naked if youre wondering i figured that youre a little on the thin side but i dont mind that she walked to the steps angled her head smiled and crooked her finger come on cutie just like that why not no law against it yet anyway sex is simple nate its everything else thats complicated so lets be simple for now she headed up the steps nate glanced back at the dogs blew out a breath lets see if i remember how to be simple he walked up paused by the first door the walls were a sizzling red except the one that was mirrored on the wall opposite the mirrors was a shelf unit holding a tv dvd player stereo components between them was what he recognized as stateoftheart exercise equipment an elliptical crosstrainer faced the tv the bowfiex and rack of free weights lined up with the mirror he imagined the minifridge held bottles of water maybe some sports drinks the room told him the body he was about to see naked got plenty of serious workouts shed left the bedroom door open and was crouched in front of another fireplace lighting the kindling there was a big whopping sleigh bed all curves and dark wood more art more lamps accented the shades of green and ivory i saw your equipment she sent a slow smile over her shoulder not yet ha i meant your personal fitness center next door you work out chief used to before jack not so much lately i like the sweat and the endorphin rush so did i well youll have to get back to it yeah this is some place youve got here took me four years to get it done i need space or i get twitchy lights on lights off when he didnt answer she straightened glanced over her shoulder again relax chief im not going to hurt you unless you ask for it she walked to the nightstand pulled open a drawer safety first she announced and tossed him a condom in a foil pack youre thinking too much she decided when he stood looking a bit bewildered and she thought adorable with all that messy roastedchestnut hair those woundedhero eyes i bet we can fix that maybe you need a little atmosphere i dont mind that either she lit a candle wandered the room lighting others a little music opening a cabinet she switched on the cd player inside adjusted the volume to low it was alanis morissette this time with her strangely appealing voice singing about the fear of bliss maybe i shouldve gotten you a little drunk first but its too late for that now youre an original nate murmured you bet your fine ass on that she tugged her sweater over her head tossed it into a chair thermal underwear makes the striptease a little less than erotic but the payoff should make up for it he was already brick hard you plan to shed any of those clothes or do you want me to take care of that for you im nervous saying that makes me feel like an idiot oh yeah she thought again seriously adorable honesty in a man always was youre only nervous because youre thinking she dropped her trousers stepped out of them sitting on the bed she pulled off her socks if it hadnt been for the call of duty new years eve wed have ended up in bed you were gone when i came back because i started thinking see its deadly she pulled back the comforter and sheets he laid his shirt over her sweater when he took his cell phone out of his pocket set it down he shrugged im on duty well lets hope everyone behaves themselves she pulled off her thermal top every muscle in his body bunched into a fist she was porcelain delicate white skin carved into curves but there was nothing fragile instead it was all drama and confidence a photograph in black and white with light playing gold over it and he saw with a surprised jolt of lust when she turned to switch off the light to leave only the candles and fire burning the little tattoo of spreading red wings at the small of her back half the thoughts in my head just evaporated she laughed lets take care of the other half lose the pants burke yes maam he unbuckled his belt then his fingers went numb as she peeled off the rest of the thermal his mouth was dry as dust you were right you look really good naked id like to say the same if you ever get those clothes off she slid onto the bed stretched out come on cutie come get me she trailed a fingertip down her breast as he undressed mmm not bad upper body wise nice muscle tone for somebody who hasnt been getting regular workouts and she grinned propped up on her elbows when he stripped off his pants well well you really did stop thinking dress that soldier and lets go to war he complied but when he sat on the bed he simply brushed his finger over her shoulder give me a minute to plan my battle strategy first ive never seen skin like yours its so pure cant judge a book by its cover balancing herself she reached up grabbed a hank of his hair and dragged him down to her give me that mouth i didnt have nearly enough of it before it swept through him in a rush all the needs the desperation the frantic urges that coalesced into blind lust the taste of her exploded inside him the ripe greedy heat of her fired in his blood his mouth bore down on hers fed from hers until hungers hed forgotten burst to life again he couldnt get enough her mouth her throat her breasts her gasps and moans and cries were like lashes against his naked need driving him to take more he clamped a hand between her thighs crazed to feel the wet the warmth and pushed her so quickly so violently to peak they both shuddered it was like climbing a quiet green hill and having it turn into a volcano that was inside of him she realized the dangerous surprise under the injured calm shed wanted him those sad eyes that quiet manner but she hadnt known what he would give her when the mask was yanked away she arched up stunned as he raked heat through her body and when she cried out it was with mindless pleasure she rolled with him digging with her nails nipping with her teeth her hands eager and possessive as they raced over slickened skin her lungs burned with every panting breath he wanted to devour to ravish and rule he drove into her would have buried his face in her hair but her hands came up to his face and she watched him her eyes wild and blue as he thrust inside her as he lost himself inside her watched him until hed emptied himself inside her hed been hulled out until his skin was nothing but a husk with air inside it he couldnt remember what it was to feel that dragging drawing weight that closed down over his mind and so bloated his body it made just getting out of bed in the morning an exercise in will and control he was blind and deaf and replete if he could have floated the rest of the way to oblivion just as he was he wouldnt have uttered a murmur of complaint no falling asleep while still engaged huh what reverse thrusters cutie he wasnt blind after all he could see light shadow shape none of it made any sense but he could see it obviously he could hear because the voice her voice was there drifting through the mild buzzing in his head and he could feel her yielding under him that soft tight curvy body damp with the sweat theyd worked up and smelling of soap and sex and female better give me a shove he said after a moment i may be paralyzed not from where im sitting but she planted her hand on his shoulder and put some effort into pushing him over then took a long whistling breath in and out and said god i think i saw him just a faint outline for a second he was smiling that was me oh she couldnt work up the energy to stretch so yawned instead somebody was very pent up mmmm lucky me the circuits in his brain were starting to connect again he could almost hear them sizzle as contact was reestablished its been a while for me curious she tipped onto her side she saw the scars her fingers had played against puckers of wounds bullet wounds she knew on his side on his thigh define a while like a month his eyes stayed closed but his mouth curved two months jesus more three wed be closing in on a year i guess holy crap no wonder i saw stars did i hurt you dont be a jerk maybe not but i sure as hell used you deliberately she traced a finger on the scar snaking down his side he didnt flinch but she felt him tighten and decided to keep it light for now id say we used each other and so well so thoroughly everyone in a hundredmile radius of this bed is lying back right now smoking a cigarette youre okay with it you got shorttermmemory syndrome burke now she stretched and gave him a quick jab with her elbow on the back end of the move whose idea was this he was quiet for a moment i was married for five years i was faithful the last two years of the marriage were rocky actually the last year of it sucked completely sex became an issue a battleground a weapon anything but a natural pleasure so im rusty and im not altogether sure what women are looking for in this area not so light then she mused im not women im me sorry your ex jerked you around by the dick but as i can attest that appendage is still in good working order maybe its time to get over it long past he shifted working his arm under her he felt her stiffen a little and the hesitation in her body before she relaxed again and let him settle her head on his shoulder i dont want this to be the end of it between us well see what we think about that next time i wish i could stay but i have to get back sorry i didnt ask you to stay he turned his head so he could see her face her cheeks were still flushed her eyes still sleepy but he was too good a cop to miss the wariness just under the ease i wish youd ask me to stay but since id have to say no thats a waste of a wish but id like to come back you cant come back tonight this storm hits and you make it out here which you wouldnt youd be stuck could be days that wouldnt suit me if its going to be that bad come back into town with me no that really wouldnt suit me relaxed again she walked her fingers up his chest along his jawline and into his hair im fine here plenty of supplies plenty of wood my dogs i like a good storm the solitariness of it and when it clears she moved her shoulder then rolled away rising she walked naked to the closet the firelight playing over her white skin and that flashy spread of red wings before she pulled out a thick flannel robe maybe youll give me a call and if im around you could bring me out a pizza she pulled on the robe smiled as she belted it ill give you a really good tip seven the first flakes fell as he drove back to town fat and soft they didnt look particularly threatening in fact he found them picturesque they reminded him of the snows of his childhood the ones that fell during the night and kept falling in the morning so when you looked out your bedroom window excitement sizzled in your blood no school it made him smile to think of it to remember the days when snow was a thrill instead of a burden or a hazard maybe it would pay him to bring some of that childhood awe back inside himself to look around see those oceans and rivers of white and consider the possibilities he was learning to snowshoe so maybe hed learn to ski crosscountry skiing might be interesting besides hed lost too much weight over the last few months that sort of exercise added to the regular meals that were always being put in front of him would help build him back up again maybe hed buy one of those skidoo things and race around in the snow for the hell of it have some fun for christs sake and hed see some of the countryside from something other than a car he paused to watch a small herd of deer wind their way through the trees to his left their coats were shaggy and dark against snow that came to their knees if deer had knees it was a whole new world for the city boy he decided whose rural adventures until now had consisted of a couple of summer camping trips to western maryland he parked in front of the station remembered to plug his engine block heater into the outlet then watched otto and pete string a knotted rope line along the sidewalk about waist high pulling his thick gloves back on he walked over to join them whats going on here rope guide otto said and wound it around a lamppost for man can lose himself a foot out the door in a whiteout doesnt look that bad nate glanced out at the street and missed the look otto and pete exchanged how much are they calling for could get four feet nate turned back sharply youre shitting me winds coming with so drifts could be two three times that there was obvious pleasure in ottos tone as he worked the rope this aint lower snow he thought of baltimore and how six inches of the white stuff could slow the city to a crawl i want these parked vehicles off the street and the snow removal equipment checked people mostly leave their cars where they sit pete told him dig them out after nate considered following the wheninrome theory then shook his head they were paying him to establish order so by god hed establish some order get them off the street anything still parked on this route in an hour gets towed alaska or lower its still four feet of snow on the street until were clear were on call twentyfour seven none of us leave the station without a twoway whats the policy on outoftowners otto scratched his chin isnt any well have peach go down the list contact all of them we make arrangements for shelter for anyone who wants to come in this time he caught the exchanged glance peter smiled gently nobodys going to maybe not but theyll have a choice he thought of meg six miles out and essentially cut off she wouldnt budge that much he already knew of her how much of this rope do we have plenty people generally string their own guides well make sure of it he went inside to put peach to work it took him an hour to organize procedure and another ten minutes to deal with carrie hawbaker when she blew in with her digital camera unlike her husband she seemed sharp and brisk merely waving at him to go on about what he was doing so she could get candids he let her snap her pictures and talked to peach about the inprogress snow emergency plans he didnt have time to worry about it or to think about how his interview with max had gone did you contact everyone outside of town he asked peach twelve more to go anyone heading in not so far she ticked off her list people live out nate because they like it out he nodded contact them anyway then i want you to go on home and call me when you get there her pudgy cheeks popped out with her smile arent you the mother hen public safety is my life and chirpier than youve been she took the pencil out of her bun wagged it at him its good to see i guess a blizzard brings out my inner songbird he glanced toward the door amazed when it opened again didnt anyone in lunacy stay home in a snowstorm hopp fluffed at her hair pouring in now she announced heard youre clearing cars off the street chief snow plowll be doing the first sweep of the mains shortly its going to take a lot of sweeps i guess it will she nodded you got a minute just about he gestured toward his office you should be home mayor if we get that four feet youll be wading in it up to your armpits im short but im hardy and if i dont get out and about a bit during a storm i get cabin fever its january ignatious we expect to get hammered regardless its five above dark as the inside of a dead dog and were already heading toward the first foot with winds gusting at thirtyfive keeping your finger on the pulse lunacy radio he gestured toward the portable on his counter they promise to broadcast twentyfour hours a day while it blows always do speaking about media i gave the interview carrie took the pictures and youre still pissed off she bobbed her head at him town gets its first official police department and brings in a chief from the outside its news ignatious no argument there you were tapdancing around max it was actually more of a twostep i just learned how whatever the choreography i stopped the dancing and my method of doing so crossed a line i apologize for it accepted when she held out her hand to shake on it he surprised her by giving it a friendly squeeze go home hopp ill say the same cant do it first i get to live out a childhood dream im going riding on a snowplow every breath was like inhaling splinters of ice those same splinters managed to spear around his goggles and into his eyes every inch of his body was double or triple wrapped and he was still breathlessly cold it didnt seem real any of it the outrageous wind the earpounding v engine of the snowplow the white wall the headlights could barely penetrate now and then he could see the glow of a lamp against a window but most of the world had fined down to the half a foot of light jittering in front of the canaryyellow blade he didnt attempt conversation he didnt think bing wanted to talk to him anyway but the noise made the subject moot he had to admit bing handled the machine with the precision and delicacy of a surgeon it wasnt the swipe and dump nate had expected there were routes and disposal sites curbside excavations driveway detours all executed in near whiteout conditions and at a speed that had nate continually swallowing a protesting yelp he had no doubt bing would love to hear him shriek like a girl and so he gritted his teeth against any sound that could be mistaken as such after dumping another load bing took the brown bottle hed wedged under the seat unscrewed the cap and took a long pull the smell that blew into nates face was potent enough to make his eyes water since they were sitting contemplating the growing mountain of snow nate decided to risk a comment i heard alcohol lowers body temperature he shouted fucking propaganda to prove it bing took another pull from the bottle considering they were alone in the dark in a blizzard and that bing outweighed him by around seventy pounds and would nate was sure like nothing better than to bury him in the mountain of removed snow until his cold dead body was found in the spring thaw he decided not to argue the point or mention the law against carrying open containers of alcohol in a vehicle or the dangers of drinking while operating heavy machinery bing turned his massive shoulders nate could see nothing but his eyes squinting between watch cap and scarf see for yourself he shoved the bottle into nates hand it didnt seem like the moment to mention he wasnt much of a drinker more politic he decided and companionable to take a slug when he did his head exploded and his throat and stomach lining burned to cinders merciful mother of god he choked and when he inhaled swallowed shards of flame rather than ice through the ringing in his ears he could hear laughing unless the sound was the howl of some giant maniacal wolf what the fucking fuck is that he continued to wheeze while tears streamed out of his eyes and froze on his face battery acid plutonium liquid fire of hell bing took the bottle back took a chug and capped it horse turd whiskey oh perfect man cant handle his whiskey aint no man if thats the criteria ill be a woman ill take you back mary done all can be done for now praise the tiny baby jesus there was a crinkling of the skin around bings eyes that could have indicated a smile he reversed turned around i got twenty in the pool says youll be packing your bag before the end of the month nate sat still his throat burning eyes stinging his feet like icebergs despite two pair of thermal socks and boots who holds the pool skinny jim works the bar at the lodge nate merely nodded he didnt know where bing got his sense of direction but decided the man couldve guided magellan he zipped the machine along in the blinding snow and arrowed it straight to the curb at the lodge nates knees and ankles wept when he jumped down the snow on the sidewalk reached those frozen knees and the wind blew it rudely in his face as he gripped the rope guide and pulled himself toward the door the heat inside was almost painful clint black rolled out of the juke and replaced the humming in his ears there were a dozen people seated at the bar or at tables drinking eating holding conversations as if the wrath of god wasnt blowing on the other side of the door lunatics he thought every one of them he wanted coffee blistering hot and red meat hed cheerfully eat it raw he nodded as people called out to him and was fighting with snaps and zippers when charlene hurried over to him why you poor thing you must be frozen solid let me help you with that coat ive got it i your fingers will be all stiff it was too weird too surreal to have the mother of the woman hed bedded that afternoon undoing his snowcoated parka ive got it charlene could use some coffee though appreciate that ill get it for you myself right away she patted his cold cheek you just sit right down but when hed managed to strip off everything but his shirt and pants he walked to the bar he pulled out his wallet signaled to the man they called skinny jim heres a hundred he said in a voice loud enough to carry put it in the pool it says im staying he stuck his wallet back in his pocket then sat beside john professor chief nate angled his head to read the title of the current book cannery row good one thanks charlene dont you mention it she set his coffee down weve got a nice stew tonight warm you right up unless you want me to take care of that for you stew would be great have you got rooms if some of these people need to stay here tonight we always got room at the lodge ill dish you up that stew nate swiveled on his stool sipping coffee as he checked the room someone had plugged an old springsteen into the juke and the boss was singing about his glory days while pool balls thudded into pockets he recognized all the faces regulars people he saw nearly every night he couldnt see the pool players from his angle but made out the voices the mackie brothers any of these people going to get drunk then try to get home he asked john mackies might but charlene would talk them out of it most will clear out in an hour or so and the diehards will still be here in the morning which camp would you be that depends on you john lifted his beer meaning if you take charlene up on her offer ill be heading on up to my room alone if you dont ill be heading up to hers im just here for the stew then ill be staying in her room tonight john doesnt it bother you john contemplated his beer having it bother me doesnt change the way things are the way she is the romantics like to say you dont have a choice who you love i disagree people pick and they choose this is my choice charlene brought out the stew a basket with chunks of fresh bread and a thick wedge of apple pie man works out in this weather he needs to eat you do justice by that now nate i will you hear from meg charlene blinked as if translating the name from a foreign language no why just thought you two mightve gotten in touch with each other to let the stew cool a little he started with the bread seeing as shes out there on her own in this nobody knows how to handle herself better than meg she doesnt need anyone not a man or a mother she walked away letting the kitchen door slap shut behind her sore spot nate commented tender as they come bigger bruise yet if she thinks youre more interested in her daughter than in her im sorry to be the cause of that but i am he sampled the stew it was loaded with potatoes carrots beans and onions and a strong gamey meat that couldnt have come from cow it slid warm into his belly and made him forget about the cold whats this meat in here thatd be moose nate spooned up more studied it okay he said and ate it snowed all night and he slept like a stone through it the view out his window when he woke was like the static on a television screen he could hear the wind howling feel it pressing against the windowpane the lights didnt work so he lit candles and they made him think of meg he dressed studying the phone it was probably out too besides you didnt call a woman at sixthirty in the morning just because youd had sex with her there was no need to worry about her shed lived up here her entire life she was tucked inside her house with her two dogs and plenty of firewood he worried anyway as he used his flashlight to guide himself downstairs it was the first time hed seen the place empty tables were cleaned off the bar was wiped down there was no smell of coffee brewing bacon frying no morning clatter or conversation no little boy sitting at a table looking up at him with a quick smile there was nothing but dark the howl of the wind and snoring he followed the sound and shined his light over the mackie brothers they lay toe to nose on the pool table snoring away under layers of blanket he worked his way into the kitchen and after a hunt found a muffin taking it with him he pulled on his gear with the muffin stuffed in his pocket he pulled open the door the wind nearly knocked him over the force of it the shock of it the bitter snow that flew into his eyes his mouth his nose as he fought his way through the door his flashlight was next to useless but he aimed it out followed the line of the rope in its beam then he stuffed the light in his pocket gripped the rope with both hands and began to pull himself along on the sidewalk the snow was up to his thighs he thought a man could drown in it soundlessly even before he died of exposure he managed to fight his way to the street where thanks to bings plow and horseturd whiskey the snow was no more than ankle deep unless you ran into a drift hed have to cross the street damn near blind and without the guide to get to the station he closed his eyes brought the image of the street the location of the buildings into his head then lowering his shoulders to the wind he let go of the rope grabbed the flashlight again and started across he might as well have been in the wilderness instead of in a town with paved streets and sidewalks with people sleeping behind board and brick the wind was like a storm surf in his ears one that kept trying to shove him back as he bulled his way through it people died crossing the street all the time he reminded himself life was full of nasty risks nastier surprises a couple of guys could walk out of a bar and grill and one of them could end up dead in an alley an idiot could walk into a blizzard try to cross the street and end up wandering aimlessly for hours until he dropped dead of exposure three feet from shelter he was cursing when his boots bumped something solid picturing the curb nate waved his arms out like a blind man and found the guide for our next amazing feat he muttered hauling himself onto the buried sidewalk he dragged himself along until he found the cross rope then changed angles and plowed his way to the outer door of the station wondering why hed bothered to lock up he fished out his keys used his flashlight to help him find the locks in the entry he shook himself off but kept his gear on as hed suspected the station was frigid frigid enough he noted that the windows were frosted on the inside someone with more forethought than he had stacked wood by the stove he fired it up stood holding his hands still gloved to the flame when he had his breath back he closed the stove door he got candles a batteryoperated lamp and considered himself in business he found the battery radio tuned in to the local station as promised they were on the air and someone with a twisted sense of humor was spinning the beach boys seated at his desk he kept one ear on klun the other on peachs call radio and mourning the lack of coffee ate his muffin by eightthirty he was still on his own a reasonable hour he decided and settled down at the ham radio hed gotten a basic lesson from peach on operation and decided to take his first flight this is klpd calling kuna come in kuna meg you there pick up or sign on or whatever you call it he got static buzzing a couple of squeals this is klpd calling kuna come on galloway this is kuna responding you got a license to operate that radio burke over he knew it was ridiculous but relief simply blew through him at the sound of her voice right on its heels was pleasure im c of p comes with the badge bay over right over no you okay out there over thats affirmative were nice and cozy tucked up here listening to the taku you over i survived a hike across the street whats taku a rock group over its a mean bastard wind burke the one shaking your windows right now what the hell are you doing in the station over im on duty he glanced around the room noted he could see his own breath your power out she waited a beat ill say over for you in this sure its out generators up were fine chief you dont have to worry over check in once in a while and i wont hey you know what i had yesterday over besides me over ha god this felt good he thought he didnt care if it was cold as the ice of hell yeah besides i had horse turd whiskey and moose stew over she laughed long and loud well make a sourdough out of you burke gotta go feed my dogs and my fire see you around over and out over and out he murmured it was warm enough now to shed the parka though he kept on his hat and thermal vest he was poking through the files looking for busy work when peach pushed through the door wondered if anyone was crazy enough to come in today she said just me how the hell did you get here oh bing brought me in on the plow she dusted one hand over the babyblue fleece of her sweater snowplow as taxicab here let me get that he hurried over to take the big sack she carried you didnt have to come in jobs a job yeah but coffee is this coffee he dug the thermos out of the sack wasnt sure youd have the generator up yet not only dont i have it up i dont know if i can find it and since mechanics arent my strong point i wasnt sure id know what to do with it if i did find it this is coffee marry me have many many children with me she giggled like a girl slapped at him with her hand you be careful throwing out offers like that just because ive been married three times already doesnt mean i wont go for four you go ahead and have some coffee and a cinnamon bun maybe we could just live together in sin he set the sack on the counter and immediately poured coffee into a mug the scent hit him like a beautiful fist forever you smile like that more often i might just take you up on it well look what the taku blew in she added when peter stumbled in holy cow thats a whopper out there talked to otto hes on his way bing bring you in too no me and my dad mushed it mushed another world nate thought but peach was right a job was a job all right then peter lets get the generator going peach get ahold of the fire department lets get a crew together and clear off the sidewalks as soon as its light enough so people can get around if they need to priorities are around the clinic and the station when otto gets here tell him the mackies are passed out on the pool table at the lodge lets make sure they get home in one piece he pulled on his parka as he worked down his mental checklist lets see if we can get an eta on when powers going to be back on people are going to want to know phones too when i get back in well work up an announcement have the radio run it about what we know when we know it i want people to know were here if they need help and that too nate discovered felt good peter right behind you chief journal entry february nearly lost han in a crevice today it happened so fast were climbing pumped up a few hours from the summit cold hungry edgy but pumped only a climber understands the juice of that combination darths in the lead the only way to keep him from pitching another shitfit then han and im bringing up the flank but i forgot yesterday the days are starting to blur now one cold white door opening to the next cold white door i was lost in the rhythm of my own pounding head in the spell of the climb in the rise of white we crawled and grunted our way up a rock pitch moving well aiming for heaven i heard darth shout rock and the cannonball of the boulder hed dislodged spat out from that long chimney whizzing by hans head i had an instant to think no i dont want to go this way smashed by some fist of god sucker punched off the mountain it missed me as it had han by inches flying by in a finger snap of time and crashing bringing a quick and jagged rain of other rocks with it we cursed darth but then we curse one another over anything and everything now most of it in companionable good humor it helps surge the adrenaline as we get higher and the airs so thin that breathing is an exercise in pain and frustration i knew han was flagging but we pushed on pushed on driven by obsession and darths relentless insults his eyes look mad behind his goggles mad and possessed while i think of the mountain as a bitch when im driving into her belly with ax and frozen fingers shes a bitch i love i think for darth shes a demon and one hes hellbent to conquer we bedded down that night by tying ourselves into pitons with the black world beneath us and the black sky above i watched the lights a dazzle of liquid jade across that mirror of black again today darth took the lead being first seems to be another obsession and arguing wastes time in any case i was concerned enough about han to see the value of taking the flank keeping the weakest of us in the middle so it was darths need to be first and my position in the rear that saved the life of one of our trio wed packed the rope away id said already that it was too cold for rope didnt i again we were moving well moving up in the bright sparkle of the short day with even our curses whipped away by the roar of the wind then i see han stumble and start to slide it was like the ground disappeared under him a moments carelessness a patch of windslab snow and he was tumbling toward me i dont know i swear if i caught him or if he sprouted wings and flew but our hands locked and i slapped my ax into the ice praying it would hold praying the bitch wouldnt belch us both into the void for eternity i was on my belly holding his hands while he dangled over the edge of nothing were screaming both of us and im trying to dig in with my toes but were slipping sliding another few seconds and it wouldve been let him go or both of us are gone then darths ice ax cleaved into the ground beside me an inch from my shoulder and the pistoning of my heart cranked up to jackhammer he used it for purchase and reached down to grab hans arm some of the weight lifted from my screaming muscles and i was able to dig in belly back bellying back the two of us pulling han up with the blood boiling in our ears and our hearts slamming in our chests we rolled back from the edge lay there on the snow shaking under that cold yellow sun shaking for what seemed hours feet away from death and disaster we cant laugh about it even later none of us have the energy to make that short nightmare into a joke were too shaken up to climb and hans ankle is messed up hell never make the summit and we all know it we have no choice but to chop out a platform and camp divvy up food from our dwindling supplies while han pops painkillers hes weak but not so weak his eyes dont roll with fear as the wind slams its killing fists at the thin walls of our tent we should go back we should go back but when i floated that trial balloon darth went off berating han shrieking at me in a voice shrill as a womans he looks half mad maybe more than half hulking in the dark ice clinging to his stubbly beard and eyebrows bitter lights in his eyes hans accident has cost us a day and hell be damned if itll cost him the summit he has a point i cant deny it we are within striking distance of the goal han may be able to make it after a nights rest well climb tomorrow and if han cant manage well leave him do what we came to do and pick him up on the way back its insanity of course and even with the drugs han looks wrecked and scared but im caught in it past the point of no return the winds howling like a hundred rabid dogs that alone could drive a man mad eight for thirty hours the snow fell and the wind howledthe world was a cold white beast that rampaged day and night fangs bared claws extended to bite and rake at anyone brave or foolish enough to go out and face it generators hummed or roared and communications were reduced to radios travel was impossible as that beast stalked its way across the interior and over southeast alaska cars and trucks were buried planes grounded even the sled dogs waited for it to pass the little town of lunacy was cut off a frozen island in the midst of a blind white sea too busy to brood too astonished to curse nate dealt with emergencies a child whod toppled onto a table and needed to get to the clinic for stitches a man whod had a heart attack while trying to dig out his truck a chimney fire a family brawl he had drunk mike as opposed to big mike the cook in an unlocked cell sleeping off a bender and manny ozenburger in a locked one rethinking his position on driving his tundra pickup over his neighbors skidoo he kept crews hacking away at the snow on the main streets and pushed his way through the canyons of it to the corner store he found harry and deb sitting at a card table in front of the canned goods playing gin while cecil snuggled in his basket hell of a blow harry called out no its just hell nate pushed back the hood of his parka stopped to give cecil a quick rub he was out of breath and vaguely surprised to still be alive i need some supplies im going to bunk at the station until this is over debs eyes gleamed oh something wrong at the lodge no yanking off gloves nate began to hunt up basics to keep body and soul together somebody needs to man the radio and weve got a couple of guests i heard drunk mike tied one on gin gin damn you harry tied one on nate agreed dumping bread lunch meat chips on the counter and staggered around singing bob seger songs snow removal crew spotted him and hauled him up when he fell facedown in the middle of the damn street nate picked up a sixpack of coke they hadnt seen him brought him in we might ve found him by april dead as elvis ill just run a tab for these chief harry got out his book noted down the purchases and im not convinced elvis is dead this going to be enough for you itll have to be getting it backs going to be an adventure why dont you sit a minute have some of this coffee deb was already getting up let me fix you a sandwich nate stared at her it wasnt the way people usually treated cops thanks but i need to get back if you need anything hell send up a flare he pulled on his gloves resecured his hood then hefted his bag of supplies it wasnt any more hospitable out than it had been five minutes before he felt the teeth and claws slice at him as he used the rope and instinct to drag his way toward the station hed left every light burning to give himself a beacon he could hear the muffled rumble of bings plow and hoped to sweet god that bing didnt head his way running over him accidentally or purposely the beast as he thought of the storm was doing its best to mock the efforts of the crews but theyd made a difference instead of swimming through the snow he was wading through it he heard gunshots three quick reports he paused strained to make out the direction then shook his head and kept going he sincerely hoped no one was lying in the snow with a gunshot wound because he couldnt do a damn thing about it he was about ten feet away from the station concentrating on the haze of light cheering himself on with the thought of heat when bings plow rolled out of the white his heart stopped he actually heard the thunder of it click off and the swishing sensation of his blood draining the plow looked enormous a mountain of machine avalanching toward him it stopped maybe a breathless foot from the toes of his boots bing leaned out his snowcaked beard making him resemble an insane santa out for a stroll yeah cant get enough of it you hear those gunshots yeah so nothing you need a break the heats on weve got sandwich makings why you got manny locked up tim bower drives that damn pissant snowmobile around like a goddamn crazy teenager every chance he gets public fucking nuisance since he was freezing nate decided to skip the part about destruction of private property and reckless driving tim bower was on the damn pissant snowmobile at the time manny flattened it got off quick enough didnt he despite everything nate found himself grinning dived headfirst into a snowbank skinny jim saw it said it looked like a double gainer bing merely grunted pulled his head in and backed the plow away inside nate made sandwiches took one to the disgruntled manny and checked on drunk mike he decided to take his own meal at the radio he liked hearing megs voice feeling that strange sexy connection it had been a long time since hed had anyone to talk to about his day since hed had anyone hed wanted to talk to the conversation added a little spice to his plain meal and some comfort to the solitude tims wrecked that snowmobile more times than i can count she said after hed told her about its final destruction manny did everyone a favor over maybe i think i can talktim out of pressing charges if manny pays for it you planning on coming into town once this is cleared up over im not big on plans over movie nights coming up i was hoping to sample your popcorn over its a possibility ive got some jobs lined up once im cleared to fly but i like movies over he drank some coke and pictured her sitting at the radio the dogs at her feet and the fire glowing behind her why dont we make it a date over i dont make dates over ever over things happen if they happen since we both liked the sex things will probably happen since she didnt say over he assumed she was giving it some thought he certainly was tell you what burke next time things happen you can tell me your long sad story over he was imagining the red tattoo at the small of her back why do you think ive got one over cutie youre the saddest man ive ever seen you tell me the story and well see what happens next over if we damn it whats that noise over sounds like drunk mikes awake and puking it up in the cell mannys finding that understandably objectionable he added as the sounds of sickness and outrage spiked out of the cells i have to go over boy a cops life is fraught with danger over and out under the circumstances nate opted to let both of his prisoners hitch rides home on the plow braving the elements he went out to dump more gas into the generator after a short debate he carted one of the cots out set it up near the radio as an afterthought he routed through peachs drawer and found one of her paperback romance novels he settled in with the book setting a mental alarm so he could put it with its sexy cover back where it came from with no one the wiser a coke and the sounds of the storm the book was better than hed imagined and took him away to the lush green fields of ireland in the days of castles and keeps there was a hefty dose of magic and fantasy tossed in so he followed the adventures of moira the sorceress and prince liam with considerable interest the first love scene gave him pause as he thought about the maternal peach reading about sex between answering calls and handing out sticky buns but he was caught up he fell asleep with the book open on his chest and the lights still blazing the sorceress had megs face her hair ink black swirled into the air like wings she stood on a white hill in brilliant sunlight that streamed through the thin red gown she wore she lifted her arms slid the gown from her shoulders so that it slithered down her body naked she walked to him her eyes were blue ice as she opened her arms and took him in he felt her lips on his hot hungry he was under her surrounded by her when she rose up wild wind rushed through her hair when she lowered the heat of her all but burned him what do you have to be sad about suddenly through the pleasure was pain abrupt searing he hissed against it and his body stiffened the burning insult of bullets into flesh but she smiled only smiled youre alive arent you she lifted a hand smeared with his blood if you bleed youre alive im shot jesus im hit and alive she said as his blood dripped from her hand onto his face he was in the alley smelling blood and cordite smelling garbage and death damp air from the rain cold cold for april cold and wet and dark it was all a blur the shouts the shots the pain when the bullet dug into his leg hed fallen behind and jack had gone in first shouldnt be here what the hell were they doing here more shots flashes of light in the dark thuds was that steel hitting flesh that stunning obscene pain in the side that took him down again so hed had to crawl crawl over the damp concrete to where his partner his friend lay dying but this time jack turned his head and his eyes were red as the blood that pumped out of his chest you killed me you stupid son of a bitch anybody should be dead its you now see if you can live with it he woke in a cold sweat his partners dream voice still echoing in his head nate pushed himself up to sit on the side of the cot he dropped his head in his hands so far he thought he was doing a lousy job of living with it he made himself get up carry the bunk back to the cell he thought of the pills he stowed in his desk drawer but bypassed his office and made himself go out to pour the last of the gas into the generator it wasnt until he was heading back inside that he realized it had stopped snowing the air was perfectly still perfectly quiet there was a faint hint of moonlight sprinkling over the mounds and seas of snow giving the white a pale blue hue his breath clouded out as he stood like a bug he thought trapped in crystal instead of amber the storm had passed and he was still alive see if you can live with it well he would hed keep seeing if he could live with it inside he brewed coffee switched on the radio a sleepy voice who identified himself as mitch dauber the voice of lunacy segued into local news announcements and weather people started coming out bears crawling out of their caves they shoveled and plowed they gathered together for conversation ate and walked and slept they lived the lunatic police log wednesday january am a chimney fire in the

woods he could be heard singing a nation once again subsequently identified as michael sullivan the man was transported to lunacy pd and turned over to chief of police ignatious burke alone in the station nate scanned the rest of the log it continued with reports of drunk and disorderlies the loss and recovery of a missing dog the call from one of the outoftowners with a serious case of cabin fever claiming wolves were playing poker on his porch names were printed on each and every item no matter how embarrassing it might be for the individual he wondered what it wouldve been like if the baltimore sun for instance had been so thorough and merciless in listing the calls the names and the actions taken by the police force in baltimore he had to admit he found it endlessly entertaining max and carrie must have put the paper together and gone to print the minute the storm was over he thought pictures of the storm and the aftermath were damn good too and the story on it with maxs byline was almost poetic he didnt mind the story on himself as much as hed thought he would in fact he was going to keep his copy along with his first two issues of the lunatic whenever he could get out to megs again hed take her one a week after the storm blew in the roads were clear enough dropping by her place to take her a paper couldnt be considered a date giving her a call just to make sure she was there and not flying around somewhere couldnt be considered plans it was just being practical expecting his staff to come in any moment nate tucked the newspaper in a desk drawer and started out to put some fuel in the woodstove hopp pushed through the outside door weve got trouble she said is it bigger than four and a half feet of snow she shoved back her hood under it her face was bone white three missing boys give me the details he backed up who when and where they were last seen steven wise joe and laras boy his cousin scott from talkeetna and one of their college friends joe and lara thought steven and scott were down in prince william for winter break scotts parents thought the same lara and scotts mother got together on the radio last night to pass the time and catch up and it came out some of the things each of the boys had told them didnt jibe they got suspicious enough that lara tried calling steven at college hes not back neither is scott college where hopp anchorage she passed a hand over her face then they need to notify the anchorage pd no no lara got hold of stevens girlfriend those idiot boys are trying a winter climb up the south face of no name whats no name its a damn mountain ignatious fear was jumping in her eyes a goddamn big mountain theyve been gone six days laras out of her mind nate strode to his office yanked out his map show me the mountain here she jabbed a finger its a favorite with the locals and a lot of climbers from outside use it for entertainment or a kind of training ground for a try at denali but trying a climb in january s just bone stupid especially for three inexperienced boys we need to call search and rescue get planes in the air at first light that gives us three hours ill contact s and r get on one of those twoways call otto peter and peach in here then i want to know who all the pilots are other than meg in the area he scanned the phone numbers peach had neatly listed what are the chances theyre still alive with a twoway in hand hopp sat heavily they need a miracle five minutes after she got the call meg was dressed and loading up gear she was tempted to ignore the radio call from lunacy pd but decided it might be an update on the lost climbers this is kuna responding over im going with you pick me up by the river on your way over irritation rippled through her as she stuffed extra medical supplies in her bag i dont need a copilot burke and i dont have time to waste showing you the sights ill contact you when i find them over im going with you those boys deserve another pair of eyes and mine are good ill be ready when you get here over and out damn it i hate heroes she hauled up the pack and with the dogs beside her went out she grabbed the rest of the gear and using the flashlight trudged down to the lake in snowshoes shed made two runs since the all clear to fly and thanked god she didnt have to take an hour now to dig out her plane she didnt think about the boys dead or alive on the mountain she simply took the steps she pulled off the wing covers stowed them it was work but less work thah scraping the frost from uncovered wings after draining the water traps in the bottoms of the wing tanks she climbed up to check the gas level by eye topped off the fuel making a circuit she checked flaps tail feathers every part of the plane that moved to make certain everything was secure lives had been lost she knew due to a loose bolt her mind focused only on the safety check she turned her prop several times to remove any pooled oil swinging into the plane she stowed the gear then strapped in she hit the starter switched on the engine the prop turned sluggishly at first then the engine fired with a belch of exhaust while the engine warmed she checked gauges she was in control here as much as she considered anyone was in control of anything it was still shy of dawn when she released the brakes she set the flaps the trim tab for takeoff gave the controls a shove and yank as she looked out to be sure the ailerons were moving if the elevators responded satisfied she straightened in her seat she kissed her fingers touched them to the magnetized photo of buddy holly stuck to the control board and rammed the throttle forward she hadnt yet decided whether to head to lunacy or not as she circled the lake building speed for takeoff she let the decision hang maybe she would maybe she wouldnt she nosed up rising into the air just as dawn began to break in the v east then with a shrug aimed that nose toward lunacy he was where hed said hed be standing on the edge of the ice with a mountain of snow at his back he had a pack slung over his shoulder she could only hope someone had told the cheechako what to bring as emergency gear she saw that hopp was with him and her stomach sank when she recognized the other figures as joe and lara it forced her to think of what might be of the bodies shed transported before of the ones she might transport today she set down on the ribbon of ice waited with the engines running for nate to cross it the prop wash blew at his coat his hair then he was climbing in stowing his pack strapping in hope you know what youre in for she said i havent got a clue maybe thats better she kissed her fingers touched them to buddy without looking at the terrified faces to her right she pushed to take off using the hand mike she contacted control in talkeetna and gave them her data then they were up over the trees and veering east northeast into the pale rising sun youre eyes and ballast burke if jacob wasnt in nome visiting his son i wouldnt have settled for you as either got it whos jacob jacob itu best bush pilot ive ever known he taught me the man you shared your popcorn with at the town meeting thats right they hit a pocket of air and she saw his hand fist against the bumps you get airsick im going to be really unhappy no i just hate flying whys that gravity she grinned as they continued to bump turbulence bothers you youre going to have a really bad day theres still time to take you back tell that to the three kids were going after the grin vanished she watched the mountains the fierce rise of them while the ground below blurred with speed and lowlying clouds is that why youre a cop saving peoples your mission no he said nothing as they shuddered through another patch of rough air why does a bush pilot have a picture of buddy holly in her cockpit to remind her shit happens as the sun speared up she took sunglasses out of her pocket and put them on below she saw the snake of dogsled trails spirals of chimney smoke a wedge of trees a rise of land she used the landmarks as much as her gauges binoculars in the compartment there she told him and made a small adjustment in the propeller pitch eased the throttle forward i brought my own he unzipped his parka pulled them out from where they hung around his neck tell me where to look if they attempted a climb up the south face theydve been dumped off on the sun glacier dumped off by who thats a mystery isnt it her jaw set some yahoo too interested in money to blow them off a lot of people have planes and a lot of people fly them it doesnt make them pilots whoever it was didnt report them when the storm came through and sure as hell didnt pick them back up fucking crazy its all right to be crazy its not all right to be stupid and thats the category this falls into airs going to get rougher when we hit the mountains dont say hit and mountain in the same sentence he looked down a slice of trees an ocean of snow a plate of ice that was a lake a huddle of perhaps six cabins all appearing disappearing through clouds it should have seemed barren stark and instead it was stunning the sky was already going that deep hard blue with the cruel elegance of the mountains etched over it he thought of three boys trapped in that cruelty for six days she banked sharp right and he had to reach deep inside for the grit just to keep his eyes open the mountains blue and white and monstrous swallowed the view she dipped through a gap and all he could see on either side was rock and ice and death over the whine of the engines he heard something like thunder and saw a tsunami of snow burst from the mountain what the avalanche her voice was utterly calm as the plane began to shake youre going to want to hold on it gushed white over white over white an iced volcano erupting charging the air with the roar of a thousand runaway trains while the plane pingponged right left up down he thought he heard meg curse and what sounded like antiaircraft fire beat against the plane the storm that vomited out of the mountain spewed bits of debris over the windscreen but it wasnt fear that rushed into him it was awe metal pinged and rang as bullets of ice and rock struck the plane wind dragged at it yanked at it pelted it until it seemed inevitable they would crash into the cliff face or simply be smashed apart by shrapnel then they were cruising between walls of ice over a narrow frozen valley and into the blue kiss my ass she let out a whoop threw her head back and laughed that was a ride awesome nate agreed and twisted in his seat trying to turn enough to see the rest of the show ive never seen anything like it mountains are moody you never know when theyre going to take a shot she slid her gaze toward him youre pretty cool under fire chief you too he settled back in his seat and wondered if his pounding heart had broken any of his ribs so come here often every chance i get you can start making use of those binocs weve got a lot of area to cover and we wont be the only ones covering it keep a sharp eye she fixed on headphones ill be in communication with control where do i aim my sharp eye there she lifted her chin one oclock compared to denali it seemed almost tame and its beauty somewhat ordinary beside the mountains magnificence there were smaller peaks ranging between what they called no name and denali and there were larger rolling back spearing up all in a jagged layered wall against the sky how big is it twelve thousand and change a good challenging climb in april or may trickier but not impossible in the winter unless youre a group of college kids on a lark then its next to suicide we find out who transported three underage kids dumped them out in january therell be hell to pay he knew that tone of voice flat emotionless you think theyre dead oh yeah but youre here anyway wont be the first time ive looked for bodies or found them she thought of the supplies and gear in the plane emergency rations medical supplies thermal blankets and prayed there would be cause to use them look for debris tents equipment bodies there are a lot of crevices ill get as close as i can he wanted them to be alive hed had enough of death enough of waste he hadnt come to look for bodies but for boys frightened lost possibly injured but boys he could return to their terrified parents he scanned through his field glasses he could see the bowelloosening drops the skinny ledges the sheer walls of ice there was no point in wondering why anyone would be compelled to risk limb or life brave hideous conditions starve and suffer to hack his way to the top people did crazier things for sport he registered the buffeting winds the uneasy proximity of the little plane to the unforgiving walls and shut down the fear he searched until his eyes burned then lowered the glasses to blink them clear nothing yet its a big mountain she circled he searched while she continued to detail coordinates to control he spotted another plane a little yellow bird swooping to the west and the sturdy bulk of a chopper the mountain dwarfed everything it no longer looked small to him not with everything he had focused on it there were shapes that made its shape plates of rippling ice fields of snow fists of black rock that were punched out of cliff walls and were streamed with somehow delicate rivers of more ice like glossy icing he saw shadows he imagined the sun never found and vicious drops to nothing from one a beam of light shot back at him like sun bouncing off crystal something down there he called out metal or glass reflective in that crevice ill circle around he lowered the binoculars to rub at his eyes wishing hed brought his own sunglasses the glare was murderous she climbed banked and as she circled nate caught a flicker of color against the snow wait there whats that about four oclock jesus meg four oclock son of a bitch one of thems alive he saw it now the bright blue the movement the vaguely human shape frantically windmilling arms to signal she dipped the wings right then left right then left as she arrowed back this is beaverninerzulunineralfatango ive got one she said into her headset alive just above sun glacier im going in for him youre going to land burke asked when shed repeated the call and relayed coordinates on that youre going one better she told him youre going out on it i cant leave the plane crosswinds are too risky and theres no place and no time to tie down he stared down saw the figure stumble fall and roll tumbling sliding before it lay still nearly invisible now in the white surf better give me a lesson and make it quick i put down you get out climb up get him bring him back then we all go home and have a really big beer short lesson no time for much more make him walk if he cant drag him grab some goggles youll need them theres no fancy work here its just like crossing a pond and climbing a few rocks just doing it several thousand feet above sea level no big deal she showed her teeth in a grin as she fought minor little wars to keep the plane steady thats the spirit the wind tore at the plane and she fought back dragging the nose back up leveling the wings she angled toward her approach dropped the gear cut back the throttle nate decided not to hold his breath since inhaling and exhaling might not be an option very shortly but she slid the plane onto the glacier between the void and the wall move she ordered but he was already yanking off his safety belt its probably twenty below out there so you make it quick unless i have to take off again dont try to give him any medical assistance until weve got him back in the plane just get him haul him dump him in ive got it one more thing she shouted as he shoved open the door and the wind roared in if i do have to lift off dont panic ill come back for you he leaped onto the mountain it wasnt the time to question to overthink cold cut into him like knives and the air was so thin that it sliced his throat there were hills rising up out of hills rippling seas acres of shadow oceans of white he pushed himself across the glacier settling for a lumbering jog instead of the sprint hed hoped for when he hit rock he went by instinct pulling his way up clattering like a goat then sinking nearly to his knees when the short wall was scaled he heard engines the wind and his own laboring breath he dropped down beside the boy and despite megs instructions felt for a pulse the kids face was gray with rough patches of what looked like dried skin on his cheek his chin but his eyes fluttered open made it he croaked out the words made it yeah lets get the hell out of here theyre in the cave couldnt make it couldnt make it down scotts sick brad think his leg might be broken i came for help i came youve got it you can show us where they are once were back in the plane can you walk dont know try nate fought the boy up took his weight come on steven one foot in front of the other youve come this far cant feel my feet just lift your legs one at a time theyll follow youve got to climb down he could already feel the cold eating through his gloves and wished hed thought to double up im not good enough at this to carry you hold on to me and help me climb down weve got to get down to help your friends i had to leave them to get help had to leave them with the dead man its all right were going back for them were climbing down now ready i can do it nate went first if the kid fell fainted slipped hed break the fall he kept shouting at him as they picked their way down shouting to keep the boy steady and conscious demanding answers to keep him alert how long since you left your friends i dont know two days three hartborne didnt come back or i think i saw but then i didnt okay nearly there youre going to show us where your friends are in just a couple minutes in the ice cave with the dead man whos the dead man nate dropped down on the glacier whos the dead man dont know the voice was dreamy now as steven slithered and slumped into nates hold found him in the cave ice man staring just staring got an ax in his chest spooky i bet he half dragged half carried steven toward the shuddering plane he knows where the others are he pushed then climbed in to pull steven into the plane he can show us get him in the back under the blankets firstaid kits in the bag hot coffee in the thermos dont let him drink too much am i still alive the boy was shivering now his body quaking from the cold yeah you are nate laid him on the floor between the seats then covered him with blankets while meg lifted off he heard the wind and engines screaming and he wondered if theyd be ripped to pieces now after all you need to tell us where your friends are i can show you with his teeth chattering he tried to take the cup of coffee nate poured here let me do it just sip as he sipped tears began to leak out of his eyes i didnt think id make it theyd die up there because i couldnt make it down to the plane you did make it plane wasnt there he wasnt there we were we were there doing his best to brace himself against the jolts of the plane nate carefully lifted the coffee again we almost got to the top but scott was sick and brad fell his legs hurt we got to the cave we found the cave and got in before the storm hit we stayed in there theres a dead man so you said im not making it up nate nodded youll show us nine nate hated hospitals it was one of the triggers that shot him back into the dark hed spent too much time in one after hed been wounded enough time for the pain and grief and guilt to coalesce into the gaping void of depression he hadnt been able to escape it hed longed for the emptiness of sleep but sleep brought dreams and dreams were worse than the black hed hoped passively that hed die just slide soundlessly away he hadnt considered killing himself that would have taken too much effort too much activity no one had blamed him for jacks death hed wanted them to but instead theyd come with their flowers or sympathy even their admiration and it had weighed on him like lead talk of therapy counseling antidepressants barely penetrated hed gone through the motions just to get doctors and concerned friends off his back hed gone through the motions for months now he was back in a hospital and could feel the soft and sticky fingers of hopelessness plucking at him easier so much easier to give in to just let go and sink into the dark chief burke nate stared down at the coffee in his hand black coffee he didnt want it couldnt quite remember how it had gotten there he was too tired for coffee too tired to get up and throw it away chief burke he glanced up focused on a face female midfifties brown eyes behind small blackframed glasses he couldnt quite remember who she was yeah sorry steven would like to see you hes awake and lucid it swam back slowly like thoughts oozing through mud the three boys the mountain hows he doing hes young and healthy he was dehydrated and he may lose a couple toes but he may keep them all so hes lucky the other two are on their way in im hoping the same goes they got them off the mountain thats what im told you can have a few minutes with steven thanks as he followed her the sounds and smells of the er penetrated the voices the pings the fretful crying of an infant he moved into an exam room and saw the boy on a bed he had some color under the patches on his cheeks his hair was matted and blond his eyes clouded with worry you got me off nate burke new chief of police in lunacy since steven held out a hand nate took it careful to avoid pressing on the iv needle your friends are on their way in i heard but nobodyll tell me how they are well find out when they get here they wouldnt be on their way if you hadnt given us the location steven nearly makes up for being stupid enough to go up there in the first place seemed like a good idea at the time he tried a wan smile everything went wrong and i think something happened to hartborne we only gave him half the money just to be sure hed come back were checking into it why dont you give me his full name any other information on him well brad knew him actually brad knew a guy who knew him okay well talk to brad my parents are going to kill me oh to be twenty nate thought and be as concerned with parental wrath as with a neardeath experience count on it tell me about the dead man in the cave steven i didnt make it up not saying you did we ah saw him we couldnt leave the cave not with brads leg we decided id go back down meet hartborne get help they had to stay in there with him with the ice man he was just sitting there staring the ax in his chest i took pictures his eyes widened as he struggled to sit up straighten i took pictures he repeated the camera it i think its in the pocket of my insulated vest i think its still there you can see hold on a minute nate moved over to the pile of clothes pawed through and came up with the vest and in the inside zippered pocket was one of those small digital cameras hardly bigger than a credit card i dont know how to work this i can show you you have to turn it on and then see the viewer here you can call up pictures from the memory the last ones i took were of the dead guy i took like three cause i wanted there nate studied the facial closeup in the little viewer the hair mightve been black or brown but it was covered with frost and ice that silvered it longish nearly shoulderlength hair with a dark watch cap pulled low over it the face was narrow white slashed by icecrusted brows hed seen death often enough to recognize it in the eyes wide and blue he recalled the previous picture there was the body of a man age between at his rough guess twenty and forty he sat with his back to the ice wall legs splayed out he wore a black and yellow parka and snow pants climbing boots heavy gloves what appeared to be a small ax was buried in his chest did you touch the body no well i kinda poked at him it frozen solid okay steven im going to need to take your camera ill get it back to you sure no problem he couldve been up there for years you know decades or something it creeped us out let me tell you but it sort of took our minds out of the shit we were in do you think they know anything about brad and scott ill find out ill go get the doctor im going to need to talk to you again anytime man seriously thanks for saving my life take better care of it he headed out slipping the camera into his pocket hed have to contact the state police he thought homicide in the mountains was out of his jurisdiction but that didnt mean he couldnt make some copies of the pictures for his own files who was he how had he gotten there how long had he been there why was he dead the questions got him through the er and to the nurses station just as the rescue team brought in the other two boys he decided the best place for him was out of the way and when he spotted meg swing in behind the team he crossed to her its their lucky day she said nate caught a glimpse of one of the boys faces shook his head thats debatable any day the mountain doesnt kill you is lucky and bringing them back alive when shed expected to find bodies pumped her theyre probably going to lose a few digits and the kid with the broken leg is in for some serious pain and physical therapy but theyre not dead weve lost the light and i dont see any reason to head out this late we wont be flying back tonight im going to get us a room at the wayfarer rates are reasonable and the foods good you ready ive got a couple of things to do ill find you youre longer than twenty minutes youll find me in the bar i want alcohol food and sex she gave him a suggestive smile more or less in that order sounds reasonable ill be there she zipped up her coat oh that reflection you caught plane wreck probably the guy who took those kids up mountain got one after all he was closer to ninety than twenty minutes and he found meg as promised in the bar it was woodpaneled smoky and decorated with animal heads she was passing the time at her table with a beer and a bump and a plate of something that looked like nachos she had her feet up on the second chair but shifted them off when nate stepped up to the table there you are hey stu same for my friend just the beer nate corrected these any good he asked as he pried up a nacho they fill the hole when were suitably buzzed well go have a steak did you stay back to keep an eye on those boys that and a couple of other things he dragged off his hat scooped a hand through his hair rescue team didnt go into the cave boys dragged themselves out when they heard the air support she scooped up cheese meat salsa with a chip priority was to get them down for medical assistance somebodyll go up eventually for the gear they left behind and the dead guy she lifted her eyebrows you bought that story yeah i did added to that the kid took pictures she pursed her lips then pried up another loaded chip no shit beers up came the call from the bar hold on she said to nate ill get it you want another round meg stu asked her well let him catch up some first she snagged the brown bottle brought it back to the table he took pictures nate nodded took a gulp of beer digital camera which he had in his pocket i talked this guy at the hospital into printing them out for me he tapped his fingers on the manila envelope hed tossed on the table i had to turn the camera over to the state boys maybe theyll keep me in the loop maybe not he shrugged you want to be in the loop i dont know he shrugged again tapped his fingers again i dont know oh he wanted to be in the loop she thought she could all but see him making some sort of mental list some sort of cop list if thats what it took to turn those sad gray eyes sharp she hoped the state boys let him play he probably hasnt been up there very long she lifted her glass why do you say that somebody wouldve found him she shook her head sipped whiskey not necessarily cave like that can get buried in a storm drowned under in an avalanche or overlooked by climbers another avalanche oh look theres a cave then it depends on where he was in the cave how deep couldve been up there for a season or for fifty years theyll get forensics either way theyll be able to date him hopefully id him already working on solving the case amused she gestured toward the envelope let me see maybe well be like nick and nora charles its not the movies and its not pretty meg neither is gutting a moose she chomped another nacho then drew the envelope over to open it if hes a local maybe somebodyll recognize him though you get plenty of outsiders on no name in any given year the kind of gear hes wearing should he saw her color drain her eyes glaze and cursed himself but when he started to take the printout from her she jerked back shoved at his arm with her free hand you dont need to look at that lets just put it away she needed to look maybe the air was trapped in her lungs and maybe her stomach had pitched down to her feet but she needed to look deliberately she took the rest of the photos out lined them up on the table then she picked up the whiskey downed it i know who this is you recognize him without thinking nate scooted his chair closer to hers so they stared at the photos together youre sure oh yeah im sure its my father she shoved away from the table her face was very pale but she didnt quiver pay for the drinks will you chief im going to have to put a hold on that steak dinner he moved fast scooping the printouts back in the envelope digging out bills to drop on the table but she was already through the lobby and at the top of the steps when he caught up meg back off a minute you need to talk to me come up in an hour room go away ignatious she kept climbing didnt allow herself to think didnt allow herself to feel not yet not until she was behind a locked door there were things she didnt believe in sharing he didnt follow part of her brain registered that and gave him points for restraint and maybe sensitivity she went into the room where shed already dumped spare gear locked the door added the chain then she walked directly into the bathroom and was miserably and violently ill when she was done she sat on the chilly floor her forehead braced on her knees she didnt weep she hoped she would hoped she could cry at some point but not now now she felt raw and shaken and thank god angry someone had killed her father and left him alone for years for years when shed lived without him when shed believed hed walked away from her without a second thought that she wasnt good enough or important enough smart enough pretty enough whatever enough seemed to fit at any given time when the missing of him was a hole in her belly but he hadnt walked away from her hed gone to the mountain something as natural for him as breathing and died there the mountain hadnt killed him she could have accepted that as fate as destiny a man had killed him and that couldnt be accepted or forgiven or left unpunished she rose stripped and running the water cold stepped into the shower she let it stream over her until the fuzziness in her head cleared then she dressed again to lie down on the bed in the dark and think about the last time shed seen her father hed come into her room where shed been pretending to study for a history test as long as she was pretending to study she didnt have to do her chores shed been sick of chores she remembered even now that quick lift in the heart when she saw it was her father rather than her mother coming to check on her he never nagged about chores or studying she thought he was the most handsome man in the world with his long dark hair and his fast grins hed taught her everything she believed really important about the stars and climbing about survival in the wild how to build a campfire how to fish and clean and cook the catch hed taken her flying with jacob and it was their secret that jacob was teaching her to fly he looked at the book open on her bed where she was flopped on her belly and rolled his eyes boring i hate history i have a test tomorrow bummer youll do okay you always do he sat on the bed gave her ribs a quick tickle hey kid i gotta take off for a while how come he lifted a hand rubbed his thumb and forefinger together how come we need money now your mom says we do shes the one who knows i heard you fighting this morning no big deal we like to fight ill pick up a couple of jobs make some moola everybodyll be happy a couple of weeks meg maybe three i dont have anything to do when youre gone youll find something and she could tell even as a girl of thirteen she could tell he was already gone in his head his pat on the head was absent like an uncles well go ice fishing when i get back sure and she was sulking ready to shrug him off before he could shrug her off see you later cupcake she had to force herself not to spring up to rush after him hold tight before he strolled away a hundred times since that afternoon shed wished shed given in given them both that one last contact she wished it now even as she rode that last memory in the dark she stayed where she was until she heard the knock on the door resigned she got up switched on lights ran her hand through the hair that hadnt quite dried from the shower when she opened the door to nate he was carrying a tray and had another sitting on the floor outside the door we need to eat maybe hed hated it when people had pushed food or whatever cure or comfort on him during the worst of his own misery but it worked and that was the bottom line fine she gestured toward the bed the only surface big enough in the room to double as a dining table then she bent and hefted the second tray if you want to be alone after i can get another room no point she sat crosslegged on the bed and ignoring the salad on her tray cut into the steak that ones mine he switched trays they said you went for bloody i dont dont miss a trick do you except you brought up coffee instead of whiskey you need a bottle ill get you one she sighed cut into the meat bet you would howd i end up sharing a steak dinner in anchorage with a nice guy im not particularly i gave you an hour so you could pull yourself together i brought you food so youd keep yourself together while you tell me about your father im sorry meg its a hard hit after you talk to me were going to have to take this to the detective in charge she cut another bite forked down into one of the soggy steak fries tell me something back where you came from you were a good cop its about the only thing i was ever good at you handle murders yeah ill talk to whoevers in charge but i want you looking into this for me theres not that much i can do theres always something ill pay you he ate contemplatively a hard hit he repeated which is why im not going to slap at you for that insult i dont know that many people who find money insulting but fine i want someone i know looking for the son of a bitch who killed my father you barely know me i know youre good in bed she smiled a little okay a guy can be an asshole and still be a stallion but i also know that you keep your head under pressure and are dedicated or stupid enough to climb out on a glacier to save a kid youve never met and you think ahead enough to remember to ask down in the restaurant how meg likes her steak my dogs like you help me out here chief he reached out and touched her hair a little stroke over the damp black whens the last time you saw him february february sixth do you know where he was going he said to pick up some work here in anchorage i figured or up in fairbanks he and my mother had been fighting about money and a variety of other things that was typical he said hed be gone a couple weeks or so he never came back your mother file a missing persons report nothen her brow creased at least i dont think so we assumed everyone assumed hed just taken a hike theyd been fighting she continued maybe more than usual he was restless even i could see it he wasnt the salt of the earth nate he wasnt a responsible sort though he was always good to me and we never went without anything important it wasnt enough for charlene and they argued she steadied herself kept eating because it was there he drank he smoked dope he gambled when he felt like it worked when he felt like it and fucked off when he felt like it i loved him maybe because of all that he was thirtythree when he left that afternoon and using the wisdom of hindsight and maturity i can see it was freaking him out to be thirtythree to be the father of a halfgrown girl and hooked up with the same woman year after year maybe he was at a kind of crossroads you know maybe he decided to take that winter climb as a kind of last idiocy of youth or maybe he was never coming back anyway but somebody made the decision for him he have enemies probably but nobody i could say would cause him harm hed piss people off but nothing major what about your stepfather she gave her salad a couple of pokes with her fork what about him how soon after your father disappeared did charlene get married howd she work the divorce first she didnt need a divorce she and my father werent married he didnt believe in the legal boundaries of marriage and blah blah she married old man hidel about a year after a little less if youre thinking karl hidel climbed up no name and carved an ice ax in my fathers chest you can forget it he was sixtyeight and fifty pounds overweight when charlene hooked him as an afterthought she picked up the salad bowl and ate smoked like a chimney he could barely climb the stairs much less a mountain who would have climbed with your father jesus nate anybody anybody who wanted the rush you know those kids today give them a little time and theyll talk about what happened up there as if it was one of the most exciting events of their lives climbers are crazier than bush pilots when he said nothing she let out a little breath ate some more salad he was a good climber had a solid rep there maybe he had taken a job guiding a group up on a winter climb or he hooked up with a couple of buddies and likeminded morons and decided to fart into the face of death he ever do anything stronger than pot maybe probably charlene would know she rubbed her eyes shit i have to tell her meg were either one of them involved with anyone else while they were together if thats a delicate way of asking if they screwed around i dont know ask her he was losing her her anger and impatience would make questioning impossible in another minute or two you said he gambled seriously no i dont know not that ive ever heard hed blow a paycheck if he had one or pile up some ious because he didnt win very often but nothing heavy at least not locally i never heard about him being into anything illegal other than recreational drugs and there are plenty of people whod be happy to tell me if he had been not because they didnt like him people did just because people like to tell you that kind of thing okay he rubbed a hand on her thigh ill ask some questions and ill make nice with whoever catches the case so theyll keep me updated well lets get out of here she rolled off the bed leaving her halfeaten dinner her hands rapped a beat against her legs i know this place the musics good we can have a couple of drinks then well come back and have some chandelierswinging sex instead of commenting on her change of mood he merely glanced up at the old and dingy ceiling light that doesnt look all that sturdy it made her laugh well live dangerously ten when he woke the dream was fading leaving only a bitter salty taste in his throat as if hed swallowed tears he could hear meg breathing beside him soft and steady some part of him struggling under the weight of despair wanted to turn to her for the comfort and oblivion of sex shed be warm and shed come to life around him instead he turned away and he knew he knew it was indulgent it was selfdefeating to choose to embrace the misery but he got out of bed alone in the dark found his clothes he dressed and left her sleeping in the dream hed been climbing the mountain hed fought his way up ice and rock thousands of feet above the world in the airless sky where every breath was agony he had to go up was compelled to claw his way up another inch another foot while below him was nothing but a swirling white sea if he fell he would drown in it soundlessly so he climbed until his fingers bled and left red smears on the icesheathed rock exhausted exhilarated he dragged himself onto a ledge and saw the mouth of the cave light pulsed from it and lit hope in him as he crawled inside it opened it towered like some mythical ice palace huge formations speared down from the roof up from the floor to form pillars and archways of white and ghostly blue where ice glinted like a thousand diamonds the walls smooth and polished gleamed like mirrors tossing his reflection back at him a hundred times he gained his feet circling the splendor of it dazzled by the sheen and the space and the sparkle he could live here alone his own fortress of solitude he could find his peace here in the quiet and the beauty and the alone then he saw he was not alone the body slumped against the gleaming wall fused to it by years of relentless cold the ax handle protruded from its chest and the frozen blood shone red red red over the black parka and his heart tipped when he understood he hadnt come for peace after all but for duty how would he carry the body down how could he bear the weight of it on that long vicious journey back to the world he didnt know the way he didnt have the skill or the tools or the strength as he walked toward the body the walls and columns of the cave hurled the reflections at him a hundred of him a hundred dead everywhere he looked death joined him the ice began to crackle the walls began to shake a thunderous sound roared as he pitched to his knees at the foot of the body the dead face of galloway turned up to his teeth bared in a bloody grimace and it was jacks face and jacks voice that spoke as the ice columns tumbled and the floor of the cave heaved theres no way out for either of us were all dead here hed wakened as the cave swallowed him meg wasnt surprised to find nate gone it was after eight when she surfaced so she imagined hed gotten bored or hungry waiting for her to wake up she was grateful to him for the companionship and the straightforward manner wrapped around compassion hed let her deal with shock and grief and whatever else she was feeling on her own terms she considered that a valuable asset in a friend or a lover she was pretty sure they were both she was going to have to keep dealing with herself her mother with everyone in town with the cops she didnt see the point in dwelling on it now thered be enough dwelling when she got back to lunacy she figured shed find nate or hed find her before it was time to head back meanwhile she wanted coffee the dining room was set for breakfast with plenty of takers cheap lodgings good food appealed to a lot of the pilots and guides who used anchorage as a launch pad she saw a scatter of familiar faces then she saw nate he sat alone at a rear corner booth since that was a prized spot it told her hed been there for some time he had a mug of coffee and a newspaper but he wasnt drinking he wasnt reading he was off somewhere in his own thoughts bleak and sorrowful thoughts looking at him from across the busy room she knew shed never seen anyone so alone whatever his long sad story was she thought it was going to be a killer as she started toward him someone called her name while she answered it with a wave she saw nate draw in she watched him bring himself back deliberately pick up his coffee and settle himself before he looked over smiled at her an easy smile secret eyes you got a good nights sleep good enough she slid in across from him you eat not yet did you know people used to commute from montana to work in the canneries around here she glanced down at the newspaper and the article actually i did its good pay yeah but not exactly a daily battle with rush hour i figured you lived in montana because you wanted to raise horses or cattle or maybe start a paramilitary camp okay gross generalization but still youre a real east coast boy hey wanda meg the waitress who looked to be about twenty and perky set down another mug of coffee pulled out her pad what can i get you couple eggs over easy canadian bacon hash browns wheat toast jocko ditched him told you he was a loser what do you want burke ah he searched around for his appetite then decided the sight and smell of food might help him locate it hamandcheese omelette and the wheat toast gotcha im dating this guy named byron she told meg he writes poetry can only be an improvement meg turned back to nate as wanda walked away wandas parents were one of the seasonals when she was a kid used to spend her summers here when they worked in the canneries she liked it moved up permanently last year habitually dates assholes but other than that shes okay what were you thinking about before i came over nothing really just passing the time with the paper no you werent but since you did me a favor last night i wont push it he didnt deny she didnt press and she didnt though the urge scraped at her reach over and stroke his cheek when she had a brood going she didnt want comfort so she gave him the same courtesy she expected for herself is there anything else we have to do here before we head back if were going to be a while i want to have someone go out and check on my dogs i called the state cops a sergeant cobens in charge of the case for now anyway hell probably want to talk to you and your mother at some point theres not likely to be much movement on this until they can get a team up there and bring him back down i called the hospital all three boys are in satisfactory condition youve been busy tell me chief do you take care of everybody no i just handle details shed heard bigger bullshit in her life but then she lived in lunacy she do a number on you the exwife he shifted probably want to spew trash her over breakfast not so much she waited while wanda served the meal topped off the coffee meg cut into the eggs letting the yolk run where it liked so i slept with this guy in college she began great looker kind of stupid but he had tremendous staying power he started playing this head game on me how i should think about wearing more makeup dressing better maybe i shouldnt argue with people so much blah blah not she said with a wag of her fork that i wasnt gorgeous and sexy and smart oh no but if i just fixed up a little more went along a little more youre not gorgeous she laughed her eyes dancing and bit into her toast shut up this is my story youre better than gorgeous gorgeous is just lucky dna youre vivid he decided compelling thats the sort of thing that comes from inside spaces so its better than gorgeous if you want my opinion wow she sat back surprised enough to forget her breakfast if i was anybody else id be speechless after a comment like that as it is ive lost my trend what the hell was i talking about this time when he smiled it reached his eyes warmed up the gray asshole college boy you slept with right right she dived into the hash browns there was more than one but anyway i was twenty and this dudes passiveaggressive insults were starting to get under my skin especially when i found out he was boffing this braindead bimbo with pots of money and breast implants she fell silent concentrating on her breakfast so what did you do what did i do she drank some coffee next time we went to bed i screwed his brains out then slipped him a couple of sleeping pills you drugged him yeah so nothing nothing i paid a couple of guys to carry him down to one of the lecture halls and i dressed his sorry ass in sexy womens underwear bra garter belt black hose that was challenging i made up his face curled his hair took some pictures to put up on the internet he was still sleeping when the first class started piling in at eight she ate some eggs it was a hell of a show especially when he woke up got a clue and started screaming like a girl enjoying her appreciating the singlemindedness as much as the creativity of her revenge nate toasted her with his coffee you can bet i wont be commenting on your wardrobe point of the story i believe in payback for the little things for the big ones for everything in between letting people screw you over is just lazy and uncreative you didnt love him hell no if i had i wouldnt have just embarrassed him id have caused him intense physical pain in addition he toyed with the rest of his omelette let me ask you something are we exclusive i consider myself very exclusive in every way what we have going on together he said patiently is this an exclusive arrangement is that what youre looking for i wasnt looking for anything then there you were uhoh she let out a long breath good one seems like youve got a whole big pot of good ones i dont have a problem limiting myself to swinging from the chandelier with just you for as long as were both enjoying it fair enough she cheat on you burke yeah yeah she did meg nodded continued to eat i dont cheat okay sometimes i cheat at cards but just for the hell of it and sometimes i lie when its expedient or when the lies just more fun than the truth i can be mean if it suits me which is a lot she paused reaching across to touch his hand for a moment so there was a connection between them but i dont kick a man when hes down unless im the one who put him down in the first place i dont put him down unless he deserves it and i dont break my word if i give it so ill give you my word i wont cheat on you except at cards well yeah its going to be light soon we should get going she didnt know how she was going to handle it with charlene any angle she picked the result was going to be the same hysteria accusations rage tears it was always messy with charlene maybe nate read her mind because he stopped meg outside the door of the lodge maybe i should break this to her ive had to give family members this kind of news before youve had to tell people their lovers been dead in an ice cave for fifteen years the means dont change the impact that much his voice was gentle in direct contrast to the jagged edge of hers it calmed her more than calmed her she realized it made her want to lean on him much as id like to pass this plate to you id better handle it youre welcome to pick up the pieces after im done they went inside a few people were loitering over coffee or eating an early lunch meg flipped open her coat as she signalled to rose charlene office we heard steven and his friends are going to be okay roads were still too bad but jerk swung in to fly joe and lara down this morning get you some coffee nate watched meg walk through a doorway sure she went straight through the lobby area skirted the counter and entered the office without knocking charlene was at her desk on the phone she gave meg an impatient backfingered wave now billy if im going to get screwed like that i expect to be taken out to dinner first meg turned away if her mother was haggling over the price of supplies she had to let it run through the office didnt look efficient it looked like charlene female and obvious and foolish lots of cottoncandy pink in the fabrics armies of silly dust catchers paintings of flowers in gold frames on the walls silk pillows mounded on the velvet settee it smelled of roses from the room spray charlene spritzed every time she entered the room the desk itself was an ornate reproduction antique shed bought from a catalog and paid too much money for curvy legs and lots of carving the desk set was pink as were all her personal stationery and postits all of them were topped with charlene in fancy nearly illegible script there was a pole lamp beside the settee a gold wash with a pink beaded shade more suitable in megs mind to a bordello than an office she wondered as she often did how she could have come from anyone whose tastes whose mind whose ways were so directly opposed to her own then again maybe her own life was nothing more than an endless rebellion against the womb meg turned back when she heard charlene purr her goodbyes trying a price hike on me with a short laugh charlene poured herself another glass of water from the pitcher on her desk didnt look efficient meg thought but looks were deceiving when it came to business charlene could calculate her profit and loss to the penny any time of the day or night i hear youre a hero charlene watched her daughter as she sipped you and the sexy chief you stay over in anchorage to celebrate we lost the light sure just a word of advice a man like nates got baggage and plenty of it youre used to traveling fast and light its not a good match ill keep that in mind i need to talk to you ive got calls and paperwork you know this is my busy time of day its about my father charlene lowered her water glass her face went very still very pale then the color erupted in her cheeks candy pink to match the room did you hear from him did you see him in anchorage that son of a bitch hed better not think for one minute he can come back here and pick things up hes not getting anything out of me and if youve got any sense youll say the same she shoved away from the desk and stood her color rising from pink to hot and red nobody nobody walks away from me then walks back not ever pat galloway can go fuck himself hes dead probably had some sob story to tell he was always good with what do you mean hes dead looking more annoyed than shocked she flipped back her curly hair thats ridiculous who told you such a stupid lie hes been dead it looks like hes been dead a long time maybe only days after he left here why would you say something like that why would you say something like that to me the angry red color had drained turning her face white white and drawn and suddenly old you cant hate me that much i dont hate you youve always been wrong about that maybe im ambivalent toward you most of the time but i dont hate you those boys found an ice cave its where they took shelter part of the time they were on the mountain he was in there hes been in there thats crazy talk i want you to get out her voice rose to a hoarse shriek get the hell out of here right now they took pictures meg continued even as charlene grabbed one of her paperweights and heaved it against the wall i saw them i recognized him you did not she whirled grabbed a trinket off a shelf threw it youre making this up to get back at me for what meg ignored the statuary and glassware that smashed into walls onto the floor even when a shard nicked her cheek it was charlenes usual method of venting temper break it destroy it then have someone sweep it up and buy new for being a lousy mother for being a big ho for sleeping with the same guy i was sleeping with to prove you werent too old to steal him from me maybe for telling me most of my life what a disappointment i am as a daughter which offense am i pulling out of my hat i raised you by myself i made sacrifices for you so you could have what you wanted too bad you never gave me violin lessons i could use one about now and guess what charlene this isnt about you or me its about him hes dead i dont believe you somebody killed him murdered him somebody hacked an ice ax into his chest and left him on the mountain no no no no no her face was frozen now as still and cold as the sky behind her then it collapsed as she slid down to the floor to sit among the broken china and glass oh my god no pat pat get up for gods sake youre cutting yourself still angry meg marched around the desk grabbed charlene by the arms to haul her up meg megan charlene s breath hitched in and out in and out her big blue eyes swam hes dead yes the tears spilled over flooded her cheeks on a wail she dropped her head on megs shoulder and clung meg fought her first instinct to pull away she let her mother weep hold on and weep and she realized it was the first sincere embrace theyd shared in more years than she could count when the storm passed she took charlene up the back way to her room it was like undressing a doll she thought as she took off her mothers clothes she doctored the minor cuts slid a nightgown over charlenes head he didnt leave me no meg walked into the bath scanned her mothers medicine cabinet there were always plenty of pills she found some xanax filled a glass of water i hated him for leaving me i know you hated me for it maybe take this murdered yes why i dont know she set the glass aside after charlene took the pill lie down i loved him maybe you did i loved him charlene repeated as meg pulled the covers over her i hated him for leaving me alone i cant stand to be alone go to sleep for a while will you stay no meg pulled the drapes spoke into the shadows i dont hate being alone and i need to be you wont want me when you wake up anyway but she stayed until charlene slept she passed sarrie parker on the stairs on the way down let her sleep her office is a mess i heard sarrie raised her eyebrows mustve said something that put her into a hell of a temper just try to get it cleaned up before she goes back in there she kept walking and grabbed her coat as she swung into the restaurant i have to go she said to nate he pushed away from the bar caught up with her at the door where home i need to be home she welcomed the cold the light slap of the wind how is she i gave her a tranquilizer she comes out of it shes going to crash down on you sorry she pulled on her gloves then pressed her hands to her eyes god god it was what i was expecting hysterics rage why do you hate me the usual your face is cut just a scratch chinapoodle shrapnel she throws things she breathed carefully as they walked toward the river she watched the ghost of her breath fly and fade but when it sank in when she understood i wasnt messing with her she fell apart i didnt expect what i saw then i didnt expect what i saw on her face she loved him i never considered that i never thought she did it doesnt seem like the best time for either one of you to be alone she wont be i need to be give me a few days burke youre going to have your hands full around here anyway few days this will settle in some come out and see me ill fix you a meal take you to bed phones are back up you could call me if you need anything yeah i could i wont dont try to save me chief she slid her sunglasses on just handle the details she turned pulled his head down to hers and indulged them both in a hot seeking kiss and drew back patted his cheek with her gloved hand just a few days she repeated then crossed to her plane she didnt look back but she knew he stood by the river knew he watched her fly away she blanked it out of her mind all of it and let herself soar over the tops of the trees on the edge of the sky it wasnt until she saw the drift of smoke from her own chimney and the silky bullets that were her dogs race across the snow toward the lake that she felt her throat slam shut on her it wasnt until she saw the figure step out of her house slowly follow the path of the dogs that she felt the tears well up in her eyes her hands began to shake so she had to fight to steady them and land he was waiting for her the man whod stepped in as her father when her own had stepped away she got out struggled to keep her voice even didnt think you were coming back for another day or two something told me to come now he studied her face somethings happened yes she nodded bent to greet her delighted dogs something happened come inside and tell me it wasnt until she was inside in the warmth when hed brewed her tea and watered her dogs when he listened without comment that she broke down and wept eleven journal entry february i stood above the clouds this for me is the defining moment of any climb all the exhaustion the pain the sheer misery of the cold washes out of you when you stand at the summit youre reborn in that innocence there is no fear of death or of life there is no anger no sorrow no history and no future there is only the moment youve done it you lived we danced on the virgin snow nearly thirteen thousand feet above the ground with the sun beaming in our eyes and the wind playing our mad tune our shouts slammed and echoed against the sky and our giddiness swirled into the rippling ocean of clouds when darth said we should jump i nearly took the leap what the hell we were gods here he meant it it gave me a jolt not quite fear to realize he was senous lets jump lets fly a little too much dex in my buddy here a little too much speed to pump him up for the fight to the finish he actually grabbed my arm daring me i had to pull myself and him away from the edge he cursed me for it but he was laughing we both were insanely he said something a little weird but it was the place for it id say rambling bitching with that bubbling laughter about my luck bagged myself the sexiest woman in lunacy and got to sit around pissing away the days while she did the work get to take off free as i please and not only bang a whore not only hit it big in the backroom but im standing on the top of the world just because i fucking wanted to now i wont even jump things are going to change thats what he told me things are going to turn around hes going to get a woman other men want hes going to hit it big hes going to live large i let him stand and stew about it it was too fine a moment for pettiness i passed through insane joy into the peace utter and complete were not gods here but only men whove struggled their way to one more peak i know a thousand things ive done might be insignificant but not this this marks me we havent conquered the mountain but have joined with it i think because ive done this i might be a better man a better partner a better father i know some of darths ramblings are truth i havent earned all that i have not the way i earned this moment i know the desire to be more strikes me as i stand in the battering wind above a world full of pain and beauty curtained now by the clouds that tempt me to dive through them to hurry back to that pain and that beauty strange that i should stand here where i so desperately wanted to be and ache for what i left behind nate studied the photographs from the ice cavethere was nothing new to see and as hed studied them every spare moment for the last three days he had every detail imprinted on his brain he had a few stingy notes from the state police weather permitting theyd send up a forensics and recovery team within the next fortyeight hours he knew theyd interviewed the three boys extensively but most of what had been asked and answered hed gotten through the grapevine rather than official channels he wanted to set up a case board but it wasnt his case he wasnt going to be allowed to examine the cave to sit in on the autopsy once the body was brought down any data passed to him would be at the investigation teams discretion maybe once the body had been positively identified as patrick galloway hed have a little more edge but he wasnt going to be in the loop it surprised him how much he wanted to be it had been a year since his juices had been stirred by a case he wanted to work it maybe it was partially because meg was connected but for the most part it was the photographs it was the man he saw in them frozen in that moment seventeen years before preserved and all those details of his death preserved with him the dead had the answers if you just knew where to look had he fought been taken by surprise had he known his killer killers why was he dead he slid the file hed started into a drawer when he heard the knock on his office door peach stuck her head in deb caught a couple of kids shoplifting over at the store peters free you want him to go round them up all right notify the parents get them down here too what did they take tried to get some comic books candy bars and a sixpack of miller ought to know better debs got an eye like a hawk jacob itus just come in hed like a minute if youve got one sure send him back nate rose wandered to his coffeemaker another hour of sunlight he calculated though what there was of it today was gloomy and dank he looked out his window picked out no name and studied it as he sipped his coffee he turned when he heard jacob approach the man was an emblem for the classic native alaskan with his rawboned face and dark intense eyes his hair was silvered worn in a single braid his boots were sturdy his clothes workrough with a long brown vest over flannel and wool nate judged his age at somewhere on the high side of fifty with a look of health and fitness and ropy strength mr itu nate gestured to a chair what can i do for you patrick galloway was my friend nate nodded you want coffee no thank you the body hasnt yet been recovered examined or positively identified nate sat behind his desk it was the same spiel hed been giving everyone whod come in or caught him on the street at the lodge over the past couple of days the state police are in charge of the investigation theyll notify nextofkin officially when the identifications verified meg would not mistake her father no i agree you cant leave justice to others that had been his creed once the creed that had sent both him and his partner into an alley in baltimore its not my case its not my jurisdiction or my province he was one of us as his daughter is you stood in front of the people of this place when you came and promised to do your duty to them i did i will im not letting it go but im well down the feeding chain on this jacob stepped closer his only movement since coming into the room when you were outside murder was your business it was im not outside anymore have you seen meg yes shes strong shell use her grief she wont let it use her as i do nate thought but this man with his intense eyes and ruthlessly controlled anger couldnt see what was inside of him tell me about galloway who would he have gone climbing with hed know them them a winter climb on no name would need at least three he was reckless impulsive but he wouldnt have attempted it with less than three he wouldnt have climbed with strangers or not only strangers jacob smiled slightly but he made friends easily and enemies a man who has what qthers covet makes enemies what did he have a beautiful woman a quickwitted child an ease of manner and lack of ambition that allowed him to do as he pleased most of the time coveting another mans woman was often a motive for murder between friends was charlene involved with anyone else i dont think so was he he may have enjoyed another woman from time to time when he was away from home as some men will if he enjoyed one in town he didnt tell me of it he wouldnt have had to tell you nate responded youd have known yes and so would others a place like this may have secrets but thats not the kind that stays buried for long he considered another moment drugs he grew a little marijuana he didnt deal nate lifted his eyebrows just grass when jacob hesitated nate leaned back nobodys going to bust him for it now primarily grass but he wasnt likely to turn down anything that came to hand did he have a dealer in anchorage say i dont think so he rarely had the money to spend on that sort of indulgence charlene held the purse and she held it tight he liked to climb and to fish and to hike he liked to fly but had no interest in learning to pilot hed work when he needed money he disliked restrictions laws rules many do who come here he wouldnt have understood you the important thing as nate saw it was for him to understand patrick galloway he asked more questions then filed away the notes hed made after jacob left then it was time to deal with the more mundane matter of a couple of adolescent shoplifters with that a pair of missing skis and a fender bender he stayed busy until the end of shift he was taking the evening off leaving otto and pete on call unless there was a mass murder he was off the clock until morning hed given meg her few days he hoped she was ready for him it was his own fault he decided that hed gone back to the lodge to pick up a change of clothes in case he stayed out at megs charlene caught him while he was still in his room i need to talk to you she scooted around him at the door and walked over to sit on the bed she wore all black a snug sweater and snugger pants and those skinny heels she liked to teeter around in sure why dont we go down and have some coffee this is private would you close the door okay but he stood by it just in case i need you to do something i need you to go to anchorage and tell those people they have to release pats body to me charlene they havent recovered the body yet i know that havent i been on the phone with those bureaucrats and insensitive bastards every day theyre just leaving him up there when her eyes filled nates stomach sank charlene he looked around a little desperately for some tissue a towel an old tshirt and ended up going into the bath he came out with a roll of toilet paper and pushed it into her hand getting people up there and making the recovery is a complicated business he didnt want to add that a few days one way or the other wasnt going to make a damn bit of difference thereve been storms up there and high winds but i talked with sergeant coben myself today if its clear they hope to send a team up in the morning they said im not nextofkin because we werent legally married she yanked off several sheets of tissue buried her face in the wad oh he puffed out his cheeks blew out a breath meg shes not legitimate voice cracking charlene waved the soggy wad why should they give him to her theyll send him back to his parents back east and thats not fair thats not right he left them didnt he he didnt leave me not on purpose but they hate me and theyll never let me have him hed seen people squabble over the dead before and it was never pretty have you talked to them no i havent talked to them she snapped and her eyes dried up cold they dont even acknowledge me oh theyve talked to meg a few times and they gave her some money when she turned twentyone little enough when theyve got piles of it they didnt bother with pat when he was alive but you can bet your ass theyll want him now that hes dead i want him back i want him back okay why dont we take this one step at a time he saw no choice so he sat down beside her draped an arm over her shoulder so she could cry on his ill keep in touch with coben im going to tell you the bodys not going to be released for a while anyway it could be some time and it seems to me that as his daughter meg has as much right as his parents she wont fight for him she doesnt care about things like that ill talk to meg why would anybody kill pat he never hurt anybody but me she gave a watery laugh the sort that sounded both sad and wistful and he never meant to he never meant to make you cry or make you mad he make a lot of people mad me mostly he made me crazy she sighed i loved him like crazy if i asked you to think back really think back to the weeks around the time he left could you the details of it even the little ones i guess i could try it was so long ago it barely seems real anymore i want you to try take a couple of days and really think back write things down when they come to you things he said did the people he was with anything that seemed different well talk about it hes been up there all this time she whispered alone in the cold how many times have i looked at that mountain over the years now every time i do ill see pat it was easier when i hated him you know yeah i guess i do she sniffled straightened i want his body brought here i want to bury him here thats what hed have wanted well do everything we can to make that happen since she was softened up with the tears and not currently hitting on him it might be the time to press for information charlene tell me about jacob itu she dabbed at her eyelashes what about him whats his story how did he hook up with pat it helps me to have a picture so you can find out what happened to pat exactly he and jacob were friends yeah she sniffled again a bit more delicately jacobs sort of mysterious at least ive never understood him judging from the sulky look that meant shed never been able to get him into bed interesting nate decided he strikes me as a loner i guess she shrugged now he and pat hit it off i think he was sort of i dont know amused by pat mostly but they liked all that hunting and fishing and hiking crap pat was good at all the outdoorsy stuff he and jacob used to go out into the bush for days while i was back here dealing with a baby and work and so that was the bond the connection nate interrupted well and they both hated the government but so does everybody else around here he and pat liked doing the livingofftheland stuff together but under it it was meg what was meg well she shifted toward him into what nate recognized as gossip mode he stayed where he was sitting intimately on the bed with her unwilling to change the dynamics until hed gotten what he was after jacob used to be married is that so ages ago eons back when he was like eighteen nineteen living in this little village in the bush outside of nome her face was animated now as she gave her little hair toss and settled in to give him the dish i got all this from pat and here and there jacob never has much to say to me she started to sulk again to poker up so he was married nate prompted some young thing same tribe they grew up together and everything one of those soul mates deals she died in childbirth her and the baby the girl she went into labor too early a couple of months early and there were complications whatever i cant remember exactly what went wrong but they couldnt get her to a hospital not in time anyway its sad she said after a beat and her eyes her face her voice softened with genuine sympathy its really sad yes it is pat said thats why he became a bush pilot if hed had a plane or theyd been able to get one in time maybe so he moved out here said he couldnt stay there because there his life was over or something like that anyway when we came around when he saw meg jacob said her spirit spoke to his he wasnt even high she said with a roll of her eyes jacob didnt get high he says that sort of thing he told pat that meg was his spirit child and pat thought that was cool it seemed weird to me but pat was okay with it he figured it made him and jacob brothers did he and pat ever argue about anything about meg for instance not that i ever heard of of course jacob doesnt argue he just freezes you with those long what do you call it inscrutable she decided those inscrutable stares i guess he stepped up with meg when pat left but pat didnt leavetears welled in her eyes again he died im sorry i appreciate the information it always helps to get a picture you talk to meg charlene got to her feet you talk to her about making those boston people see pat belongs here you make her see she wont listen to me never did never will im counting on you nate ill do what i can she seemed to be satisfied with that and left nate sitting on the side of the bed picturing himself being squeezed flat by two difficult females he didnt call her she might put him off or just not answer the phone the worst she could do if he showed up on her doorstep was send him away again and at least hed have seen for himself if she was okay he drove along the tunnel of road with the walls of snow on either side the sky had cleared some as predicted so there was a faint glimmer of moon and starlight it drizzled on the mountains that filled his view glinted off his glimpses of the river he heard the music before he made the turn to her house it filled the dark soared through it and swallowed it just as the lights beat back the night she had them on all of them so the house the grounds the near trees were lit like fire and through it the music streamed and flew he thought it was some sort of opera though that kind of music wasnt his strong point it was wrenching the sort of thing that broke the heart even as it somehow lifted the soul shed cleared a walkway a good three feet wide he could imagine the time and effort that had taken her porch was clear of snow and a wood box beside the door was full he started to knock then decided nobody could hear a knock over the music he tried the door found it unlocked eased it open the dogs whod been sleeping despite the music leaped up from the rug after a few quick warning barks tails wagged to nates relief they appeared to remember him and pranced over to greet him good great wheres your mom he tried a couple of shouts then made his way through the first floor there were cheery fires burning in both the living room and kitchen and something simmering on the stove that smelled like dinner he started to take a peak maybe a sample when he caught a movement through the window he moved closer he could see her now clearly in the flood of lights she was bundled head to foot trudging back through the snow on the fat round snowshoes they called bear claws as he watched she stopped lifted her head to the sky she stood staring up music pouring over her then she threw her arms back to the sides and fell backward he was at the door in one bounding leap wrenching it open he shot out jumped the steps skidded on the frosty path shed cleared she popped up when he shouted her name what hi whered you come from what happened are you hurt no i just wanted to lie in the snow for a minute skys clearing up well give me a hand up since youre here even as he reached out the dogs flew out and leaped on both of them left the door open meg managed as one of the huskies rolled with her in the snow sorry closing it slipped my mind when i thought you had a seizure he hauled her up what are you doing out here i was in the shed working on this old snowmobile i picked up a few months ago every now and then i go in and give it a few whacks you know how to fix a snowmobile my talents are endless and varied i bet they are looking at her he forgot all the little irritations of the day i was thinking i might buy a snowmobile really well once i get this one up and running ill make you a deal lets go in im ready for a drink she sent him a sidelong look as they started for the house so were you just in the neighborhood no checking up on me yeah and hoping for that free meal that all youre hoping for no good because im ready for that too she picked up a broom cocked by the door brush me off some will you when hed done his best she took off the bear claws take your coat off stay awhile she invited and began to strip off her own hey your hair she rubbed a hand over it as she hung up her parka and hat what about it theres a lot less of it it came to just below her jaw now straight and full and thick and a little crazed from her hands i wanted a change so i changed she walked over got a bottle from the pantry getting down glasses she glanced back and saw him grinning at her what i like it it makes you look i dont know young and cute she angled her head young and cute like you want me to dress in a pinafore and mary janes and call you daddy i dont know what a pinafore is but you can wear one if you want id as soon skip the daddy part whatever blows up your skirt she shrugged poured deepred wine into two glasses its good to see you burke he walked over took the glasses out of her hands and set them down on the counter and using his hands to skim back that thick hair leaned down slow eyes open and kissed her soft and quiet until the warmth sparked with licks of heat and he watched her watch him through the kiss saw those perfect blue eyes of hers flicker once when he eased her back he lifted the wineglasses again gave one to her its good to kiss you too she rubbed her lips together and was surprised the heat that had pumped into them didnt spark from the friction hard to argue with that i worried about you you dont want to hear that puts your back up but thats the way it is we dont have to talk about any of it if youre not ready she took a drink then another a lot of patience inside there she decided and the kissing cousin to patience was tenacity might as well deal with it do you know how to make a salad ah you open one of those bags of salad stuff you buy at the store and dump it into a bowl not a guy for the kitchen huh no still at this point in our relationship when youre hot for me youll learn to chop vegetables without complaining about it ever peel a carrot she asked as she walked to the refrigerator yes yes i have there thats a start she piled produce on the counter handed him a carrot and a peeler do that while he did she began to wash lettuce in some cultures women hack off their hair as a sign of mourning thats not why i did it altogether hes been gone a long time and i adjusted to that in my own way but its different now murder changes everything more than death does she agreed deaths natural its a pisser because hey who wants to but theres a cycle and nobody gets to jump off the wheel she dried the lettuce those long fingers with their short blunt nails working briskly i couldve accepted his death im not going to accept his murder so ill push at the state cops and ill push at you until im satisfied this may cool off your hotness for me but thats the breaks i dont think it will i havent felt hot for a woman in a while so im due why not he handed her the carrot for inspection why not what why havent you been hot for a woman i hmm performance issues he blinked managed a strangled laugh well jesus thats a question but this is just too weird a conversation to have over lettuce back to murder then she replied who took them up he questioned what theyd have needed a pilot right who flew them to the base camp or whatever you call it oh she paused tapped her knife on the cutting board you are a cop arent you i dont know and it may be tricky to find out after all this time but between me and jacob we should be able to do it whoever it is took down at least one less man than he dropped off but he didnt report it why and those are the things we need to find out good a direction the investigators in charge will be asking those questions heading in that direction you might want to give yourself some time to deal with the more personal business you mean the custody battle and funeral charlenes planning she began to slice interesting ribbons from a hunk of red cabbage ive already had an earful which is why i stopped answering the phone yesterday fighting over a dead bodys just a little too stupid for me especially when she has no idea if his family will object to her burying him here in the first place have you met them she got out a pot and began to fill it with water for the pasta yeah his mother contacted me a few times and when she offered to fly me out there to meet his family i was curious enough to go i was eighteen charlene was supremely pissed which only made me want to go more after the pot was on a burner she gave the sauce a little stir then came back to finish the salad theyre okay snooty highbrowed not the sort of people id hang out with or whod want me hanging around for long but they were decent to me they gave me money which has to earn them some points reaching for the bottle she topped off her glass held it up eyebrows raised to nate no im good it was enough money for me to put a down payment on my plane and this place so i owe them she paused to sip her wine contemplatively i dont think theyre going to fight charlene and insist on dragging him back east she wants to think so because she likes to hate them just like they enjoy disregarding her that way they can all make more out of my father than he was she got out plates passed them off to nate for the table is staying quiet an interrogation technique it can be it can also be called listening theres only one person i know well that im willing to spend appreciable time with who listens like you thats jacob its a good strong quality my father would listen to me sometimes but you could see him start to drift if it went on too long to suit him hed sit it out but he wasnt hearing you jacob always heard me anyway she said after a huffedout sigh patrick galloway he was an inconsiderate bastard i loved him and he was never really inconsiderate to me but he was to his family who whatever their faults didnt deserve to have their son take off without a word before his eighteenth birthday and he was to charlene leaving her to earn most of the coin and take care of the bulk of the messy stuff i think she probably loved him which was maybe is her cross to bear i dont know if he loved her she pulled a clear glass container of rotini out of a cabinet dumped some into the boiling water continued to speak while she adjusted the heat and stirred and i dont think hed have stuck it out with us if someone hadnt killed him before hed had a chance to take off anyway but now i cant know and he never got the chance to make his choice thats what counts what counts is someone ended him so thats my focus on this not where he ends up being put in the ground sensible im not a sensible woman burke im a selfish one youll figure that out for yourself soon enough she got a plastic container out of the fridge shook it then drizzled the contents over the salad theres a baguette in that drawer there fresh from this morning he opened the drawer found the bread i didnt know youd been into town i havent i took a couple days off to burrow after unwrapping the bread she cut a few thick slabs bakings one of the things i do when im burrowing which prevents it from becoming wallowing you bake bread he sniffed at it ive never known anybody who bakes bread or flies a plane or can fix a snowmobile engine as i said a woman of strange and varied talents ill show you some more of them after dinner in bed top off the wine will you were about ready here maybe it was the atmosphere maybe it was the woman but he couldnt remember a more relaxed meal shed said she wasnt sensible but he saw good clear sense in the way she lived took care of her home in how she dealt with shock and grief even anger jacob had said she was strong nate was beginning to believe she was the strongest person hed ever met and the most comfortable with herself she asked about his day it took him a while to get his rhythm there hed been so accustomed through his marriage to leaving the job outside but she wanted to hear about it to comment to gossip to laugh still under the ease he felt with her was a frisson of excitement anticipation that sexual buzz that heated his blood whenever he was around her he wanted to get his hands in her hair to get his teeth on the nape that shorter length exposed he could think of that imagine that have his belly tighten even as he felt the weight of the day slide off his shoulders at one point she stretched out laying her feet in his lap as she leaned back to drink more wine and his mouth went dry his mind fuzzy i used to shoplift she tossed a chunk of bread to each dog and immediately made him think of how such an action would have caused his own mother to freak and how much he liked watching the dogs field the bread like a couple of outfielders shagging pop flies you used to steal i dont really equate shoplifting with stealing taking things not paying for them okay okay she rolled her eyes but it was really more of a rite of passage at least for me and i was too slick to get caught like those kids you bagged today i never took anything i had any use for it was more hmm wonder if i can get away with this then id hide the booty in my room and take it all out at night and gloat over it id take it all back within a couple of days which was nearly as dangerous and thrilling i think id have been a good criminal if i lived somewhere else because i got that its not so much what you get as the getting of it you dont still no but now that you mention it it might be fun to see if i still have the knack and if i get busted i have this in with the chief of police she dropped her feet leaned over to pat his thigh while he studied her with those serious gray eyes dont look so worried everybody in town knows im crazy and wouldnt hold it against me she rose lets get these dishes out of the way why dont you let the dogs out they like a good run this time of day once the kitchen was tidied to her specifications and the dogs settled down on the floor with a couple of tibiasized rawhide bones she wandered into the living room to flip through her cd list i dont think puccini sets the right tone for the next portion of our evening is that what that was the opera stuff well i guess that answers the question of your opinion on that area of music i just dont know anything about it i liked the way it sounded outside when i drove up sort of full and strange and heartwrecking there may be hope for you hmm could pull out barry white but it seems pretty obvious what do you think of billie holiday ah dead blues singer she turned to him okay what do you know about music i know stuff whats on the radio or you know vh her amused stare had him stuffing his hands in his pockets i like norah jones norah jones it is then she found a number then programmed her unit to select it and black crowes he continued in his own defense and actually jewels new stuff is pretty hot springsteens still the boss and theres dont sweat it she laughed and grabbed his hand jones works fine for me she began drawing him up the stairs if you do me right ill hear my own music anyway but no pressure bet you can handle it at the top of the stairs she turned into him backed him through a doorway handle me chief ive been wanting you to i think about you all the time at inappropriate moments she hooked her arms around his waist shed been needing him shed been wanting him so strange so new for her to need and want so very specifically such as like picturing you naked when i was going over the weekly rotation with peach it can be disconcerting i like you picturing me naked especially at inappropriate times she grazed her teeth over his jaw why dont you get me that way now i like you dressed too just fyi he said as he tugged her sweater up he liked the feel of her body under his hands and how he had to go layer by layer before he reached skin and how warm that skin was how smooth and despite the fleece and wool and cotton despite all that practicality there was the secret sexy scent of her under it she touched him easily and eagerly stripping those layers from him as he did from her and she lit something inside him something more than lust something that had been hibernating far too long he could lose himself in her without feeling lost let himself go without worrying if hed find his way back when his mouth closed over hers tasted both surrender and demand he had all he needed they circled toward the bed lowered to it he heard her sigh and wondered if she could be as relieved or as needy as he she drew him down arched and offered when his mouth roamed her throat when his teeth nipped their way to her nape he felt her heart kick lightly against his and the firm welcoming stroke of her hands on his back she wanted him to take what he needed that was rare for her a woman who preferred seeing to her own needs first and often last as well but she wanted to give to him to ease away that smudge of sorrow that haunted his eyes and she knew somehow she could give and he would never leave her wanting there was more to the heat of his lips the greed of his hands than a search for satisfaction if some part of her worried over it she brushed it aside she knew there was always plenty of later for worries and regrets so she rose to him found his face with her hands with her lips and let the tender mix with the heady he moved over her stirring little quivers lighting little fires and finally clasped her hands with his to keep her from arousing him too much too soon he wanted to taste her those shoulders breasts that wonderful lean line of her as his lips roamed over her she shuddered her breath catching on a moan as her fingers flexed in his he stroked his tongue over her into her and set her wild she came on a gallop her body going hot and damp as pleasure flooded her her system screamed with release then churned in a desperate quest for more he gave her more shockingly until she would have clawed and bit to have him until her body went lax and dazed with the drug hed sent swimming into her blood meg he pressed his mouth to her belly under her heart over it as her freed hands gripped his hips he lifted hers he was inside her at last linked mated dropping his forehead to hers he fought for breath and waited for his head to clear so he would know every second every movement every thrill she held him held him close as bodies merged and minds blurred he said her name again an instant before he emptied shadow follow a shadow it still flies you seem to fly it it will pursue ben jonson and coming events cast their shadows before thomas campbell twelve she didnt mind lying quiet in the dark in fact she liked it especially when her body was loose from sex she heard the dogs come in and settle in their usual tangle on the floor at the foot of the bed the grandmother clock from her office down the hall bonged nine too early to sleep she thought and too relaxed to stir the perfect time then to satisfy some of her curiosity about the man beside her why did she cheat on you what your wife why did she cheat on you she felt him shift moving his body slightly apart from hers a shrink she supposed would have theories on that i guess i wasnt giving her what she was looking for youre good in bed better than good hold on a minute she rolled out of bed and since she was determined to ferret out some information dug out a robe be right back she said and headed down to get the wine and fresh glasses when she came back he was up had pulled on his pants and was tossing a fresh log on her bedroom fire maybe i should if go is the next word forget it im not done with you she sat back on the bed poured the glasses its time for that long sad story burke you might as well start with her since shes probably the root i dont know that she is you were married meg prompted she was unfaithful that about wraps it up but she only cocked her head held out a glass he hesitated but walked back accepting the wine he sat on the bed with her i didnt make her happy thats all its not easy being married to a cop why not because let me count the ways he thought the job pulls at you all the damn time the hours suck every second time you make plans you have to cancel you get home late and your heads still in the case when you work homicides you can drag death around with you even when you dont want to sounds true enough she sipped her wine tell me this were you a cop when she married you yeah but no no im asking the questions here how long did you know each other before you took the leap i dont know a year he took a slow sip of wine and watched the fire closer to two i guess was she slow stupid no jesus meg just pointing out that youd have to be one or the other to be involved with a cop for a year or more and not clue in to the rules of the road yeah maybe that doesnt mean you have to like the rules or want to live with them sure people are entitled to change their minds whenever no law against it im saying she married you knowing the package so using the package as an excuse to cheat or cast blame in your direction if things werent working doesnt wash she married the son of a bitch she was cheating with so i guess that plays into it okay she fell for somebody else shit happens but thats on her pushing the blame for her actions on you is just bitchy and cheap he looked at her now how do you know she did because im looking at you cutie am i wrong he took a gulp of wine no and you let her i loved her those wonderful eyes clouded with sympathy as she touched his cheek brushed her hand through his messy mass of hair poor nate so she broke your heart and kicked you in the balls what happened i knew things werent right i ignored it so thats on me figured itd smooth out i shouldve worked at it harder coulda shoulda woulda he gave a halflaugh youre tough easing over she kissed his cheek hows that so you didnt pay enough attention to the cracks in the ice as you should have in your opinion what then bigger cracks i thought i could take some time off and we could get out of town rediscover whatever she wasnt interested i wanted kids wed talked about it before we got married but shed chilled to the idea we had some rounds about that we had some rounds about a lot of things its not all her fault meg it never is i came home one day bad day caught a case driveby shooting a woman and her two kids shes waiting for me tells me she wants a divorce that shes sick of waiting around until i decide to come home sick of having her needs and wants and plans take a backseat to mine and so on i blew she blew and it comes out shes in love with somebody else who happens to be our frigging lawyer and shes been seeing him for months she lays it all out ive emotionally deserted her never consider her needs or desires expect her to alter her plans at the drop of a hat im not there for her anyway so she wants me out and has considerately packed up most of my stuff what did you do i left id just come in from dealing with the useless slaughter of a twentysixyearold woman her ten and eightyearold kids and after rachel and i yelled at each other for an hour i didnt have anything left i packed up my car drove around awhile and landed at my partners slept on his couch for a few nights to megs mind the woman rachel shouldve been the one sleeping on a friends couch after nate had delivered a good kick in her ass to help her out the door but she let it pass meanwhile she served me with papers i went to talk to her but she was done and made it clear she didnt want to be married to me wed divide up the assets and walk away i was married to the job anyway so she was superfluous thats what she said end of story i dont think so a guy like you might get his heart cracked and he might mope about it for a while then he gets pissed off why havent you who says i didnt he got up set his wine aside walked to the fire to the window look it was a bad year a long bad year or two my mother got wind of the divorce in progress and that was lots of fun she came down on me like bricks whys that she liked rachel she never wanted me to be a cop in the first place my father died line of duty when i was seventeen she never got over it shed handled pretty well being a cops wife but she couldnt handle being a cops widow and she never forgave me for wanting to be what he was somewhere in her head she thought that rachel that marriage would turn me into something else it didnt and as far as she was concerned id wrecked it that pissed me off for a while so i buried myself in the job and got through and then he turned away from the window came back to sit rachel got married i dont know why it was such a kick in the gut but it hit me pretty hard and i guess it showed jack my partner said we were going out have a couple drinks jack was a family man hed go home to his wife and kids but i was down he was my partner so he sat with me over a couple of beers and let me vent he shouldve been home instead of walking out of a bar with me in the middle of the night he shouldve been home in bed with his wife but he wasnt and we come out and we see it half a block up drug deal going south guy starts shooting and we pursue down the alley and im hit shot she thought the scars on your leg and right side i go down with the leg shot but i tell jack im okay im calling for backup on my cell and im pulling myself up and he shoots jack chest gut jesus i cant get to him cant and the shooters coming back crazy hyped up fucking crazy to come back instead of run he hits me again not much more than a graze really just this hot arrow under the ribs and i emptied my clip in him i dont remember but thats what they told me i remember crawling to jack watching him die i remember the way he looked at me how he gripped my hand and said my name like what the hell and how he said his wifes name when he knew i remember that every night and blame yourself he wouldnt have been there i dont see things that way she wanted to gather him up rock him like a child a mistake for him she knew an indulgence for her so she sat beside him only laid her hand on his thigh every choice a person makes takes them somewhere you wouldnt have been there either if your wife had been waiting at home for you so you could just as easily blame her and the guy shed been seeing or you could just blame the man who shot him because you know somewhere you know hes the one to blame i know all that heard it all before it doesnt change how i feel at three in the morning or three in the afternoon or whenever it wants to slap me down might as well say it all tell her all whatever it cost i went into a hole meg a big black nasty hole ive been trying to climb out and sometimes im almost there right at the edge then something from below reaches up and drags me back down again you have therapy the department arranged it meds he shifted again i dont like them better living through chemistry she said but he didnt smile they make me edgy or jumpy or out of myself i cant do the job on meds and if i couldnt do the job the whole thing was pointless but i couldnt stay in baltimore either couldnt face it every day another body another case trying to close the ones jack and i caught together before seeing somebody else at his desk knowing he left a wife and kids who loved him and there was nobody whod have been left if itd been me instead so you came here to bury myself but things happened i saw the mountains i saw the lights northern lights he looked at her and realized by the faint smile on her face she understood he didnt have to say more so he could say more and i saw you similar reaction to all something inside me wanted to come back to life i dont know how itll be or if im any good for you im not a sure bet i like long odds lets just see how it plays i should go didnt i say i wasnt done with you ill tell you what we should do we should go out and jump in the hot tub for a while then we should come back up here and roll around naked again go out as in outside get in a tub of water outside where its about ten degrees not in the tub it isnt come on burke get hardy get stimulated and soak away some of those blues she thought we could stay right here in bed and get stimulated but she rolled away youll like it she promised and yanked him out of bed she was right he did like it the insanity of the rushing cold the painful plunge into hot water the absurdly sexy sensation of being naked with her under a sky now mad with stars and those magical shifting lights steam pumped and plumed off the surface and the dogs once again raced like maniacs the only downside he could see was having to heave himself out again race through the bitter air to the house and the possibility of a heart attack do you do this a lot a couple times a week gets the blood moving ill say sinking a little lower he tipped back his head and the northern lights filled his vision oh man do you ever get tired of it even used to it she mirrored his pose enjoying the way the cold streamed into her face while the heat saturated her body used to it in a way that makes you proprietary like they belong to me and i just share them with a few lucky others i go out most nights just to look theres nobody out and everythings quiet and yeah then they belong to me there were shimmers of lavender tonight swirls of deep blue hints of red the music shed chosen this time had michelle branch singing passionately about the light shining in the dark stirred he found her hand in the heat of the water linked fingers i guess this is perfect he murmured seems like he soaked himself in the lights and the music in the heat and the music are you going to get weirded out if i fall in love with you she didnt speak for a moment i dont know i might i might thats a revelation for me that id have enough left inside to head in that direction id say youve got plenty left on the other hand i dont know as i have enough to begin with to walk that way he looked at her then smiled guess well find out maybe you should just focus on the moment enjoy it for what it is live that is that what you do live for the moment the red was deepening overpowering the softer sweeter lavender sure i dont buy it you cant run your own business without looking ahead building for the future the movement of her shoulders ripped the water business is business life is life uhuh not for people like you and me work is life thats part of our problem or one of our virtues depending on how you look at it she was studying his face now frowning well thats some hot tub philosophy he glanced over as she did toward the sound of the dogs barking fiercely in the woods they always carry on like that no might be they flushed a fox or a moose but her brow remained creased until the dogs quieted too early in the season for bear and rock and bull can handle almost anything ill call them back in a minute hed brought a couple of hunks of fresh meat the dogs knew him so he wasnt worried but it was best to be prepared he was here surveying the house from the shelter of the trees because he believed in being prepared he wasnt sure what it meant that the cop and the daughter of his old friend were frolicking in the hot tub maybe it was good an affair would keep them both occupied in any case he didnt think much of the cop just a kind of figurehead who hauled in drunks or broke up fights nothing much to worry about there then again hed stopped worrying the body would be found hed stopped thinking about it and had put the whole ugly business out of his mind years ago it had happened to someone else it had never happened it would never be a problem but now it was he would deal with it he was older now calmer now he was more careful now loose ends to snip if one of them turned out to be meg galloway hed be sorry but he had to protect himself he supposed it was best if he began to do so right away he shouldered his rifle and left the dogs gobbling up the last of the meat hed prepared everything standing in the darkened office he saw nothing thought of nothing hed missed theyd need to talk of course it was only right only fair he was a fair man still it was dangerous for him to be here at this time of night if he was seen hed need reasons excuses plausible deniability he thought with a half smile it had been so long since hed done anything dangerous so long since hed been the man who climbed mountains and lived large the taste of it awakened that old excitement thats why theyd called him darth once for his ruthlessness and love of dark deeds its what had pushed him to do the reckless and the sublime its what had urged him to kill a friend but that had been a different man he reminded himself hed remade himself what he did now wasnt for pleasure or for curiosity it was to protect the innocent man hed become he had the right to do that so when his old friend came through the back door he was waiting quietly calm as ice max hawbaker jolted when he saw the man sitting behind the desk howd you get in you know you leave the back open half the time he rose movements relaxed and easy i couldnt stand around outside waiting for you someone might have seen me all right all right max dragged off his coat tossed it aside its crazy meeting here at the paper in the middle of the damn night you could have come to the house carrie might hear you never told her any of this you swore no i never told her max swiped a hand over his face mother of god you said hed fallen you said he went crazy and cut the rope that hed gone down in a crevice i know what i said i couldnt tell you the truth it was horrible enough wasnt it you were banged up and delirious when i got back to you i saved your life max i got you down but i saved your life yes all right yes ill explain everything get out that bottle you keep in your drawer we need a drink all these years all these years hes been up there like that he did need a drink and grabbed two coffee mugs then the bottle of paddys out of his drawer what am i supposed to think what am i supposed to do he tried to kill me i can still hardly believe it plausible deniability he thought again pat pat tried to luke remember skywalker the jedi knight the more drugs he took the crazier he got it stopped being a game when he reached the summit he wanted to jump and damned near dragged us both off my god my god he said it was a joke after but i knew it wasnt we were coming down rappelling down the face and he took out his knife christ god he started sawing at my rope and laughing i barely got to the ledge when he cut it through i took off i cant believe it max swallowed whiskey poured more i cant believe any of this i couldnt believe it when it was happening hed lost his mind the drugs the altitude hell i dont know i got to the ice cave i was panicked i was furious he came after me why didnt you tell me any of this before i didnt think youd believe me i took the easy way out youdve done the same i dont know max dragged a hand through his thinning hair you did take the easy way when you thought hed fallen you agreed to keep your mouth shut you agreed not to say anything at all to anyone patrick galloway took off parts unknown end of story i dont know why i did it three thousand came in handy for your paper didnt it max flushed stared into his glass maybe it was wrong to take it maybe it was i just wanted to put it all behind me i was trying to start something here i didnt know him that well not really and he was gone we couldnt change that so it didnt seem to matter and you said you said how thered be an investigation if we told anyone wed been up there that hed died up there there wouldve been the drugs wouldve come out max you know it you couldnt afford another drug bust you couldnt afford to have the cops wondering if you if either of us had been responsible for his death however he died thats still true isnt it yes but now i had to defend myself he came at me with the knife he came at me he said the mountain needed a sacrifice i tried to get away i couldnt i grabbed the ax and he cupped his hands around the mug pretended to drink oh god it was selfdefense ill back you up how you werent there max gulped down whiskey as a bead of sweat trickled down his temple theyre bound to find out we went up there theres an investigation cops are involved now and we cant avoid it theyll backtrack maybe theyll find the pilot who took us up i dont think so it looks like murder and theyll dig dig enough and theyll identify us people saw us with him in anchorage they might remember its better to come forward now to give them the whole story explain what happened before they charge one or both of us with murder weve got reputations positions professions jesus ive got carrie and the kids to think of i need to tell carrie to explain all this to her before we go to the police what do you think will happen to our reputations our positions if this comes out we can weather it if we go to the police and tell them everything thats the way you want to play it its the way we have to play it ive been thinking about this since they found him ive been working it all out we need to go to the cops before the cops come looking for us maybe youre right maybe you are he set the mug down rose as if to pace back and forth behind maxs chair he drew a glove out of his pocket slid it onto his right hand i need a little more time to think to put things in order in case lets take another day max reached for the bottle again give us both time well go to chief burke first get him behind us you think thatll work his voice was soft now with a hint of amusement in it i do i really do this works better for me from behind he grabbed maxs right hand clamped his own over it on the butt of the gun and hooking his left around maxs throat jammed the barrel to his temple his old friend reared back in shock gulped for air and he pulled the trigger the explosion was huge in the small room and sent his hand to shaking but he made sure to press maxs limp finger to the trigger fingerprints he thought his mind bellclear even as he shuddered gun powder residue he released his hold so maxs head fell to the desk and the gun clattered to the floor beside the chair carefully with his gloved hand he turned on the computer and brought up the document hed written while waiting for his friend to meet him i cant live with it any longer his ghost has come back to haunt me im sorry for what i did for everyone i hurt forgive me i killed patrick galloway and now ill join him in hell maxwell hawbaker simple clearcut he approved it and left the computer on the light from the screen and the flare from the desk lamp shone on blood and gray matter he stuffed the soiled glove in a plastic bag pushed that into the pocket of his coat before putting it on he donned fresh gloves his hat scarf then picked up the coffee mug the only thing in the room hed touched without gloves walking into the bathroom he poured the whiskey down the sink rinsed the sink with water he wiped the mug clean then carried it back to the office and set it down again maxs eyes stared at him and something about it forced bile up into his throat but he swallowed it down forced himself to stand and study the details satisfied hed overlooked nothing he left the way hed come in he took the side streets making sure his scarf was over his face his hat low on his head in case some insomniac looked out a window above him the sky streamed with the northern lights hed done what hed had to do he told himself now it was over when he got home washed away the scent of cordite and blood that clung to him he had a single short whiskey as he watched the old glove burn up in the fire there was nothing left now so he put it all cleanly out of his mind and slept the sleep of the innocent thirteen carrie stopped by the lodge on the way to the paper to pick up a couple of baconandegg sandwiches shed been surprised then a little annoyed to find max gone when shed wakened not that it was the first time hed gone back to the paper at night and ended up sleeping there or left early in the morning before either she or the kids were awake but he always left her some sweet or silly note on his pillow when he did thered been no note that morning and no answer when shed called the paper it wasnt like him but then he hadnt been himself for the last several days that was starting to annoy her too there was a huge story brewing what with patrick galloways body being discovered allegedly pat galloways body she reminded herself they needed to decide how to handle the story how much space theyd want to devote to it and if they should get their butts down to anchorage when the body was finally brought down shed already dug through her old snapshots and had culled several of pat theyd want to run his picture along with the story and pictures of the three boys whod found him she wanted to interview them certainly steven wise who was a hometown boy rather she wanted max to do so as he was better at interviewing than she was max wouldnt talk about it why hed even snapped at her once when shed brought it up time for him to go in to the clinic and get himself a physical he tended to get a delicate stomach when he wasnt eating or sleeping right which he hadnt been come to think of it since news came down about the galloway business maybe it was because they were of an age she mused as she pulled up at the curb in front of the lunatic and that hed known the man a little theyd struck up a friendship in the few months max had been in lunacy before pat left best to leave it at left until they had all the facts but she didnt see why max should take out his middleaged blues or whatever on her shed actually known pat longer than max had and she wasnt going into a funk she was sorry of course for charlene and meg theyd have to be interviewed too and she intended to give them both her condolences in person as soon as she could but it was news the sort she and max should be investigating and writing about for the paper for gods sake they had the hometown advantage here it could mean having their articles picked up by the wire services well she was going to make that doctors appointment for him herself then nag him into keeping it they had a hell of a lot to do what with the galloway story and their plans to cover the iditarod lord it was already february and march first nearly on them they needed to get started if they were going to get any color on the race before deadline she needed her man in tiptop shape and shed remind him of it at the top of her lungs if need be she climbed out of the car with the takeout bag steaming fragrance and already spotted with grease and shook her head when she saw the faint wash of light from the rear of their storefront operation max had fallen asleep at his desk again shed bet the bank carrie hi jim she stopped on the sidewalk to talk to the bartender early for you need some supplies he nodded toward the corner store weathers supposed to stay clear so i thought id do a little fishing he glanced in the papers window at the light somebody else is starting early you know max nose for news he said tapping his own hey professor time for school john stopped to make it a trio just about thought id walk it while i have the chance radio said we might break thirty today springs coming carrie announced and this breakfast is getting cold id better get in and give max a shove off his desk got anything on the galloway story john asked her she dragged out her keys if theres anything to get well have it for the next edition have a good one after letting herself in she flipped on the lights max rise and shine she clamped the takeout bag between her teeth to free her hands she stripped off her coat hung it on a peg she stuffed her gloves in one pocket her hat in the other as a matter of habit she fingerfluffed her flattened hair max she called again stopping by her desk to turn on her computer i got breakfast though i dont know why im so good to you seeing as youve been cranky as a constipated bear lately setting the bag down she moved to the coffeemaker and carried the carafe into the bathroom to fill baconandegg sandwiches i just saw skinny jim and the professor out on the street well i saw the professor at the lodge first finishing up his oatmeal before school looks pretty chipper for a change i wonder if hes thinking now that charlene knows her old flames dead shes going to settle down with him poor slob she started the coffee then dug out paper plates napkins for the sandwiches under her breath she was humming tiny dancer the elton john number that had been playing on her favorite classic rock station on the drive in maxwell hawbaker i dont know why i put up with you if youre going to be sullen and sulky much longer im going hunting for a happier younger man see if i dont with a plated sandwich in each hand she started back to maxs little office but before i leave you for my wild sexual affair with a twentyfiveyearold stud im hauling your dumpy ass to the clinic for she stopped in the doorway and her limp hands folded out at the wrists the sandwiches plopped onetwo onto the floor through the roar in her ears she heard the screaming nate had his second cup of coffee while he discussed the lego castle he and jesse were building as their morning project hed had the first at megs and most of his mind was still back there with her shed be flying north today delivering supplies then stopping off at fairbanks to buy items for the locals here for her fee of five percent tacked onto the purchase price they could save themselves the round trip to one of the cities a choice that wasnt always possible in winter and have her do the shopping the transporting and the delivery it was shed told him a small but steady portion of her business hed gotten a look at her office that morning too it was just as bold and stylish as the rest of the place and set up for comfort and efficiency a sturdy cratestyle desk a toughlooking black computer with a wide flat screen leather executive chair he remembered an oldfashioned freestanding clock and a lot of blackframed arty pencil sketches on the wall thered been a huge plant something that had looked like long green tongues in a glossy red pot snowwhite file cabinets and a starshaped crystal suncatcher hanging from a chain in front of the window hed found it both practical and female theyd made no plans for later she shook off the notion of plans and he thought that was just as well he needed some time to think about what direction they were or might be taking his scorecard with women was pitifully low maybe he had a chance to change that with her or maybe it was just the moment an interim sort of thing there was a lot waking up inside him after a long dark sleep how did he know what was real or if it was real if he could keep it that way if he wanted to better for now to drink his coffee eat his breakfast and build a plastic castle with a kid who was just happy to have the company it should have a bridge jesse said the upanddown bridge drawbridge nate pulled his attention back we might be able to work that we could get some fishing wire the boy looked up at him and beamed okay here you go chief he caught roses wince when she set his plate down okay backs a little stiff had the same thing with this one she ruffled her sons hair maybe you ought to see the doctor ive got a checkup today jesse you let chief burke eat his breakfast while its hot we need fishing wire for the bridge she left her hand on his head another moment well get you some she looked over as skinny jim stumbled in the door jim chief chief you gotta come come quick at the paper its max oh my god what happened but he held up a hand even as he said it he could see from the ghost white pallor of jims face the wide glazed eyes that it was bad and beside him the little boy was watching with his rosebud mouth opened in a stunned o wait he got up fast grabbed his coat outside and he gripped the mans trembling arm pulling him out the door what is it hes dead sweet jesus god max is dead shot dead half his head half his heads gone nate yanked jim up when the mans legs buckled max hawbaker you found him yes no i mean yes its max carrie carrie found him we heard her screaming she went inside and the professor and i were standing there talking for a minute and she started screaming like somebody was killing her we ran in and and nate continued to drag him down the street you touch anything what i dont think no the professor said to go get you to go to the lodge and get you thats what i did he was swallowing fast and often think im going to be sick no youre not youre going to go to the station house get otto youre going to tell him what you just told me and that i need a camera some evidence bags some plastic gloves the crime scene tape just tell him i need crime scene equipment can you remember that i yeah ill do it ill do it right now then stay there you stay at the station until i come to talk to you dont talk to anybody else go nate angled toward the paper and quickened his pace his brain had gone on auto and preserving the scene was key right now as far as he knew there were two civilians in there which meant it was already compromised he yanked open the door and saw john kneeling on the floor in front of a sobbing carrie john was still wearing his outdoor gear minus his gloves and was pressing a glass of water to carries lips he looked up at nate and a shadow of relief moved across his shocked face thank god max back there stay here keep her here he started toward the back office he could smell it you could always smell it no he corrected not true there would be no smell of death in the ice cave where galloway waited nature would have covered it but he could smell max hawbakers death even before he saw it as he could smell beneath it the fried eggs and bacon from the two sandwiches on the floor just over the threshold his gaze scanned the room from the doorway the placement of the body the gun the nature of the wound it said suicide but he knew the first murmur from a crime scene was often a lie he moved in keeping to the edges of the room noting the pattern of the blood spatter on the chair the computer screen the keyboard and the pool of it from the head wound that had soaked the desk and dripped onto the floor before death had turned off the pump powder burns he noted the barrel of the had probably been directly against the temple no exit wound and unlike jims babbling statement the insult to the face was minor the bullet had left a relatively neat hole before it entered the brain and bounced around gleefully like a pinball hitting top score dead most likely before his head had hit the desk noting the swirling pattern of color from the screen saver nate drew a pen out of his pocket and moved in close enough to tap the mouse the document sprang onscreen his eyes narrowed as he read it stayed narrowed as he looked down at the body of the man who claimed to have killed patrick galloway he moved back to the doorway then signaled for otto to wait when the deputy rushed in the front nate walked to carrie and like john crouched down carrie max max she raised red horrified eyes to his max is dead somebody i know im so sorry he clasped his hands over hers im going to help him now i need you to go over to the station and wait for me but max i cant leave max you can leave him with me im going to take care of him johns going to help you get into your coat and in a minute he and otto will take you over im going to be there as soon as i can so you go over there and you wait for me she stared dully shock still glazing her eyes wait for you thats right shed do what he said the shock and the horror would make her obedient for a while otto he rose moved toward the back again merciful god otto said under his breath i need you to take both of them over jims still there yeah he swallowed audibly jesus chief keep them there and keep them separated let peach take care of carrie for now i want you to call peter in tell him to come straight here im here now peter can ride herd over at the station while i need you to start taking statements youll handle that better than peter start with jim i want the doctor here too you get in touch with ken and tell him to come straight here i want him standing in i dont want any mistakes on this and i want it kept quiet until we have this scene secured and the statements on file use a tape recorder get the time and the date on it and take notes as a backup keep everyone there everyone in separate places until i get back you got that yeah he swiped a hand over his mouth why the hell would max kill himself thats what it is isnt it suicide lets work the scene and the witnesses otto lets take it a step at a time when he was alone he picked up the camera otto had brought in to record the scene he went through one pack of film reloaded and shot a second then taking out a notebook he wrote down details the fact that the rear door was unlocked the make and caliber of the gun the exact wording of the note onscreen he did a rough sketch of the room adding in the position of the body the gun the lamp the bottle of whiskey and the single mug he had on his gloves and was sniffing at both bottle and mug when peter came in take the crime scene tape peter i want you to use it on the front and back doors i got here as soon as i could otto broke off when he reached the doorway when his skin tinged with green nate snapped at him you dont get sick in here you have to puke you do it outside and take that tape with you peter angled his body away looked hard at the wall and breathed through his mouth otto said max killed himself but i didnt think we havent determined that what we have determined is max is dead right now this is a crime scene and i want it secured nobody gets in here but the doctor clear yes sir peter fumbled the yellow tape out of the box otto had thrown together and staggered back outside state boys are going to want you max he murmured it looks like youre going to tie things up for them with a fucking bow on top maybe thats just what you did but im not a big believer in bows he walked out and with his hands still gloved called sergeant coben in anchorage im not leaving this body sitting here until you can fly in from anchorage he said after hed given coben the essentials youve run me by now you know im qualified ive secured and recorded the scene and ive got a doctor on the way in im gathering the evidence and having the body moved to the clinic everything ive gots at your disposal once you get here he waved ken inside when the doctor came to the door and i expect the same cooperation regarding the galloway investigation this is my town sergeant we both want to nail this down but were going to have to share the hammer ill be expecting you he hung up i need you to look at the body can you give me an approximate time of death so its true max is dead ken slipped his fingers under his glasses pressed them to his eyes ive never had to do this sort of thing before but i should be able to give you a ballpark good enough put these on nate handed him a pair of gloves its not pretty he added ken stepped in then took a moment to visibly steady himself ive dealt with gunshot wounds but nothing quite like this not when i knew the victim why the helld he do this to himself the winters can prey on people but hes been through them before worse than this he wasnt suffering from depression carrie wouldve told me or idve seen it myself he flicked a quick glance at nate i never thought about killing myself too much effort if i change my mind ill try to let you know first feeling better these days some days ready now ken squared his shoulders yeah thanks he stepped over can i touch him move him at all he had the photographs and had outlined the body in crime scene tape for lack of something better so he nodded leaning down ken lifted one of maxs hands pinched the skin id do better if i could get him to the clinic strip the body do a more thorough exam youll get your chance give me an approximation well digging back into my student days and figuring the temperature of the room the state of rigor id guess between eight and twelve hours thats really rough nate so that would be somewhere between nine pm and one am good enough we might be able to close that in some with carries statement im going to send peter for a body bag i need you to put the body somewhere secure and cold ive got the area we use as a makeshift morgue when we have a death thatll work i dont want you talking about this to anyone keep him under wraps until i get there he supervised the transfer of the body made a printout of the note on the computer before shutting it down once hed locked the doors he started back to the station hopp ran him down i need to know what the holy hell is going on im still working that out what i can tell you is that max hawbaker was found dead at his desk at the paper apparently from a gunshot wound to the head possibly selfinflicted oh god oh goddamn it possibly she trotted to keep up with him and plucked at his sleeve when he outdistanced her what do you mean possibly you think he was murdered i didnt say that im looking into it hopp the state police have been notified and will be here in a few hours when i have answers ill let you know let me do my job he hauled open the door of the station and shut it in her face he took the time in the arctic entry to pull off his gear and try to clear his mind the sun was up now and the day as clear as the forecasters had promised theyd be heading up to retrieve galloway today he thought and maybe theyd be flying in to pick up the body of his killer two for one hed see about that he opened the inner door and found john sitting in one of the wait chairs reading a paperback copy of watership down john got to his feet stuffed the book in his back pocket without marking his place peach has carrie back in your office ottos with jim back in a cell not locked up he added quickly then sighed hard to think otto get your statement yes there wasnt that much to tell i left the lodge took a walk heading to school i saw jim and carrie stopped for a minute to talk to them carrie had breakfast in a bag and the light was on in maxs office you could see the backwash of it through the window she went in and jim and i stood there another couple minutes talking he was going to pick up some bait going fishing he likes to rib me about it because i dont hunt or fish he began to rub the left side of his jaw as if it ached next thing we knew carries screaming we ran in and we saw him saw max he closed his eyes drew a couple of breaths im sorry ive never seen anyone dead before not until they were prepared for viewing take your time i ah i pulled carrie back didnt know what else to do yanked her away and i said jim the chiefs at the lodge go get him carrie was hysterical i sat her down held her down at first because she wanted to go back to max then i got her some water and just stayed there until you came in thats it any of you go in the room no well carrie was just inside the room she was standing maybe i dont know a step or two inside she was holding a paper plate in each hand shed dropped the sandwiches and was just standing there screaming with a plate in each hand how long between the time you heard her screaming and the time you reached her maybe thirty seconds nate she sounded like someone was carving her up with a knife we both reacted we were through the door fast probably less than thirty okay i may need to talk to you again and the state cop whos coming in will want to stay reachable and id like to keep this quiet not much chance of it but id like to im going to go on into school he checked his watch in an absent gesture already late but maybe itll keep my mind off it ill be there most of the day appreciate the help he always seemed so harmless john said as he reached for his coat benign if you know what i mean always looking for a story in a place like this town gossip local color births deaths id have said he was a contented man running his little paper raising his children hard to see under the surface sometimes no doubt about it he went in to jim next corroborated johns story once hed sent the man on his way nate sat down on the bunk next to otto ive got peter down at the clinic im going to leave him there for now hes a little shaken and i was hard on him i need you to start a canvass work your way out from the paper talk to people who live nearby ask if anyone heard a gunshot last night were working on between nine pm and one am right now i want to know if anyone saw max or anyone else around the building when where who if they heard a car if they heard voices if they heard or saw any damn thing i want to know state coming in yeah ottos face settled into bulldog lines i dont think thats right right or not thats the way it is give peter an hour then pull him in to work the canvass with you ken can be trusted to keep the body locked away did you talk to carrie tried to didnt get much its all right ill talk to her now he rose otto did max know patrick galloway i dont know he frowned yeah sure he did its hard remembering back that far but it seems to me max came along the summer before pat disappeared was murdered he corrected max worked for a paper in anchorage and decided he wanted his own rag smalltown deal thats the story anyway okay start the canvass as nate approached his office door he thought he heard singing crooning he corrected the way you might croon to a baby opening his door he saw carrie stretched out on a blanket on the floor her head pillowed in peachs ample lap peach stroked her hair and crooned she looked up when nate entered best i could do she murmured poor things broken to bits sleeping now i ah happened to find some xanax in your desk drawer i cut one in half for her he had to ignore the twist of embarrassment i need to talk to her hate to wake her up still she should be a little calmer than she was when otto tried you want me to stay no but dont go far when he sat on the floor peach closed a hand over his wrist i guess i dont have to tell you to be gentle youd know and youve got that in you but all the same she trailed off stroked carries cheek carrie sweetie you need to wake up now carrie opened her eyes and they were unfocused and dull what is it nates got to talk to you baby can you sit up i dont understand she rubbed her eyes like a child i had a dream she focused on nate now and those eyes filled not a dream max my max when her voice broke nate took her hand im sorry carrie i know this is hard and im sorry you want some water anything no no theres nothing she pushed herself up buried her face in her hands theres nothing nate rose helped peach struggle her way to her feet ill be right outside if you need me she said and went out closing the door quietly behind her do you want a chair or do you want to stay where you are i feel like im still in a dream everythings floating inside my head he decided the floor would do and he sat again carrie i need to ask you some questions look at me what time did max leave the house last night i dont know i didnt know he was gone until i got up this morning i was annoyed he always leaves me a note on the pillow when he goes in to work at night or early in the morning when did you see him last i saw this morning i saw no he took her hand again tried to lead her away from that image before was he home for dinner yes we had chili max made it he likes to brag about his chili we all had dinner together what did you do then we watched tv or i did the kids watched a little then stella got on the phone with one of her friends and alex got on his computer max was restless he said he was going to read a book but he wasnt i asked him what was up and he was irritable with me a tear spilled over tracked a lonely line down her cheek he said he was working something out and couldnt i leave him the hell alone for five minutes we got snappy with each other later when the kids were in bed he said he was sorry he had something on his mind but i was still mad and shrugged him off we hardly spoke to each other when we went to bed what time was that about tenthirty i guess but no thats not right i went up to bed then and he muttered something about staying up to watch cnn or something i didnt pay attention because i was annoyed i went up to bed early because i was mad and didnt want to be with him now hes gone he was still home at tenthirty you didnt hear him leave i just went straight to bed i fell asleep when i got up this morning i knew he hadnt come to bed he always pulls the sheets out from the bottom of the mattress drives me crazy i thought maybe hed been sulky and slept on the couch but he wasnt there i got the kids off to ginnys it was her turn to drive them in oh my god my god the kids dont worry theyre being looked after im going to get all of you home once were done here you went into town i decided to forgive him you cant stay mad at max and i was going to make him an appointment for a checkup hes been off his feed for the last few days i stopped to get us some breakfast then i drove to the paper i saw jim and john then i went in and found him i found him how could anybody hurt max that way carrie did he ever leave the back door of the paper unlocked all the time he never remembered to lock up why bother hed say if somebody really wanted to get in theyd just kick the door in anyway did he own a handgun sure a few of them everybody does a a browning pistol yes yes i need to get my kids in a minute where did he keep that gun that one in the glove compartment of his truck he liked to use it to target shoot mostly sometimes hed like to stop on the way home from work and shoot a few cans working out a story idea hed say did he ever say anything to you about patrick galloway of course everybodys talking about galloway these days i mean specifically about himself and galloway why would he they only knew each other for a little while before pat left nate weighed his options she was nextofkin and had to be told it might as well be now there was a note written on his computer she knuckled at tears what kind of a note nate rose again opened the file hed put on his desk im going to let you read a copy of it its not going to be easy carrie i want to see it now nate handed it to her waited he saw what little color that had come back into her face drain off again but her eyes rather than going dull with shock went hot this is wrong this is crazy this is a lie as if to prove it she sprang to her feet and ripped the printout into shreds this is a terrible lie and you should be ashamed my max never hurt a living soul in his life how dare you how dare you try to say he killed someone and killed himself im just showing you what was on his computer and im telling you its a lie somebody killed my husband and youd better do your job and find out who did this whoever hurt my max put this lie on there and if you believe it for one second you can go to hell she ran out of the room and seconds later he heard her fractured weeping he slipped out saw her enveloped in peachs arms see that she and her kids get home he said quietly then eased back into his office for a time he just stood studying the torn shreds of paper on the floor fourteen hopp kept an office at town hall it wasnt much bigger than a broom closet and was furnished in that same haphazard style but since nate wanted to keep the meeting formal he arranged to meet her there as she was wearing full makeup and a dark suit he figured they were on the same page chief burke the words were two quick bites the gesture of her hand toward a chair a short jab he could smell the coffee from the mug on her desk and the pot behind her on the short counter was nearly full he wasnt asked to help himself im going to apologize for being abrupt with you this morning he began but you got in my way at the wrong time ill remind you that you work for me i work for the people of this town and one of thems stretched out on a table in our parttime morgue that means hes my priority mayor youre not the mouth shed painted a bold crimson tightened he heard her long hissing inhale and the slow expulsion of air be that as it may i am mayor of this town which makes its residents my chief concern as well i was hardly sniffing around for gossip and resent being treated as if i were and be that as it may i had a job to do part of that was the full intention of giving you a report once id completed my preliminary which im prepared to do now i dont like your snippy attitude right back at you this time her mouth dropped open her eyes flared obviously your mother didnt teach you to respect your elders guess it didnt take then again she doesnt like me either she drummed her fingers on her desk short practical and unpainted nails that didnt go with the red mouth or business suit you know what pisses me off right now im sure youre going to tell me the fact that im not mad at you anymore i like holding onto a good mad but you had a point earlier about the people of this town being your priority i respect that because i know you mean it max was a friend ignatious a good one im upset about this i know im sorry for that and ill apologize again for not being more sensitive courteous forthcoming take your pick all right lets move on she pulled out a tissue blew her nose enthusiastically get yourself some coffee and tell me whats what thanks but ive already downed about a gallon as far as i can piece together max left his house sometime after tenthirty last night hed had a spat with his wife nothing too serious but she claims hed been off the last few days she pinpoints it to the time the news hit about the discovery of patrick galloways body hopps forehead wrinkled the lines around her mouth deepened why would that be i wonder i dont recall they knew each other all that well seems to me they hit it off well enough but max hadnt been here long when patrick went missing i dont have any evidence as yet that points to max making any stops before going to his office at the paper sometime if the docs estimate is correct before one am he or person or persons unknown put a bullet in his brain through his right temple why would anybody she caught herself waved him on sorry go ahead and finish from the onscene evidence the deceased was sitting at his desk at the time the back door was unlocked which im told was fairly habitual his computer was on as was the desk light he had a partial bottle of paddys whiskey on the desk and a coffee mug with about a fingerful of whiskey left in it itll be analyzed but i didnt detect any other substance in the mug god i just saw him yesterday morning did he seem off to you i dont know cant say i was paying attention she pressed steepled hands to the bridge of her nose held them there a moment then dropped them now that you mention it maybe he was distracted but i cant think of any reason hed do this to himself he and carrie had a good marriage his kids arent in any more trouble than kids that age are he loved running the paper maybe he was sick maybe hed found out he had cancer or something and couldnt face it clean bill of health last checkup at the clinic six months ago the weapon found on scene was his duly registered according to his wife it was one he most often kept in the glove compartment of his truck for target shooting there was no sign of struggle poor max she grabbed another tissue but rather than use it just balled it in her fist what could have driven him to end his own life to do that not just to himself but his family there was a note on his computer it claimed hed killed patrick galloway what the coffee shed just lifted lapped at the top of the mug as she set it down again ignatious thats crazy max thats just crazy he used to climb didnt he more fifteen sixteen years ago than now well yes yes but half the people in town do or did some climbing she laid the flat of her hands on the desk i will not believe that max killed anyone you were prepared to believe he killed himself because hes dead because everything ive heard points to it but murder thats nonsense therell be tests run to verify the in evidence was used fingerprints powder residue im going to tell you that i believe the tests will substantiate what appears to be a suicide and that in all likelihood his death will be officially ruled same just as the galloway homicide will be closed i cant believe this im also going to tell you im not convinced ignatious she pressed her hand to her temple youre confusing me awfully neat isnt it a computer note anybody can tap a few keys guilt kills him after all these years well he lived with it pretty well up to now carrie said he left her a note on his pillow whenever he decided to go into work late or early a man does that but he doesnt leave a personal note for her when he decides to kill himself iou re saying easy to get a gun out of a glove compartment if you know its there not that hard to stage a suicide if you think it through and keep your blood cool you think god you think max was murdered i didnt say that either i said im not convinced this is what it looks like on the surface so if this is ruled a suicide and the galloway case is closed before i am convinced im going to keep looking into it youre paying me so you ought to know if im spending official time chasing a wild goose she stared at him then he heard her take another of those long audible breaths what can i do to help sergeant roland coben struck nate as a solid cop a twentyyear man with a lot of cases under his belt he was about six feet a little thick through the middle a little tired around the eyes he had a crisp whiteblond crew cut a regulation shine on his boots and a wad of cherryscented gum in his mouth hed brought a twoman crime scene unit with him and both officers were busy combing maxs office while coben studied the photographs nate had taken whos been on this scene since the body was discovered me the town doctor and one of my deputies before i let them in i took the pictures ran the outline bagged evidence everyone gloved up the scenes secure sergeant coben looked over at the grease stains on the rug just inside the inner door nate had dutifully bagged the sandwiches as well that as far as the wife got according to her and the two witnesses yes and no one but me touched anything but the body coben made some sound of assent and studied the note on the computer screen well take the computer with us along with the evidence you gathered lets have a look at the body nate led him out the back worked homicide outside didnt you i did coben climbed easily into nates fourwheel thats handy lost your partner i hear thats right took a couple of hits yourself im still standing coben dutifully hooked his seat belt a lot of medical leave on and off your last year with baltimore nate leveled one quiet look im not on medical leave now your lieutenant says youre a good cop and maybe you lost some of your edge some of your confidence after your partner went down turned in your badge down there last fall and broke off with the department shrink nate stopped in front of the clinic you ever lose a partner no coben waited a minute but ive lost a couple of friends line of duty just trying to get a feel for you chief burke city cop from outside one with your experience might get his back up when he has to pass a big case on to state authorities he might and a state cop might not have the same investment in this town and what goes on here as its chief of police you havent been chief very long he stepped out of the car maybe we both got a point the departments been able to handle the press on the ice man they just love to name these violentcrime victims always do well theyre holding the line on the media now but that changes once the team brings him down its going to be big fat news chief burke the sort the national media loves to cover now youve got the body of the man claiming to be his killer and theres more news quicker we wrap this up the better it is for everybody the neater we wrap it the better nate stayed on the opposite side of the car are you worried about me going to the media stirring up publicity for myself for the town just a comment thats all there was a lot of press out of that shooting in baltimore a lot of it focused on you nate felt the heat rising in him the long slow simmer of anger that bubbled from gut to throat so you figure i must like seeing my name in print seeing my face on tv and a couple of dead men give me the opportunity to tune that up you could earn yourself some points seems to me if youre planning on going back to baltimore then its pretty lucky for me that i happened to come here just in time for all this to go down doesnt hurt to be in the right place at the right time are you trying to provoke me or are you just a natural asshole cobens lips quirked could be both mostly im just trying to get a feel for things then lets clear this up this is your investigation thats procedure but this is still my town these are still my people thats a fact and whether or not you trust me like me or want to take me to dinner and a movie im going to do my job then wed better take a look at the body coben headed inside and fighting off temper nate followed there was only one person in the waiting area bing looked embarrassed then irritated to have been found sitting on one of the plastic chairs bing nate said with a nod and the man grunted before jerking the ancient copy of alaska in front of his face docs with a patient joanna said giving coben a good onceover sal cushaw cut her hand on a hacksaw and hes stitching her up she needs a tetanus shot too we need the keys to the morgue nate told her and her eyes darted between him and coben docs got them said nobody could go in there but you this is sergeant coben with the state police would you go get the keys sure okay she scurried away just as bing began to mutter dont need no storm troopers in lunacy take care of our own nate simply shook his head as coben glanced over his shoulder dont bother he murmured you sick bing nate leaned back on the counter or just passing the time my business is my business just like if a man wants to blow his head off thats his business cops cant leave well enough alone youre right about that were just pains in the ass with badges whens the last time you talked to max never had much to say to him pipsqueak i heard he bitched at you about plowing in his driveway so you plowed it out and dumped the snow on top of his car bings grin spread in the mass of his beard maybe dont think he blew his head off over it though youre a mean bastard bing damn right chief joanna came back to the counter held out the keys its the one with the yellow mark doc said hed come back as soon as hes finished with sal hey im next in line here bing rattled his magazine hawbakers not going to get any deader joanna folded her lips you ought to have some respect bing what i got is hemorrhoids tell the doc to finish with all his patients nate said where is it oh sorry straight back then the first door on the left they walked back in silence and nate used the key to unlock the door they stepped into a room with a wall of metal shelves and two metal tables nate switched on the overhead and noted both tables were the style used for autopsies or funeral parlor prep rooms im told they use this as a parttime morgue theres no funeral parlor in town no undertaker they bring one in when they need one and hell prep a body for burial here he walked to the table where max was laid out uncovered to preserve any possible trace evidence as per nates orders the bodys hands were bagged nails are chewed down below the quick on his right hand nate pointed out cut on his bottom lip looks like he bit it no defensive wounds evident powder burns around the wound can we confirm he was righthanded we can we have sealing the hands meant preserving them for residue testing there were photographs of the body of the scene even of the outer door from every possible angle witness statements had been taken and typed up while the witnesses were fresh and the building locked tight and sealed with police tape burke had run a clean scene coben thought and had saved him considerable work well go over him here to see if we can find any trace evidence did you go through his pockets wallet open roll of turns loose change book of matches notebook pencil he had his drivers license credit cards about thirty in cash family pictures in his wallet cell phone another book of matches and a pair of wool gloves in the pockets of the coat in his office nate slipped his hands into his own pockets continued to study the body i went through the truck parked outside the scene registration in the name of the vie and his spouse maps operators manual for the truck an open pack of ammo for the a roll of breath mints several pens and pencils and another notebook in the glove compartment a lot of handscribbled notes in the books reminders ideas for articles for the paper observations phone numbers firstaid and emergency kits in the back of the cab the truck was unlocked keys in the ignition keys in the ignition yeah statements from acquaintances indicate he had a habit of leaving the keys in there and rarely remembered or thought to lock up all removed items are bagged labeled listed ive got them locked up back at the station well take them and him in let the me make his determinations but it looks like suicide im going to want to talk to the wife the two witnesses and anyone who might be aware of his relationship with patrick galloway he didnt leave his wife a note sorry nothing personal nothing detailed in the computer note either irritation flickered in cobens eyes look burke you and i both know that suicide notes arent nearly as typical as hollywood makes them the me will make the call but from where im standing this is suicide the note links him to galloway well pursue that see if we can find a trail back to confirm im not going to cut corners on this or on galloway but im not going to kick either if it turns out both cases fall closed in my lap it doesnt add up for me check your math do you have a problem with me pursuing this quietly he added with emphasis from a different angle its your time to waste but dont step on my toes i still remember how to dance coben it was hard to knock on carries front door the intrusion on her grief seemed impossibly callous he remembered too well how beth had crumbled when hed first seen her after jacks death and hed been helpless bound to a hospital bed dopey from surgery drowning in grief and guilt and rage there was no grief now he reminded himself a little guilt for the way hed had to handle her earlier but no rage now he was just a cop shes going to resent me nate told coben if you play on that you might get more out of her he knocked on the front door of the twostory cabin when the redhead opened it he had to flip through his mental files ginny mann she said quickly im a friend of the family a neighbor carries upstairs resting sergeant coben maam coben took out his identification id really like to speak with mrs hawbaker well try not to take long artist nate remembered now painted landscapes and wildlife studies that were sold in galleries here and in the lower taught art at the school three days a week arlene woolcott and i have the kids back in the kitchen were trying to keep them busy i guess i could go upstairs and see if carries up to it wed appreciate it coben stepped in well just wait here nice place coben said when ginny went upstairs homey comfortable sofa nate noted a couple of roomy chairs colorful throws a painting of a spring meadow backed by the white mountains and blue sky he imagined was the redheads work framed pictures of the kids and other family shots on the tables along with the everyday mess from an average home they were married about fifteen years i think he used to work for a paper in anchorage but relocated and started his weekly here she worked with him it was pretty much a twoman operation with some what do you call it stringers they published articles from locals some photographs and picked up stories from the wire services older kids about twelve a girl she plays the piccolo younger son ten is a hockey freak youve picked up a lot in the few weeks youve been here i picked up more since this morning first marriage for her second for him shes been here a couple of years longer than him moved up on one of those teacher programs gave it up to work with him when he got the paper started but she still substitutes if they call her in whyd he move here im working on that he shut down when ginny started back down her arm draped around carries shoulder mrs hawbaker coben stepped forward voice sober im sergeant coben with the state police im very sorry for your loss what do you want her gaze riveted hard and bright on nates face were in mourning i know this is a difficult time but i need to ask you some questions coben glanced at ginny would you like your friend to stay with you carrie shook her head ginny would you stay with the kids would you keep them back there away from this of course you just call me if you want me carrie went into the living room sank into one of the chairs ask what you need to ask then go i dont want you here first i want to tell you well be taking your husbands body back to anchorage for autopsy hell be released to you again as soon as possible good then youll find out he didnt kill himself whatever he says she added with a quick resentful glance at nate i know my husband hed never do that to me or his children may i sit down she shrugged coben sat on the couch facing her his body angled slightly in her direction it was good nate thought he was keeping it between the two of them keeping it sympathetic he started her on the standard questions after the first few she drew back i told him all this already why do you have to ask me again the answers arent going to be any different why dont you go out there and find out who did this to my max do you know anyone who wished your husband harm yes her face lit up with a kind of horrible pleasure whoever killed patrick galloway ill tell you exactly what happened max must have found something out just because he ran a smalltown weekly didnt mean he wasnt a good reporter he dug something up and someone killed him before he could decide what to do did he discuss any of this with you no but he was upset worried he wasnt himself but that doesnt mean he killed himself and it doesnt mean he killed anyone else he was a good man tears began to track down her cheeks i slept beside him for almost sixteen years i worked beside him every day i had two children with him dont you think id know if he was capable of this coben changed tacts are you sure about the time he left the house last night she sighed flicked at tears i know he was here at tenthirty i know he was gone in the morning what more do you want you stated that he kept the gun in the glove compartment of his truck who else would have known that everybody did he keep the glove compartment locked the truck locked max couldnt remember to close the bathroom door half the time much less lock anything i keep the guns we have in the house locked up and i keep the key because he was absentminded about that sort of thing anybody could have taken that gun somebody did do you know the last time he used it no not for certain mrs hawbaker did your husband keep a diary or a journal no he just wrote things down when they came to him on whatever was handy i want you to go now im tired and i want to be with my children outside coben paused beside the car still some loose ends there id like tied up be a good idea to take a look through his things his papers see if theres anything regarding galloway such as motive such as coben agreed any reason you couldnt work on tying up those ends no i want to get the body back to anchorage start the tests and i want to be there when they recover galloways body id appreciate a call on that when you have him his daughters going to want to see him and her mothers going to be pretty insistent about taking custody of the body yeah ive already heard from her once hes down and positively idd well let the family fight that end out his daughter can come down for a visual but his prints are on file a couple of minor drug busts well know if its galloway once we have the body ill bring her in ill tie up your loose ends and ill do what i can to play mediator with the deceaseds family in return i want copies of every piece of paperwork on both these cases that includes case notes coben looked back at the neat house on its blanket of snow you seriously think somebody staged this suicide to cover up a sixteenyearold crime i want the copies fine coben pulled open the passenger door your lieutenant said you had good instincts nate sat behind the wheel and good doesnt always mean right fifteen he had to work with what he had and that included his two deputies and his dispatcher he pulled them all into his office along with the necessary extra chairs there was a plate of peanutbutter cookies and a pot of fresh coffee on his desk courtesy of peach and he thought why the hell not he took a cookie gestured with it toward his deputies before biting in first the results of the canvass pierre letreck thinks he mightve heard what sounded like a gunshot otto pulled out his notebook and made a business out of flipping through pages he says he watched a movie on cable claimed at first it was the english patient and i said pierre dont hand me that shit you never watched anything of the kind and he said how the hell do you know what i watch in the privacy of my own home otto to which i responded just give me the bottom line otto otto scowled looked up from the notebook and his careful reading just trying to be thorough what he watched which he told me after considerable interrogation was some skin flick called alien blondes he thought it went off around midnight and he was in the bathroom taking a relieving his bladder he amended after a loud throatclearing from peach he heard what he thought was a gunshot and being of a curious nature looked out the bathroom window at that time he saw no one but did notice maxs the deceaseds truck parked in back of the paper he then completed his business and retired for the night he thinks somewhere in the vicinity of midnight chief peter raised his hand i checked the listings and the movie ended at twelvefifteen according to mr letrecks statement he went straight from his living room to the bathroom and heard the single shot almost immediately did he notice anything else any other vehicles no sir otto made him go through it a couple of times but he stuck with the statement anybody else hear anything see anything jennifer welch thinks she might have otto flipped more pages she and larry her husband were sleeping and she says she thinks she mightve been wakened by a noise theyve got an eightmonthold baby and she says she sleeps pretty light as soon as she woke up the baby started crying so she doesnt know for sure if it was the baby or a noise that woke her up but the timings about the same as pierres said she looked at the clock when she got up to get the baby and it was about twelvetwenty where are these two houses in reference to the lunatics back office nate gestured to the chalkboard hed picked up at the corner store and hung on his wall draw it out for me otto ill do it peach hauled herself to her feet neither of these two can draw worth a damn thanks peach nate looked back at his deputies were these the only two you could find who heard anything thats it otto confirmed we got hans finkle who said his dog started barking sometime in the night but he just threw a boot at it and didnt notice the time fact is most people arent going to pay any mind to a gunshot are any of you aware of max having words with anybody lately at the negative responses nate looked over at the blackboard peach was taking him literally he noted rather than just drawing a diagram she was busily sketching buildings adding trees there was even the silhouette of the mountains in the background nate otto shifted in his seat not criticizing or anything but this seems like a lot of official fuss for a suicide especially since the states got the body and will be in charge of closing it up maybe he opened a file whats said in this room stays in this room until i tell you otherwise understood this was written on maxs computer he read the note was met with shocked silence comments that doesnt seem right peach spoke softly the chalk still in her hand i know im just a glorified secretary around here but that doesnt seem right why i cant see max hurting anybody not in my wildest dreams and as i recall he admired pat sort of had a little heroworship going there is that so people ive talked to are saying they barely knew each other thats true enough and im not saying they were the best of friends but pat had a way about him he was goodlooking and charming when he wanted to be which was most of the time he played the guitar and drove a motorcycle he climbed mountains and went off into the bush for days at a time if the mood struck him he had the sexiest woman in town warming his bed had that pretty little daughter who adored him she set the chalk aside brushed the dust from it off her hands and he didnt give a damn about much of anything plus he could write i know max wanted to get him to write for the paper adventure stuff i know because carrie told me about it she and max were just getting serious about each other and she was a little worried because pat was wild when nate gestured for her to keep going she walked over poured herself some coffee i was going through the last spin of that bad cycle with my third husband so with me she had a sympathetic ear and gave me one back we talked a lot in those days she was worried pat might talk max into going off to do something crazy according to her max said pat was what alaska was all about living large living your own way bucking whatever system tried to stop you sometimes admiration becomes envy sometimes envy kills maybe it does absently peach picked up a cookie nibbled but its hard for me to see it i know you said this stays here but carries going to need friends now i want to go see her thats fine but you keep what we discuss here out of it he rose walked to the board shed drawn in the road running behind the paper had even put in the street sigh and labeled it moose lane the letreck house was mostly garage he remembered it now pierre ran a small appliancerepair business out of it and his living quarters were an afterthought attached to his workshop it sat across from the back of the paper and two lots to the east the welch house a bungalow style stood directly across from the rear door of the paper hans finkles secondstory apartment was above letrecks garage shed sketched in other houses other businesses and written the appropriate names across the buildings in her careful script good work peach what were going to do now is set up a case board he picked up his file and walked to the freestanding corkboard hed borrowed from town hall anything we get that applies to galloway or hawbaker gets copied a copy gets pinned up to this board the states already gone through the paper but otto you and i are going over there and go through everything again in case they missed something peach im going to want to get inside the hawbakers go through maxs things there carries not going to be receptive to that not for a while maybe you can try to smooth that way for me all right its sounding like you dont believe what it said in that note and if you dont believe that best not to believe anything until you have all the details lined up he interrupted peter i want you to contact the paper in anchorage where max worked i want you to find out what he did there who he did it for and with and why he left then you type it all up in a report two copies i want one on my desk before you leave today yes sir and all three of you have homework you were here when pat galloway disappeared i wasnt so youre going to spend some time thinking back to the weeks before and after that event write down everything you remember no matter how irrelevant it might seem what you heard what you saw what you thought peter i know you were a kid but people dont always see kids and they say things do things around them without thinking he finished pinning up the photographs galloway on one side of the board hawbaker on the other theres one vital piece of information i want where was max hawbaker when galloway left town not that easy to pin that down after all this time otto said and the fact is galloway couldve been killed a week after he left or a month or six damn months one step at a time hard as it is to take when youve drunk beer and fished out of the same hole with somebody if max confessed to murder then shot himself what are we trying to prove otto pressed thats supposition otto it isnt fact the facts are weve got two dead men some sixteen years apart lets just work from there nate didnt even stop by his room on the way out of town there would be too many questions he couldnt or wouldnt answer waiting at the lodge better to evade them until hed worked out an official line in any case he wanted the open space the frosty dark and the icy shine of the stars the dark was beginning to suit him he thought he couldnt remember what it was like to begin or end his workday with any hint of the sun he didnt want the sun he wanted meg he had to be the one to tell her the one to shake her world a second time if once he had she tried to shut him out hed have to push to stay inside hed managed with little effort to close people out for months he wasnt quite sure if the ease of his solitude had been because hed been unable to hear people trying to break down the walls or if thered simply been no one whod cared enough to try either way he knew how painful it was to come back how all those atrophied emotions and sensations burned and twisted as they struggled back to life and he knew he cared enough to do whatever it took to spare her from that and there was more he could admit that as he drove alone with only the rumble of the heater breaking the silence he needed her knowledge her memories of her father to fill in gaps in the picture he was creating because he needed the work the headachy exhausting frustrating buzz of police work those muscles were flexing again painfully he wanted that pain needed it without it he was afraid very afraid hed just slide silently back into the numbness again lights were on in her house but her plane wasnt there he recognized the truck outside as jacobs a whip of worry slapped down his spine as he pushed out of his car the door of the house opened he saw jacob in the stream of light an instant before the dogs flew out over their noisy greeting he called out meg picked up another job shell be camping out tonight in the bush with a hunting party she took in that typical nate asked when he reached the porch yes i came to see to her dogs and check the heat block on her car that too is typical she called you then radioed theres stew if youre hungry wouldnt mind jacob walked back to the kitchen leaving nate to close the door the radio was on tuned to klun the dj announced a round of buffy saintemarie as nate tossed his coat over the arm of a chair youve had a long day jacob commented as he spooned up stew youve heard then nothing travels swifter than bad news a selfish last act to take his own life so brutally leaving his wife to find the shell the stews hot the breads good thanks nate sat was max a selfish man we all are and most selfish when we despair despairs personal thats not necessarily the same as selfish so do you remember when max came here to start the paper he was young and eager persistent jacob added and poured coffee for both of them came here by himself many do but he made friends some do jacob said with a smile i wasnt one of them particularly though we werent enemies carrie courted him she set her sights on him and pursued he wasnt handsome or rich or brilliant of mind but she saw something and wanted it women often see what doesnt show guy friends jacob raised his eyebrows as he slowly sipped his coffee he seemed to be comfortable with many i heard he used to climb you ever take him up yes summer climbs on denali and deborah if i remember when he first came he was a fair climber and once or twice i flew him and others into the bush for hunting parties though he didnt hunt he wrote in his book or took photographs other flights for other stories and photographs i flew him and carrie to anchorage both times she was ready to deliver their children why curious he ever climb with galloway i never took them together jacobs eyes were intense now why would it matter curious thats all and since im curious would you say patrick galloway was a selfish man yes just yes nate said after a moment no qualifications jacob continued to drink his coffee you didnt ask for qualifications howd he rate as a husband a father he was at best a poor husband jacob finished his coffee turned to the sink to wash the mug but some would say he had a difficult wife would you i would say they were two people with a strong bond who pulled and twisted that bond in their individual pursuits of opposing desires would meg be that bond carefully jacob laid a cloth on the counter and the cup on it to dry a child is they were no match for her which means she was brighter stronger more resilient more generous than either of them more yours jacob turned back and there was nothing to read in his eyes meg is her own ill leave you now does meg know what happened with max she didnt mention it neither did i she say when she thought shed be back shell fly the party out the day after tomorrow weather permitting you got any problem with me staying out here tonight would meg i dont think so then why would i he kept company with her dogs and made use of her fitness equipment it felt good better than hed imagined to pump iron again he didnt intend to pry into her things but when he was alone nate found himself wandering the house poking into closets peeking into drawers he knew what he was looking for pictures letters mementos that pertained to her father he told himself if meg had been there shed have given them to him he found the photograph albums on the top shelf of her bedroom closet above a wardrobe that fascinated him with its mix of flannel and silk beside the album was a shoe box crammed with loose pictures shed yet to organize he sat down with them on the spare bed opened the red cover of an album first he recognized patrick galloway immediately in the snapshots behind the clear sticky plastic a younger galloway than the one hed seen in the digitals longhaired bearded dressed in the uniform of bellbottom jeans tshirt and headband of the late sixties and early seventies nate studied one where galloway leaned against a burly motorcycle an ocean behind him a palm tree to his right and his hand lifted fingers veed in the peace sign prealaska nate thought california maybe there were others of him alone one with his face dreamy and lit by a campfire while he strummed an acoustical guitar more of him with a very young charlene her hair was long and blond and curling crazily her eyes laughing behind bluetinted sunglasses she was beautiful he realized seriously beautiful with a streamlined body soft smooth cheeks a full and sensual mouth and couldnt have reached her eighteenth birthday by his estimation there were several others traveling photos camping shots some were of one or both of them with other young people a few urban pictures where he thought he recognized seattle some where galloway was cleanshaven again were taken inside an apartment or small house then he came across one with galloway the beard was back and he was leaning against a road sign welcome to alaska he could track their trail by the photos their time in the southeast of the state working the canneries he supposed and he got his first glimpse of meg so to speak with the photo of a hugely pregnant charlene she wore a skimpy halter and jeans cut below her enormous and naked belly her hands were cupped on the mound protectively she had the sweetest look on her face a painfully young face nate thought that radiated hope and happiness there were photos of patrick painting a room the nursery others of him building what looked like a cradle then to nates shock there were three pages of photos detailing labor and delivery hed worked homicide and had seen he considered just about all there was to see but the sight of those upclose images had the stew rolling dangerously in his belly he flipped past them the sight of baby meg settled his stomach and made him grin he wasted time skimming through those or maybe not he thought as he could study the tender or joyful way one or both of the new parents held the child the way they held each other he could watch the seasons change the years pass as he moved to the next album and he saw the young pretty face of charlene grow harder leaner the eyes less full of light photos per year began to diminish into those taken more on holidays birthdays special occasions a very young meg grinning gleefully as she hugged a puppy with a red bow around its neck she and her father sitting under a straggly christmas tree or meg by a river arms full of a fish almost as big as she there was one of patrick and jacob arms slung around each others shoulders the shot was fuzzy and badly cropped making nate wonder if meg had been behind the camera he dumped the shoe box and began to sort through the loose snapshots he found a series of group shots all of which obviously were taken the same day summer he thought because there was green instead of snow did it get that green here he wondered that warm and bright the mountains were in the distance their peaks gleaming white under the sun the lower reaches silver and blue and dotted with green someones backyard cookout he thought or a town picnic he could see picnic tables benches folding chairs a couple of grills platters of food kegs of beer he picked out galloway the beard was gone again and the hair was shorter though it still nearly reached his shoulders he looked tough and fit and handsome meg had his eyes nate thought his cheekbones his mouth he found charlene dressed in a tight shirt that showed off her breasts brief shorts that showed off her legs even in the photo he could see her face was carefully madeup gone was the fresh lovely young girl laughing out of tinted lenses this was a woman beautiful and sharp and aware but happy she was laughing or smiling in every shot and posed as well in one she sat provocatively on the lap of an older man who looked both surprised and overwhelmed by the armful of her he saw hopp sitting beside a gangly silverhaired man they were both drinking beers and holding hands he found ed woolcott banker and deputy mayor leaner sporting a moustache and short beard mugging for the camera with the silverhaired man nate took as hopps dead husband one by one he identified people he knew bing looking just as burly and sour as he did today but about fifteen pounds lighter rose that had to be beautiful rose fresh and young as the flower she was named for holding the hand of a handsome little peter max with more hair and less belly sitting beside galloway and both of them about to bite into enormous slices of watermelon deb harry and jeez a fiftypoundslighter peach arms linked hips cocked smiles blazing for the camera he went back through them again concentrating on galloway he was in nearly every shot eating drinking talking laughing playing his guitar sprawled on the grass with kids he culled shots of the men some were strangers to him others looked too old even then to have made that arduous winter climb and some had been too young but he wondered as he scanned from face to face if it would be one of them had one of the men whod celebrated that bright shiny day who had eaten and laughed with patrick galloway and max hawbaker killed both of them more loose shots were individuals groups holidays he found christmas again and again a picture or two of max with galloway jacob with them or ed or bing or harry or mr hopp ed woolcott still with a moustache and beard a fuming bottle of champagne harry in a hawaiian shirt max draped in mardi gras beads he spent another hour with the pictures before putting them back exactly as hed found them he would have to find a way to confess to meg that hed invaded her privacy or find a way to have her show him the photos without letting her know hed already seen them hed decide which later now it was time to let the restless dogs out for a last run and since he was just as restless it seemed a good time to practice his snowshoeing he went out with the dogs instead of racing off they trotted along beside him as he walked out to get his snowshoes out of the car peter had shown him the basics and had proven to be a patient teacher nate still fell on his face or ass now and then and sometimes got the shoes bogged down but he was making progress he strapped them on took a few testing strides still feel like an idiot he confided to the dogs so lets keep tonights practice session between us as if in challenge the dogs bounded off toward the woods it would be a hell of a hike nate decided as he pushed a flashlight into his pocket but exercise helped beat back depression and if he was lucky would tire him out enough to let him sleep through any dreams that wanted to haunt him he used the house lights and the stars to reach the edge of the woods his progress was slow and not particularly graceful but he made it and was pleased he was only slightly out of breath getting back in shape some still talking to myself though but that doesnt mean anything he looked up so that he could see the northern lights could watch them spread their magic here he was ignatious burke of baltimore snowshoeing in alaska under the northern lights and pretty much enjoying it he could hear the dogs thrashing around letting loose with the occasional bark right behind you boys he pulled out the flashlight too early for bear he reminded himself unless of course weve got an insomniac in the area to reassure himself he patted his side and felt the shape of his service weapon under the parka he set off trying to get into an easy rhythm instead of the awkward stepclompstep he fell into if he wasnt paying attention the dogs raced back danced around him and he was pretty sure they were grinning keep it up and therell be no dog biscuits for you go do whatever dog business youve got to do this is thinking time for me keeping the lights of the house visible through the trees to his left he followed the dog tracks he could smell the trees the hemlock hed learned to identify and the snow not that many miles west or north there would be no trees so hed been told just seas of ice and snow rolling forever places where no roads cut through that sea but here with the smell of the forest he couldnt imagine it could hardly conceive that meg who had a sexy red dress in her closet and baked bread when she brooded was out there somewhere in that sea even now he wondered if shed looked up at the northern lights as he had and thought of him with his head down the flashlight beam shining ahead he pushed his body into the steady pace and let his mind wander back to the photos of that sunny day how long after that summer picnic had patrick galloway died in ice six months seven were those pictures with christmas lights from his last holiday had one of those men whod smiled or mugged for the camera been wearing a mask even then or had it been impulse insanity the momentary madness of temper that had brought that ax down but it had been none of those things that had left a man in that cave for all these years preserved in the ice and permafrost that took calculation that took balls just as it took both calculation and balls to carefully stage a suicide or it could all be bullshit he admitted and the note left could be gods own truth a man could hide things from his wife from his friends a man could hide things from himself at least until that despair that guilt that fear wrapped around his throat and choked him off wasnt he chasing this case for the same reason he was out here in the dark in the cold tramping around on oversized tennis rackets because he needed to be normal again he needed to find who hed been before his world had caved in on him he needed to break out of his own cocoon of ice and live again everything pointed to suicide all that was arguing against it were his own instincts and how could he trust them after letting them lie stagnant so long he hadnt worked a murder in close to a year hadnt done much more than ride a desk for his last months with bpd and now he wanted to turn a suicide into a homicide because what it made him feel useful he could feel the weight bearing down on him as he thought of the way hed pushed his opinions onto coben the way hed issued orders despite the doubts in his deputies eyes hed invaded megs privacy for no good reason he could barely run a little cop shop that dealt mainly with traffic violations and breaking up shoving matches and suddenly he was the big bad cop who was going to close the books on a murder that took place sixteen years ago and disprove a nearly textbook suicide yeah sure then hed track down this nameless faceless killer sweat a confession out of him and hand him over to coben all tied up in a big pink ribbon what bullshit you can barely pass for a cop now what makes you think he trailed off staring dully down at the snow that gleamed under the beam of his light and the tracks that marred its surface funny mustve circled around somehow not that he gave a good damn he could wander around aimlessly all night just like he wandered around aimlessly most days no he closed his eyes broke into a light sweat at the physical effort it took to push away from that void not going back there thats the bullshit not going back down in that hole hed take the antidepressants if he had to do yoga lift weights whatever it took but he couldnt go back down there again hed never crawl his way free if he went back down this time so he just breathed opening his eyes watching his breath stream out white and vanish still standing he murmured then looked down at the snow again snowshoe tracks curious and using the curiosity to hold back the dark he stepped back compared those tracks with the ones in front of him they looked the same but it was a little tough to gauge any difference in the beam of his flashlight and considering the fact he wasnt some wilderness tracker but he was sure enough he hadnt tromped around in the woods circled and somehow ended up walking over his own path coming in the opposite direction could be megs he murmured she mightve walked out here anytime just like im doing now the dogs ran back zoomed over the tracks and toward the lights of the house to satisfy himself nate changed his direction which almost set him on his ass and followed the tracks but they didnt go all the way through the woods a fist balled in his belly as he followed the way theyd stopped where someone had obviously stood looking through the trees toward the rear of the house and the hot tub where he and meg had relaxed the night before and the dogs had set up a racket in the woods he remembered now he followed their trail backtracking now he saw other tracks moose maybe or deer how would he know but he decided on the spot he would damn well learn he saw depressions in the snow and imagined the dogs had lain there rolled there and again the tracks he followed indicated someone had stood feet slightly apart as if watching the dogs as he circled around with the trail he could see where it would lead him now to the road several yards from megs house he was well out of breath by the time hed followed it to the bitter end but he knew what he was looking at someone had walked or driven on that road entered the woods well out of sight of a house then had hiked through those woods purposely he thought directly to megs hardly a neighbor paying a call or someone looking for help due to a breakdown or accident this was surveillance what time had they gone out to the tub the night before ten he thought no later than ten he stood on the side of the road with the dogs snuffling along the snowpacked ground behind him how long he wondered to walk back to the road it had taken him more than twenty minutes but he imagined you could halve that if you knew what you were doing another ten tops to get to maxs house take the gun from the glove compartment five more to get into town plenty of time he thought plenty to get into the unlocked door type a note on the computer plenty of time to do murder sixteen nate wasnt surprised to find bing karlovski had a sheet it wasnt a big shock to his system to find charges of assault and battery simple assault aggravated assault resisting arrest drunk and disorderly on that sheet running names whether or not he officially had a case was basic procedure patrick galloway might have died while nate was still learning to handle his first secondhand car but max hawbaker had died on his watch so he ran bing he ran patrick galloway and printed out his record of minor drug pops loitering trespassing he worked steadily down his list discovering that harry miner had a disorderly conduct and injury to property ed woolcott had a sealed juvie a dui max had racked up a few trespassing disorderly conducts and two possession pops john malmont two d ds jacob itu came out clean and mackie sr had a fistful of d ds simple and aggravated assaults and injuries to property he didnt spare his deputies and saw that otto had mixed it up a few times in his younger days with disorderly conducts assault and battery charges dropped peter as hed suspected was as clean as fresh snow he made lists notes and added them to his file he played it by the book as much as he was able the problem was as he saw it he hadnt read the book starring the smalltown chief of police nipping his way up the investigative food chain behind a state cop he considered it wise or at least politic to filter all his inquiries through coben hardly mattered nate decided when he hung up the phone as none of those inquiries could be answered yet anchorage was urban which meant it had all the bogging red tape and backups of an urban area autopsy results not yet in lab results not yet in the fact that the chief of police of lunacy knew in his gut maxwell hawbaker had been murdered didnt carry much weight he could take the easy way and let it drag him down nate figured hed taken the easy way for a long time now or he could use his underdog status to rise to the occasion sitting at his desk with the snow falling soft and steady outside his window nate couldnt quite see the way to rise he had little to no resources little to no autonomy a force that was green as a shamrock and an evidentiary trail that pointed its bony finger straight to suicide didnt mean he was helpless he reminded himself as he got up to pace to study his case board to stare hard into the crystal eyes of patrick galloway you know who did you he murmured so lets find out what you can tell me parallel investigations he decided thats the way he was going to proceed as if he and coben were running separate investigations that ran along the same lines rather than sticking his head out the door he went back and made use of the intercom peach call over to the lodge and tell charlene i want to talk to her you want her to come over here thats right i want her to come over here well its still breakfast time and charlene sent rose home ken thinks the baby might come a little earlier than expected tell her i want her to come over as soon as possible and that i v shouldnt have to keep her long sure nate but it might be easier if you just went over and peach i want her here before lunchtime got that all right all right no need to get snippy and let me know when peter gets back from patrol i need to talk to him too awful chatty today she cut off before he eould comment he wished hed gotten better pictures of the snowshoe prints by the time hed driven into town picked up the camera driven back to megs fresh snow had been falling he didnt know what the hell a bunch of snowshoe tracks was going to tell him and he hesitated to pin them up but it was his case board for what it was worth he was tromping around in the dark just as hed been tramping around in the woods the night before but if you kept going you got somewhere eventually he grabbed a few tacks and pinned up his shots chief burke apparently peach had taken a cue from him as her formal tones came through his intercom judge royce is here and hed like to see you if youre not too busy sure he grabbed the buffalo plaid blanket hed brought in as a makeshift drape for his board send him back he said and tossed the redandblack checks over the board judge royce was mostly bald but wore the thin fringe that circled his dome long and white he had cokebottle glasses perched on a nose as sharp and curved as a meat hook he had what the polite might call a prosperous build with a wide chest and a heavy belly his voice at seventynine resounded with the same power and impact as it had in his decades on the bench his thick dungcolored corduroy pants swished as he walked into nates office with them he wore a matching corduroy vest over a tan shirt and the offkey adornment of a gold loop in his right ear judge coffee never say no he settled himself in a chair with a windy sigh got a mess on your hands seems its on the hands of the state authorities dont shit a shitter two sugars in that coffee no cream carrie hawbaker was by to see me last night shes going through a bad time your husband ends up with a bullet in his brain yep its a bad time pissed at you nate handed the coffee over i didnt put the bullet in his brain nope dont figure you did but a woman in carries state doesnt quibble at taking a shot at the messenger she wants me to use my influence to have you removed from office and hopefully run out of town on a rail nate sat contemplated his own coffee you got that much influence might if i pressed the matter been here twentysix years could say i was among the first lunatics in lunacy he blew once on the steaming surface of his coffee sipped never in my life had a decent cup of cop coffee me either are you here to ask me to resign im cantankerous you get to be when you hit eighty so im practicing but im not stupid not your fault max is dead poor slob not your fault there was a note on his computer claiming he killed pat galloway his eyes were very alert behind those thick lenses as he nodded at nate yeah she told me that one and shes trying to talk herself into you making that up so you can tie things up neat and tidy shell get past that shes a sensible woman and youre telling me this because it might take her a little while to remember how to be sensible meanwhile she might try to make trouble for you itll help her through the grief im going to smoke this cigar he pulled a fat one out of his shirt pocket you can fine me for it once i have if youve a mind to nate pulled open a desk drawer dumped out the contents of a tin of push pins rising he walked over handed it to the judge as an ashtray you knew galloway sure the judge puffed the cigar to life and filled the air with its subtle stink liked him well enough people did not everybody as it turns out he glanced toward the draping blanket that your dead board under there when nate didnt respond he puffed and sipped puffed and sipped i tried capital cases back in the dark ages presided over them when i was wearing robes now unless you think i climbed up no name when i was past sixty and put an end to a man half my age you should be able to cross me off your list of suspects nate leaned back you had a couple of simple assault pops royce pursed his lips been doing your homework a man whos lived as long as i have lived up here as long as i have and hasnt gotten into a tangle couldnt be a very interesting man that may be a man whos lived here as long as you could probably handle the climb if he put his mind to it and an ax against an unarmed man makes up for any age difference theoretically royce grinned around his cigar you got a point i like to hunt and spent some time with pat out in the bush a time or two but i dont climb never did you can verify that if you ask around it only took once nate thought but filed the statement away who did who did climb with him max did as i recall first season he was here ed most likely did and hopp both of them once or twice on easy summer climbs id say harry and deb they both like to climb bings been up a few times jacob and pat did a lot of climbing a lot of hiking and camping together or working as a team to guide paying customers hell more than half the people in lunacy take a whack at the mountains more than that whove been here and gone he was a good climber from what im told made some of his living such as it was taking people up a winter climb who around here wouldve been capable of a winter climb on that mountain dont have to be capable so much as willing to challenge the elements he puffed and sipped some more you going to show me the board since he could find no reason not to nate got up and removed the blanket the judge sat where he was a moment lips pursed then he pushed his bulk out of the chair and moved closer death robs youth most times you dont expect it to preserve it he had potential wasted most of it but pat still had enough potential to make something of himself he had that pretty ambitious woman a smart charming child had brains had talent problem was he liked to play the rebel so he pissed most of that away a man would have to get fairly close in to dig an ax into another mans chest that way wouldnt he seems to me pat wasnt much of a scrapper peace love and rock and roll youre too young to know the era but pat was the sort who embraced all that crap make love not war flowers in your hair and a roach clip in your pocket the judge sniffed still i cant see him standing there quoting dylan or whatever when somebody came at him with an ice ax if he knew who it was trusted him didnt take it seriously there are a lot of possibilities max being one of them the judge shook his head as he shifted his attention to the photographs of max hawbaker i wouldnt have thought so get to be my age nothing much surprises you but i wouldnt have thought it of max physically pat could have swatted him down like a fly which youve thought of the judge said after a moment harder to swat flies armed with deadly weapons point max was a decent enough climber but i wonder if he was good enough to get down that mountain in february without the help of someone with pats skill i wonder how he managed that and how he lived with settling down here marrying carrie raising his kids knowing pat was up there that he was responsible for killing him the arguments going to be he couldnt live with it sure is handy isnt it pats bodys found through more luck than sense and a few days later max confesses and kills himself doesnt explain doesnt spell it all out just i did it im sorry bang handy nate agreed but youre not buying it ill be saving my money for the time being when the judge left nate made additional notes hed need to talk to several more people now including the mayor the deputy mayor and some of the towns most prominent citizens he wrote pilot on his pad circled it galloway had gone reportedly to anchorage to pick up some winter work had he found any if galloway had been playing it straight with charlene had fully intended to come back after a few weeks that would narrow the time of the murder to february a big if but working with that theory it would be possible with time and legwork to verify that max had been out of lunacy during that time frame if so for what purpose if so had he gone alone how long had he been gone had he come back alone or with a companion he was going to have to pick his way through carries memories for the answers she wasnt going to be amenable just now maybe shed talk to coben but if the me ruled suicide would coben bother to follow up there was a knock and even as nate rose to cover the board again peter stepped in you wanted to see me yeah close the door question yes sir chief you know any reason somebody would be out snowshoeing in the woods by megs place in the dark sorry im just guessing here but i dont think most people would go out shoeing around in the woods in the dark for sport well i guess you could if you were going to visit someone or something or couldnt sleep i dont get it he gestured to the board i found those tracks last night when i was out practicing giving the dogs a last run i followed them from the road about fifty yards up from megs place and to the edge of the woods by the back of her house sure they werent yours im sure how do you know they were made at night somebody most anybody might have taken a hike there any time wanted to do some hunting or take a walk across from the lake good points nate conceded meg and i were out there the night max died took a dip in her hot tub peter looked politely at the wall cleared his throat well while we were out there the dogs got antsy took off into the woods they were barking like theyd scented something carried on long enough that meg was on the point of calling them back but they settled down now before you point out they could have treed a squirrell or chased down a moose i found a spot where it looked like theyd rolled around in the snow and the tracks the snowshoe tracks indicated somebody stopped and stood there im not daniel frigging boone peter but i can follow the dots he tapped a finger on the photographs somebody entered the woods far enough from megs as not to be seen then walked in a reasonably direct line as someone would who knew the layout and had a purpose toward the back of her house the dogs behavior indicates they recognized this individual and considered him or her friendly this individual then stopped at the edge of the screen of trees if um i was hiking around and happened to spot you and meg taking a dip in her hot tub id probably be you could say hesitant to make myself known id probably back off and leave with the sincere hope you didnt spot me itd be embarrassing otherwise seems to me itd be less embarrassing altogether not to go sneaking around by her house in the dark it would studying the pictures peter pulled on his bottom lip maybe it was somebody setting or checking traps its really megs property right there by her house i mean but a little poaching maybe she wouldnt like it because of her dogs i bet she had the music going she did so somebody mightve headed toward the house just to see especially if he was checking traps okay it was reasonable how about you and otto taking a run out there see if you can find any traps if you do id like to know who set them i dont want to see one of the dogs hurt well get right on that he glanced back toward the board he mightve been green but he wasnt slow you think somebody was spying on her somebody whos involved in all this i think its worth finding out rock and bull wouldnt let anybody hurt her even if they considered the individual friendly anybody made any kind of threatening move on her theyd attack thats good to know let me know about those traps one way or the other as soon as you can ah chief i think you should know carrie hawbakers been making a lot of calls talking to a lot of people shes saying youre trying to smear maxs character so you can puff yourself up mostly people know shes just upset and a little crazy right now but well some of them maybe some who didnt much like the idea of bringing in someone from outside are stewing about it ill handle it but i appreciate the headsup there was concern in his dark eyes and a hint of anger on his face if people knew you were working so hard to try to find out the whole truth they might settle lets just do the job for now peter cops never win popularity contests he wasnt going to win one with charlene either nate decided when she stormed into his office an hour later im up to my ears over at the lodge she began rose isnt in any shape to wait tables or anything else and i dont appreciate you calling me over here like im some criminal im in mourning goddamn it and you should have some respect ive got nothing but respect charlene if itll help any you can cross my room off the housekeeping schedule until things get back to routine i can deal with it myself thats hardly going to make a difference with every other person in town coming in to gossip and sniff around about my pat and about poor carrie you think because max went and killed himself shes got more grief than i do i dont think its a contest she tossed her head jutted up her chin nate figured shed stomp her foot next but she folded her arms instead if you talk to me that way i dont have a thing to say to you dont think im going to tolerate you taking that attitude with me just because youre banging meg youre going to want to sit down and shut up her mouth dropped open her cheeks flamed who the hell do you think you are i think im the chief of police and if you dont stop being a pain in my ass and cooperate im going to put yours in a cell until you do her mouth painted caribbean coral opened and closed like a guppys you cant do that probably not nate thought but he was past playing with her you want to sit around sulking and playing the injured party i know that tune and it gets old and boring for everybody who has to hear it or do you want to do something about it do you want to help me find out who killed the man you say you loved i did love him the stupid selfish bastard she dropped into a chair burst into tears he debated for five seconds on how to handle her he walked out grabbed the box of tissues peach kept on her desk and ignored his dispatchers wide eyes back in the office he dropped the box on charlenes lap go ahead have a jag then mop yourself up pull it together and answer some questions i dont know why you have to be mean to me if you treated carrie like this no wonder shes saying terrible things about you i wish youd never come to lunacy you wont be the only one to wish it once i find the man who killed patrick galloway she lifted her swimming eyes at that youre not even in charge im in charge of this office im in charge of this town the anger that was stirring inside him felt good it felt just cop juice he realized hed missed it and right now im in charge of you did pat galloway leave town alone youre nothing but a bully youre answer the damn question yes he packed a bag tossed it in the truck and left and i never ever saw him again i raised our child alone and shes never once been grateful for did he have plans to meet up with anyone i dont know he didnt say he was supposed to get some work we were about tapped i was tired of living hand to mouth his family had money but he wouldnt even consider charlene how long did he plan to be gone she sighed began to shred the damp tissue winding down nate thought couple of weeks maybe a month he never called never got in touch no and i was mad about that too he shouldve called after a week or two to let me know what was going on you try to get in touch with him how she demanded but the tears were dried up now i badgered jacob pat always talked to him more than me but he said he didnt know where he was he couldve been covering for him for all i know jacob was still flying regularly then so making regular runs the way meg does now her answer was a shrug so nate kept probing was he or anyone else you can think of out of town for lets say a week or ten days during february of that year how the hell am i supposed to know that i dont keep tabs on people and it was sixteen years ago this month she added and he could see that the fact it was a kind of anniversary had just occurred to her sixteen years ago pat galloway disappeared i bet if you put your mind to it you could remember a lot of details about those weeks i was scrambling to pay the rent just like i was more than half the time i had to ask karl for more hours work at the lodge i was a hell of a lot more worried about myself than what other people were up to but she leaned back closed her eyes i dont know jacob left about the same time i remember because he came by to see pat the day pat left and said hed have flown him into anchorage if hed known he was going he was flying max down and a couple others i think harry harry was hitching a ride to anchorage to look into a new supplier or something or maybe that was the year after or before i dont know for sure but i think it was then good he made notes on his yellow legal pad anyone else it was a slow winter hard and slow thats why i wanted pat to find some work town was dead we couldnt get the tourists in the lodge was damn near empty and karl gave me busy work just to tide me over help me out he was a sweet man he looked out for me some people went hunting some holed up and waited for spring max was trying to get the paper off the ground and was hunting up advertisers pestering people for stories nobody took him seriously back then was he in town the whole month i dont know ask carrie she was chasing him like a hound chases a rabbit back then why do you care because im in charge of this office of this town of you you didnt even know pat maybe its like some people are saying you just want to make a big stir get some press before you go back where you came from im from here now he answered a couple of calls including another residential chimney fire and a complaint about the mackie brothers blocking the road with an overturned jeep cherokee it wasnt like we did it on purpose jim mackie stood in the thickly falling snow scratching his chin and scowling at the jeep that lay on its side like a tired old man taking a nap we got it cheap and we were hauling it home gonna rebuild the engine paint her up and sell her again less we decided to keep her his brother put in hook a plow up to her and give bing some competition nate stood in the snow in the miserable cold and studied the mess you dont have a trailer hitch a tow bar or any of the standard towing equipment you just figured youd haul this heap twenty miles with a couple of rusted chains hooked onto your truck with what is this baling wire it was working bill furrowed his brow till we hit that rut and she rolled over like a dog playing dead it was working fine we were working out how to get her up again no cause for everybody to go crazy about it he heard the howl of what had to be a wolf eerie and primal in the ghostly gloom it served to remind him he was standing on a snowy rural road on the edge of the alaskan interior with a couple of lamebrains youre blocking traffic and obstructing the town plow from clearing the road for people who have enough sense to drive responsibly if this had happened five miles the other way youd have hampered the fire department on a call bings going to get this thing upright and tow it to your place youre going to pay his standard fee son of a bitch and the fine for towing a vehicle without proper equipment or signage bill looked so pained that nate wouldnt have been surprised to see tears run from his eyes how the hell are we supposed to make a profit on this if you go around fining us and making us pay that pennypinching bings towing fee thats a puzzle all right hell jim kicked the bald rear tire of the jeep seemed like a good idea at the time then he grinned well fix her up good maybe youll want to buy her for the police department hook a plow to her cheap enough be useful take it up with the mayor lets get this off the road it took bing his helper pargo both mackies and nate to get the job done when it was over and bing was towing the jeep away nate tried to roll the kinks out of his back how much you pay for it two thousand bill got a gleam in his eye cash he calculated loosely what it would cost to make it roadworthy how much bing would skin them for over the towing im going to let this go with a warning next time you boys decide to be enterprising get a tow bar youre all right chief both mackies slapped him on the back and nearly sent him pitching facefirst in the snow pain having cops around but youre all right appreciate that he drove the short distance back to town and swung to the curb when he saw david helping rose out of their truck in front of the clinic everything okay he called out babys coming david yelled back nate jumped out and took roses other arm she continued to take slow steady breaths but she smiled at him with those melted chocolate eyes its okay everythings fine she leaned against her husband as nate opened the door i didnt want to go to the hospital in anchorage i wanted doc ken to deliver everythings fine my mother has jesse david told him he was looking a little pale nate thought and he felt considerably pale himself do you want me to stay do anything please say no call anyone my mothers coming rose let david help her out of her coat doc said i could go anytime when i saw him last checkup looks like he was right four minutes apart she told joanna who hurried over steady and strong now my water broke about twenty minutes ago and that nate decided was about all a man even one with a badge needed to hear ill let you get to it he took roses coat from david hung it up call if whatever peters out doing something for me but ill call him in if you want thank you they disappeared into the back to do things he didnt care to think about but he dug out his phone it rang in his hand burke chief its peter we didnt find any traps any sign of them either if you want we can extend the search um widen the parameters no thatll do head on back your sisters in the process of making you an uncle again rose now is she okay is she she looked fine to me shes here at the clinic now davids with her his mom has jesse and your moms on her way so am i nate stuffed the phone back in his pocket he should probably stand by at least until more of the family arrived the waiting room of the clinic was as good a place as any to sit and think about tracks in the snow and what he would tell meg when she returned to lunacy seventeen it was a girl eight full pounds of one with the requisite complement of digits and a thatch of black hair her name was willow louise and she was beautiful this information came from peter who rushed into the station four hours after hed rushed into the clinic knowing his job nate had stopped by the corner store and picked up cigars and while he was there found a sturdy fivering binder it was army green rather than the black he would have preferred but he bought it charged it to the lunacy pd account it would hold his notes copies of all the reports and photos it would be his murder book he passed the cigars out with some ceremony to peter otto and an amused peach the gesture warmed the cold shoulder shed given him since hed snapped at her that morning after some backslapping and smelly smoke he gave peter the rest of the day off nate hunkered back in his office spent some time with the hole punch and the copier he put his murder book in order having it and the board gave him that tangible foundation it was cop work it was his work he intended to spend the next part of his shift harassing anchorage with more calls but peach came in she shut the door sat down and folded her hands in her lap problem you think those tracks back at megs place are something to worry about well otto told me since you didnt i ah if you told me whats what around here i wouldnt get irritable yes maam her lips twitched at that and dont think im not onto you ignatious you use that agreeable tone when you want to change the subject or make someone think youre agreeable when youre not busted i thought it was worth checking out thats all and you dont mention it to your dispatcher because maybe you dont think shes smart enough to know youre spending as much free time as you can manage out there snuggled up with megan galloway no watching her he tapped the corner of his murder book right tapped it left but maybe i didnt want to discuss said snuggling with the woman who brings me sticky buns because she might get the wrong idea and peter and otto wouldnt theyre guys mostly guys only have one idea about snuggling so it didnt apply im sorry i was short with you this morning and im sorry i didnt keep my valued and respected dispatcher in the loop youve got a smooth way about you she said after a minute you worried about meg im wondering what business anybody had sneaking around there thats all shed be the first to tell you she can handle herself and always could but im of the opinion it never hurts a woman to have a good man looking out people around here they dont hurt each other oh some fistfights now and then or some backbiting what have you but its a place you feel safe where you know if you had trouble somebodyd lend a hand she drew the pencil out of her bun ran it through her fingers now this happens and you wonder if feeling safe was just an illusion people get worked up get scared and spooked and a lot of those people are armed and territorial and a little bit crazy she added with a nod youre going to want to be careful who did max trust enough to let get that close peach close enough to put a bullet in his head she played with the pencil another moment then stuck it firmly back in her bun youre not going to let it be suicide im not going to let it be what its not she sighed twice cant think of anybody he wouldnt have trusted same goes for me and just about everyone in lunacy were a community we may argue and disagree and kick some ass now and then but were still a community and thats next door to family put it this way who would max have climbed with back when galloway went missing that hed trust well enough today god almighty staring at him she pressed a fist to her heart youre scaring me some putting it that way youre making me think which one of my neighbors my friends might be a coldblooded killer i dont know that its cold but you are she realized suddenly when it comes down to this you are bing jacob harry or deb lord god ah hopp or ed though hopp was never too keen on climbing mackie sr drunk mike if he was sober enough even the professor went up a couple times short summer climbs as far as i know john always had a thing for charlene holy hell nate just getting a picture peach i guess so long as i can remember anyway not that she looked twice at him well anymore than she looked twice or three times at any man when she was with pat then she married karl hidel what about six months after pat left everybody knew including old man hidel that she married him for his money for the lodge but she was good to him okay her gaze flicked to his board away again how am i going to look at these people straight on now downside of being a cop she looked a little dazzled and a little chagrined at being termed a cop guess it is she pushed to her feet stood in her red sweater with pink valentine hearts around the hem i want you to know before i say this last thing that i like meg ive got a lot of affection and respect for her but ive got a lot of affection and respect for you too and im hoping she doesnt break your heart noted he waited until shed gone out to swivel around in his chair and stare out at the snow a few weeks before he hadnt thought there was enough left of his heart to break now he didnt know whether to be pleased or annoyed to realize there was recovery he wondered or stupidity maybe they were the same thing he swiveled back and made the calls she didnt come back that night nate spent it at her place with her dogs he worked off some frustration and a growing anger in her weight room in the morning when the snow had slowed to a thin drizzle he drove back to lunacy and the job she hadnt contacted him and that was deliberate inconsiderate meg admitted when she settled back in the cab at anchorage airport hed probably worry some he had worryaboutthewoman genes if she was any judge hed be hurt and hed be mad and that was also deliberate on her part the man had spooked her thered been a look in his eye when hed watched her climb into her plane more than that was the sensation that look had caused to roll around inside her she wasnt after that sort of depth and feeling and contact why the hell couldnt people just enjoy some good simple sex without mucking it up with whatever loyalty was one thing and shed give and get that as long as the blood ran hot she wasnt her mother ready to roll with whoever came along but she wasnt a woman looking to share home and hearth for the long term either thats what he was about and shed known it shed known what was behind those sad wounded eyes the first time shed looked into them shed had no business sleeping with a man whod want or expect more than sex wasnt her life complicated enough right now without feeling obliged to make adjustments for anybody else for a man for gods sake shed been smart to take the extra jobs and she loved the feeling of being flush shed been smarter yet to stay away from him and lunacy for a couple extra days settle herself down god knew she needed to be settled for what she was about to do she hadnt contacted nate but shed contacted coben the body had been recovered and brought to the facilities in anchorage now she was on her way to the morgue to identify her father alone another deliberate act shed been living her life handling her affairs dealing with her own details alone nearly as long as she could remember she had no intention of changing that now if it was her father in the morgue and she knew in her gut it was then he was her responsibility her grief and in a strange way her release this she wouldnt share even with jacob the only person she loved absolutely what she was doing was a formality more a courtesy coben had made certain in his flat and polite way she knew that patrick galloway had a record and his prints were on file officially hed already been identified but she was next of kin and permitted to see him to confirm the identity to sign papers give her statement deal with it when she arrived she paid off the cab steeled herself coben was there waiting ms galloway sergeant she offered her hand found his cool and dry i know this is difficult and want to thank you for coming what do i have to do theres some paperwork to clear well streamline it make this as quick as we can he led her through it she signed where she needed to sign accepted her visitors badge and hooked it on her shirt she kept her mind blank as he led her down a wide white corridor and did her best to ignore the vague and persistent odors that snuck into the air he took her into a little room with a couple of chairs and a wallmounted tv there was a window covered on the other side by tight white blinds bracing herself she walked to it ms galloway he touched her shoulder lightly if youll look at the monitor monitor confused she turned stared at the dull gray screen the television youre going to show him to me on television christ dont you think thats more ghoulish than just letting me its procedure its best when youre ready her mouth had gone dry with a sandy coating that tasted foul she was afraid to try to swallow it afraid that it would simply come up again erupt out of her in ripe sickness before shed even begun im ready he lifted a phone from the wall murmured something then picking up a remote aimed it at the screen and clicked she saw him only from the tops of his shoulders they hadnt closed his eyes was her first panicked thought shouldnt they have closed his eyes instead they were staring the icy blue she remembered filmed over his hair moustache the stubbly beard were all the pure dark black she remembered there was no ice now to silver them to sheen like glass over his face was he still frozen she thought dully internally how long did it take for heart and liver and kidneys to thaw out when a hundredandseventypound man had been frozen solid did it matter her stomach shuddered and she felt a tingling in the tips of her fingers the tips of her toes can you identify the deceased ms galloway yes there was an echo in the room or in her head her voice seemed to go on forever shimmering back tinny and soft thats patrick galloway thats my father coben clicked off the screen im very sorry im not finished turn it back on ms galloway turn it back on after a brief hesitation coben complied i should warn you ms galloway the media im not worried about the media theyre going to splash his name around whether i worry about it or not besides he mightve enjoyed that she wanted to touch him had prepared herself for that she couldnt say why shed wanted that contact her skin against his skin but she could wait wait until theyd done what they needed to do to the shell of him when they had shed give him that last touch the touch shed denied herself in childish pique so many years ago all right you can turn it off would you like a minute would you like some water no id like information i want information but her legs betrayed her going loose at the knees so she had to let herself fold into a chair i want to know what happens now how you intend to find the person who killed him it might be best if we discussed this elsewhere if you come back with me to he broke off when nate stepped into the room chief burke sergeant meg you should come with me jacobs waiting upstairs jacob yeah he flew me in without waiting for assent nate took her arm he pulled her up led her from the room ill get ms galloway to the station sergeant her vision was blurry not tears but shock she realized it was seeing her father dead on that screen dead on tv as if his life the end of it had been some sort of episode a cliffhanger she thought giddily one hell of a cliffhanger so she let him guide her and said nothing to him nothing to jacob nothing at all until they walked outside i need some air i need a minute pulling her arm free she walked half a block she could hear the traffic busy city traffic and could see out of her periphery the smears and blurs of color from people passing her on the sidewalk she could feel the cold on her cheeks and the thin winter sunlight that filtered through those thickly overcast skies on her exposed skin she drew on her gloves put on her sunglasses and walked back coben contacted you she asked nate thats right since youve been out of touch there are some things you need to know before we talk to him again what things things i dont want to discuss on the damn sidewalk ill get the car car she said to jacob when nate strode away he rented one at the airport he didnt want you in a cab he wanted you to have some privacy considerate which im not you dont have to say it she went on when jacob stood in silence i can see it in your eyes he tended your dogs while you were gone did i ask him to she heard the bitchiness in her voice and swore damn it damn it jacob im not going to feel crappy for living my life the way ive always lived it did i ask you to he smiled a little and the pat of his hand on her arm nearly broke the wall shed built viciously against tears they put him on a television screen i couldnt even look at him not really she walked to the curb when nate pulled up in a chevy blazer and climbing in squared her shoulders what do i need to know he told her of max in the detached straightforward style he would have used to inform any civilian with a need to know in regards to a case he continued to speak continued to drive with his eyes on the road even when she turned her head to stare at him max is dead max killed my father max is dead thats a fact the medical examiner ruled it suicide the note left on his computer claimed responsibility for the murder of patrick galloway i dont believe it there was too much churning inside her too much beating against that defensive wall youre saying max hawbaker went homicidal all of a damn sudden stuck an ice ax in my fathers chest then climbed down the mountain and strolled back into lunacy thats just bullshit thats stupid cop tieitupandforgetit bullshit im saying that max hawbaker is dead that the me ruled it a suicide determining same from physical evidence and that there was a note written on the computer which was decorated with some of maxs blood and brains that claimed responsibility if youd bothered to contact anyone over the last few days you would have been apprised and updated his voice was flat and so she noted were his eyes nothing there nothing that showed she wasnt the only one with walls youre being awfully careful not to express your opinion chief burke its cobens case he left it at that and pulled into a visitors slot at the parking lot of the state police hawbakers death has been ruled a suicide coben stated they gathered in a small conference room coben had his hands folded on a file on the table the weapon was his and his prints only his prints were found on it gunpowder residue was found on his right hand there was no sign of breakin or struggle a whiskey bottle and a mug thereof were on his desk autopsy results prove hed consumed just over five ounces of whiskey prior to his death his prints and only his were on the keyboard of the computer the wound the position of the body the position of the weapon all indicate selfinfliction coben paused hawbaker was acquainted with your father ms galloway yes and youre aware he had occasion to climb with your father from time to time yes were you aware of any friction between them no you may also be unaware that hawbaker was fired from the paper in anchorage for drug use my investigation indicates that patrick galloway was known to use recreational drugs as yet ive found no evidence that your father sought or had gainful employment in anchorage or elsewhere after he left lunacy purportedly to seek same she spared him a glance not everyone works on the books true it would appear that hawbaker whose whereabouts during the first and second week of february of that year cannot as yet be determined met patrick galloway and together they sought to climb the south face of no name supposition would be that during that climb perhaps influenced by drugs and physical distress hawbaker murdered his companion and left the body in the ice cave it could be supposed that pink pigs fly meg returned my father could have snapped max in two without breaking a sweat physical superiority wouldnt hold up against an ax particularly in a surprise attack there was nothing in the cave that indicated a fight we will of course continue to study and evaluate all evidence but sometimes ms galloway the obvious is the obvious because its truth and sometimes crap floats she got to her feet people always say suicides a cowards way maybe thats valid but it seems to me it takes a certain amount of guts and determination to put the barrel of a gun to your head and pull the trigger either way max doesnt fit the bill for me because either way is extreme and he just wasnt what he was sergeant coben was ordinary ordinary people do the unspeakable every single day im sorry about your father ms galloway and i give you my word that ill continue to work the case to its conclusion but at this time i have nothing more to tell you another minute sergeant nate turned to jacob and meg ill meet you outside he closed the door behind them himself what else do you have what arent you telling her do you have a personal connection with megan galloway undetermined at this particular time and irrelevant give and take coben i can tell you that there are a good half dozen people still living in lunacy who could have climbed with galloway that winter people max knew as friends and neighbors and who could have sat in that office with him on the night of his death the mes determination was made on facts but he doesnt know the town the people he didnt know max hawbaker and you barely did coben held up a hand but i have evidence there were three people on that mountain at the probable time of galloways death evidence that only two of them were in that cave evidence i believe was written by galloways own hand he pushed the file toward nate he kept a journal of the climb there were three of them up there burke and im dead sure hawbaker was one of them im not sure he was the second man in that cave theres a copy of the journal in the file im having an expert verify its galloways writing from another sample but eyeballing it id say it is its up to you if you want to share that with his daughter you wouldnt against the grain some to share it with you just like it is to admit youve got more homicide experience than i do and a better handle on the people of that town lunacy fits burke because id say youve got at least one certifiable lunatic living under your nose he flew back with meg with the file tucked under his parka after hed read it hed decide if hed tell her about it decide if hed tell anyone since he couldnt quite pull off the denial that he was in the air he did what he could to enjoy the view snow more snow frozen water icy beauty with dangerous pockets not unlike his current pilot is coben an asshole she asked abruptly i wouldnt say so is that because you cops stick together or is it an objective opinion some of both maybe following the evidence doesnt an asshole make it does if either of you seriously believes max whacked my father with an ax i expected better from you see where expectations get you she took the plane into a deep left dip that had his stomach sloshing toward his throat before he could object she dipped right you want me puking in your cockpit you just keep it up cop ought to have a stronger stomach she nosed down with such speed he could see nothing but that white world hurtling toward them and his own mangled body in twisted burning wreckage his vicious violent cursing had her laughing as she shot the plane up again you got a death wish he shot out no you i did but i got over it you pull that again galloway and when were on the ground im going to knock you on your crazy ass you wouldnt guys like you dont hit women oh just try me she was tempted was feeling just crazed enough to be tempted you ever knock the cheating rachel around he looked over there was a wildness about her in her eyes vivid on her face never even considered it but im forging new territory every day youre pissed off at me all mopey and hurt because i didnt radio in every hour to make kissy noises just fly the plane my rides at your place thats where jacob picked me up i didnt need you there i didnt need you coming in to hold my hand i dont believe i offered to hold your hand he waited a beat rose and david had a girl eight pounds named her willow oh some of that wild temper eased out of her face a girl theyre okay fine and dandy peach says shes beautiful but when i went to see she looked like a really irritated guppy with black hair why are you talking to me conversationally when youre mad enough to pop me between the eyes i prefer to keep things neutral as switzerland until you land the damn plane fair enough once she had she grabbed gear hopped out slinging what she could over her shoulders she bent to greet her excited dogs there you are theres my guys miss me she shot a glance up at nate going to deck me now if i did your dogs would rip my throat out sensible youre a sensible man not always he said under his breath as he followed her to the house inside she tossed her gear aside then went directly to the fire to stack logs and kindling she needed to deal with the plane drain the oil and haul it to the shed to keep it warm cover the wings but she wasnt feeling practical and efficient she wasnt feeling quite sane appreciate you looking out for rock and bull while i was gone no problem he turned his back carefully laying the file under his parka busy were you making hay she got the fire started jobs fall into my lap i take them now ive got a couple of nice fat fees to bank good for you she dropped into a chair hooked a leg over the arm all insolence now back now and its good to see you lover you got time we can go upstairs for some welcomehome sex she smiled as she began unbuttoning her shirt bet i could get you up for it thats a poor imitation of charlene meg it wiped the smile off her face you dont want to fuck fine no need to insult me but there seems to be a need for you to hurt me make me mad what is it your problem she pushed up started to shove by him but he gripped her arm swung her back nope he said and ignored the warning growl from the dogs it appears to be yours i want to know what it is i dont know the distress in her tone turned the growls into snarls rock bull relax relax she said more calmly friend she knelt down hooked an arm around each of them nuzzled damn it why dont you yell or storm out or tell me im a cold heartless bitch why dont you give me a damn break why didnt you bother to contact me why have you been spoiling for a fight since you saw me hold on a minute she got up snapped her fingers for the dogs to follow her into the kitchen after digging out milk bones she tossed one to each dog then she leaned back against the counter and looked at nate not quite gaunt anymore she thought hed put on a little weight in the last month or so the kind that looked good on a man the sort that spoke of muscles toning his hair looked wild and sexy and a little past trimming time and those eyes calm and wrenchingly sad and irresistible stayed level and patient on hers i dont like being accountable to anyone im not used to it i built this place built my business built my life a certain way because they suit me are you worried im going to start holding you accountable expecting you to change the order of things for me arent you i dont know maybe i see a difference between accountability and caring i was worried about you for you and your dogs werent the only ones who missed you as to the order of things im still working on my own a day at a time tell me something no bullshit are you falling in love with me feels like it what does it feel like like something coming back inside me warming up and trying to find its rhythm it feels scary he said crossing to her and good good and scary i dont know if i want it i dont know if ive got it me either but i do know im tired of being tired and empty and just going through the motions so i can get by i feel when im with you meg i feel and some of thats painful but ill take it he cupped her face in his hands maybe you should try that for now too just take it she closed her hands over his wrists maybe eighteen journal entry february hes gone crazy out of his freaking mind too much dex and christ knows what else too much altitude i dont know i think ive calmed him down storm came up so weve taken shelter in an ice cave hell of a place like some sort of miniature magic castle with ice columns and arches and sudden drops wish all of us had gotten here i could use a little help bringing old darth back to earth hes got some whackedout idea that i tried to kill him we had some trouble on the rappel and hes screaming at me into the wind that i want to kill him came at me like a maniac and i had to knock him flat calmed him down though got him calm he apologized laughed about it well just take a breather here pull ourselves together weve been playing the firstthingilldowhenimbackintheworld game he wants a steak i want a woman then we both agreed we wanted both hes still jittery i can see it but hell the mountain does that to you we need to get back to han get moving down get back to lunacy weathers clearing but theres a feeling in the air somethings coming down its time to get the hell off the mountain in his office with the door shut nate read the last entry in patrick galloways climbing journal took you another sixteen years to get off the mountain pat he thought because something sure as hell came down three went up he thought and two came down and two kept silent for sixteen years but there were only two in that cave galloway and his killer nate was more certain than ever that the killer hadnt been max why had the killer let max live for so long if han equaled max max had been injured not seriously but enough to make the descent difficult hed been the least experienced and hardy of the three if he was reading correctly between the lines of galloways journal but the killer had brought him down let him live another sixteen years and max had kept the secret why ambition blackmail loyalty fear the pilot nate decided find the pilot and the story he had to tell he locked the copy of the journal in a desk drawer along with his murder book pocketed the keys when he went out he found otto just coming in from patrol ed woolcott said somebody broke the lock on his icefishing shack and took off with two of his rods his power auger a bottle of singlemalt scotch and defaced the shack with paint his face pink from the cold otto headed straight to the coffeepot kids most likely i told him hes the only one around here who locks his shack and that just makes kids want to break in how much is it worth altogether he says about eight hundred strikemaster power auger runs about four hundred both disgust and derision covered his face thats ed for you you can pick up a good hand auger for maybe forty but hes gotta fly first class we have a description of the property yeah yeah any kid stupid enough to show off a rod that has eds name brassplated on it deserves to get busted scotch they likely drank themselves sick on it probably just drilled a hole through the ice somewhere with the auger did a little fishing and drinking i expect theyll ditch the gear somewhere or try to sneak it back to the shack its still breaking and entering and theft so lets follow it through you can bet theyre insured and for more than he paid for them you know he talked to a lawyer about suing hawley for running him off the road back around the first of the year a lawyer jesus h christ ill talk to him good luck otto sat at his desk with his coffee and scowled at his computer screen gotta write this up im heading out doing a followup on something he paused you do much climbing these days what do i want to go up a damn mountain for i can see them fine from here but you used to used to tango with loose women too yeah amused nate sat on the corner of ottos desk youre a deep pool otto these women wear tight dresses and skinny high heels humor battled grouchiness they did with those sexy slits in the skirt on the side so their legs slid out like a slice of heaven when they moved ottos glower lost its war with a smile those were the days bet they were i never learned to tango or climb maybe i should stick with the tango chief surer to live through that the way some people talk about climbing its like a religion whyd you give it up got tired of flirting with frostbite and broken bones his eyes darkened as he looked down into his coffee last time i went up was on a rescue party of six avalanche took them we found two the bodies youve never seen a man taken out by an avalanche no i havent count your blessings that was nine years back next month i never went up again never will you ever climb with galloway couple times he was a good climber damn good for an asshole you didnt like him otto began to play huntandpeck with the keyboard if i disliked every asshole i met there wouldnt be many left guy got himself stuck in the sixties peace love drugs easy way out you ask me in the sixties nate thought otto had been sweating in a jungle in nam that sort of friction soldier and hippy could blow up under less stress than a winter climb you yammer about living the natural life and save the frigging whales otto went on as he jabbed at keys and what youre doing is sitting on your ass living on the government you bitch about all the time got no respect for that i guess you wouldnt have had a lot in common what with you coming from the military we werent drinking buddies he stopped typing looked up at nate whats all this about just trying to get a full picture of the man as he rose he asked casually when you did climb whod you use as a pilot mostly jacob he was right here i thought jacob did some climbing too you ever go up with him sure get hank fielding maybe out of talkeetna to fly us or twotoes out of anchorage stokey loukes if he was sober he shrugged plenty of pilots around to take up a party if you got the money to pool if youre really thinking of going up you get meg to take you and get yourself a professional guide not some yahoo ill do that but i think i might settle for the view from my office smarter interrogating his own deputy didnt give him any pleasure but hed write up the conversation in his notes he couldnt picture otto going berserk on speed and attacking a man with an ax but he couldnt picture him doing the tangowith a woman in a tight dress either people did a lot of changing in sixteen years he went to the lodge and found charlene and cissy serving the early dinner crowd skinny jim worked the bar and the professor manned his stool nursing a whiskey and reading trollope got a pool starting on the iditarod jim told him you want in nate sat at the bar who do you like im leaning toward this young guy triplehorn an aleut hes gorgeous cissy commented when she stopped by with empties doesnt matter what he looks like cissy does to me need a moosehead and a double vodka rocks sentimental moneys on this canadian tony keeton were sentimental over canadians nate wondered as jim poured the vodka nah the dogs walt notti bred his dogs twenty then on the canadian beer coffee thanks jim while jim and cissy dealt with drinks and continued to argue over their favored mushers nate turned to the man beside him how you doing john not sleeping very well yet john marked his page set the book down cant get the image out of my head its tough you knew max pretty well wrote some articles for his paper monthly book reviews the occasional color piece didnt pay much but i enjoyed it i dont know if carrie will keep the paper going i hope she does somebody told me galloway wrote some pieces for the lunatic back in its early days he was a good writer hed have been a better one if hed focused on it i guess thats true of anything he had a lot of raw talent in several areas john glanced over his shoulder toward charlene but he never buckled it down wasted what he had including his woman id be biased on that subject in my opinion he didnt put much effort into his relationship or much of anything else he had a couple of chapters of several novels dozens of halfwritten songs any number of abandoned woodworking projects the man was good with his hands had a creative mind but no discipline or ambition nate weighed the possibilities three men drawn together by location avocation the writing and the climb and two of the three in love with the same woman maybe hed have turned that around if hed had the chance john signaled for jim to refill his glass maybe you read his stuff i did wed sit around over a beer or two or some other recreational drug john added with a half smile and discuss philosophies and politics writing and the human condition young intellectuals john lifted his glass in toast who were going absolutely nowhere you climbed with him ah adventure young intellectuals dont come to alaska without needing to have them i enjoyed those days and wouldnt have them back for a pulitzer smiling the way a man does over past glories he sipped at the fresh whiskey the two of you were friendly yes we were friends on that intellectual level in any case i envied him his woman that was no secret i think it amused him and made him feel a bit superior to me i was the educated one hed tossed the prospect of a superior education away yet look what he had john brooded into his drink i imagine hed still be amused that i continue to envy him his woman nate let that sit a minute drank coffee did you two climb with a group or alone hmm john blinked like a man coming out of a dream memories nate thought were just another kind of dream or nightmare groups theres camaraderie in the insanity the best i remember was a summer climb on denali groups and solos picking their way up that monster like ants on a giant cake base camp was like a little town all of its own and a crazed little party you and pat mmm along with jacob otto deb and harry ed bing max the hopps sam beaver who died two years ago from a pulmonary embolism ah lets see mackie sr was there as i recall he and bing started to beat the snot out of each other for something and hopp the deceased hopp broke it up hawley was there but he fell over drunk and cracked his head we wouldnt let him climb and there was missy jacobson a freelance photographer with whom i had a short intense affair before she moved back to portland and married a plumber he smiled at that oh yes missy with her big brown eyes and clever hands those of us from lunacy had put our party together like a holiday we even had a little flag we were going to stick on the summit for photo ops for the paper but none of us made it to the top none of you no not then pat did later as i recall but on that climb we were plagued with bad luck still that night at base camp we were full of possibilities and goodwill singing screwing dancing under that wonderful endless sunlight as alive as i think any of us had ever been what happened harry was sick didnt know it but by morning he was running a fever flu he said he was fine and nobody wanted to argue he didnt make it five hours deb and hopp got him back down sam fell broke his arm missy was getting sick another group coming down took her back to base the weather turned and those of us who were left pitched tents and huddled down praying for it to pass it didnt got worse ed got sick then i got sick one thing after another until we had to call it and go back miserable end to our little town holiday who got you back to town sorry you have a pilot oh i remember being stuffed into that plane everyone sick or pissed or sullen cant remember the pilot some friend of jacobs i think i was dog sick that i recall vividly i wrote about it at some point tried for a little humor in a piece for the lunatic he polished off the whiskey i always regretted not hoisting that flag nate let it go and wandered to charlene can you take a break sure when rose is back on her feet five minutes youre not that crowded yet she shoved her order pad in her pocket five we dont keep things moving in here people will start going to the italian place i cant afford to lose my regulars she clipped her way out of the restaurant into the empty lobby the sound of her heels made nate think of the tango and he wondered what sort of vanity would overcome a womans need for comfort when she was going to be hopping on her feet for a few hours to your knowledge patrick galloway was going to anchorage to look for work weve been through this indulge me if he went there and got a wild hair to do a climb who would he most likely hire to fly him to sun glacier how the hell am i supposed to know he wasnt supposed to be climbing he was supposed to be looking for a job you lived with him for close to fourteen years charlene you knew him if it wasnt jacob and he was in anchorage it would probably have been twotoes or stokey unless he got that hair when neither of them were around then hed have hired whoever was handy or more likely have bartered something for the flight he didnt have any money to spare i only gave him a hundred out of my household fund any more i knew hed piss it away you know where i can find either of those pilots ask jacob or meg they run in that world i dont you should have told me they brought him back down nate you should have told me and taken me to see him there was no point in putting you through that no he said before she could object there wasnt he nudged her into a chair sat beside her listen to me it wont help you to see him that way it wont help him meg saw him and it ripped her up i was there i know it you want to do something for him for yourself you want to find your closure make time to go see your daughter be her mother charlene give her some comfort she doesnt want comfort from me she doesnt want anything from me maybe not but offering it might help you he got to his feet im going out to see her now anything you want me to tell her you could tell her i could use a hand around here for the next couple of days unless shes got something more important to do okay it was full dark when he got back to megs he could see she looked calmer steadier and more rested the position of the pillows and throw on the sofa told him shed had a nap in front of the fire at some point hed figured out the best way to handle things and handed her a bouquet of mixed mums and daisies hed picked up at the corner store they werent particularly fresh but they were flowers whats this for see i realized we were working backward in the traditional sense i got you into bed or you got me so that pressures off now im romancing you is that right she sniffed at them maybe it was a cliche but she had a weakness for flowers and men who thought to offer them then the next step would be what a pickup at a bar i was thinking more of a date dinner say but you could pick me up in a bar that works for me too meanwhile id like you to pack some things and come back with me to the lodge for the night oh so we can still have sex during this romancing period you could get your own room but id rather have the sex you could bring the flowers too and the dogs and why would i leave the comfort of my own home to have sex with you in a hotel room she twirled the flowers watched him over them oh for the thrill factor in our backward relationship its stupid enough to appeal to me burke but id as soon stay here and we can pretend were in some cheap motel room we can even see if theres any porn on cable that sounds really good but id like you to come back with me someone was skulking around in your woods the other night what are you talking about he told her about the tracks why the hell didnt you tell me about this when it was light so i could see for myself she tossed the flowers down on the table and headed for her parka hold on it snowed a good six inches you wont be able to see anything otto and peter already tromped around in there anyway i didnt tell you before because you had enough on your plate this way you had a nap and some quiet time pack what you need meg im not going to be driven out of my house because somebody walked around in the woods even if i want to take a page out of your book of paranoia and conclude he or she was spying or up to some nefarious plan i wouldnt be driven out i can handle yourself yes i know you think i cant she spun on her heel marched into the kitchen when he came in behind her she was yanking a rifle out of the broom closet meg just shut up she checked the chamber to his distress he saw it was fully loaded do you know how many accidents go down because people keep loaded weapons in the household i dont shoot anything by accident come out here she pulled open the door it was dark it was cold and he had an irritated woman with a loaded rifle on his hands why dont we just go inside and that branch two oclock seven feet up forty feet out meg she shouldered the rifle got her bead and fired the blast of it boomed in his head the branch exploded six inches in okay you can shoot a rifle gold medal for you come inside she fired again and the six inches of branch jumped on the snow like a rabbit her breath steamed out as she fired again and obliterated what was left then she picked up her spent shells walked back inside and replaced the rifle a plus on marksmanship nate commented and though i have no intention of letting it come to that i will point out that blasting the shit out of a tree branch isnt anywhere near the same level as putting a bullet into flesh and bone im not one of your dainty lower women ive taken down moose buffalo caribou bear ever shot a human being its not the same meg believe me its not im not saying youre not smart or capable or strong but i am asking you to come back with me tonight if you wont ill stay here but your mother could use some help at the lodge with rose out shes overworked and churned up about your father charlene and i i cant connect with mine you know my mother she barely speaks to me and my sister stays away from both of us because she just wants to have a nice normal life cant blame her i didnt know you had a sister shes two years older lives in kentucky now i havent seen her in five years i guess the burkes arent big on family gatherings she didnt come to see you when you were shot she called we didnt have a lot to say to each other when jack was killed and i was shot up my mother came to see me in the hospital i thought as much as i was thinking that maybe just maybe something would come out of all that horror i thought wed work our way back to each other but she asked me if id stop now if id resign from the force before she had to visit my grave instead of my hospital bed i told her no that it was all i had left she walked out without another word i dont think weve exchanged more than a dozen words since the job cost me my best friend my wife my family no it didnt she couldnt stop herself from taking his hand lifting it to her cheek rubbing it there you know it didnt depends how you turn it thats all but i didnt give it up im here because even at the bottom it was the one thing i kept maybe its what stopped me from sinking all the way down i dont know but i do know youve got a chance to make some sort of peace with your mother you ought to take it she couldve asked me to give her a hand she did im just the filter on a sigh she turned around and gave the underthesink cabinet a testy little kick ill chip in some time but dont look for happyeverafter on this nate ever afters too long to worry about anyway he dropped her off at the lodge then went back to the station he spent some time writing up notes from his conversations with otto and john then began a searchandrun on the names of the pilots otto had given him he found no criminal on stokey loukes nothing more than a few traffic violations he lived in fairbanks now and was employed as a pilot for a tour organization called alaska wild their web page promised to show clients the real alaska and help them bag game reel in enormous fish and capture scenes of the great alone all for various package prices group rates available fielding moved to australia in and died of natural causes four years later thomas kijinski aka twotoes was a different story nate found several pops for possession of controlled substances intent to distribute d d petty larceny hed been kicked out of canada and his pilots license had been suspended twice on march his body had been found stuffed in a trash bin on a dock in anchorage multiple stab wounds his wallet and watch had been missing conclusion mugging the perpetrator or perpetrators had never been identified shine a light on it another way nate thought as he printed out the data and you have a cleanup rather than a mugging pilot takes three brings back two couple weeks later the pilots stabbed and stuffed in the garbage made a man stop and think with the station quiet around him nate uncovered his case board he brewed more coffee and dug up a can of processed ham from the storeroom to make himself what passed for a sandwich then he sat at his desk studying the board reading his notes reading patrick galloways last journal and spent the long evening hours thinking nineteen he didnt tell her about the journal when a woman ended the day tired and irritable it seemed unwise to give her one more thing to add to the mix he had to give meg points for shoving up her sleeves and pitching in at the lodge and bonus points for rolling out of bed the next morning and handling the breakfast crowd especially since the tension between her and charlene was thick enough to slice up and fry alongside the bacon still when he took a table she walked over coffeepot at the ready hi im meg and ill be your server this morning since im looking for a really big tip im going to wait until after you eat to bash this pot over charlenes head i appreciate that how long before rose comes back on another week or two anyway and then charlenes going to let her set her own schedule until she feels ready for fulltime you gotta say thats obliging oh shes plenty obliging with rose she shot a short and bitter look over her shoulder in charlenes direction she loves her its me she cant tolerate whatll it be handsome if i say the two of you are probably after the same things in different ways are you going to bash me over the head with that coffeepot i might then ill have the oatmeal you eat oatmeal she wrinkled her sexily crooked nose without somebody holding a knife to your throat it sticks with you yeah for weeks with a shrug she walked off to take more orders top off mugs of coffee he liked watching her move quick but not rushed sexy but not obvious she wore the ubiquitous flannel shirt open over a white thermal a silver pendant bounced lightly from its chain between her breasts shed slapped some makeup on he knew because hed watched her and slapped was the operative word fast efficient absent quick brushes of color on the cheeks shadowy stuff on the eyes then careless flicks of mascara on those long dark lashes and when a man noticed how a woman handled mascara nate mused he was sunk charlene came out with an order meg went back with her pad they didnt acknowledge each other except for the sudden dip in temperature he picked up his coffee pulled out his notebook to use it as a shield when charlene headed in his direction even a man who was sunk had enough selfpreservation to stay out of the middle of two sniping women want me to top that off for you she get your order i dont know why she cant be more pleasant to the customers no thanks yes she did and she was pleasant to you maybe because youre balling her charlene he caught the unmuffled snickers from the booth where hans and dexter habitually sat god well its no secret is it not anymore he muttered spent the night in your room didnt she he set his coffee down if thats a problem for you i can take my things to her place why should it be a problem for me despite his no thanks she topped off his coffee in an automatic gesture why should anything be a problem for me to his utter terror her eyes filled with tears before he could think how to handle it or her she rushed out of the room coffee sloshing in her pot women bing said from the booth behind him nothing but trouble nate shifted around bing was plowing through a plate of eggs sausage and home fries there was a sneaky grin on his face but if nate didnt mistake it a little gleam of sympathy in his eyes you ever been married bing was once didnt stick cant imagine why thought about doing it again maybe ill get myself one of those russian mailorder women like johnny trivanis doing hes going through with that sure got it down to two last i heard thought id see how it works out for him then look into it uhhuh since they were having what passed as a conversation nate decided to probe do you do any climbing bing used to some dont like it much i got free time id rather go hunting you looking to recreate might be days are getting longer you got city all over you and a skinny build stick with town chief thats my advice take up knitting or some shit ive always wanted to macrame at bings blank look nate only smiled how come you dont have a plane bing guy like you likes his independence knows his machines seems like a natural too much work im gonna work its gonna be on the ground besides you have to be half crazy to pilot so i hear somebody mentioned some pilot to me funny name sixtoes something thatd be twotoes lost three of them on one foot to frostbite or some shit now that was one crazy bastard dead now that so crashed nah got himself beat up in a fight or no bings brow wrinkled stabbed city crime teach you to live with that many other people there you go did you ever go up with him once crazy bastard flew a bunch of us out to the bush for caribou didnt know he was higher than the frigging moon until he damn near killed us blackened his eye for it bing said with relish crazy bastard nate started to respond but meg came out of the kitchen and the front door opened chief nate jesse flew in steps ahead of david youre here you too nate flicked a finger down the boys nose david hows rose and the baby good really good were giving her a break having a mans breakfast here can we sit with you jesse asked cause were all men you bet and the bestlooking men in lunacy meg slid the oatmeal a plate of wheat toast and a bowl of mixed fruit in front of nate you driving yet jesse he laughed and scooted into the booth beside nate no he bounced can i fly your plane when your feet reach the pedals coffee david thanks you sure this is all right he asked nate sure ive missed my usual breakfast buddy here hows it feel to be the big brother i dunno she cries loud and then she sleeps a lot but she held my finger she sucks on moms boobie to get milk really was all nate could think to say why dont i get you some milk in a glass meg poured coffee for david rose heard you were pitching in for her david added sugar to his coffee she wanted you to know she appreciates it we all do no problem meg glanced over when charlene came back in ill get that milk while you decide what to have for your manly breakfast nate left his truck for meg and walked to the station the sunlight was weak but it was light the mountains were misted by clouds the kind he now knew carried snow with them but the bitter wind and the cold it whipped up had mellowed the walk warmed his muscles cleared his head he passed familiar faces exchanged greetings in the absent way people who saw each other almost every day were wont to do and he thought with some surprise that he was making a place for himself not just an escape a refuge or a stopgap but a place he couldnt remember the last time hed thought about leaving or just drifting to some other town some other job it had been days since hed had to force himself out of bed in the morning or since hed sat in the dark for hours afraid to face sleep and the nightmares that ran with it the weight could still come back into his head his shoulders his gut but it wasnt as heavy wasnt as often he looked to the mountains again and knew he owed patrick galloway owed him enough for cracking open that dark so that he couldnt and wouldnt give up trying to find him justice he stopped when hopp swung her fourwheel over she rolled down her window im on my way to see rose and the baby give them my best you ought to pay a call yourself meanwhile couple of things fedsll be setting off a controlled avalanche the day after tomorrow so the road between here and anchorage is going to be blocked say that again feds set off an avalanche from time to time clear the mountain got one scheduled for about ten oclock am day after tomorrow peach just got the dispatch and told me when i stopped in youll need to get a bulletin out ill take care of it and theres a damn bull moose wandering around the school yard and when a couple of kids decided to chase it it bashed into a couple of parked cars then chased back theyve got the kids inside now but that moose is pissed whatre you grinning at she demanded you ever see a pissedoff moose no maam but i guess im going to if you cant head it out of town youre going to have to take it down she nodded when he stopped grinning somebodys going to get hurt ill take care of it he quickened his pace damn if he was going to shoot some stupid moose especially on school grounds maybe that labeled him an outsider but thats the way it was he pushed into the station and saw his staff and ed woolcott ottos face was flushed with temper and his nose and eds were all but bumping avalanches a pissedoff moose pissedoff deputy pissedoff banker a wellrounded morning its about damn time ed began i need a word with you chief in your office youll have to wait peach get the information on the scheduled avalanche to klun i want it announced every half hour through the day and make up some fliers get them posted around town peter i want you to ride out personally inform anyone residing south of wolverine cut that this is coming and theyll be cut off until the roads are cleared yes sir chief burke just a minute he said to ed otto weve got an angry moose down at the school already some vehicular damage he strode to the weapon cabinet as he spoke i need you to come with me see if we can herd it out he unlocked the cabinet chose a shotgun with the sincere prayer he wasnt going to have to use it ive been waiting ten minutes ed complained your deputies are capable of handling a simple wildlife situation you can wait here or ill come by the bank as soon as this situation is under control as deputy mayor youre being a real pain in the ass nate finished otto well need your car mines back at the lodge lets go looked like a landed trout gulping otto said when they were outside hes going to want to fry you for that nate sure as god made little green apples ed doesnt take to being stonewalled hes outranked the mayor told me to deal with the moose im dealing with the moose he climbed in ottos car were not shooting it why do you have the shotgun i plan to intimidate him the towns schools were a connected trio of small lowslung buildings with a pretty grove of trees on one side and a little squaredoff field on the other he knew the younger kids were allowed out into the field twice a day for a kind of recess weather permitting since most of the kids had been born there it took some pretty serious weather to cancel recess the high schoolers liked to use the grove to hang out maybe smoke or fool around before and after classes there was a flagpole and at this time of day both the us and the alaskan flag should have been up and waving instead they were a little under halfstaff and flicking fitfully in the disinterested wind kids mustve been hoisting the flags when they spotted it nate muttered decided to chase after it just going to irritate it doing that nate glanced at the two smashedup cars in the tiny lot looks like he spotted the moose now at the edge of the grove rubbing his antlers on bark he also saw a light trail of blood since no one had reported an injury he assumed it was moose blood doesnt look like hes causing any trouble now looks like he cut himself up bashing those cars so hes not going to be in a good mood if he decides to stay around hell be trouble especially if some idiot kid slips by a teacher and decides to chase it again or runs home to get a gun and shoots at it well shit get as close as you can and maybe itll move off charge more likely im not shooting some moose while its scratching itself on a tree otto somebody else will if he sticks close to town moose meats a good meal its not going to be me and its not going to be within town limits damn it he saw the moose turn as they edged closer and saw to his consternation a look more fierce than dumb in those dark eyes hell shit damn fuck blast the horn moose werent slow where had he gotten the idea they were it galloped toward them apparently more challenged by the sound of the engine and horn than intimidated still cursing nate hitched himself out of the window aimed the gun toward the sky and fired the moose kept coming and adding his own oaths to the mix otto swerved to avoid collision nate pumped fired into the air again shoot the son of a bitch otto demanded as he whipped the wheel and nearly dumped nate out of the window im not doing it pumping the shotgun again nate fired into the snowy ground a foot in front of the moose this time it was the moose that veered off and with his ungainly trot headed into the trees nate fired twice more to keep it going then he dropped back on the seat huffed out two breaths from behind them came the sounds of hoots and cheers and laughter as kids popped out of the school doors youre crazy otto pulled off his cap to scrub a hand over his crew cut youve got to be crazy i know you shot a man dead back in baltimore and sent him to hell and you cant put some buckshot into a moose nate took another deep breath and pushed the image of the alley out of his mind the moose was unarmed lets go otto i need to deal with the deputy mayor you can come back and take the reports the deputy mayor had not deigned to wait in fact peach told nate hed stormed out after a short diatribe on why it had been a mistake to hire some lazy puffedup outsider taking it in stride nate passed the shotgun to otto snagged a twoway and set out to walk to the bank somewhere in the wide wide world nate imagined there was a place colder than lunacy alaska in february and he hoped to god he never paid a visit there the sky had cleared which meant any stingy heat had lifted up and away but the sun streamed so with luck they might hit a sweaty twenty degrees by midafternoon and the sun nate saw was ringed by a rainbow circle a colorful halo of reds and blues and golds what peter had told him was called a sun dog people were out and about taking advantage of the bright morning to do their business some of them called out greetings to him or flipped waves he saw johnny trivani the hopeful groom chatting on the sidewalk with bess mackie and deb outside the store washing windows as if it had been a fine spring day he lifted a hand to mitch dauber who sat in the window of klun spinning records and observing life in lunacy he expected mitch would have something philosophical to say about the moose before the end of the day february it struck him as he stood on the corner of lunatic and denali somehow it had gotten to be so far into february they were nearly to march he was coming right up on the line of his sixty days his own point of return and was still here more than here he thought settling into being here thoughtful he crossed over and into the bank there were two customers doing business at the bank counter and another picking up mail from the post office from the way they and the tellers eyeballed him nate imagined ed had still been in a temper when hed come in in the silence that fell he nodded then stepped through the short swinging gate that separated the bank lobby from the offices it didnt boast a drivethrough and there were no atms lurking outside but the bank had a nice carpet a few local paintings on the wall and a general air of efficiency he walked to the door that had ed woolcotts name on a shiny brass plaque and knocked ed opened it himself sniffed youll have to wait im on the phone fine when the door shut in his face nate simply slipped his hands into his pockets and studied the paintings he noted one of a totem in a snowy woods was signed by ernest notti one of peters relatives he wondered he still had a lot to learn about his lunatics he glanced around there was no protective glass between teller and customers but there were security cameras hed checked the place out already before hed opened his own accounts now that conversation had started up again he tuned into snatches movie night an upcoming bake sale to benefit the school band the weather the iditarod smalltown small talk and nothing like what he would have heard if hed walked into one of the branches of his bank in baltimore ed kept him waiting ten minutes a little power flex and was stonefaced with a little flush on his cheekbones when he opened the door i want you to be aware ive made a formal complaint to the mayor okay i dont like your attitude chief burke noted mr woolcott if thats all you want to tell me i need to get back to the station what i want is to know just what youre doing about the theft of my property ottos handling that my property was vandalized and damaged expensive fishing gear has been stolen i believe im entitled to the attention of the chief of police and youve got it a report has been duly filed and the officer in charge is pursuing the matter the theft isnt being taken lightly by me or my staff we have a detailed description of the stolen property and if the thief is dumb enough to use it talk about it or try to sell it within my jurisdiction well make an arrest and recover your property eds eyes were slits in his rawhide face maybe if i was female youd take more interest actually i dont think youd be my type mr woolcott he continued youre upset and youre angry youve got a right to be you were violated the fact that it was most likely kids being stupid doesnt lessen that violation well do everything we can to get your property back if it helps ill apologize for being abrupt with you earlier i was concerned that children might be injured and that took priority you have two children in that school i assume their safety would take precedence over an update on your stolen property the flush had died down and a long huff told nate the crisis had passed be that as it may you were rude i was and distracted to be frank ive got a lot on my mind just now patrick galloways murder maxs apparent suicide he shook his head as if overwhelmed when i signed on for this job i expected to be handling well at worst the sort of theft youve experienced tragic ed sat now and was gracious enough to gesture nate to a chair its so damn tragic and shocking max was a friend a good one he rubbed the back of his neck with his hand i thought i knew him and had no idea no clue that he was contemplating suicide leaving his wife his kids that way he held up his hands a kind of silent apology i guess im more upset about it than ive wanted to admit and its been eating at me i owe you an apology too not necessary ive let this theft build up defense mechanism its easier to get riled about that than think about max ive been trying to help carrie with the details on his memorial and some of the finances a lot of paperwork comes along with death its hard its hard to deal with it nothing harder than burying a friend you knew him a long time a long time good times our kids have grown up together and this on top of finding out about pat you knew him too he smiled a little before i married arlene or as shed say before she tamed me i wasnt always the solid citizen and family man i am now pat was an adventure those were good times too in their way he looked around his office as if it belonged to someone else and he couldnt quite remember how hed come to be there it doesnt seem possible none of it its been a shock for everyone to find out about galloway i thought hed taken off everyone did and it didnt surprise me not really he was restless reckless thats what made him so appealing you climbed with him god ed sat back now i used to love to climb the thrill and the misery still do love it but i rarely have or take the time ive been teaching my son ive heard galloway was good very good though that recklessness was there a little too much of it for comfort for me even when i was thirty do you have any thoughts on who wouldve been climbing with him that february none and believe me i have thought about it since we heard the news i suspect he might have picked up someone or a group and taken them up for a winter climb it was the sort of thing he might do on impulse to earn a little money and for the buzz and one of them killed him god knows why he shook his head but arent the state police handling that investigation they are im just curious unofficially i doubt theyll ever find out who it was or why sixteen years god how things change he murmured you hardly notice as they do you know i ran the bank singlehanded at one time lived here too kept the money in that safe right over there he gestured to a black floor safe i didnt know that i was twentyseven when i landed here going to carve my place out of the wilderness civilize it to my liking he smiled now guess i did just that you know the hopps and judge royce were my first customers took a lot of faith for them to put their money in my hands i never forgot it but we had a vision and we built this town out of it its a good town yes it is and im proud of my part in making it old man hidel was here with the original lodge he banked with me too after a while other people came along peach with her third no it was her second husband they lived out in the bush awhile came here for supplies and company from time to time she came back for good when he died otto bing deb and harry takes strength of character and vision to make a life here yes it does well he drew air in through his nose pat had vision of his own kind and he was a character i dont know about that strength he was an entertaining bastard though i hope this will all be put to rest properly do you think well ever know for certain what happened up there odds arent favorable but i think coben will give it the proper time and effort hell look for the pilot and anyone who might have seen galloway in the days before he went up they might want to talk to you about who he used as a pilot on his climbs it wouldve been jacob most usually but surely if jacob had taken him up hed have reported it when pat didnt come back he lifted his shoulders so logically it would have to have been someone else let me think he picked up a silver pen tapped it absently against his desk blotter when we climbed with jacob as i recall he sometimes used what was his name vietnam vet lakes loukes thats it then there was this maniac twotoes they called him do you think i should call this coben and tell him couldnt hurt i should get back he rose held out a hand i hope were square now mr woolcott ed and we are damn auger i paid too much for it so its a double annoyance its insured so are the rods but its the principle understood listen ill take a ride out to your ice shack take a look around satisfaction settled over eds face now i appreciate that i put a new lock on let me get you the keys since moose and apoplectic deputy mayors had been dealt with nate swung by to see rose he made what he hoped were appropriate noises over the baby who looked like a blackheaded turtle swaddled in a pink blanket he called in let peach know he was taking a run out to the lake to run another check of eds ice shack on impulse he stopped by the dog run at the lodge sprang rock and bull and took them with him so they could have an hour of free rein it was a nice ride with the radio turned from ottos choice of countrywestern to nates preference for alternative rock he drove to the lake to the bouncy beat of blink eds shack sat alone on a rippled plate of ice it was nate estimated about the size of two generous outhouses stuck together and was fashioned out of what he thought might be cedar shakes a little more upscale than hed expected with the sides silvered by weather and topped by a peaked roof and set well apart from the huddle of other shacks he decided it looked like the manor house and the peasant village amusing himself the dogs raced over the ice like a couple of kids on school holiday while nate slipped and slithered his way across the quiet was amazing like a church with a kind of musical hush from that light wind through the snowdrenched trees the sun dog shimmered in the icy blue sky and had the frozen lake gleaming the sense of silence and solitude was so strong that he jumped reached for his weapon when he heard the long echoing call overhead the eagle circled goldbrown and gorgeous against the heavy sky the dogs bumped each other playfully then dived into the bank of snow at the edge of the lake he could see megs plane from here he realized the red flash of it just at the long curve of the frozen water and other little snips of civilization if he cared to look there a stream of smoke from a chimney a glimpse of a house through the thick trees his own breath streaming out he let out a short laugh maybe he should give this icefishing business a shot there had to be something to be said for the primitive rush of dropping a line through a hole in the ice and sitting in the quiet on a plate of frozen water he crossed to the shack and saw the sloppy spraypainted dick shit spewed across the door in virulent yellow another sign of civilization nate thought as he fished out the keys ed had bolted on two new padlocks each with a fat shiny chain he dealt with them stepped in the graffiti artists had been at work inside obscenities squirreled around the walls he adjusted his annoyance with ed hed have been royally pissed too to find this sort of thing in one of his sanctuaries he could see the rack where the rods had been as well as the utter tidiness under the disorder the vandals had caused the tackle the coleman stove the chairs hadnt been touched but a cabinet he suspected had held the scotch glenfiddich according to ottos report and some food supplies was empty and open he found cleats that snapped on boots and made a mental note to buy some for himself he found a firstaid kit extra gloves hat an old worn parka snowshoes and a couple of thermal blankets the snowshoes were hung on the wall just over a screaming yellow asshole if theyd been used recently nate couldnt tell there was fuel for the stove a fish sealer and a couple of wickedlooking knives a number of magazines a portable radio extra batteries nothing he supposed that you wouldnt expect to find in an icefishing shack in alaska when he walked out again he circled around he looked down toward megs plane then across where her woods began he tried to picture ed woolcott pompous but tough skulking around the woods on snowshoes twenty the moose was the hot topic for most of the week nate was razzed or congratulated on his moose dispersing technique depending on the source nate considered the moose a kind of blessing it took peoples minds off murder and death at least for a little while hed considered going back to speak with carrie and some strategies for getting past the probability shed slam the door in his face and refuse to see him the notification that the body had been released and cremated and that meg was flying carrie into anchorage to pick up the ashes decided him im going to need to come with you he told meg look chief its going to be hard enough to deal with coming and going without you there to rub the circumstances in her face i dont intend to do any rubbing im going to go see her now well meet you at the river nate she finished dragging on her boots maybe you think the lunacy pd has to be represented here for whatever cop reason but send otto or peter fair or not youre the last person carrie wants to see today well meet you at the river he was halfway to the door of the room they were temporarily sharing when it struck he turned grinned rock and bull im slow but i just got it must be all the moose talk rocky and bullwinkle you are slow or you had a deprived childhood no i just figured they were macho names like i dont know boxers the rock raging bull whatever her lips tipped up at the corner why was it he could charm her even when she was annoyed with him the rocks a wrestler close enough see you in an hour hed already informed his staff who had the same pessimistic attitude as meg that hed be making the trip to anchorage that morning so he drove straight to carries the door swung open before he was halfway up the walk she stood in a black sweater and pants blocking the door you can just turn around and go back to your car i dont have to talk to you and i dont have to let you into my house id like five minutes carrie i sure as hell dont want to stand out here shouting what i have to say to you through a closed door i dont think youd like that either itd be easier on both of us if you give me that five minutes inside especially since im going to be on the plane with you in an hour i dont want you with me i know that if you still feel that way after you hear what i have to say ill send peter instead he could see the struggle on her face then she turned walked away leaving the door open to him and the brisk cold he walked in shut the door she stood in her living room her back to him her arms folded against her chest tight enough that he saw her knuckles whiten against her own biceps are your kids here no i sent them to school theyre better off with the routine with their friends they need some normal how can you come here like this she whirled around how can you come here and harass me on the day im going to bring my husbands ashes home dont you have any heart any compassion im here officially and what im going to say to you is confidential officially she all but spat it what do you want my husbands dead hes dead and he cant defend himself against the terrible things you say about him you wont say those things in his house this is maxs house and you wont say those horrible lies about him here you loved him did you love him enough to give me your word that what i do say here wont be repeated to anyone anyone carrie youd dare ask me if i loved just yes or no i need your word ive got no interest in repeating your lies say whatever you have to say and get out ill promise to forget you were even here it would have to do i believe max was on the mountain with patrick galloway at the time of galloways death go to hell i also believe there was a third person with them her mouth trembled open what do you mean a third person three of them went up two of them came down i believe that third person is responsible for galloways murder and i believe he killed max or induced max to kill himself while she stared her hand groped out fumbled its way to the back of a chair her body seemed to sink into it i cant understand you i cant give you all the details but i need your cooperation i need your help he amended to prove what i believe there was a third man carrie who was it i dont know god i dont know i i told you someone killed max i told you he didnt kill himself i told sergeant coben i keep telling him i know i believe you you believe me tears gushed out of her eyes rained down her cheeks you believe me i do but the fact is the mes ruled it suicide coben may have his doubts and he may have his instincts even a certain amount of circumstantial evidence but he doesnt have the investment we do he doesnt have the room or the time to push on this the way i do were going to need to go back a long time youre going to need to try to remember details feelings conversations its not easy and youre going to need to keep this to yourself im asking you to take a risk she brushed at tears i dont understand if were right and someone killed max because of what happened on that mountain that someone may be watching you he may wonder what you know what you remember what max might have told you you think i could be in danger i think i want you to be very careful i dont want you discussing this with anyone not even your kids not your best friend not your priest no one i want you to let me go through maxs things his personal papers everything here and at the paper and i dont want anyone to know about it i want you to go back and think about that february what you did what max did who he spent time with how he behaved write it down she stared at him with something that looked like hope fighting through the grief youre going to find out who did this to him to us im going to do everything i can she mopped at her cheeks i said terrible things about you to to anyone whod listen some of them were probably true no they werent she pressed her fingers to her eyes now im so confused im sick sick in my heart in my head i made myself hire meg to take me to bring us back because i needed to prove i didnt believe that i wasnt ashamed but part of me was she dropped her hands and her eyes were shattered if he was up there he must have known we re going to work all that out some of the answers may be hard carrie but its better than just having questions i hope youre right she got to her feet i need to fix myself up a little she started out then stopped and turned around that business with the moose out at the school max wouldve loved that he would have loved writing that up troublemaking moose expelled from lunacy high or something like that that sort of story just tickled him a man like that a man who could find such pleasure in something so foolish he couldnt have done what was done to pat galloway iwanted to marry him almost as soon as i met him i liked the way hed talk and talk about starting up a town paper how it was important to record the little things just as much as the big ones carrie looked out the window in her seat beside meg and nate could see her gaze was on the mountains i came here to teach and i stayed because it got inside me i wasnt a very good teacher really but i wanted to stay and i liked the odds a lot more men than women i was looking for a man she slid a sideways glance at meg who isnt carrie laughed a little but the sound was hoarse i wanted to get married and have kids one look at max and i decided hed fit the bill he was smart but not too smart cute but not so handsome id worry other women would be after him a little wild more that he wanted to be wild but the sort you knew you could fix up with some time and effort she broke off and her hitching breaths were an obvious fight against tears do women make checklists of stuff like that you know like you do on a house youre thinking of buying fixerupper solid foundation but needs new trim that kind of thing nate asked carrie let out a watery giggle pressed her hand to her lips we do or i sure did the closer i got to thirty i didnt love him right off i mean not like some huge hot burst but i got him into bed and that part was good another check in the plus column there was another beat of silence then nate cleared his throat ah are those particular checks sizespecific or colorcoded dont worry burke you get a nice fat check in that column too meg interjected she flipped him a glance that was full of appreciation and understanding he was keeping it light and easy for the widow as much as he could she looked over at carrie you always looked good together like a team we were a good team maybe i never got that big hot burst but ill tell you when i fell in love with him really absolutely nogoingback in love with him it was when he held our daughter for the first time the look on his face when he lifted her up that first time the way he looked at me when he did all that shock and wonder the thrill and the terror all of it on his face so i didnt get an explosion but what i got was warm and steady and real he didnt kill your father meg she looked out the window again the man who held that baby the way he did he couldnt have killed anyone i know you have reason to think different and i want you to know how much i value and appreciate your kindness in taking me today we both lost someone we loved it wouldnt prove anything if we slapped each other about it women nate thought were tougher and more resilient than any man he knew including himself he tracked down coben as soon as they landed and though it felt callous he left meg with carrie to deal with the arrangements and release of maxs ashes thomas kijinski aka twotoes he looks like the best bet theres a pilot loukes works out of fairbanks now and a couple others galloway used occasionally he set the list hed made on cobens desk but kijinski pops for me he ends up dead a couple of weeks after galloway stabbing investigated and deemed a mugging coben drew in a breath kijinski played with some bad boys he gambled pretty heavy was suspected of running drugs time of his death he had markers out for somewhere in the neighborhood of ten large investigating officer believed one of his ious was collected in flesh but he couldnt prove it and youre buying that kind of coincidence im not buying anything the fact is kijinski lived a bad life and met a bad end if he happened to be the pilot who took galloway on his last climb he isnt going to tell us about it then it shouldnt be a problem for you to give me a copy of the file on him coben sucked air through his nose again ive got the press on my ass on this burke yeah ive caught some of the reports ive given some reporters an official statement youve seen crap like this he yanked a copy of a tabloid out of a drawer tossed it down the headline screamed ice man recovered from frozen grave there was a picture of galloway as hed been in the cave in lurid color under the boldface type you had to expect shit like this nate began one of the recovery team had to take that shot one of them cashed in made a few bucks by selling it to the tabloids my lieutenants breathing down my neck i dont need you doing the same there was a third man on the mountain yeah there was according to galloways journal of course we cant prove he died after that last journal entry with sixteen years between weve got a lot of room on time of death couldve been then or a month after six months after you know better than that what i know coben lifted one hand what i can prove then the other me ruled suicide and my lieutenant likes it too damn bad hawbaker didnt name names in his note give me the file and ill get names you can smell it the same as i can coben if you want to close the lid on the stink thats up to you but ive got a memorial to go to and a woman with two kids who deserves to know the truth so she can learn to live with it i can take a few days and go hunting for information here in anchorage or you can give me the file and let me get back to lunacy if id wanted to close the lid i wouldnt have given you galloways journal frustration rippled around him in nearly visible waves ive got brass to answer to and they want the lid closed the prevailing theory is that hawbaker killed galloway and the third man the one who was injured according to the journal and if you look at this straight on thats what plays why would galloways killer spare an injured man a potential witness hawbaker does them both then fear of exposure remorse and he offs himself thats tidy coben flattened his lips some like it tidy ill get you the file burke but you keep your personal investigation lowkey the lowest the press my lieutenant anybody gets wind youre poking around and im helping you it comes down on me done meg was so saturated with carries grief that she didnt mind spending another evening waiting tables given a choice shed have preferred to load up her dogs and fly out to the bush somewhere anywhere she could spend a couple of days completely alone away from the pulls and tugs of people and all their needs that she thought as she swung into the overheated kitchen at the lodge was the galloway gene take off flip it off shrug it off lifes too short for hassles but there was enough of something else in her christ she hoped it wasnt charlene to make her stay and see it through she hooked her orders on the turntable for big mike two meat loafs a vegetarian special and the salmon surprise she picked up the completed orders from her last trip in balanced them with such ease it made her wince nothing against waitpersons the world over she thought as she carried the food out but she wished she wasnt so good at it it wasnt on the scope for her even as a fallback career god she wanted the air some silence her dogs her music some sex she was ready to pop she worked another two hours through the clatter the complaints the gossip the bad jokes she could feel the pressure building up inside her the desperate need to get out get away when the crowd thinned out she caught charlene at the kitchen door thats all you get for tonight im taking off i need you to youre going to have to need somebody else shouldnt be hard for you she headed for the stairs she wanted a shower and by god she was packing up her things and going home this time it was charlene who caught her were going to have another rush in an hour people coming in to drink to oddly enough i dont care shed have closed the door in charlenes face but her mother was through the door and slamming it behind her you never did i dont care that you dont care but you owe me forget the shower shed just pack bill me i need help megan why cant you ever just help me out without being so bitchy about it i inherited the bitch from you not my fault she ripped open a drawer and dragged whatever was in it out tossed it on the bed i built something here you benefited from that i dont give a rats ugly ass about your money im not talking about money charlene grabbed clothes from the bed and hurled them into the air im talking about this place it means something you never cared you couldnt wait to get away from it and from me but it means something weve been written up in the paper in magazines in tour guides i got people working here who depend on their paycheck to put food on their table and clothes on their kids backs ive got customers who come in here every damn night because it means something youve got megan agreed its nothing to do with me thats what he always said too enraged she kicked at a pair of jeans on the floor you look like him you sound like him thats not my fault either nothing was ever his fault bad run of luck playing poker gee guess theres no money this week need a little space charley you know how it goes ill be back in a couple of days somethingll turn up stop nagging at me somebody had to pay the bills didnt they charlene demanded somebody had to pay for medicine when you got sick or come up with the cash to get you shoes he could bring me all the wildflowers he could pick in the summer or write me pretty songs and poems but they didnt put food on the table i put food on my table i buy my own shoes but shed calmed a little im not saying you didnt work you did plenty of scheming on top of it but its your life you got what you wanted i wanted him goddamn it i wanted him so did i so we both lost out there nothing we can do about it shed come back for her things meg thought right now she just needed out she walked to the door hesitated i called boston talked to his mother shes she wont block you from claiming his body from burying him here you called her yeah its done she opened the door meg megan please wait a minute charlene sat on the side of the bed clothes strewn on the floor around her thank you hell oh hell it was just a phone call it matters charlene gripped her hands together in her lap and stared at them it matters so much to me i was so mad at you for going to anchorage to to see him for cutting me out meg closed the door leaned back against it thats not what i was doing i wasnt a good mother i wanted to be at first tried to be but there was always so much to do i didnt know thered be so much to do you were pretty young too young i guess he wanted more she looked up then shrugged he just loved you to pieces and he wanted more kids i wouldnt let it happen i just didnt want to go through it all again getting fat and tired going through that pain then having all that to do and the money that was never there when you needed it or just wanted it he pushed for it and i pushed back with other things until it seemed we spent half the time pushing each other and i was jealous because he doted on you and i was always the outsider always the one saying no i guess somebody had to i dont know if wed have made it if hed come back i dont know if wed have stuck it out we started wanting such different things but i know if wed split i know hed have taken you as if to keep her hands busy she smoothed the bedspread on either side of her hed have taken you she repeated idve let him you should know that he loved you more than i could it was hard harder than anything she could remember to walk to the bed and sit enough to scrape the money together to buy me shoes maybe not but enough to take you camping so you could look at the stars enough to sit at the fire and tell you stories i like to think youd have made it if hed come back charlene looked over blinked really yeah i like to think youd have found a way to make it work youd already stuck together a long time longer than a lot of people do i want to ask you something this seems like the time was there a big hot blast the first time you met him when you fell for him oh god yes nearly burned me up and it never stopped id think it was dead cold and dead when i got mad enough or tired enough but then hed look at me and it was back i never had that with anyone else i keep waiting for it but i never get it maybe you should be looking for something else this time somebody told me recently about the benefits of a good steady warmth she rose picked up scattered clothes i cant go back down there and work tonight okay ill work breakfast for you but i need you to get somebody else to cover for rose ive got to get back to my place my life charlene nodded pushed to her feet you gonna take the sexy cop with you up to him she packed up tidied the room meg considered leaving nate a note but decided that was a little too rude a little too wrong even for her didnt have her car anyway she remembered not that she was above borrowing his or someone elses and telling them about it later in the end she slung her knapsack over her shoulder and hoofed it to the station after a detour by the italian place hed said hed be working late covering the desk whatever since his car was locked she debated briefly she could dig out her handy set of keys probably find one that would work but he wouldnt appreciate it if hed set the car alarm which being city bred he might have done she carried her pack and the large pizza into the station awfully damn quiet was her first thought how did the man work without music she tossed her pack aside started to call out but he appeared in the doorway if she hadnt been looking she wouldnt have seen the way his hand rested on the butt of his holstered weapon or the way it drifted away is when he smiled at her i smell food and woman gets my caveman instinct going pizza pepperoni figured you could use something hot which includes me about this time thats a big affirmative to both whats the knapsack for she hadnt seen him look at it im running away want to come with fight with charlene yes but thats not why we sort of made up actually i just have to get the hell out of here burke too many people for too long gets me edgy i thought pizza then some sex back in my place would scratch that itch before i hurt someone and you had to arrest me thats a plan i was going to just go but i didnt i want the points for doing it this way scoreboards adjusted why dont you bring that back ill dig up something to wash it down with got that she dug onehanded into her duffel pulled out a bottle of red liberated it from the bar at the lodge well have to drink it all to dispose of the evidence she passed him the bottle as she walked past him then turned into his office and set the pizza on his desk hed closed his files both hard copy and computer and had tossed the blanket over the board when he heard the outer door open napkins she asked it wasnt gentlemanly but he couldnt leave her alone in the office under peachs counter he pulled out his swiss army knife levered out the corkscrew never actually used this one before lot of damn work but hey he muscled out the cork as she came back in success she tossed down the napkins got two mugs from beside his coffeemaker whats this she tugged the side edge of the blanket with a finger dont at her look of surprise he shook his head just dont lets eat they sat divvied up wine and pizza why are you working so late and alone are you killing time until i finish my moonlighting for the night thats one part but tell me what did you fight with charlene about youre changing the subject yes i am her being demanding me being ungrateful and so on and so forth then we came around to my father and other things and some of it made sense to me enough for me to be able to admit he wasnt the easiest guy to be with as a partner and that she in her own strange and annoying way probably did the best she could that we both loved him more than we can love each other she poured more wine deliberately picked up a second slice of pizza though her stomach had gone knotty under that blankets about my father isnt it ive seen enough cop movies enough cop tv burke to know you people stick up photographs and reports and what have you when youre investigating im not investigating anything officially yes it has to do with your father and i want you to leave that blanket where it is i told you before im not delicate and im telling you now there are some things i dont share wont ever she was silent studying her pizza that the sort of statement that had your wife doing another man no he said evenly she couldnt have cared less about my work she closed her eyes a moment then made herself open them and meet his that was a cheap shot im not above a cheap shot she tossed the pizza down i dont like myself very much tonight thats why i have to get out get away get back to who i am when i like me but you came here first to bring me pizza and wine youve got a little hook in me somewhere i dont know if its going to stick but its there for now i love you megan oh jesus dont say that now she sprang up pulling at her hair as she paced when im in this pissy bitching mood do you look to be kicked in the face by women ignatious are you just itching for somebody else to smack your heart around it was that big blast for me he went on calmly it took a big blast to break through id guess since ive been pretty busy wallowing for the last year most of the time lately it banks down to a nice simmer easier to live with the simmer than the blast now and then it kicks up again though goes right through me like a fireball she stopped dropped down again because her knotty stomach was busy doing flips god help you yeah i thought the same myself but i do love you and its different than it was with rachel i had all this stuff planned out then a nice steady sensible normal kind of step and stage and youre not looking for sensible and normal with me be a waste of time dont give me that youve got home and hearth tattooed on your butt do not youre the one with the tattoo which i find incredibly erotic by the way maybe when you decide youre in love with me we can think about what happens next but for now when i decide yeah when im patient meg and relentless in my way im starting to get my edge back its been blunted a long time but its coming back youll just have to deal with that interesting a little scarier than i expected but interesting and its because i love you and i trust you that im going to show you this he opened the file on his desk taking the copied pages of patrick galloways journal he handed them to her he saw the instant she recognized the handwriting the way her body went stiff and still the quick almost inaudible drawing in of breath her gaze flicked up to his once briefly then riveted on the pages in her hand she said nothing as she read them she didnt weep or rage or tremble as another woman might have done instead she picked up her wine again sipped slowly and read the pages straight through where did these come from theyre copies from the pages out of a notebook he had inside his parka coben gave them to me how long ago few days there was a little burn in the center of her belly and you didnt tell me you didnt show me no because i needed to evaluate and you needed to settle is that part of your edge chief making unilateral decisions its part of my professional responsibilities and my personal feelings you cant discuss this with anyone until i determine otherwise youve shown them to me now because in your professional opinion youve evaluated and ive settled something like that she closed her eyes you take care dont you professionally personally its pretty much the same to you the caring he said nothing and she opened her eyes no point in tossing a bunch of bullshit out at you when you did what you thought was right probably was right knowing it wouldnt go down easy now she set the wine aside what does coben think its more what his superiors think at this point the theory is max killed galloway then killed the third man when your fathers body was discovered fear of discovery and remorse drove him to suicide thats how theyll write it up close it down whatever the copspeak for it is i think so yes poor carrie she leaned forward laid the pages back on his desk poor max he never killed patrick galloway no nate said and closed the file again he didnt twentyone they packed into town hall for max hawbakers memorial it was the only place big enough to hold the crowd it was interesting to nate how many showed up in work clothes or sunday clothes in alaskan tuxedos or bunny boots they came because hed been one of them and his wife and kids still were they came nate thought whether they thought he was a smalltown hero or a murderer and many did believe the latter nate saw it in their eyes or heard it in snatches of conversation he let it go max was eulogized with warmth and with humor and the name patrick galloway was carefully omitted from any public statement then it was done some went back to work and some went to carries for what he always thought of as the postfuneral replay nate went back to work charlene ambushed meg as she offloaded supplies from her plane she grabbed her arm tugged her away from jacob i need to see him who you know who i want you to fly me into anchorage to the funeral home thats holding his body till spring i have a right meg studied charlenes face well i cant its too late to fly to anchorage today and ive got jobs booked iditarods under way people want to fly over the route get pictures ive got a right what brought this on just because we didnt get married doesnt mean i wasnt his wife his true wife just the same as carrie was to max oh shit meg paced out two tight circles you know i thought you showed a lot of class going to the memorial looking carrie right in the eye and giving her your condolences and here you are working up a mad because she got all that attention thats not it or only part of it charlene admitted i want to see him and i will if you wont take me ill call jerk in talkeetna pay him to fly me down youve been stewing about this since maxs memorial havent you just stewing and churning it around since then whats the point charlene youve seen him score one for me how do i know hes gone how do i know its him unless i see for myself the way carrie got to see max i cant take you youd make me go with a stranger meg looked back at the river thered been some overflow cracks and gaps in the shifting ice that had the water below welling up freezing thin dangerous business because the new ice looked just like the rest and would break under you and take you down what you thought was safe would kill you there were handwritten warning signs nates doing she knew he was a man who understood all about thin ice and the dangers of what looked safe and normal would you settle for a picture a photograph what do you mean she turned back if i brought you a picture of him would that do it if you can go down and take his picture why i dont have to nate has pictures i can get one bring it to you now no not now she yanked off her cap drove her fingers through her hair he wouldnt like it evidence or something but ill get it tonight you can look at it satisfy yourself and ill take it back outside the station meg flipped through her keys and found the one marked pd shed left nate sleeping and hoped he stayed that way until she got back she didnt want to explain this little bit of insanity to him she let herself in pulled out her penlight part of her wanted to poke around and enjoy the sensation of being somewhere she shouldnt but more she wanted to get this little chore over with and get back to bed she went straight into nates office here she risked the overhead lights flipping them on before crossing to the covered corkboard she removed the blanket carefully and it fell to the floor from her numb hands as she took one wavering step in retreat shed seen death before and had never known it to be pretty but those stark and graphic photos of max hawbaker had her breath whistling out best not to think about it not quite yet better to take the photo of her father how much cleaner his death seemed and take it to charlene she slid the photo inside her jacket turned the lights off and went back out the way she came charlene was in her room answered the door wearing a floral robe there was a scent of whiskey smoke perfume youd better be alone meg said i am i sent him on where is it did you get it youre going to look then im taking it back and i dont want to hear any more about this let me see let me see him meg drew it out no you cant touch it you wrinkle it up or anything nate will know she turned the photo face front oh oh charlene stumbled back much as meg had at the corkboard god no she shot a hand out to stop meg from putting the picture away again i need to she stepped forward again and at megs warning look clasped her hands behind her back he he looks the same how can that be he looks the same all these years and he looks the same he never had a chance to look different it wouldve been quick do you think would it have been quick yes he was wearing that parka when he left he was wearing it the last time i saw him she turned cupped her elbows with her hands go away now she shuddered then pressed both hands to her mouth meg she began and spun around but meg was already gone alone charlene walked into the bath turned on the lights and studied herself in the hard glare hed looked the same she thought again so young and she didnt she never would again it was march in alaska but the longer days didnt make him think of approaching spring however close the calendar crept toward the official day nate awoke to daylight now and most often on the left side of megs bed when he walked through town he saw more of peoples faces and less of sheltering hoods the plastic eggs hanging from the branches of snowdraped trees the plastic bunnies crouched on white carpets of lawn didnt make him think spring either but his first breakup did he watched with a kind of buzzy wonder the little cracks creeping along the icy ribbon of river like crazed zippers unlike the overflow these didnt fill in and freeze up it astonished him so much that it took him twenty minutes to stop staring and head back to the office there are cracks in the river he told otto yeah little early for breakup but weve had a warm spell maybe nate thought if he lived in lunacy for oh a hundred years hed think of a few days of forties and damp chilly lower fifties as a warm spell i want signs posted i dont want a bunch of kids playing hockey falling through the ice kids got more sense than to i want signs posted like we did for overflow but more so check at the corner store see if theyve got any more sign board either peach or peter needs to write them ah no skating thin ice its not so much thin as otto just go get me a half dozen signs he grumbled but he went and nate noticed peachs lips were folded tight on a smile she was trying to suppress what nothing not a thing i think its a fine idea shows weve got concern for our citizenship and order but i think you could just write breakup and steer clear write whatever you think best just write it he started through the station to head out the back and find what he could use for stakes and dont let otto write it when he was satisfied the signs were under way he wrote and printed fliers off his computer and set out to distribute them he pinned them up in the post office the bank the school worked his way to the lodge there bing came over and read behind his shoulder and snorted saying nothing nate read his own words breakup in progress no skating walking or other activities will be permitted on the river by order of the lunacy police department i spell something wrong bing nope just wonder who you thinks stupid enough to go skating around on the river during breakup same sort of person who jumps off a roof to see if he can fly after hes read a couple superman comics how long does breakup take depends doesnt it winter started early now springs doing the same thing so well just see river breaks up every frigging year so does the lake nothing new a kid goes out there fooling around falls through the ice we could be going to another memorial bing pursed his lips thoughtfully as nate walked out again he still had fliers in his hand when he saw movement behind the display window of the lunatic he crossed over found the door was locked knocked carrie studied him through the glass a minute then opened up carrie id like to post one of these in your window here she took it read it then walked to her desk to get tape ill put it up for you appreciate it he glanced around you here alone yes hed interviewed her twice since the memorial and each time her thoughts and answers had been scattered and vague hed tried to give k her time but time was passing have you been able to remember any i more details from that february i tried to think about it write things down like you said at home she taped the flier faceout on the glass i couldnt do it there i couldnt seem to do it at my parents when i took the kids down for a couple weeks i dont know why i just couldnt get the thoughts out or the words down so i came here i thought maybe thats fine i wasnt sure i could come here i know hopp and some of the other women came in and cleaned up after when they were allowed to but i wasnt sure i could come back here its hard hed gone back to the alley forced himself to go back and all hed felt was numb despair i had to come back there hasnt been a paper since its been too long max worked so hard and this meant so much to him she turned around drawing careful breaths as she looked around the room doesnt look like anything really doesnt even look like a real paper max and i went to anchorage fairbanks even juneau to tour a real paper real newsrooms his eyes would just light up doesnt look like much here but he was proud of it i dont agree with you i think it looks like a lot she struggled to smile nodded briskly im going to keep it going thats something i decided today just today before you came in i thought id let it go that i just couldnt do this without him but when i came back here today i knew i had to keep it going im going to put an edition together see if the professors got time to help me maybe knows a couple of kids who want to work get some journalist experience thats good carrie im glad to hear it ill write something down for you nate i promise ill think back and ill try to remember i know you wanted to go through his papers and such i havent been back there yet she didnt have to look at the back office for nate to know she meant the room where max had been found you can if you want the state cops had been through that room nate thought he still wanted his pass at it but not now not when anyone walking by would see he was inside and wonder why ill come back for that he kept an office at home a little one i havent been through his things i keep putting it off anybody at your place now no kids are in school is it all right with you if i go in now look around if i need to take anything ill write you up a receipt you go ahead she went to her purse fished out keys and took one off a ring this is to the back door you keep it as long as you need it he didnt want to park in front of the hawbaker house too many people talked about something just that small instead he parked by a bend in the river he didnt notice any cracks in the ice and wondered if hed jumped the gun on the ones in town he hiked the back way through a patch of woods colder here he thought colder under the trees where the sun couldnt fight through there were tracks snowmobile skis crosscountry team he decided from the high school he spotted other tracks that werent human and hoped he wasnt going to come facetoface with the moose hed run off he didnt know enough about them to be sure they didnt hold grudges the snow was deeper than hed anticipated and made him curse himself for not slapping on his snowshoes so he did what he could to use the tracks he saw a streak he thought might be a fox and when he stopped to catch his breath spotted a herd of shaggycoated deer they trudged along no more than fifteen feet to his north he could only assume he was downwind as they didnt so much as give him a glance so he stood watching them until they wound their way out of sight he worked his way to carries back door past what he assumed was a garden or toolshed around the building on stilts that would be their cache someone had cleared the back stoop and there was a stack of firewood covered with a tarp by the door he used the key and stepped inside a combination mudroom and laundry area since his boots were wet and caked with snow he took them off leaving them and his coat the kitchen was clean almost to a gleam maybe thats what women did or some women when they were coping with grief they got out the cleanser and the mop and the polishing cloth he thought as he continued through the house the vacuum cleaner there wasnt a speck of dust to be found nor any of the usual clutter of living maybe that was the point she wasnt ready to live again yet he went up identified the kids room by the posters on the walls the disorder on the floor for now at least he bypassed the master bedroom where the bed was carefully made and a patchwork throw was draped over the back of a chair did she sleep there now unwilling unable to lie down on the bed shed shared with her husband beside the bedroom was maxs office and here was the clutter the dust and debris of normal living the desk chair had a strip of duct tape along one of the seams the everymans repair job the desk itself was scarred and battered an obvious second or thirdhand purchase but the computer on it looked new or very well tended there was a desk calendar one of those cubes that followed a theme and gave you a picture and a saying each day maxs was a fishing theme and it had a cartoon man holding up a minnowsized fish and claiming it was bigger when hed hooked it the date was january nineteenth max hadnt made it back home to rip it off to reveal the next days joke there was no message written on it no handy clue such as meet at midnight nate bent to go through the trash can under the desk he found several other pages of the cube some with notes iditarod artpov dog bathroom tap dripping carrie pissed fix and the one from the day before his death the one covered with scribbles of one word pat nate took it out placed it on the desk he found several envelopes indicating max had sat there paying bills on one of the days shortly before he died a couple of candy wrappers he went through the desk drawers found a checkbook on the balance after the billpaying stint two days before he died three passbooks for savings accounts one for each of his children one joint for him and his wife he and carrie had a nest egg there were envelopes return address labels rubber bands paper clips a box of staples nothing out of the ordinary in the bottom drawer he found four chapters of a manuscript the top page indentified it as cold snap a novel by maxwell t hawbaker nate put it on the desk and got up to search the shelf unit running along one wall to his pile nate added a box of floppy disks and a scrapbook holding newspaper articles then he sat down to test his computer skills it wasnt passwordprotected which told him max hadnt thought he had anything to hide a run through the documents netted him a spreadsheet on which max had carefully listed mortgage and time payments family man nate thought responsible with his money nothing he could find on finances showed any large sums anything out of the ordinary if max had been blackmailing his killer he hadnt recorded the income alongside his monthly debits he found more of the novel and the start of two more a check through the floppies showed that max had conscientiously backed them up there were a few bookmarked sites fishing for the most part he found some saved email fishing buddies responses from a couple of people regarding sled dogs followups nate assumed on the planned iditarod article he spent an hour threading through but nothing jumped out and yelled clue gathering up what he had he carted it down to the mudroom where he confiscated an empty box to dump it all into he wandered back into the kitchen the kitchen calendar had a bird theme no one had thought or bothered to turn it over to february much less march more than half the little squares had notes pta meeting hockey practice book report due dentist appointment normal family routine the dentist appointment had been maxs nate noted and hed been due for it two days after his death he flipped it up glanced over february at march a lot of notes there too with gone fishing in large capital letters over the second weekend in march nate let the page fall again routine normal ordinary but there was that single calendar page from the trash can upstairs covered with the name pat four pairs of snowshoes hung in the mudroom studying them he put on his boots his coat hefted the box and started out again he was back in the woods again up to midshin in snow when the gunshot blasted through the quiet instinctively he dropped the box dug under the coat for his own weapon even as he gripped it there was a thunder in the woods a single deer a thickbodied heavily antlered buck leaped into view and continued its leaping gallop with his heart thudding nate started moving in the direction it had come from hed made it about twenty yards when he saw the figure melt out of the trees and the long gun it carried they stood for a moment in the echoing stillness each with a weapon in his hand then the figure lifted his left hand shoved back his hood he scented you jacob said spooked and ran even as i fired so i missed missed nate repeated id hoped to take some venison to rose david hasnt been able to hunt lately he lowered his gaze slow and deliberate to nates sidearm do you hunt chief burke no but when i hear a gunshot i dont go looking for who fired it unarmed jacob made an obvious business of clicking on the safety you found him and i go home without meat sorry it was the deers day not mine do you know your way out i can find it well then jacob nodded turned and moving with grace and ease in his snowshoes melted back into the trees nate kept his weapon out as he walked back as he picked up the box hed dropped he didnt holster it again until he was back in his car he drove to megs to push the box into the back of a closet it was something he had to pursue on his own time since his pants were wet to the knees he changed then went down to the lake with the dogs to check for any sign of breakup before he drove back into town signs are up otto told him so i see weve gotten two complaints already about minding our own business anybody i need to talk to nope you got two calls chief from reporters peach tapped the pink while you were out notes on her counter about pat galloway and max followup they said they have to catch me first peter still on patrol we sent him out for lunch it was his turn otto scratched his chin ordered you an italian sub thats fine thanks would a man go hunting two three miles from his own place when hes got acres of hunting ground where he lives depends wouldnt it on what what he was hunting for one yeah i guess it would depend on that the cracks in the river lengthened and widened as the temperatures held above freezing from the banks nate saw his first sight of the cold deep blue shimmer between the gleam of white fascinated he watched it spread and heard what sounded like artillery fire or the crashing fist of god plates of ice heaved up swamped and surrounded by that blue then floated placidly like a newborn island something almost religious about your first breakup hopp commented as she walked up beside him my first breakup was with pixie newburry and it was more traumatic than religious hopp stood in silence as ice crackled and boomed pixie yeah she had these big almondshaped eyes so everybody called her pixie she dumped me for this kid whose father had a boat it was the first wave in a sea of broken hearts for me sounds shallow to me you were better off without her didnt seem like it at twelve i didnt think this would happen so fast once nature decides to move theres no stopping her and you can bet shell slap us back with a few more licks of winter before shes done but breakups a time for celebration around here were having an informal breakup party at the lodge tonight youll want to put in an appearance okay youve been spending more time at megs than the lodge sleeping arrangement wise she smiled when he merely looked at her its been mentioned here and there is my choice of sleeping arrangements a problem officialwise no indeed she cupped her hand around a cigarette used a thick silver zippo to light it and on a personal front id estimate that meg galloways no pixie newburry its been mentioned too here and there that there are lights on at megs pretty late at night maybe we have insomnia she was the mayor nate reminded himself and galloways journal hadnt referred to a woman on the mountain im spending some of my off time on the galloway matter i see she stared out at the river as the blue and the white battled most people go fishing read a juicy book or watch tv on their off time cops arent most people you do what pleases you ignatious i know charlenes planning to bring pat back here soon as shes able and bury him wants a fullfledged funeral the ground ought to be thawed enough soon to manage it by june unless we get another long freeze she drew in smoke sighed it out again part of me wishes that would be that the dead are buried and the living have to live its hard on carrie i know but you keeping this going wont bring her husband back i dont believe he killed galloway and i dont believe he killed himself her face stayed perfectly still her eyes stayed on the busy river thats not what i want to hear gods pity on carrie but thats not what i want to hear nobody wants to hear they may be living next door to someone whos killed twice she shuddered now once and violently and drew on the cigarette she puffed at it hard expelling smoke in bursts i know the people who live next door to me and a mile away and three miles from that i know them by face and name and habits i dont know a murderer ignatious you knew max oh god you climbed with galloway her eyes sharpened now and focused on his face is this an interrogation no just a comment she breathed in and out while the ice cracked yes i did my man and i did i enjoyed it too the challenge of it the thrill of it in my younger days bo and i settled for hiking a night of camping in good weather the last few years he was alive that bo was alive she said whod he trust most when he was on the mountain who did galloway trust up there himself thatd be the first rule of climbing youd better trust yourself first and last your husband was mayor back then it was more honorary than official in those days even so he knew the people around here paid attention i bet you did too and if you put your mind to it thought back to february of you might remember who besides galloway wasnt in lunacy who was away for a week or more she tossed the cigarette down where it sizzled against the snow then she kicked snow over it to bury it from view youre giving a lot of credit to my memory ignatious ill think about it good if you remember anything come to me just me hopp springs coming hopp said and spring can be a bitch she walked away leaving him by the river he stood in the chilly wind watching that river come back to life twentytwo it wasnt just river ice that cracked and heaved during breakup streets frozen through the long winter burst with fissures the size of canyons and potholes wide enough to swallow a truck it didnt surprise nate that bing had the contract for road repair and maintenance what did surprise him was that no one seemed to give much of a damn that the repair and maintenance moved at the pace of a lame snail he had other things to worry about people he discovered cracked too some who had held onto their sanity through the dark relentless winter appeared to think the tease of spring was a good time to let it go his cells were revolving doors for the drunk the disorderly the domestic disturbances and the just plain dopey the sound of horns tooting and catcalls brought him to the bedroom window just after dawn a light snow had fallen during the night hardly more than a dusting that lay thin and sparkling on the streets and sidewalks under the rising sun the lights on the barricades around the twofoot pothole hed named lunatic crater blinked red and yellow around those blinking lights he saw a man dancing what appeared to be a jig that might have been surprising enough for sunrise entertainment but the fact that the man was buckassed naked added a certain panache a crowd was gathering already some were clapping maybe keeping time nate speculated others were shouting encouragement or derision in equal measures with a sigh nate toweled off his halfshaven face grabbed a shirt and shoes and headed down the dining room was deserted with a few plates of halfeaten breakfast as testament to the draw of a naked guy dancing on lunatic street nate grabbed a jacket off a hook and walked out in his shirtsleeves there were whistles and stomping feet and a dawn temperature nate judged hadnt quite come up to the freezing mark as yet he nudged his way through the gathered crowd he recognized the dancer now tobias simpsky parttime clerk at the corner store parttime dishwasher at the lodge parttime disc jockey at lunacy radio hed changed the jig to some kind of westernmovie indian war dance chief rose with jesses hand in hers and the baby snuggled in a pack at her breast smiled serenely nice morning right is today some particular event a pagan ritual i mightve missed hearing about no just wednesday okay he passed through the onlookers hey toby forget your hat this morning still dancing toby tossed back his long brown hair and threw out his arms clothes are only a symbol of mans denial of nature of his acceptance of restrictions and loss of innocence today i merge with nature today i embrace my innocence i am man just barely someone called out giving the crowd a good laugh why dont we go talk about that nate took his arm and managed to flap the jacket over his hips man is a child and a child comes naked into the world ive heard that shows over nate called out he tried to arrange the jacket while guiding toby across the street the man had grapefruitsized goose bumps on every inch of exposed skin nothing much to see here anyway he muttered under his breath i drink only water toby told him i eat only what i gather with my own hands got it no coffee and doughnuts for you if we dont dance the dark will come back and the cold winter the snow he looked around wildly now its everywhere its everywhere i know he got him inside into a cell figuring ken was the closest he had to a shrink he contacted him to request a house call in the next cell drunk mike snored away sleeping off a toot that had had him wandering into a neighbor s house instead of his own the night before including drunk mike hed had six calls between eleven and two slashed tires on hawleys truck a portable radio turned up to full blast and left on sarrie parkers doorstep broken windows at the school more yellow graffiti on tim bowers new skidoo and on charlenes ford bronco apparently even the thought of spring stirred up the natives he was thinking about coffee about his missed breakfast about what drove a man to dancing naked on a snowy street when bing came slamming in he was big as a tank and looked ready to commit murder found these in my gear he slapped two fishing rods onto the counter then jabbed the auger which looked like a curly sword before slamming it down as well i aint no thief and you better find out who stowed them there so id look like one would these belong to ed woolcott got his name engraved on the damn rods doesnt he just like that prissy gnatass to have his name plated on overpriced fishing rods im telling you right now im not having him say i took them clean his clock good and proper if he does where did you find them he worked his hands into fists you try to say i took em ill clean your clock too i didnt say you took them i asked where you found them in my shack went out last night gonna tow my shack in for the season found them then mulled over what to do about it and this is what im doing he jabbed a finger at nate now you do what youre supposed to do whens the last time you were in your shack before last night been busy havent i couple of weeks maybe if theyd been there id have spotted them right off just like i did i dont use that prissyassed gear why dont you come back to my office bing and sit down he readied meatslab fists again bared his teeth what for youre going to make an official statement details like if you noticed if anything else was disturbed added or subtracted if your shack was locked who might want to get your nonprissy ass in hot water bing scowled youre gonna have to take my word on it thats right bing jutted his bearded chin all right then but its gonna have to be quick i got work to do dont i well make it quick you get that crater fixed on lunatic before it swallows a family of five since bing was a man of few words the statement took under ten minutes do you and ed have a history i should know about i put my money in his bank take it out as i need it you two socialize bings answer was a snort i dont get invites to dinner at his place and wouldnt go if i did whys that his wife a lousy cook likes to put on airs both of them like they were better than the rest of us hes an asshole but sos better than half the worlds population he shrugged his massive shoulders it was like watching a mountain stretch i got nothing against him particularly can you think of anyone whod have something against you enough to want to cause you trouble i mind my own and expect people to do the same anybodys got a problem with that ill clean their clock nate finished ill see ed gets his property back appreciate you bringing it in bing sat another moment drumming his thick fingers against his wide thighs i dont hold with stealing me either dont see why youre so fired up to lock up a man whos had a few drinks or punches somebody who gets in his face but a thiefs different nate believed he spoke his own truth thered been violence on bings record but no theft and somebody took my buck knife and my spare gloves out of my rig nate pulled up another form give me a description its a goddamn buck knife he hissed through his teeth when nate simply waited got a fiveinch blade closedlock back wood handle hunting knife and the gloves nate prompted as he keyed in the description work gloves for christs sake cowhide fleece lining black when did you notice them missing last week and youre reporting it now because bing didnt speak for a minute then moved those mountainous shoulders again maybe youre not a complete asshole im touched let me blink these sentimental tears out of my eyes you lock your rig no nobodys been stupid enough to mess with my stuff always a first time nate said when he was alone and waiting for the town doctor to come give toby some sort of psych eval nate studied the reports on his desk a decent stack of reports he thought maybe not the sort of load hed been accustomed to in baltimore but a definite stack with petty theft and petty vandalism leading the pack enough so he mused that hed been kept busy the last couple of weeks so busy hed had little time to spare for his unofficial investigation maybe it wasnt coincidence maybe it wasnt some cosmic reminder that he wasnt homicide any longer maybe somebody was nervous he called ed in and watched the mans face light up when he saw the rods and auger i take it those are yours they sure are id given up on them certain theyd made their way to some pawnshop in anchorage good work chief burke youve made an arrest theres no arrest bing found them mixed in with his gear in his ice shack last night he brought them in to me first thing this morning but is there any reason you can think of why bing would have broken into your shack defaced it taken those then brought them in to me today no ed stroked a hand over each rod in turn no i guess not but the fact remains he had them the only facts are he found them and returned them do you want to pursue this ed blew out a breath stood for a moment with his face reflecting a man struggling with some inner war well i honestly cant see why bing wouldve taken them much less turned them in if he had i have them back and thats the important thing but it doesnt address the vandalism or the theft of nearly a full quart of scotch ill keep the case open good good then he nodded toward the window to beyond where ice floes floated on the deep dark blue you survived your first winter looks like there are some who dont expect you to put yourself through the experience a second time ive wondered myself if you plan to go back to the lower after your contract i suppose that depends on whether or not the town council offers to renew my contract i havent heard any complaints well nothing major in any case he picked up the rods the auger i should get these stowed i need you to sign for them nate nudged a form across his desk lets keep it official oh absolutely he looped his signature on the proper lines thank you chief im glad to have my property back nate noticed him glance at the draped blanket as he had twice before but there were no questions or comments about it nate rose to shut the door himself then he walked to the board uncovered it on a list of names he penciled a line connecting bing to ed and added a question mark the clouds rolled back in by afternoon and through them nate spotted the red slash of megs plane he was on his way back from investigating a call reporting a dead body by the stream in rancor woods it turned out to be an old pair of boots stuck in the snow which the holidaying birdwatchers renting the cabin had spotted through their field glasses tourists nate thought as he tossed the boots likely abandoned by other tourists in the back of his car then he heard the familiar thunder of the bush plane and watched meg slide out of the clouds by the time he got to the skinny dock on the river shed already landed the floats on her plane were another sign of spring he thought he walked over feeling the dock sway under him while she and jacob unloaded the supplies hey cutie she dropped a box on the dock and made it shudder saw you out by rancor woods my heart went pittypat didnt it jacob he chuckled under his breath and carried a large box down the dock to his truck bought you a present yeah give it up she reached into another box pushed the contents around and pulled out a box of condoms thought you might be shy about buying your supply at the corner store whereas i wouldnt be shy about having you wave them around on a public dock he grabbed them out of her hand stuffed them in his jacket pocket i got you three boxes but ill keep the other two in a safe place she winked then bent to pick up a carton he lifted it first ill carry it careful with it its an antique tea set joannas grandmother wanted her to have it for her thirtieth birthday she hauled out another box walked with him what are you doing hanging around the docks chief looking for loose women found one didnt i she laughed gave him a little elbow jab well see if you can make me looser later its movie night movie nights saturday no they moved it remember conflict with the high school spring fling right right ive got a couple of dresses in this load for that whats the movie double feature vertigo and rear window ill bring the popcorn she loaded the box in the truck studied him as he loaded his you look tired chief a lot of people seem to have spring fever its keeping me busy busy enough i havent been able to give certain areas as much time or attention as id like youre not just talking about my naked body she looked back to her plane where jacob was getting the last of the cargo my fathers been dead for sixteen years times relative i want to close this down for you for him for myself too she twined a lock of his hair around her finger hed let her trim it for him a sign she thought of a courageous man or one loopily in love tell you what lets take the night off from all of it just go to the movies eat popcorn and fool around ive got more questions than i have answers im going to have to ask you some of them you may not like them then lets definitely take the night off weve got to deliver this stuff ill see you later she hopped in the cab of the truck and sent nate a quick wave as jacob pulled out but she watched him in the sideview mirror until theyd turned he looks worried jacob commented his kind always worries why do i find that so attractive hed like to shield you no one else ever did he smiled a little when she turned to stare at him i taught you listened to you cared for you but i never shielded you i dont need to be shielded or want to be no but knowing he would attracts you maybe maybe shed have to think about that one but his wants and mine are bound to ram headlong into each other before long then what that depends on which ones still standing after the collision with a half laugh she stretched out her legs he doesnt stand a chance shed hoped to have time to get home clean herself up polish herself up and set the stage for a night of marathon sex it was a way to keep things interesting and basic and she admitted thoughtless but she believed it wouldnt hurt him to be thoughtless for a little while he thought entirely too much and it was contagious but she didnt have time not after delivering all the cargo collecting her fees she had to settle for popping the corn in the lodges kitchen while big mike serenaded her with show tunes it wasnt a hardship to listen to big mike sing as he worked she caught up on the news as rose passed in and out of the kitchen and she cooed over pictures of willow and new shots of big mikes toddler it was she thought almost like being home in the warmth of the active kitchen listening to chatter and music and there was the added benefit of being able to pilfer a slice of big mikes applesauce cake got yourself a movie date big mike said between tunes romantic meg ate the cake with her hands standing beside the stove could be unless he hogs the popcorn got little stars in your eyes little stars and hearts uhuh she managed with her mouth full sure do him too he made kissy noises an odd sound meg thought with a laugh coming out of a buff bald black man i got them in my eyes the first time i saw my julia still do so here you are baking great applesauce cake for a bunch of sourdoughs i like baking cake he plated fried fish red potatoes and frenchcut green beans but for julia and my little princess annie id do just about anything this is a good place to live a good place to work but if you got love any place is he segued from show tunes to the beatles all you need is love while meg polished off the cake and rose came in for orders it was a good place to live meg mused as she filled a paper bag with the popcorn shook it to distribute butter and salt she was just going to have to figure out what to do about the love she walked over to town hall in a chilly damp that promised rain nate was late which surprised her he hustled in just as the lights dimmed sorry had a call porcupine tell you later he tried to settle into the movie to the mood to the moment but his thoughts kept circling around hed connected ed and bing on his board that morning drawn together by stolen fishing gear something that had all the earmarks of a prank or a kids adventure there were dozens of other connections linking person to person they were all around him sitting in the dark watching jimmy stewart play a cop after a breakdown been there done that nate mused stewart would spiral down too hed suffer and hed sweat his way into an obsession and hed get the girl lose the girl get the girl lose the girl a merrygoround of pain and pleasure the girl was the key was meg as patrick galloways only child wasnt she the living symbol of him if not the key another link how long are you going to circle before you land what looks like a holding pattern to me meg angled her head and he realized the lights were back on for intermission between the features sorry zoned out ill say you didnt get close to your share of the popcorn she rolled up the bag left it on the seat lets get some air before the second feature they had to take it in the open doorway like most of the movie crowd the clouds that had rolled in had burst open sometime during kim novaks transformation the rain meg had scented gushed out of the sky pummelled the ground well have some flooding meg said frowned through the clouds of smoke from those brave and drenched souls who stood just outside with cigarettes cupped in umbrellaed palms and black ice on the roads when the temperature drops a little more if you want to get home now ill take you ill need to come back keep an eye on this no ill stay for the second feature see how it goes just as easy turn to snow again let me check on a couple of things ill meet you back inside theres a cop for you ever vigilant she saw his face change rolled her eyes not a complaint burke jesus im not going to whine and go pouty if i end up watching a movie by myself and i can get myself home if i need to i can even handle the rest of tonights planned entertainment on my own if youre not around to service me i have fresh batteries you look at me and see her its going to piss me off he started to say he hadnt but she was already walking away and it wouldve been a lie anyway conditioned response he thought and tried to roll the weight of it off his shoulders still carrying it he picked peter hopp bing the professor out of the crowd he spent intermission and a little beyond it coordinating and confirming procedure for flooding by the time he rejoined meg grace kelly was trying to convince jimmy stewart to pay more attention to her than the people in the apartment he could see from his rear window he took megs hand linked fingers knee jerk he murmured in her ear sorry leave off the knee and youve got it right but she turned her head brushed her lips over his watch the movie this time he did or tried to but just as raymond burr caught grace kelly snooping around his apartment the door banged open behind them light ran in behind otto causing most of the audience to boo and shout at him to close the damn door he came in fast and wet ignoring the curses as he zeroed in on nate nate was already up and moving toward him you need to come outside chief for the second time that day nate went out in his shirtsleeves this time to the sizzle of sleet on pavement and the icy sting of it on his skin he saw the body immediately and dragging the hair out of his face moved through the wet to the curb he thought at first it was rock or bull and his heart went thick in his throat but the dog that lay in blood and freezing rain was older than megs with more white in his coloring the knife that had been used to slash his throat lay buried in his chest he heard someone scream from behind him get them back inside he ordered otto control the situation i know this dog nate its joe and laras old dog yukon harmless barely got a tooth left in his head get these people back inside either you or peter bring me out something to cover him up with peter came on the run moments after otto went in jacob gave me his slicker god chief its yukon its stevens dog yukon this isnt right this just isnt right do you recognize the knife look at the handle peter i dont know theres a lot of blood and i dont know but nate knew his gut told him it was going to be a buck knife it was going to be bings missing buck knife were going to take this dog down to the clinic youre going to help me load him in the back of my car but youre going to go over and get the camera first so we can record this scene hes dead thats right hes dead were going to examine him at the clinic after we record the scene here once we have him loaded i need you to go back inside tell joe and lara their dogs with me and where go get the camera now he looked up caught a movement out of the corner of his eye when he straightened he saw meg on the sidewalk holding his jacket you forgot this i dont want you out here ive already seen what somebody did to that poor dog poor old yukon its going to break laras heart go back inside im going home im going home to my own dogs he grabbed her arm youre going back inside and when ive cleared it youre going to the lodge this isnt a police state burke i can go where i want to go youre going to do what the hell i tell you im going to know exactly where you are and its not going to be alone five miles out of town theres ice on the roads hazardous conditions flash flooding and somebody whod be cold enough to cut this dogs throat from ear to ear so you get your ass back inside until i tell you otherwise im not leaving my dogs out ill get your dogs get inside meg get inside or ill haul you in and lock you in a cell he waited five thrumming seconds with nothing but the crackling hiss of sleet striking the ground she spun around stormed back in he waited where he was outside in the rain beside a dead dog until peter came roaring back he took the camera took several polaroids tucking them into the pocket of his jacket help me load this dog peter then you go in follow the orders i gave you i want you to tell otto to escort meg to the lodge and see that she stays there until i say different is that clear peter nodded his adams apple bobbed but he nodded ah kens inside chief i was sitting just behind him during the movie do you want him out here now yeah yeah send him out he can ride with me he shoved his dripping hair out of his eyes while thin fog twined around his ankles im going to count on you to keep order peter i want you to disperse the crowd inside send everyone on their way advise them to go home let them know were taking care of things theyre going to want to know what what happened we dont know what happened yet do we he looked back at the dog keep everyone calm youre good at talking to people you go in there and talk to your people and peter pay attention to whos in there i want you and otto to make a list of everyone whos inside and nate thought ill know everyone who isnt they loaded the dog into the vehicle as peter hurried back into town hall nate crouched down by his right rear tire beside it just under the axle was a pair of bloody gloves he opened the door dug out an evidence bag lifting the gloves by the cuffs he sealed them they would be bings he thought as the knife would be a knife and gloves bing had reported stolen only hours before twentythree it wouldve been quick ken stood over the dog and scrubbed his hands over his face the neck wound did it nate prompted yeah yeah jesus what kind of sick son of a bitch does this to a dog you said ah you said the chest wound didnt show much blood he was gone when whoever did this rammed the knife into the chest you slice the neck like that sever the jugular thats game point bloody blood wouldve gushed yeah god rain washed away some of it most of it but not all and he was still a little warm when we found him hed been dead what maybe an hour if that nate shaking his head ken took off his glasses polished them on the tail of his shirt this is way out of my league your guess on that would be as good if not better than mine but yeah an hours about right intermissiond been over around an hour he wasnt there when we went out between movies and there was too much blood left for him to have been killed somewhere else and dumped you knew this dog sure old yukon his eyes went shiny and he rubbed them dry sure he give anybody any trouble snap at somebody that you know of bite anyone yukon barely got enough teeth left to gum up his own food friendly dog harmless maybe thats why im having a hard time keeping it together he turned away for a moment struggling for control max well max was horrible a human being for gods sake but this dog this dog was old and sweet and defenseless sit down for a minute if you need to but nate stood where he was looking down at the dog at the fur matted with blood and still dripping with rain sorry nate youd think a doctor could handle himself better than this he sucked in air pushed it back out of his lungs what do you want me to do joe and lara are going to be coming along in a minute i need you to keep them out of here until i finish what are you going to do my job just keep them out until im done he lifted his camera took more pictures he wasnt a coroner but hed stood over enough dead bodies witnessed enough autopsies to guess that the knife strike had been executed from over the dogs head a little behind a lefttoright stroke straddled him lifted his head up sliced blood jets out coats the gloves maybe the sleeves maybe even splashes back some dog goes down bury the knife in him ditch the gloves walk away a couple of minutes with the rain giving cover with a couple hundred people maybe a little more inside the building focused on jimmy stewart risky he thought as he dusted the handle of the knife for prints but calculated cold there was nothing on the knife but blood he bagged it then dug up a plastic sack he put the knife and the photographs inside and went out to speak to the wises the rain had turned to a thin wet snow by the time nate tracked down bing he found him in his enormous garage by his log house his weather radio was on as he tinkered under the hood of his truck there were a couple of other vehicles inside and what looked like a small engine or a motor up on blocks one of the drawers on a huge rusted red toolbox was open above a long counter was a pegboard holding more tools with a calendar beside it featuring a mostly naked blonde with enormous breasts a muscularlooking sewing machine sewing machine sat on a wood table in the far corner and over that was a moose head the place smelled like beer stirred with smoke and grease bing squinted over at nate one eye closed against the smoke that drifted up from the cigarette clamped in his lips we get more rain tomorrow the rivers going to come up and kiss lunatic street gonna need the sandbags i got back of the truck sandbags nate thought with a glance at the sewing machine he couldnt quite picture bing sewing up sandbags but he supposed there were bigger wonders in the world you left the movie early seen enough gonna be busy by morning whats it to you nate stepped forward held out the bagged knife yours bing drew the cigarette out of his mouth as he turned hed have to have been blinded by more than a little smoke to miss the blood on handle and blade looks like it he tossed the cigarette down heeled it to pulp on the oilstained concrete yeah its my knife looks like its been used some too whered you find it in joe and laras dog yukon bing took one step back nate saw it the quick jerking step of a man whod been sucker punched what the hell you talking about somebody used this to slit that dogs throat then jammed it in his chest so i wouldnt have any trouble finding it what time did you leave the movie bing somebody killed that dog somebody killed that dog awareness slid over the shock in his eyes youre saying i killed that dog his fist tightened over the wrench still in his hand is that what youre saying you take a swing at me with that ill take you out you want to spare yourself that humiliation because believe me i can do it put it down now rage trembled over his face quaked visibly through his body youve got yourself a big bad temper dont you bing nate said softly the kind thats earned you some assaults on your record had you spending a few nights here and there behind bars the kind thats pushing you right now to crack my skull like an egg with that wrench go ahead try it bing heaved the wrench across the room where it smashed a chip out of the cinderblock wall he was breathing like a steam engine and his face was red as brick fuck you sure i punched a few faces cracked a few heads but im no goddamn dog killer and if you say i am i dont need a wrench to bust your head open i asked you what time you left the movie i went out to catch a smoke at intermission you saw me you started in on how we had to prep for possible flooding i came back here loaded those damn sandbags he jerked a thumb toward the bed of his truck where at least a hundred sandbags were stacked figured id tune up the engine while i was at it ive been here ever since somebody went to joes place and killed that dog it wasnt me i liked that dog nate took out the bagged gloves are these yours staring at them bing rubbed the back of his hand over his mouth the red was dying out of his cheek with clammy white rising what the hells going on here is that a yes yeah theyre mine im not denying it i told you somebody took em took my spare gloves and my buck knife i reported it just this morning too a cynical person might wonder if you were covering yourself why the hell would i kill a dog damn stupid old dog bing scrubbed at his face then shook another cigarette out of the pack in his breast pocket his hands shook visibly you dont have a dog do you bing so that makes me a dog hater christ i had a dog he died two years ago this june got cancer bing cleared his throat drew hard on his cigarette cancer took him somebody kills a dog you have to wonder if he had problems with the dog or the people who owned it i didnt have any problem with that dog i got no problem with joe or lara or that college boy of theirs you ask them you ask them if we had any problems but somebodys got problems with me thats for damn sure any idea why that might be he shrugged jerkily only thing i know is i didnt kill that dog keep available bing if you plan on leaving town for any reason i want to know about it i aint going to stand by while people point the finger at me stay available nate repeated and went out the way hed come in meg nursed a beer and her temper as she waited she didnt like waiting and nate was going to hear about it when he got back hed snapped orders at her like she was some sort of halfwit green recruit and he was the general she didnt like orders and he was going to hear about that too he was going to get both ears full when he got back where the hell was he she was worried sick about her dogs no matter how the sensible part of her insisted they were fine that nate would keep his word and get them for her she should have been allowed to get them herself instead of being under some sort of halfassed house arrest she didnt want to be here worrying helpless sipping beer and playing poker with otto skinny jim and the professor to pass the time she was up twentytwo dollars and change and she didnt give a damn where the hell was he and who the hell did he think he was telling her what to do threatening to lock her in jail hed have done it too she thought as she drew the eight of clubs to fill out a very pretty full house he hadnt been sweet sadeyed nate when hed stood out in the rain beside that dog beside poor dead yukon hed been something else someone else someone she imagined hed been back in baltimore before circumstances had cut him off at the knees cut him off at the heart she didnt give a damn about that either she wouldnt give a damn see your two dollars she said to jim raise it two and tossed her money into the pot her mother had given jim an hour break and was working the bar not that there was a lot of business meg thought as the professor folded and otto bumped her raise another two other than their table there was a booth of four outsiders climbers waiting out the weather the two old farts hans and dex had another booth whiling away a rainy evening with beer and checkers and waiting she knew for whatever gossip might come in the door thered be more in and out if the river rose people coming in for a few minutes of dry and warm ordering up coffee before they went out to sandbag again when it was done thered be more piling in wet and tired and hungry but not ready to go home alone not ready to break the camaraderie of bucking nature theyd want coffee and alcohol and whatever hot meal was put in front of them charlene would see they got it shed work until the last of them were gone meg had seen it before she tossed in two dollars to call when jim folded two pair otto announced kings over fives your kings are going to have to bow to my ladies she set down two queens seeing as theyre cozied up with three eights son of a bitch otto watched the nice little pile of bills and coins as meg swept them away then he lifted his chin pushed back his chair as nate stepped in from the lobby chief meg jerked around shed sat facing the outside door waiting to pounce the minute he opened it instead she thought sourly hed snuck in behind her could use some coffee charlene its good and hot she filled a large mug i can fix you a meal thatd be good and hot too no thanks where are my dogs meg demanded in the lobby otto i ran into hopp and some others outside consensus is the river looks like its going to hold but well need to keep an eye on it no more than a light snow coming down now forecasters say this systems going to head west so were probably in the clear he drank down half the coffee held the mug out to charlene for a refill its flooded over on lake shore peter and i put hazard markers up there and across from the east edge of rancor woods those two spots are a problem if too many people piss on the side of the road otto told him the system goes west we wont have a problem in town well keep an eye nate repeated and turned toward the stairs just one damn minute chief meg stood in the doorway a dog on either side ive got some things to say to you i need a shower you can say them while im cleaning up or you can wait her lips peeled back into a snarl as he carried his coffee up the steps wait my ass she stomped up behind him the dogs in her wake who do you think you are i think im chief of police i dont care if youre chief of the known universe you dont get off snapping at me ordering me threatening me i did get off but i wouldnt have had to do any of those things if youd just done what i told you what you told me she shoved into the room behind him you dont tell me youre not my boss or my father just because ive slept with you doesnt give you the right to tell me what to do he yanked off his soaked jacket then tapped the badge on his shirt no but this does he peeled off the shirt on the way to the bathroom he was still someone else she thought the someone else whod lived behind those sad eyes just waiting to muscle his way out that someone was hard and cold dangerous she heard the shower start up both dogs continued to stand their heads cocked at they looked up at her lie down she murmured she marched into the bathroom nate was sitting on the toilet lid fighting off wet boots you sic otto on me like some sort of guard dog and leave me waiting damn near three hours three hours where i dont know whats going on he looked at her dead in the face with eyes like flint i had work and more important things to do than keep you updated you want the news he set the boots aside rose to strip off his pants turn on the radio dont you talk to me like im some sort of whiny irritating female he stepped into the shower ripped the curtain shut after him then stop acting like one god he needed the heat nate pressed his hands to the tile dipped his head and let the hot water pour over him an hour or two of it he estimated it might just reach his tired frozen bones a bottle or two of aspirin parts of him might stop aching three or four days of sleep might just counteract the fatigue that trudging through icy flood water hauling barricades watching a grown man and woman weep over their murdered dog had drenched him with part of him wanted the quiet the quiet dark that he could sink into where none of it really mattered and part of him was afraid hed find his way back there all too easily when he heard the curtain draw back again he stayed as he was arms braced head down eyes shut you dont want to fight with me now meg youll lose ill tell you something burke i dont like being shuffled off like a petty annoyance i dont like being ignored ordered around im not sure i like the way you looked outside town hall tonight so i couldnt see anything i recognized on your face in your eyes it pisses me off and she slid her arms around him pressed her naked body to his so that he jerked straight it stirs me up dont he clasped his hands over hers prying hers apart before he turned to hold her at arms length just dont deliberately she looked down deliberately she smiled as she looked up again seems to be a contradiction here i dont want to hurt you and i would the way im feeling right now you dont scare me you got me all churned up spoiling for a fight all of a sudden im spoiling for something else give me something else she reached up ran her hand down his chest well finish fighting after im not feeling friendly me either nate sometimes you just need something else just need to go somewhere else and forget for a little while burn up some of the mad or the hurt or the scared burn me up she murmured she gripped his hips now squeezed shed have been better off if hed pushed her away he was sure of it but he yanked her toward him so that warm wet body collided with his so he could find her mouth ravage it she clamped around him hooking her arms up his back so her fingers could dig into his shoulders nails biting flesh the heat pumped out of her and it reached his bones seared through them scoring away the tired and the cold line of anger her hands streaked down him again wet against wet and her head dropped back to invite him to feast on her throat her shoulders anywhere he could find that soft warm flesh the sound she made the sound that simmered against his lips was one of erotic triumph here she slid the soap out of the slot lets clean you up i like the feel of a mans back under my hands especially when its all wet and slippery she had a voice like a siren he let her use it on him use her hands on him let her think she was guiding him when he pushed her back to the shower wall the sleepy look in her eyes sharpened with surprise when she started to smile he crushed his mouth to hers shed been right she thought dimly he was someone else someone who took control ruthlessly who took away choice who could make her surrender it even as his mouth took possession of hers he twisted the soap from her hand he ran it over her breasts long teasing strokes that had her nipples aching her breath trembled out in a sigh the tickle low in her belly told her she was ready that she wanted she needed rubbing her lips down the side of his neck she murmured to him its good with you its good be inside me now come inside me youll scream first she laughed nipped not so gently no i wont yes he hauled her arms over her head cuffed her wrists with one hand pinned them there you will he slid the soap between her legs rubbing it sliding it watching her as her body shuddered to orgasm nate i warned you something like panic lit inside her panic quickly tangled with razoredged pleasure as his fingers dipped inside her she twisted looking for freedom for more for him but he drove her past the point she could hold it past the point she thought she could bear it her breath sobbed out halfmad pleas as the water poured hot over her shaking body as the steam blurred her vision when it burst in her ripping a line between sanity and madness he muffled her scream with his mouth say my name he had to hear it had to know she knew who had her say my name he ordered as he hoisted her by the hips and buried himself inside her nate again say it again his breath was raw in his throat look at me and say my name nate she fisted a hand in his hair dug her fingers into his shoulder she looked at his face looked into his eyes and saw him saw herself nate he took her took her took her until he was empty until she was limp as water her head dropped on his shoulder he had to brace a hand on the wet wall to catch his breath to catch himself he fumbled for the tap to shut off the shower i need to sit down she managed i really need to sit down hold on a minute because he wasnt sure she would he boosted her up half slinging her over his shoulder as he levered them out of the shower he grabbed a couple of towels though he imagined with the heat theyd generated the water would steam off them in a matter of minutes the dogs got to their feet when he walked into the bedroom with her better tell your pals youre okay what the dogs meg reassure your dogs before they decide ive knocked you unconscious rock bull relax she all but dripped out of his arms when he laid her on the bed my heads buzzing better try to dry off he dropped one of the towels on her belly ill get you a shirt or something she didnt bother to dry off but only lay there enjoying the used lax sensation weighting her body you looked tired when you came in tired and mean with a thin coat of ice over it all same look you had outside town hall ive seen it a couple of other times a quick glimpse of it cop face he said nothing only pulled on an old pair of sweats tossed her a flannel shirt its one of the things that stirred me up weird the roads dicey out to your place youre going to need to stay here she waited a moment letting her thoughts coalesce again you shrugged me off before before when we were outside she could still see yukon the slash in his throat the knife buried to the hilt in his chest you shrugged me off and you gave me orders a kind of verbal strongarming i didnt like it again he said nothing but picked up the towel to dry his hair youre not going to apologize no she sat up to draw on the borrowed shirt i knew that dog since he was a puppy because her voice wanted to break she pressed her lips together controlled it i had a right to be upset im not saying you didnt he walked to the window the snow was barely a mist now maybe the forecaster was right and i had a right to be worried about my own dogs nate a right to go see to them myself partways there he stepped away from the window but left the curtains open natural enough to worry but there was nothing to worry about they werent hurt but they mightve been no whoever did this went for a solo dog an old dog yours are young and strong and have two sets of healthy teeth theyre practically joined at the hip i dont see think for two seconds instead of just reacting impatience snapped in his voice as he tossed the towel aside say somebody wanted to hurt them say somebody even somebody they knew and let get close tried to hurt one of them even managed to do it the otherd be on him like gods own fury and tear him to pieces and anybody who knows them enough to get close knows that she drew her knees up to her chest pressed her face against them and began to cry without looking up she waved a hand to hold him off when she heard him move toward her dont dont give me a minute i cant get the picture out of my head it was easier when i was mad at you or turning that mad into sex i hated sitting there waiting not knowing and i was scared for you under it i was scared something was going to happen to you and that pissed me off she lifted her head through the blur of tears she could see his face and that hed shut down again ive got something else to say go ahead i i have to figure out how to say this so it doesnt sound lame she dragged the heels of her hands up over her cheeks to dry them even being mad and being scared and wanting to plant my boot up your ass for making me both i admire what you do how you do it who you are when you do i admire the strength it takes to do it he sat not beside her not on the bed but on the chair so there was distance between them nobody i ever cared about nobody outside of on the job ever said anything like that to me then id say you cared about the wrong people she got up walked to the bathroom to blow her nose when she came out she stood leaning on the doorjamb watching him from across the room you went out and got my dogs for me with all that was going on you went out and brought them back for me you couldve sent someone else or just blown it off roads flooded theyll have to wait but you didnt i have friends whod have done the same for me and me for them but i cant think of any man ive been with any man ive slept with who would have done it a ghost of a smile touched his mouth then id say youve slept with the wrong men i guess i have she went over and picked up the shirt hed discarded when theyd come in with some care she unpinned the badge then brought it to him this looks good on you by the way sexy he gripped her hand before she could step back still holding it he got to his feet ive got an awful need for you its more than ive had for anyone else and may be more than you want i guess well find out you wouldnt have admired me a year ago six months ago and you need to know that there are still days it seems like too much trouble to even get out of bed why do you he opened his other hand looked down at the badge i guess ive got an awful need for this too thats not heroic oh youre so wrong her heart was lost in that one moment it simply slid out and dropped at his feet heroisms just doing more than you want to do or think you can sometimes its just doing the crappy things the unhappy things other people wont do she stepped closer cupped his face in her hands its not just jumping out of a plane onto a glacier ten thousand feet up because theres nobody else there to do it its getting out of bed in the morning when it seems like too much trouble emotion swirled into his eyes and he lowered his cheek to the top of her head im so in love with you meg then he kissed her hair straightened i need to go out i want to check the river patrol before i turn in can a civilian and her dogs do a ridealong on that yeah he ruffled a hand over her damp hair dry your hair first will you tell me what you know about yukon ill tell you what i can twentyfour he went back to the scene of the crime in the early morning drizzle ten steps from the door nate thought left in plain view of anyone who might have come in or gone out of town hall plain view of anyone driving by walking by more than left he amended executed in plain view he walked inside through to the meeting center hed ordered everything left as it was the folding chairs the big projection screen remained in place he brought it back into his head the way it had been the night before hed come in a little late just before the lights had gone down hed scanned the crowd as much out of habit as looking for meg rose and david had been in the last row her first night out since the baby theyd been holding hands he remembered seeing them both at intermission with rose on the phone probably checking with her mother who was home watching the kids bing had been near the back nate had ignored the flask hed held between his knees deb and harry the professor a small clump of high schoolers the entire riggs family who lived in a log cabin out past rancor woods hed estimate that half the population had been there which meant half hadnt some had left at intermission any of those whod stayed might have slipped out and in again in the dark while attention was focused on the screen he walked back to the lobby when he heard the outer door open and watched hopp shove back her hood saw your car parked outside i dont know what to think about this ignatious i cant put two thoughts together about it she lifted her hands let them drop again im going to go over and see lara dont know what ill say this is such a crazy thing mean and crazy ill go with mean but not crazy somebody carves up a harmless dog outside town hall and thats not crazy depends on why her mouth flattened at that i cant see any why to it couple of people are saying weve got a cult high school kids experimenting or some such thing i dont believe that for one minute it wasnt ritualistic others think its some loony camped out near town maybe its a comfort believing none of us could have done such an awful thing but i dont know that it makes me feel any better to think weve got a crazy lurking around whod kill a dog that way she studied his face you dont think that no i dont think that are you going to tell me what you do think i think when somebody kills a local dog in the middle of town in front of a building where a good half of that towns sitting hes got his reasons which are im working on it he drove along the river before heading to the station it was a sulky gray today with those plates and chunks of floating ice dull on its surface megs plane was gone a clear symbol that he couldnt box her up somewhere safe and close bing and a twoman crew were patching a section of road bings only acknowledgment as nate slowed to pass was a long steady stare he drove to the station to find peach urging coffee on joe and lara peter stood by looking very much like a grown man struggling not to cry lara her eyes swollen and beet red sprang up the instant nate stepped into the room i want to know what youre doing about yukon what are you doing to find the bastard who killed my dog now lara dont now lara me she said whirling on her husband i want to know why dont you come back to my office peach hold off anything that comes in except an emergency for the next few minutes all right chief lara she gripped laras hand in hers i couldnt be more sorry lara managed a short bob of her head before she shot her chin into the air and sailed into nates office i want some answers lara i want you to sit down i dont want i want you to sit down his tone was quiet but the authority in it had her dropping into a chair the town voted for this police department voted to bring you in and to pay the tax that pays your salary i want you to tell me what youre doing why youre not out there right now looking for that son of a bitch im doing everything i can do lara he said in that same quiet tone before she could speak again dont think for a minute that im taking this lightly that any of us are im pursuing it and ill keep pursuing it until i can give you those answers youve got the knife the knife that her voice broke and her chin bobbled but she sucked in air pushed back her shoulders you ought to be able to find out who owned that knife i can tell you that the knife was reported stolen yesterday morning along with other items ive talked to the owner and im going to get statements from people who were in town hall last night i can start with you you think one of us killed yukon thats not what i think sit down lara he said when she leaped to her feet you were both at movie night so lets go over what you saw heard she lowered slowly this time we left him outside tears swam into her eyes he was getting so he couldnt hold his bladder so we left him outside it was only for a few hours and he had his doghouse if wed left him in you dont know if it wouldve made a difference whoever did this couldve broken in taken him out from what ive heard you gave that dog nearly fourteen good years youve got nothing to blame yourself for what time did you leave the house lara bowed her head stared at her hands as her tears plopped onto them right after six joe said and began to rub his wifes shoulder you go straight to town hall yeah we got there about sixthirty i guess early but we like to sit close to the front we dumped our jackets on the chairs three four rows back on on the left side and we socialized awhile nate took them through it who they had talked with who had sat near them anyone ever complain to you about the dog no joe sighed well maybe a few times when he was a puppy he used to bark if a leaf stirred and he got out once and chewed up tim tripps boots from off his back stoop but that was years ago and tim got kind of a kick out of it because the damn boots were almost bigger than yukon he settled down after he got out of the puppy stage he settled down how about the two of you have you had a problem with anyone lately an argument i got into it some with skinny jim over the iditarod it got pretty heated but that sort of thing happens people get worked up over the iditarod and theyve got their favorites i had to call ginny mann into the school because her boy hooked twice lara fumbled out a tissue she wasnt happy about it or with me how old is her boy eight she blinked rapidly oh god joshua couldnt have done that to yukon nate hes a good kid just doesnt much like school but he wouldnt have killed my dog because he was mad at me and ginny and don theyre good people they couldnt okay if you think of anything else you let me know i want i want to apologize for the way i jumped on you before dont worry about that lara no it wasnt right it wasnt right and it wasnt you saved my sons life i wouldnt go that far you helped save it and thats the same thing to me i shouldnt have come in here the way i did joe tried to calm me down but i wouldnt be calmed i loved that damn dog after theyd left nate uncovered his case board as he pinned up the pictures hed taken the night before peter came in okay chief yeah i feel like i shouldve been able to handle mrs wise i got twisted up i well steven and i hung out together a lot and i grew up with that dog my dad he has the sled dogs and theyre great but not the same as a pet even when steven went to college id go over and see yukon sometimes i guess thats why i had some trouble with everything last night too you couldve told me i just i was just twisted up um chief is that going to be just an open case board now i mean should we put copies of notes and other caserelated items on the board no but youve got yukon up there now thats right you think what happened to yukons related to the others i feel stupid but i dont understand thinking theyre related might be stupid peter stepped closer why do you at this point ive got no clear motive for anyone killing that dog nate walked around to his desk unlocked a drawer and took out the sealed knife and gloves these belong to bing he reported them stolen yesterday morning bing peters eyes widened bing hes got a temper on him hes got a sheet and most of it deals with assaults violent behavior yeah but god weve got a few ways to look at this bing gets in an argument with joe somewhere along the line or joe and lara do something that aggravates him he stews about it decides to teach them a lesson so he decides to kill the dog reports the knife and gloves as stolen then goes off after intermission last night knowing the wises are inside he gets the dog brings him back kills him leaves the knife and gloves figuring hes covered because hed reported them stolen then he goes home and works in his garage if he was mad at mr or mrs wise why didnt he just punch mr wise in the face good question another way we can look at it is somebody wanted to cause bing some trouble he pisses a lot of people off so thats no stretch he eased a hip onto his desk his eyes on the board they steal his knife and gloves they use them to kill the dog leave them where theyll be found or he moved to the counter started a pot of coffee we ask ourselves how galloways murder maxs death and the killing of a dog might be connected thats just it i dont see the killer left us one big clue cryptic or obvious depending on which angle you look from the dogs throat was slit thats what killed him but the killer doesnt toss the knife aside he takes another minute had to roll the dog over to do it to bury the knife in its chest why because hes sick and hes mean and put that aside and look at the board peter look at galloway look at the dog he struggled with it nate could see with looking close at the grisly pictures then he let out a little breath as if hed been holding it chest wound they both have a blade of some kind in the chest could be coincidence or maybe somebodys trying to tell us something now take another step wheres the connection between galloway max and the wises well i dont know steven and his parents moved here when i was about twelve i guess that was after galloway was gone but they knew mr hawbaker mr wise ran an ad in the lunatic most weeks for his computer servicing and mrs wise and mrs hawbaker took some classes together the exercise class at the school and the quilting class peach has going something else connects them to our knowledge they didnt know patrick galloway but for sixteen years everyone believes galloway just took off now they dont why well because they found him when steven stevens the one who found him get away with murder for sixteen years then some dumbass college boy and his idiot friends screw it up for you nate listened to the coffee plop into the glass pot a pisser all right if they hadnt been up there that time that place odds are things would be fine another avalanche natures or one the state set off to clear the mountain that cave could ve been buried again for years maybe forever if your luck held he eased a hip down on his desk while the coffee brewed now youve got to go and kill again kill max or induce him to kill himself youll get away with that too you believe that you have to believe that but there are cops in lunacy now not just state but town cops right underfoot what do you do about that i i cant keep up you distract them vandalism petty thievery little things that keep them occupied just in case theyre thinking about more important things you pay that dumbass college boy back and you give the cops something else to worry about at the same time two birds but you cant resist being a little fancy giving them an elbow in the ribs so you mimic your first murder by shoving the knife in the dogs chest he got up poured coffee for both of them now it could be youre so fucking arrogant and full of yourself that you use your own knife your own gloves strong possibility when you profile bing karlovski or youre so clever so full of yourself you plant them so the finger points elsewhere if thats the case why bing wheres he connect i swear i dont know im trying to get all this into my head maybe it doesnt have to connect bings ornery he irritates people or there was just an easy chance to steal the knife none of its chance not this time we need to find out where bing was exactly where he was in february of how nate sipped his coffee for a start im going to ask him meanwhile i want statements from everyone who was at movie night and everyone who wasnt thats going to take time you tell peach to make a list that divides the township and outlying into three parts well each take one ill tell her right now peter nate stopped him at the door werent you scheduled to work last night to cover the desk yeah but otto said he didnt feel like going to the movies so we switched thats okay isnt it sure nate sipped his coffee again thats fine go ahead and get peach started on that list nate crossed to the board and drew lines connecting joe and lara wise with max and with bing nate peach peeked in you still want me to hold things out here no whatcha got had a report of gunfire and a bear sighting same people who reported the dead body that was a pair of boots i gave both of them to otto since he was already out on patrol gunfire was dex trilbys truck which is older than i am backfiring and the bear was what a squirrel standing on a log no the bear was a bear those idiot outsiders put up a bunch of bird feeders around the cabin draw the birds in well a bear cant resist fresh bird feed otto ran it off and made them take down the feeders hes a little irritable after having to go out there twice already today so if something else comes in i thought id hand it off to you or peter you do that well then carrie hawbaker just came in and wants to see you she wants me to give her the items for the police log good go ahead i guess well have the lunatic up and running again looks that way she says she wants the official statement on what happened last night for the paper do you want me to take care of it no he flipped the blanket over his board send her on back she looked better than the last time hed seen her steadier and not quite so sunken around the eyes thanks for seeing me how are you doing he asked and closed the door getting through getting by it helps to have the kids they need me and the paper she took the chair he offered and set the canvas briefcase she carried on her lap im not just here about the items for the police log though god its an awful thing about yukon it is well i know you wanted me to think about back when pat disappeared to write down details i did some she opened the bag to take sheets of paper i thought id remember it all i thought everything would just coming flooding back but it didnt nate saw the papers were neatly typed and written in a formal outline style it looks like you remembered plenty i put down everything a lot of things that couldnt matter it was long ago and i have to admit now that i didnt pay much attention to pats leaving i was teaching and wondering how i was going to get through another winter my second here i was thirtyone and id missed my goal of being married by my thirtieth birthday she smiled a little that was one of the reasons id come to alaska in the first place the ratio was in my favor i remember feeling a little desperate a little sorry for myself and annoyed with max because he hadnt asked me thats why i remember youll see it written there that he was gone a couple of weeks that winter i think it was that february im not absolutely sure days tend to freeze together in the winter especially if youre alone where did he tell you he was going that i do remember because i got snippy about it he said he was going to anchorage down to homer a few weeks in the southeast interviewing bush pilots and getting some of them to fly him around for the paper and research for the novel he was writing did he do a lot of traveling back then he did i put that down too he said hed be gone maybe four or five weeks and that didnt sit well with me especially with things still up in the air between us i remember because he was back sooner than he said but he didnt even come to see me people told me hed holed up at the paper was practically living there i was too mad to go see him either how long before you did see him it was a while i was pretty mad but finally i got mad enough to see him i know it was the end of march or the very start of april we had the classroom decorated for easter easter hit the first sunday in april that year i looked it up i remember sitting there with all those colored eggs and bunny drawings while i was stewing about max she ran her hand over her stack of papers this part i remember perfectly he was at the paper locked in i had to bang on the door he looked terrible thin and unshaven his hair all which way he smelled there were papers all over his desk she sighed a little i cant remember what the weather was like nate what it looked like in town but i can remember exactly how he looked i can remember exactly how it looked in his office coffee cups dishes all over the place trash cans overflowing trash on the floor ashtrays full of butts he used to smoke i wrote it down she said and smoothed the papers again he was working on his novel thats what i assumed and looked like a madman damn if i know why i found that so appealing but i gave him whatfor told him i was done if he thought he could treat me that way he could just think again and so on i just raved and ranted and he didnt say a thing when id run out of steam he got down on one knee she stopped a moment pressed her lips together right there in all that mess he said he wanted a second chance he needed one and asked me to marry him we were married that june i wanted to be a june bride and since id already missed the thirtiethbirthday deadline a couple more months didnt matter did he ever talk about the time he was away no and i didnt ask it didnt seem important all he said was that hed learned what it was like to be alone really alone and he didnt want to be alone again nate thought about the lines connecting the names on his list did he ever have a particular runin or a particular friendship with bing bing no not a buddy sort of thing max tried to stay on his good side especially since he knew bing had asked me out bing asked me out is probably a euphemism he wasnt interested in dining and dancing if you follow me and did you ever no she laughed cutting herself off in midstream and looking shocked at herself i havent laughed not really since its terrible to laugh at this the thought of you and bing strikes me funny howd he take being turned down oh i dont think it was a big deal she brushed it off with the back of her hand i was handy thats all new female in the very small pack men like bing would try to cut the new one out of the herd see if he could get some sex and maybe a couple of homecooked meals out of it nothing against him its natural enough in a place like this he wasnt the only one who made moves i went out with a few that first winter even the professor and i had dinner a couple times though it was plain as plain he had a major crush on charlene that would be before galloway left before during after hes always had a thing for her but we had dinner a couple of times and he was a perfect gentleman maybe a little more gentlemanly than i was looking for to tell the truth but i wasnt looking for someone like bing because hes so big and crude and rough i went out with john because i liked his looks and his intellect and with ed once because well why not even otto after his divorce a woman even one whos not very pretty and past thirty has a lot of choices in a place like this if shes not too picky i chose max she smiled into middle distance i still would then brought herself back i wish i could tell you more looking back i guess i can see that max was troubled but he always seemed troubled when he worked on one of his books hed put them away for months and months at a time and everything was normal but as soon as hed pull one out and start hed close in i was happier when hed forget the books anyone ever make a move on you after you were married no i recall bing telling me right in front of max that i was selling myself short or cheap or something like that and nothing max made a joke out of it bought bing a drink he wasnt one for confrontations nate went miles out of the way to avoid one which is one of the reasons i guess he didnt make it on a bigcity paper you saw what he did when you brushed him off after you first got here he went to hopp that was his way he wouldnt have come in here for a showdown with you on his own because he just didnt have the tools for any sort of battle he never did was max a movie fan just about everyone in lunacy is one dependable form of community entertainment he really loved doing reviews on what we had coming up speaking of movie night i really do want a statement about what happened last night peach can give you the report for the log ill see her about that but i think something like this well want to run more than an item otto found him she began as she started to dig out a notebook yes give us a couple days on this carrie by then i should have something more cohesive to give you do you mean you expect to make an arrest shortly nate smiled youve got your reporter hat right back on what i mean is ill have my notes statements the incident report coordinated she rose im glad my kids werent there last night i almost insisted they go just so theyd get out and do something normal but they had a couple of friends over for pizza instead ill check back with you tomorrow i was just wondering he said as he walked her to the door was max a fan of star wars she stared at him where did that come from just a dot im trying to connect he wasnt not just that he wasnt a particular fan which was baffling to me because he loved that sort of thing big epic stories with lots of special effects but he wouldnt watch those we had a star wars marathon on movie night about six seven years ago well whenever the twentieth anniversary of the original was he wouldnt go and the kids were mad to go i had to take them myself and write the reviews for the paper now that i think about it when the new ones came out i ended up taking the kids all the way to anchorage to see them for the first run he stayed home what hat did you pull that one out of cop hat he gave her a little nudge to urge her out its not important you see peach about the log item nate timed it so that he walked over to the lodge when bing and his crew broke for lunch he stepped inside as rose served bing a beer his eyes met bings over it he strolled over nodded casually to the two men on the opposite side of the booth you boys mind finding another table so bing and i can have a private conversation they didnt like it but they picked up their coffee mugs and moved to the next empty booth i got lunch coming bing began and i got a right to eat it without you sitting here spoiling my appetite see you got that pothole filled in thanks rose he said when she brought him his usual coffee you ready for lunch chief no nothing right now rivers holding he continued to bing maybe we wont need those sandbags maybe we do maybe we dont february where were you how the living fuck do i know in the los angeles dodgers won the series the redskins took the super bowl cher won an oscar lower crap and in february susan butcher won her third iditarod hell of a feat for a girl from boston finished in eleven days and just under twelve hours maybe that refreshes your memory it refreshes that i lost two hundred bucks on that race damn woman so what were you doing a few weeks before you lost the two bills a man remembers losing two hundred because of a woman he dont necessarily remember every time he scratches his ass or takes a piss you take any trips i was coming and going as i damn well pleased then same as now maybe you went down to anchorage saw galloway there ive been down to anchorage more times than you can spit couple hundred miles doesnt mean anything up here i mightve seen him there a time or two seen plenty of people i know there i do my business and they do theirs you play hardass on this youll be the one who pays for it the heat burned into his eyes you dont want to go threatening me you dont want to go stonewalling me nate leaned back with his coffee you figured you should be the one wearing this badge better than some cheechako one that got his own partner killed one that woulda washed out if that thin blue line hadnt held him up it seared straight into his gut but he drank the coffee held bings eyes been doing your homework i see but the fact is im wearing the badge ive got enough right now to take you in charge you and lock you up for what was done to that dog i never touched that dog if i were you id put a little more effort into remembering where i was when patrick galloway left town why do you want to beat this dead horse burke make you feel important max killed galloway and everybody knows it then it shouldnt bother you to verify your own whereabouts rose came over with a slab of meat loaf a mountain of mashed potatoes and a small sea of gravy anything else i can get for you bing she set a bowl of snow peas and tiny onions beside the plate nate saw him struggle watched him draw himself back his voice was even a shade on the gentle side when he answered no thanks rose you enjoy that chief just let me know if you want anything im through talking to you bing said and forked up a huge bite of meat loaf how about some lunchtime small talk then what do you think of star wars huh you know the movies luke skywalker darth vader fucking idiot bing mumbled under his breath and scooped up gravy drenched potatoes star wars for christs sake let me eat in peace great story memorable characters under all the jazz its about destiny and betrayal its about making a killing at the box office and merchandising bing waved his fork before he dug in again buncha guys flying around in spaceships whapping each other with light swords sabers light sabers the thing is it took some time some sacrifice some loss but he slid out of the booth the good guys won see you around twentyfive there were eleven seniors in the lastperiod english lit class nine of them were awake john let the two snoozers catch their lateafternoon catnap while one of the more alert mangled the bards words in her reading of lady macbeths out damned spot scene he had enough on his mind and supervising the discussion on macbeth was only a small part of it hed been leading discussions like this for twentyfive years since the first time he stepped nervously in front of a classroom of students hed been only a few years older than those hed taught back then and perhaps more innocent and eager than the majority of his students hed wanted to write great and awesome novels filled with allegories on the human condition he hadnt wanted to starve in a garret so hed taught hed written and though the novels were never as great or awesome as hed hoped hed published a few without teaching he might not have starved in that garret but he wouldnt have eaten well hed felt the demands and god help him the joys of teaching overwhelming for the intellectual young man who wanted to write great novels so hed taken the leap the brave and foolish leap and had run to alaska there he would experience hed live simply hed study the human condition in that primitive place that wideopen isolation it represented to him hed write novels about mans courage and tenacity his follies and his triumphs then hed come to lunacy how could he have known a young man not yet thirty the true meaning of obsession how could he have understood that bright idealistic and pathetic young man that one place one woman could chain him could keep him willingly shackled no matter how they defied and denied his needs he had fallen in love become obsessed he was no longer sure there was a difference the moment hed seen charlene her beauty was like a golden willow her voice a sirens song her reckless and joyful sexuality everything about her enchanted and engulfed him she was another mans woman the mother of another mans child but it made no difference his love if thats what it was hadnt been the pure and romantic love of a valorous knight for a lady but the lustful sweaty need of a man for a woman hadnt he convinced himself she would cast galloway off he was careless with her selfish even if he hadnt been blinded by love john would have seen that resented that so hed stayed and waited changed the course of his life and waited after everything hed done all his plans his hopes he was still waiting his students got younger and younger and the years died behind him he could never get back what hed cast away what hed wasted and still the single thing he wanted would not be his he glanced at the clock saw another day had gone to dust then catching a movement out of the corner of his eye saw nate leaning against the jamb of the open door of his classroom your papers on macbeth are due next friday he announced to a chorus of groans kevin ill know if marianne writes it for you those of you whore on the yearbook committee remember theres a meeting tomorrow at threethirty make sure youve arranged transportation home if necessary dismissed there was the general clatter shuffle chatter he was so used to he no longer noticed what is it about high schools nate began that can make a grown mans palms sweat just because we survived the hell of it once doesnt mean we cant be thrown back into the pit guess thats it youd have done well enough id wager john said as he packed some papers into his battered briefcase youve got the looks the attitude decent enough student id say did well with the girls athletic what did you letter in track nates lips curved always could run you your classic nerd the one that screwed the curve for the rest of the class that was you i hated you with his thumbs hooked in his pockets nate strolled in looked at the notes on the blackboard macbeth huh i got shakespeare okay if somebody else read it out loud i mean so i could hear the words this guy killed for a woman right no for ambition at the urging of a woman with the seeds for it all planted by three more he didnt get away with it he paid with his honor with the loss of the woman he loved to madness with his life what goes around john nodded lifted an eyebrow did you drop by to discuss shakespeare nate nope were investigating the incident last night i need to ask you some questions about yukon i was in town hall when it happened what time did you get there a few minutes before seven he glanced over absently as some of the liberated students raced laughing down the hall actually im doing an extracurricular group on hitchcockian storytelling for the tenththrough twelfthgraders gets some of the kids involved earns them extra credit a dozen of my students signed up for it did you go out between seven and ten i went out at intermission had a smoke got some of the punch the elementary school committee was selling which was more palatable when i doctored it where were you sitting toward the back opposite side from my students i didnt want to inhibit them or be barraged with questions i was taking notes on the movies in the dark yes thats right just a few key points i wanted to make sure to bring forward in discussion id like to help you on this but i dont see how i can he walked over to lower the blinds on the rooms single window after otto came in after we knew what had happened i went back to the lodge i was upset we all were charlene skinny jim and big mike were running the place who was there ah mitch dauber and cliff treat drunk mike a couple of hikers as he spoke he policed the room gathering up dropped pencils crumpled balls of paper a hair clip i got a drink meg and otto came in shortly and after things settled down a little we played some poker we were still playing when you got there nate nodded and put away the notebook hed pulled out john tossed the paper in the trash put the other items in a shoe box on his desk i dont know anybody whod do that to a dog especially yukon nobody else seems to either nate glanced around the classroom it smelled like chalk he thought and that teenage perfume of gum lip gloss and hair gel do you ever take time off during the school year give yourself a break and just head out ive been known to mentalhealth breaks id call them why im wondering if you took a mentalhealth break back in february of behind his lenses johns eyes went cool it would be hard to say try should i be talking to a lawyer chief burke that would be up to you im just trying to get a picture of where everyone was what everyone was up to when patrick galloway was killed shouldnt the state police be the ones trying to get that picture and if im not mistaken havent they drawn their conclusions i like my own drawings you wouldnt say it was a secret that youve been lets say partial to charlene for a long time no after taking off his glasses john began to polish them slowly thoroughly with a handkerchief from his jacket pocket i wouldnt say its a secret and were partial to her when she was with galloway i had feelings strong feelings for her yes they hardly did me any good as she married someone else less than a year after galloway left was murdered nate corrected yes he replaced his glasses was murdered did you ask her she said no shes said no every time ive asked her but she slept with you youre treading on very personal ground now she slept with you nate continued but she married someone else slept with you while she was married to someone else and not just you thats private as much as anything can be in a place like this im not going to discuss it with you loves a kind of ambition isnt it nate tapped a finger on the copy of macbeth still sitting on johns desk men kill for it men kill half the time they dont need any excuse cant argue with that sometimes they get away with it more often they dont id appreciate it if youd think back and when you remember where you were that february you let me know he started for the door turned back oh i wondered did you ever read any of the books max hawbaker started no though his voice was calm a dull anger still rode in his eyes he was secretive about them a lot of aspiring writers are i had the impression he talked about writing a book more than he actually wrote turns out he started a few ive got the copies they all sort of circle around to the same thing a theme i guess youd call it thats not atypical for a fledgling writer either even an experienced one will explore a theme from several angles his seems to be about men surviving nature and each other or not surviving always ends up being three men no matter how many it starts out with it comes down to three the one he did the most on is about three men climbing a mountain in the winter nate jingled loose change in his pocket when john remained silent he only had a few chapters complete but he had notes on the rest like an outline or scattered scenes he was going to plug in three men go up the mountain only two come back nate paused a moment a lot of novels are autobiographical arent they some john said evenly its often a device used for a first novel interesting isnt it itd be even more interesting to find out who that third man was well ill be around you let me know if you recall where you were that february john stood where he was until nates footsteps stopped echoing down the hall then he sat slowly at his desk and saw his hands were shaking nate walked in on an informal meeting at town hall he did so deliberately and wasnt surprised when conversation snapped off when he came in the door sorry to interrupt he scanned the faces of the town council faces hed come to know more than one of them registered embarrassment i can wait until youre finished if you want i think were about wrapped up here hopp said i disagree ed planted his vasque sundowners on the floor folded his arms over his chest i dont think weve resolved anything and i think this meeting should continue and im sorry chief remain closed until things are resolved ed deb leaned forward weve hashed this around six dozen ways lets give it a rest i move we continue oh move it up your ass ed joe wise got to his feet joe hopp jabbed a finger at him were informal here but that doesnt mean were going to start a rumble since ignatious is here and his names come up in this meeting lets get his input i agree ken rose dragged another chair into the circle theyd formed have a seat nate listen he said before anyone could object this is our chief of police he should be a part of this the fact is ignatious were discussing recent events and your handling of them okay i take it some arent satisfied with my handling of them well the fact is harry scratched his head thereve been some rumblings around town that weve had more trouble here since we hired you than before seems like we have not that i see how thats your fault but it seems we have it might have been a mistake ed firmed his jaw ill say that right to your face it might have been a mistake to hire you anyone for that matter from outside the reasons for going outside were valid walter notti reminded him chief burke has done is doing the job he was hired to do that may be walter that may be but ed held up his hands it could be some of the less lawful elements of this town look at that as a kind of dare so theyre more active you could say people around here dont like being told what to do we voted to have a police force hopp reminded him i know that hopp and i was one who voted aye right here in this room im not saying nates to blame for the way its worked out im saying it was a mistake our mistake im stitching up the mackies less often since nate got here ken put in i had less patients coming in than usual for treatment after fights less domestic violence last year drunk mike was brought in twice with frostbite after somebody found him passed out on the side of the road this year hes still going on benders but hes sleeping them off safe in a cell i dont think we can blame having a police force for you getting your equipment stolen ed or your shack graffitied deb spread her hands we cant blame having law for hawley getting his tires slashed or for windows being broke at the school or any of that stuff i say we blame it on parents not sitting hard enough on their kids a kid didnt kill my dog joe looked apologetically at nate i agree with what deb said and with what walter and ken said before that but a kid didnt do that to yukon no nate said it wasnt a kid i dont think hiring you was a mistake nate deb continued but i think weve all got a responsibility to this town and we ought to know how youre handling it what youre doing to find out whos doing these things and who did that to yukon thats fair some of the incidents mentioned may very well have been kids the broken windows at the school certainly were and since one of them was careless enough to drop his penknife theyve been identified i talked to them and their parents yesterday restitution will be made and both of them will get a threeday suspension during which time i doubt theyre going to have a real good time you didnt charge them ed demanded they were nine and ten ed i didnt think locking them in a cell was the answer a lot of us he said remembering the sealed juvenile file on eds record do stupid things get in trouble with the law when were kids if they did that maybe they did the other things deb suggested they didnt they got set down in school by their teacher broke a couple of windows they sure as hell didnt hike all the way out to eds ice shack or sneak out of the house at night and walk the two miles to hawleys to slash his tires and spray paint all over his truck you want my input your trouble didnt start since you hired me your trouble started sixteen years ago when somebody killed patrick galloway thats something thats shaken everybody up harry said nodding to the others around the room even those of us who didnt know him but i dont see what it has to do with what were discussing here i think it does so thats how im handling it i dont follow you deb said whoever killed galloway is still here whoever killed galloway nate continued as everyone began talking at once killed max hawbaker max killed himself ed interrupted he killed himself because he killed pat someone wants you to believe that i dont thats just crazy talk nate harry pushed back air with both hands just crazy talk crazier than max killing pat deb rubbed her fingers over her throat crazier than max killing himself i dont know quiet hopp held up both hands and shouted over the noise just quiet down a damn minute ignatious she drew a breath youre saying that someone we know has killed twice three times his gaze was flinty as it scanned the room two men and an old dog my department is investigating and will continue to investigate until this individual is identified and arrested the state police joe began whatever the findings and the opinion of the state authorities my department will investigate i swore to protect and serve this town and i will part of that investigation will require each one of you to account for your whereabouts and activities last night between nine and ten pm us ed bellowed it youre going to question us thats right in addition im going to be looking for the whereabouts and activities of everyone during the month of february you you ed blustered to a halt then gripping the edge of his chair pushed himself forward you intend to question us as suspects this is over the top this is beyond belief im not going to be subjected to this or have my family and my neighbors subjected to this youre exceeding your authority i dont think so but you guys can vote to cancel my contract pay me off ill still investigate ill still find the person responsible thats what i do he rose i find the people responsible so you can have your meetings your votes your discussions you can take my badge ill still find the one responsible thats the only person who has to worry about me he strode out leaving the raised voices and insulted faces behind hopp caught up with him on the sidewalk ignatious wait a minute wait just a minute she snapped when he kept walking damn it he stopped jiggling the keys in his pocket she scowled up at him as she finished pulling on her coat you sure know how to liven up a town council meeting am i fired not yet but i sure dont think you won any popularity votes in there she tugged the hiplength coat the color of a concord grape closed you mightve been a little more tactful about it murders one of those things that short circuits all my tact switches then theres the matter of walking in on a meeting where my professional status is being questioned all right all right maybe that was poorly done if you or anyone else has a problem with how im doing the job you shouldve come to me with it youre right she pinched the bridge of her nose were all upset were all on edge and now youve dumped this in our laps nobody liked thinking max had done what it seemed clear hed done but it was a hell of a lot easier to think that than what youre suggesting im not suggesting it im saying it flat out im going to find out what i need to know however long it takes and whoever i have to step on along the way she pulled her cigarettes and lighter out of her coat pocket i can see that plain enough where were you sixteen years ago hopp me her eyes popped wide for christs sake ignatious you dont honestly think i climbed up no name with pat and stuck an ice ax in him he was twice my size but not your husbands youre a toughminded woman hopp youve done a lot around here to preserve your husbands vision you might do a lot to protect his name thats a filthy thing to say to me a filthy thing to say about a man you didnt even know i didnt know galloway either you did fury covered her face as she took a step back she turned away marched back into town hall the door slammed like a cannon shot behind her he knew murmurs and mutters would be going around so nate decided to stay visible he had his dinner at the lodge from the glances tossed his way he imagined the statements hed made at the meeting were making their way around lunacys frosty grapevine and that was fine it was time to shake things up charlene brought his salmon special to the booth herself then slid in across from him youve sure got people wondering and worried do i im one of them she picked up his coffee sipped then wrinkled her nose i dont know how anybody can drink this without sweetening it up some he pushed the dispenser of sugar packets over help yourself if you want it i will she tore open two packets of sweetn low poured it in and stirred it up she was wearing a shimmery gray shirt the sort that clung to a womans curves and had scooped back her hair to show off dangling silver earrings after tapping the spoon on the side of the mug she sampled thats better then she kept both hands around the mug as she leaned intimately toward nate when i first found out about pat i went a little crazy inside id have been ready to believe you if youd told me skinny jim had put that ax in him and he didnt come along until five or six years after pat had been gone but ive calmed down some thats good nate said and continued to eat maybe knowing i can bring him back here and bury him when the grounds ready helped i like you nate even though you wouldnt give me a tumble i like you well enough to tell you youre not doing anybody any good with all this nate slathered butter on a roll and what would all this consist of charlene you know what im saying this talk about us having a murderer running around something like that gets whispered about enough people might start to believe it its bad for business the tourists arent going to come here if they think they could get murdered in their beds cissy he called with his eyes still on charlenes can i get another cup of coffee here is that what it comes down to charlene it comes down to money to your profitandloss statement weve got to make a living here weve got she broke off as cissy set another mug on the table filled it with coffee you need anything else nate no thanks we do a lot of business here over the summer weve got to if we dont want to live on the pfd all winter and winters long ive got to be practical nate pats gone max killed him im not letting myself hold that against carrie i wanted to but im not letting myself shes lost her man too but max killed pat god knows why but he did she picked up her coffee again sipped it while she gazed out the dark window pat took him up there some wild hair i expect max looking for a story or article or some shit and pat figuring he could have an adventure and make a few dollars the mountain can make you crazy thats what happened when he said nothing she touched a hand to his ive thought about it like you asked me to and i remember that max didnt come in here for damn near a month that winter maybe more back then this was the only place for miles in any direction you could get a hot meal and he was a regular i used to wait on him almost every night but he didnt come in absently she reached over broke a small chunk off nates dinner roll he called in orders a few times she said as she nibbled on bread we didnt do deliveries still dont but karl he was softhearted he ran the food over to the paper himself he told me max looked sick and a little crazy i didnt pay any attention i was brooding over pat and busy trying to make ends meet but you told me to think back and i did and i remember that all right you arent paying attention to me i heard everything you said he met her eyes who else didnt come in much that february she let out an impatient breath i dont know nate i only thought about max because hes dead and because i was remembering all of a sudden that carrie and i both got married that summer the summer after pat was gone thats what made me think of it okay now think about people who are still alive i think about you she laughed waved a hand oh dont get all tightassed a womans got a right to think about a goodlooking man not when hes in love with her daughter love she began to drum her fingers on the table well you are just out for all sorts of trouble arent you taking on the town council so everybodys looking at you sideways getting ed and hopp all pissed off now talking about loving meg she hasnt kept a man more than a month since she figured out what to do with one i guess that means i hold the current record shell chomp a piece out of your heart then spit it right in your face my heart my face why does it bother you charlene ive got bigger needs than she does bigger stronger needs her earrings spun and glinted when she tossed her head meg doesnt need anything or anyone she never did she made it clear a long time ago she didnt need me shell make it clear soon enough that she doesnt need you that may be or it may end up i make her happy maybe thats what bothers you the idea she might end up happy and you cant quite get there his hand snaked out gripped her wrist before she could hurl the coffee in his face think again he said quietly a scenes going to embarrass you a lot more than me she jumped violently out of the booth and stalked across the room up the stairs for the second time that day nate heard the bullet shot of a slammed door and in its echo he finished his dinner he drove out to megs hoping his blood would cool and his brain clear by the time he got there the gloom of the past few days had lifted leaving brilliant stars in a blackglass sky a slice of moon rode over the trees and a shimmery fog slithered low to the ground bare branches on the trees nate noticed the snow was still thick on the ground but the branches had shaken off the snow a part of the road was still flooded so he had to ease his way around the barricade and through the foot of standing water he heard a wolf call lonely and insistent it might be hunting he thought for food for a mate when it killed it killed for purpose not for greed not for sport when it mated hed read it mated for life the sound died off as he drove through the night he could see the smoke rise from megs chimney hear the soar of her music lenny kravitz this time he thought rocking on mists of doom and fields of pain he parked behind her then just sat he wanted this he realized wanted it maybe more than he should to come home to deal with the day then shake it off and come home to music and light to a woman the woman hearth and home meg had said well shed nailed him so if he ended up with that chunk of his heart spat in his face he had no one to blame but himself she opened the door as he walked up and the dogs rushed out to dance around him hi wondered if youd find your way to my door tonight she cocked her head you look a little rough around the edges chief whatve you been up to winning friends influencing people well come on inside cutie have a drink and tell me about it dont mind if i do light is it so small a thing to have enjoyd the sun to have lived light in the spring to have loved to have thought to have done to have advanced true friends and beat down baffling foes matthew arnold we burn daylight william shakespeare twentysix chief peach offered him a sticky bun and a cup of coffee almost before he got in the door you know you keep baking these things im not going to be able to sit in my desk chair itd take more than a few sticky buns to pork up that cute little behind besides its a bribe i need to ask if i can take an extra hour for lunch tomorrow im on the may day planning committee were going to meet tomorrow and try to finish coordinating the parade parade may day parade nate its on your calendar and not that far off may he thought hed played with the dogs a bit that morning in megs yard in snow up to the tops of his boots thatd be may first come hell or high water and weve had the parade in both school band marches the natives wear their traditional dress and play traditional instruments all the sports teams are in it and dolly mannerss dance classes more people who live here participate in it than watch it but we get tourists and outside folk come in from all over she fussed with the vase of plastic daffodils on her counter its a good time and the past couple years weve done some advertising we did even more this year drumming up media interest and whatnot charlene puts it on the lodges web page and does package deals and hopp pushed and got us included in the events page of a couple of magazines no kidding pretty hot stuff well it is its a fullday event we have a bonfire and more music that night weathers too bad we move that to the lodge you have a bonfire in the lodge she punched his arm playfully just the music take whatever time you need big parade nate thought bookings at the lodge meals served customers in the corner store browsing the local artists and craftsmens work more money more business at the bank the gas station more business period that could be cut considerably by too much talk of murder he glanced over when otto came in isnt it your day off yeah nate could see something in his eye but played it light you come by for the sticky buns no otto held out a manila envelope i wrote up where i was what i was doing and so forth in february of on the night max died and when yukon got killed thought itd be better all around if i put it down before you had to ask me why dont you come back to my office dont need to i got no problem with this he puffed out his cheeks a little problem maybe but less doing it like this than having you ask i dont have much of an alibi for any of the three situations but i wrote it down nate set down the bun to take the envelope i appreciate it otto well im going fishing he left passing peter on the way out hell nate muttered youre in a tight spot peach gave him a little rub on the arm youve got to do what youve got to do even if it means hurting feelings and getting danders up youre not wrong um peter looked back and forth between them something wrong with otto i hope not peter started to follow up but peach gave a quick shake of her head well the reason im late is my uncle came by this morning he wanted to tell me theres a guy squatting north of town by hopeless creek theres an old cabin there it looks like hes moved in nobodyd care much except my uncle thinks he may have broken into his work shed and my aunt says theres food missing from the cache he grabbed a sticky bun bit in he my uncle went by to check it out this morning before he came to see me and he says the guy came out with a shotgun and ordered him off his property since he had my cousin mary with him taking her into school he didnt hang around to reason with the guy all right well go reason with him nate set his untouched coffee and ottos envelope on the counter then went to the weapon cabinet and got two shotguns and ammo just in case reason doesnt work he told peter the sun was bright and hard it seemed impossible that only a few weeks before hed have made this trip in the dark the river wound beside the road cold blue forming a keen edge of color against the snow that still lined its banks the mountains stood clear as monuments carved in glass against the sky he saw an eagle perched on a mile marker post like a golden guard to the forest behind him how longs this cabin been empty nobodys lived in it officially as long as i can remember its rundown and built too close to the creek so it floods out every spring hikers might use it for a night now and then and ah kids might use it for you know chimneys still standing so itll hold a fire smokes something awful though meaning youve used it for you know even as he smiled color edged peters cheekbones maybe once or twice what i heard was a couple of cheechakos built it way back going to live off the land pan the creek for gold figured theyd get by on subsistence and after a year start collecting their pfd didnt know squat one of them froze to death the other went crazy with cabin fever maybe ate some of the dead guy lovely probably just bullshit but it adds to it when youre taking a girl there yeah pretty romantic stuff you want to turn off up there peter pointed its a little rough going after about three yards bumping and grinding his way along the narrow snowpacked rut nate decided peter was the master of understatement the trees were thick and smote out the sun so it was like driving through a tunnel paved by sadistic ice demons he rolled his tongue back so it wouldnt get in the way of his teeth when they snapped together and muscled the wheel he wouldnt have called it a clearing the dilapidated square of logs hunched in a hackedout square of trash willows and spindly evergreen on the icy bank of the spit of creek it huddled there in the shadows one window boarded the other crisscrossed with duct tape a sagging length of porch sat over a few stacked cinder blocks a filthy lexus fourwheeldrive with california tags stood in front call peach have her run those tags peter while peter used the radio nate debated there was smoke puffing sluggishly out of the tilted chimney and a dead mammal of some sort hung nastily over a post by the door nate unsnapped his weapon but left it holstered as he eased out of the car thats far enough the cabin door swung open in the dimness nate could see the man and the shotgun im chief burke lunacy police im going to ask you to lower that weapon i dont care who you say you are or what you say you want im onto your tricks you alien bastards im not going back up there aliens nate thought perfect the alien forces in this sector have been defeated youre safe here now but i need you to lower your weapon so you say but he eased out another foot how do i know youre not one of them early thirties nate estimated fiveten a hundred and fifty brown hair wild eyes color undetermined i have my id stamped and certified after testing you lower that weapon so i can approach ill show it to you id he looked confused now and the shotgun lowered an inch underground earth forces certified nate tried a sober nod cant be too careful these days they bleed blue you know i got two of them the last time they took me two nate lifted his eyebrows as if duly impressed and watched the gun lower another inch youre going to need to be debriefed well get you back to control get your statement on record we cant let them win we wont the gun barrel angled toward the ground and nate stepped forward it happened too fast it always happened too fast he heard peter open the car door say his name he was watching the mans face his eyes and he saw it come into them panic rage terror all at once he was already cursing already ordering peter to get down get down as he cleared his weapon from the holster the shotgun blast shook the air sent some bird screaming in the trees a second pumped out as nate dived for cover under the car he was set to roll out the other side when he saw the blood on the snow oh god oh jesus christ peter his body went to lead and for an endless moment he shook under the weight of it he could smell the alley the rain overripe garbage blood his breath came too fast the high edge of panic making his head light the bitter wash of despair turning his throat to dust he carried it all with him as he crawled through the snow peter was sprawled behind the open door of the car his eyes wide and glassy i think i think im shot hold on nate clamped a hand over peters arm where his jacket was torn and bloody he could feel the warm flow and the anvil slam of his own heart in his chest with one eye cocked toward the cabin he dug out a bandanna if there were prayers running inside his head he didnt recognize them its not too bad is it peter moistened his lips angled his head down to look and went white as bone man listen to me listen nate tied the bandanna tight over the wound tapped peters cheek to keep him from passing out you stay down youre going to be all right not going to bleed out on me not going to die in my arms not again please god he pulled peters weapon out of the holster closed peters hand around it you got this i im righthanded he shot me you can use your left he gets by me you dont hesitate listen to me peter he comes out here you shoot aim for body mass and you shoot until hes down chief just do it nate bellied back to the rear of the car opened the door and slid in he slid out again with both shotguns he could hear the man inside the house raving the occasional blast of fire he could hear the sounds of the alley merging with it the rain the shouts the running footsteps he bellied back to peter laid one of the shotguns over his lap you dont pass out hear me you stay awake yes sir there was no one to call for backup this wasnt baltimore and he was on his own crouched the shotgun in one hand his service revolver in the other he dashed across the icy stream and into the trees bark exploded he felt a knifesplice of a flying splinter hit his face just under his left eye that meant the shooters attention was on him now and away from peter in the cover of trees he plowed through the snow his partner was shot his partner was down his breath whistled out as he tried to run through kneedeep snow circling the cabin braced behind a tree he studied the layout no back door he noted but another window on the side he could see the shadow of the shooter on the glass knew he was waiting there watching for movement nate pumped the shotgun onehanded and fired glass exploded and with that sound the screams the return fire filling his ears he used his own tracks to run back toward the front of the cabin shouts and shots sounded behind him as he cracked through the ice of the stream scrambled through the frigid water and leaped toward the front of the house he barreled onto the sagging porch and kicked open the door he had both weapons pointed at his man and part of him most of him wanted to cut loose with them drop him drop him cold as he had the murdering bastard in baltimore the murdering bastard whod killed his partner and ripped his own life to pieces red in the shambles of the cabin the man looked at him his lips trembled into a smile your bloods red and dropping the gun he fell to the filthy cabin floor and wept his name was robert joseph spinnaker a financial consultant from la and a recent psychiatric patient he had claimed multiple alien abductions over the past eighteen months stated that his wife was a reproduction and attacked two of his clients during a meeting hed been listed as missing for nearly three months now he slept peacefully in a cell reassured by the color of the blood on nates face and peters arm nate had done little more than lock him up before hed rushed back to the clinic so he could pace the waiting room he went over the entire event a hundred times and each time he saw himself doing something different just a little different that kept peter from being hurt when ken came out nate was sitting his head in his hands he jerked up immediately how bad getting shots never good but it couldve been a hell of a lot worse hell be wearing a sling for a while hes lucky it was bird shot hes a little weak a little groggy im going to keep him a couple more hours but hes good okay nate let his knees give way and lowered to the chair again okay why dont you come back let me clean those cuts on your face just some scratches the one under your eyes more of a gash come on dont argue with the doctor can i see him nitas with him now you can see him after i treat you ken led the way gestured for nate to get on an exam table you know he said as he cleaned the cuts itd be stupid for you to blame yourself hes green hes grass and i took him into an unstable situation thats not showing much respect for him or the job he signed on to do nate hissed in a breath at the sting under his eye hes a baby hes not hes a man a good man and you taking on the weight lessens what happened to him today and what he did he got up broke cover and got to the door after me he could barely keep his feet but he came to back me up nate met kens eyes as ken fixed on a butterfly bandage his blood was on my hands but he came through the door to back me up so maybe im the one who cant handle himself you did handle yourself i got most of it from peter he thinks youre a hero if you want to pay him back for what happened dont disillusion him there ken stepped back youll live hopp was in the waiting room when nate came out along with peters parents and rose they all stood began talking at once hes resting hes fine ken assured them and nate kept walking ignatious hopp hurried out after him id like to know what happened im walking back then ill walk with you and you can tell me id like to get it straight from you rather than the various accounts blowing around town at this point he told her briefly would you slow down your legs are longer than my whole body howd your face get hurt tree shrapnel flying bark thats all flying because he was shooting at you for gods sake the fact my face got cut up is probably why both spinnaker and i are still standing fortunately i bleed red so does peter he thought hed bled plenty of red today the state police coming to get him peach is contacting them well she drew a breath hes been out and about being crazy for three months squatting out there god knows how long he could be the one who killed poor yukon he could be the one who did that nate found his sunglasses in his pocket and put them on he could be but hes not mans crazy and it was a crazy thing he couldve thought yukon was some alien in a dog suit it makes sense ignatious only if you believe this guy happened to sneak into town hunt up an old dog brought the dog outside town hall and sliced his throat having previously stolen the buck knife thats a little too broad for me hopp she took his arm so hed stop maybe because youd rather believe otherwise maybe because believing otherwise is giving you something to get your teeth into more than breaking up a few fights or keeping drunk mike from freezing his sorry ass did it ever occur to you that youre tying all this together looking for a killer among us because you want it to be so i dont want it to be so it is so damn stubborn she set her teeth turned to the side until she controlled her temper things wont settle down around here if you keep stirring them up things shouldnt settle down around here until theyre resolved ive got to go write up my report on this nate spent the night in the station most of it listening to spinnakers earnest reports of his alien experiences to keep him calm if not quiet nate sat outside the cell making notes and was deeply thrilled to see the state police arrive the next morning to relieve him of his prisoner he was also surprised to see coben on the detail maybe you should consider renting a room down here sergeant i figured this would be an opportunity to touch base on other matters if we could take a minute in your office sure ive got the paperwork on spinnaker for you he walked into his office picked up the paperwork assault with deadly on police officers et cetera the shrinks will soften that up but it wont make my deputy any less shot hows he doing hes okay hes young resilient it caught him mostly in the meaty part of the arm any time you walk away its a good day theres that coben walked over to the board still pursuing this looks like making any headway depends on where youre standing lips pursed coben rocked back on his heels dead dog youre linking that mans gotta have a hobby look im not fully satisfied with the resolution of my case but ive got restrictions on me a lot of it does depend on where youre standing we can agree there was an unidentified third man on that mountain when galloway was killed doesnt mean he killed galloway or had knowledge thereof doesnt mean hes still alive for that matter as its more logical that the individual who killed galloway also disposed of this third man not if the third man was hawbaker we dont believe it was but if it was coben continued it sure as hell doesnt mean this unidentified third man had anything to do with hawbakers death or the death of some dog ive got a little wiggle room unofficially to confirm the identity of the third man but its not taking me anywhere the pilot who took them up was killed in unexplained circumstances theres no proof of that ive looked into it kijinski paid off some debts and made more during the period between galloways death and his own so thats hinky ill give you that but theres no one to confirm he took them up because all but one of thems dead there are no records no flight logs no nothing and nobody who knew kijinski or will admit to it who remembers him booking that flight he may very well have been the pilot and if so its just as logical to assume hawbaker disposed of him as well might be logical except max hawbaker didnt kill three men and he didnt come back from the grave and slit that dogs throat it doesnt matter what your gut tells you i need something solid give me time nate said two days later meg strolled into the station flipped a wave at peach and went straight back to nates office a glance at his board barely broke her stride okay cutie im springing you sorry even thoughtful dedicated hardworking cops get a day off youre due peters on inactive were a man short and youre sitting here brooding about that and everything else you need headclearing time burke if something comes up well head back from where its a surprise peach she called as she started back out your boss is taking the rest of the day off what do they call it on nypd blue personal time he could use some you can cover it cant you otto meg nate began peach whens the last time the chief took a day off three weeks a little more by my recollection headclearing time chief meg grabbed his jacket off the hook herself weve got a clear day for it he took one of the twoways an hour she smiled well start with that when he spotted her plane at the dock he stopped dead you didnt say this headclearing time involved flying its the best method guaranteed couldnt we just take a drive have sex in the backseat of the car i find thats a really good method trust me she kept his hand firmly in hers and used her other to brush the cut under his eye hows that feeling now that you mention it i probably shouldnt fly with a wound like this she cupped his face leaned in and kissed him long slow and deep come with me nate i have something i want to share with you well when you put it that way he got in the plane strapped in you know ive never taken off from the water not when the water was wet theres still some ice it wouldnt be good to run into the ice right a man who faces down an armed mental patient shouldnt be so jittery about flying she kissed her fingers tapped them on buddy hollys lips and began to glide over the water sort of like water skiing but not nate managed then held his breath as she gained speed kept holding it as the plane lifted off the water i thought you were working today he said when he decided it was safe to breathe again i passed it to jerk hell be dropping off supplies later weve got parade stuff coming in including a whole case of bug dope you and jerk run drugs for insects she slid her eyes in his direction insect repellant cutie you survived your first alaska winter now well see how you fare in the summer with mosquitoes as big as bs you wont want to walk three feet out of the house without your bug dope roger on the bug dope but im not eating eskimo ice cream jesse says its made from whipped seals oil she said on a laugh seal oil or moose tallow and its not bad if you mix in some berries and sugar ill take your word because im not eating moose tallow i dont even know what the hell it is she smiled again because his shoulders had relaxed and he was actually looking down pretty from here isnt it with the river the ice and the town all lined up behind it it looks quiet and simple but its not its not really either of those the bush looks quiet too from the air peaceful and serene a harsh kind of beauty but its not serene nature will kill you without a minutes thought and in nastier ways than a crazy guy with a gun it doesnt make her any less beautiful i couldnt live anywhere else i couldnt be anywhere else she soared over river and lake and he could see the progress of breakup the steady march of spring patches of green spread as the sun worked on the snow a waterfall rushed down a cliff side with the sparkle of ice gleaming out of deep shadows below them a small herd of moose lumbered across a field above the sky curved like a wild blue ribbon jacob was here that february meg glanced at him i wanted to get that out of the way maybe off both our minds he came to see me a lot when my father was gone i dont know if my father asked him to or if it was just jacobs way there mightve been a couple days here and there i didnt see him but not as much as a week at a stretch not a long enough time for him to have climbed with my father i wanted you to know that for certain in case you needed to ask him to help you it was a long time ago yeah and i was a kid but i remember that once i thought back on it i remembered i saw more of him than i did of charlene in those first few weeks after my father left he took me ice fishing and hunting and when we had a storm come in i stayed at his place for a couple of days im telling you that you can trust him thats all all right now look to starboard he glanced right and watched them fly off the edge of the world over a channel of blue water that seemed entirely too close for comfort before he could object he saw an enormous chunk of that bluewhite world crack off and tumble into the water my god this is an active tidewater glacier and what youre watching is called calving she said as other boulders of ice broke and fell i guess because in the cycle its more a kind of birth than death its beautiful he was all but plastered against the windscreen now its amazing jesus some of them are the size of a house he let out a laugh as another shot off into the air and barely registered the shimmy of the plane in a pocket of turbulence people pay me good money to fly them over here to see this then spend most of their time with their eyes glued to the lens of a video camera seems like a waste to me if they want to see this on a movie they should rent one it wasnt just the show nate thought the spectacle of it it was that cycle violent inevitable somehow mythic the sights jagged boulders of blue ice heaving themselves into the air the sounds of it creaks the thunder and the cannon shots the gushing up of the water on impact the rising of the white into a shimmering island that streamed along on the churning fjord i have to stay here she guided the plane up circling so he could watch from another angle here in the air no he turned his head grinned at her in a way she rarely saw easy and relaxed and happy here i cant be anyplace else either its good to know that heres something else that might be good to know im in love with you she laughed as the plane shuddered through rough air then she punched it through and bulleted up the channel while ice fell around them twentyseven charlene had always loved what passed for spring in alaska she loved the way the days kept stretching out longer and longer until there was nothing but light in her office she stood at the window her work neglected on her desk and stared out at the street busy people walking driving going coming townspeople and tourists country dwellers in for supplies or company fourteen of her twenty rooms were booked and shed be at capacity for three days the following week after that the strong almost endless light would draw people in like flies to honey shed work like a dog through most of april into may and straight through until freezeup she liked to work to have her place crowded with people the noise and the mess they made the money they spent shed built something here hadnt she shed found what she wanted or most of what she wanted she looked out to the river boats were on it now slipping their way through the melting islands of ice she looked beyond the river beyond to the mountains white and blue with green beginning to spread slowly very slowly at their feet white at their peaks forever white in that frozen foreign world shed never climbed she never would the mountains had never called to her but other things had pat had shed felt that call blow through her a thousand trumpets when hed roared into her life not yet seventeen she remembered and still a virgin stuck hadnt she been stuck in those flat iowa fields just waiting for someone to pluck her out the original midwestern farm girl she thought now desperate for any escape then hed come churning up all that dull air on his motorcycle looking so dangerous and exotic and different oh hed called to her charlene remembered and shed answered that call sneaking out of the house on those chilly spring nights to run to him to roll naked with him on the soft green grass free and careless as a puppy and so desperately in love that burning blistering love maybe you could only feel at seventeen when hed gone shed gone with him walking out on home family friends speeding away from the world she knew and into another on the back of a harley to be seventeen she thought and that daring again theyd lived how theyd lived going wherever they wanted doing whatever they liked through farmland and desert through city and tiny town and all the roads theyd wandered had led here things had changed when had they changed she wondered when she realized she was pregnant theyd been so thrilled so stupidly thrilled about the baby but things had changed when theyd come here with that seed planted inside her when shed told him shed wanted to stay sure charley no problem we can stick around awhile a while had become a year then two then a decade and god god shed been the one to change to push and prod at that wonderful reckless boy to nag and hound him to be a man to be what hed run from responsible settled ordinary hed stayed more for meg she knew more for the daughter who was the image of him than for the woman whod given him that child hed stayed but hed never settled shed resented him for that resented meg how could she do otherwise she wasnt built to do otherwise shed been the one to work hadnt she to make sure there was food on the table and a roof over their heads and she knew when hed gone off to pick up jobs to take a break to climb his damn mountains that hed gone to whores men wanted her she could make any man want her and the only one she really wanted had gone to whores what were his mountains but other whores cold white whores that had seduced him away from her until hed stayed inside one and left her alone but shed survived hadnt she shed done better than survive shed found what she wanted here most of what she wanted she had money now she had her place she had men young hard bodies in the night so why was she so unhappy she didnt like to think long thoughts to look inside herself and worry about what shed find there she liked to live to move to keep in motion you didnt have to think when you were dancing she turned vaguely irritated by the knock on her door come on in she smoothed her face out and the sultry smile was automatic when she saw john well hi there goodlooking school out its that late already she patted her hair as she looked at her desk and here ive been daydreaming wasting the day away im going to have to get out there and see what big mikes whipping up for tonights special i need to talk to you charlene sure honey ive always got time for you ill make us some tea and well get all cozy no dont baby you look all frowny and serious she crossed to him and skimmed a finger down each of his cheeks of course you know i love when youre serious its so sexy dont he said again and took her hands is something wrong her fingers tightened on his like wires oh god is someone something else dead around here i dont think i can take it i dont think i can stand it no its nothing like that he let go of her hands eased back a step i wanted to tell you ill be leaving at the end of the semester youre taking a vacation youre going to be taking a trip just when lunacys at its best im not taking a vacation im leaving whatre you talking about leave for good thats just nonsense john the flirty smile faded and something hot and sharp stabbed in her belly where would you go what would you do there are a lot of places i havent seen a lot of things i havent done ill see them ill do them she felt her heart sink as she looked up into his dependable face the ones who matter her mind whispered leave you john you live here you work here ill live and ill work somewhere else you cant just why why are you doing this i shouldve done it years ago but you get into the drift float your life away nate came to see me at school last week some of the things he said made me think made me look back over too many years she wanted to find her anger the sort that pushed her to shout to break things the sort that swept her clean but there was only dull worry what does nate have to do with this hes the change or the rock in the stream that caused the change you drift charlene like water in a stream and maybe you dont notice as much as you should whats going by he touched her hair then dropped his hand again then a stone drops into the stream and it disrupts it changes things maybe a little maybe a lot but nothings quite the same again i never know what youre talking about when you go on like that she pouted as she turned around and kicked at her desk and the gesture made him smile water and rocks and streams what does that have to do with you coming in here like this and telling me youre leaving youre going away dont you even care how i feel entirely too much for my own good i loved you the first minute i saw you you knew it but not anymore yes then now all the years between i loved you when you were with another man and when he was gone i thought now shell come to me and you did to my bed at least you let me have your body but you married someone else even knowing i loved you you married someone else i had to do what was right for me i had to be practical she did throw something now a little crystal swan but its destruction gave her no satisfaction i had a right to look out for my future i wouldve been good to you and for you id have been good to meg but you chose differently you chose this he spread his hands to indicate the lodge you earned it you worked hard you built it up and while karl was alive you still came to me and i let you to me and to others karl wasnt after sex or hardly he wanted a partner someone to take care of him and this place i kept my end she said passionately we had an understanding you took care of him and this place and when he died you kept taking care ive lost track of the times ive asked you to marry me charlene the number of times youve said no the number of times ive watched you go off with someone else or slide into my bed when there wasnt someone else im done with it i dont want to get married so youre just going to take off you slept with that man the other night part of the hunting group the tall one with dark hair she jerked up her chin so what what was his name she opened her mouth realized her mind was blank she couldnt remember a face much less a name and barely remembered the groping in the dark what do i care she snapped out it was just sex youre not going to find what youre looking for not with nameless men nearly half your age but if you have to keep looking i cant stop you thats been clear enough right from the start of this but i can stop being your fallback position go on then she scooped up a pile of paperwork from her desk threw it into the air i wont care i know if you did really did i wouldnt go he stepped out of the room and closed the door behind him he was dazzled by the light nate couldnt get enough of it no matter how long the day lasted he wanted more he could feel it penetrating flesh and bone charging him he hadnt woken from a nightmare in days he woke to light worked and walked through it in the day he thought in it and ate in it he soaked in it and each night he watched the sun slide down behind the mountains he knew it would rise again in a few hours there were still nights when hed slip out of megs bed walk out with the dogs for company to watch the lights play havoc with the night sky he could still feel the wound throbbing under the scars on his body but he thought the pain was a healing one now he hoped to god it was a kind of acceptance for what hed lost and an opening to what he could have for the first time since hed left baltimore he called jacks wife beth i just wanted to know how you were you and the kids were okay were good its been a year since he knew a year today todays a little rough we went out this morning took him flowers the firsts are the hardest the first holiday first birthday first anniversary but you get through it and its a little easier i thought hoped youd call today im so glad you did i wasnt sure youd want to hear from me we miss you nate me and the kids i worry about you im okay too better tell me what its like there is it awfully cold and quiet actually its around sixty today as for quiet he looked over at his board yeah yeah its pretty quiet weve had some flooding not as bad as in the southeast but enough to keep us busy its beautiful he turned to his window now like nothing you can imagine you have to see it and even then its hard to imagine you sound good im glad you sound good i didnt think id make it here anywhere i wanted to i didnt care so much until i got here until i was here and then i wanted to but i didnt think i would now i think i will beth i met someone oh there was a laugh in her voice and he closed his eyes to hear it is she wonderful spectacular in so many ways i think youd like her shes not like anybody else shes a bush pilot a bush pilot isnt that one of those people who fly around in those tiny planes like maniacs pretty much shes beautiful well shes not but she is shes funny and tough and shes probably crazy but it fits her her names meg megan galloway and im in love with her oh nate im so happy for you dont cry he said when he heard the tears no its good jack would find a million ways to tease you but under it hed have been happy for you too well anyway i just wanted to tell you i just wanted to talk to you and tell you and say that maybe sometime you and the kids could come up its a great place for a summer vacation by june it wont be dark till midnight and then they tell me its more like twilight than dark and its warmer than you think or so they tell me id like you to see it to meet meg id like to see you and the kids i can promise well come for the wedding his laugh was a little jerky i havent moved in that direction i know you nate you will when he hung up he was smiling the last thing hed expected he left the board uncovered a kind of symbol that he was investigating in the open now and walked out of his office it still gave him a jolt to see peter with his arm in a sling the young deputy sat at his desk punching keys onehanded desk duty paperwork detail a cop and thats what the kid was could die of sheer boredom nate walked over want to get out of here peter looked up one finger of his good hand poised over the keyboard sir want me to uncuff you from that desk for a while light came into his face yes sir lets take a walk he grabbed a twoway peach deputy notti and i are on foot patrol um ottos already out peter told him hey crime could be rampant out there for all we know peach youve got the helm aye aye captain she said with a snicker you boys be careful nate took a light jacket from a peg want yours he asked peter nah only lower ers need a jacket on a day like this that so well then deliberately nate rehung the jacket outside it was brisk enough and overcast rain was probably on its way and undoubtedly nate thought hed regret the gesture of leaving the jacket before they were finished but he headed down the sidewalk with the damp frisky air blowing through his hair hows the arm pretty good i dont think i need the sling but between peach and my mother its not worth the grief women get all fussy when a guy gets himself shot tell me about it and try to be you know stoic about it and theyre all over you i havent talked to you too much about the incident initially i told myself id made a mistake taking you out there i spooked him when i got out of the car incited the situation a squirrel dropping an acorn wouldve spooked him peter i said initially i told myself id made a mistake the fact is i didnt youre a good cop you proved it you were down you were hurt and dazed but you backed me up you had the situation controlled you didnt need backup i might have thats the point when you stand with someone in a volatile situation you have to be able to trust him no reservations the way he and jack had trusted each other he thought so youd go through the door into the alley no matter what waited in the dark i want you to know i trust you i i thought you had me on the desk because you were trying to ease me out ive got you on the desk because youre injured in the line peter a commendation regarding your actions during the incident is going in your file peter stopped stared a commendation you earned it itll be announced at the next town hall meeting i dont know what to say stoic works they crossed the street at the corner to swing up the other side i have something else to tell you and its sensitive regarding the investigation our department is conducting the homicides he caught peters quick glance whatever the state police have determined this department is treating them as homicides i have several statements from individuals giving their whereabouts during the times in question most of those statements however cant be corroborated at least not to my satisfaction that includes ottos oh but chief ottos one of us i know but i cant cross him off the list because hes one of us there are a lot of people in this town or outlying it who had the opportunity for these three crimes motives a different thing the motive for the two subsequent arrow back to galloway what was the motive for his murder crime of passion gain coverup druginduced maybe a combination of those motives but whoever it was he knew nate scanned the streets the sidewalks sometimes it was what you knew that waited in the dark he knew them well enough to do that winter climb with his killer and with max just the three of them he knew his killer well enough to indulge in i guess wed call it roleplaying while they were up there enduring harsh conditions i dont understand what you mean he had a journal it was on him and left on him coben gave me a copy but if he had a journal then he never used the names of his companions they were on some sort of lark the kind that tells me if he hadnt been killed up there then hed have died on some other climb unless hed straightened up they were smoking grass popping speed playing star wars galloway as luke max as han solo and ironically enough galloways killer in the darth vader role the mountain became that ice world they were on hoth i like the movies peter added with a little hunch to his shoulders i collected the action figures and stuff when i was a kid me too but these werent kids they were grown men and somewhere along the line the game got out of hand galloway wrote how han i believe that was max injured his ankle they left him behind in a tent with some provisions and kept going that proves max didnt kill him depends on how you angle it you could speculate that max decided to follow caught up with them in the ice cave and went crazy you could further speculate that max held the vader role and killed both his playmates those arent my personal theories but theyre theories and the state accepts the second one that mr hawbaker killed both guys then got himself down alone i cant see it why well i know i was just a little kid when all this happened but mr hawbaker never had a rep for being you know bold and um selfsufficient youd have to be both to handle that descent i agree later in the journal galloway wrote that the darth character was showing signs of lets call it lunacy anger risk taking accusations a lot of drugs involved in this and from what ive read a byproduct of the strain altitude sickness the high some climbers get from being up there nate watched deb come out of the corner store to take cecil for a walk the dog was wearing a bright green sweater galloway was worried worried about this guys state of mind he continued as he casually exchanged waves with deb about getting them all down safe his last journal entry was written in the ice cave he never got out of it so he was right to be worried but he still wasnt worried enough to take definite steps to protect himself there were no defensive wounds on the body his own ice ax was still in his belt he knew his killer just like max knew his just like yukon knew the man who slit his throat we know him too peter he sent another wave to judge royce who strode toward klun with a cigar clamped between his teeth we just havent recognized him yet what do we do we keep going through what we know we keep working with the layers until we know more im not telling otto about the journal not yet god this is tougher on you these are people youve known all your life or a good part of it he nodded down the street where harry stood on the sidewalk outside the corner store catching a smoke and talking to jim mackie across from them ed walked briskly in the direction of the bank but stopped to exchange a word with the post mistress who was out sweeping her stoop big mike came out of the lodge and jogged undoubtedly heading for the italian place and his daily bout of shoptalk with johnny trivani his little girl let out belly laughs as she rode his shoulders just people but one of them out here on the street inside one of these buildings or houses in a cabin outside of town is a killer if he has to hell kill again he went to megs every evening she wasnt always there jobs were picking up as the weather warmed but they had an unspoken agreement that he would come and stay hed tend the dogs see to some of the chores he was leaving his things there such as they were little by little another unspoken agreement he kept his room at the lodge but it was more a storage area for his heavy winter gear at this point he couldve moved that to megs too but that wouldve been the line the official werelivingtogether line he saw the smoke from her chimney before he made the turn and his mood cranked up another notch but there was no plane on the lake and it was jacobs truck in her drive the dogs bolted out of the woods to greet him with rock carting one of the mastodon bones they liked to gnaw on it looked fresh to nate and he left the dogs playing an energetic tugofwar with it as he went inside nate could smell blood before he was halfway to the kitchen instinctively his hand went to the butt of his weapon i brought meat jacob said without turning around there were a couple of thick planks of something bloody on the counter nate relaxed his hand she doesnt have much time to hunt these days bear are awake its good meat for stew meat loaf bear meat loaf nate thought what a world im sure shell appreciate it we share what we have jacob continued calmly wrapping bear meat in thick white paper she told you i was with her most days during the time her father was taken was taken thats an interesting way to put it his life was taken from him wasnt it jacob finished wrapping the meat then picked up a black marker and wrote a date on the packages it was such a housewifely gesture that nate blinked she told you this but you dont trust her memory or her heart i trust her she was a child jacob washed his hands in the sink she could be mistaken or could because she loves me be protecting me she could jacob dried his hands picked up the packages of meat when he turned nate saw he wore an amulet around his neck a dark blue stone over a faded denim shirt ive talked to people he walked into the little mudroom where meg kept a small chest freezer people who arent so willing to talk to police people who knew pat and twotoes he began to stack packages in the freezer im told by these people who will talk to me and not the police that when pat was in anchorage he had money more money than was usual for him he closed the freezer walked back into the kitchen im having a whiskey now whered he get the money he worked a few days at a cannery took an advance on his pay im told he used it to play poker jacob poured three fingers of whiskey into a glass held a second glass up with a question on his face no thanks i believe this may be true because he liked to play and though he often lost he would consider it payment for the entertainment it seems this time he didnt lose he played two nights and most of one day those who talk to me say his winnings were big some say ten thousand others twenty others more it may be like a fish and grows bigger with the telling but theres agreement that he played and won and had money what did he do with the money that no one knows or admits to knowing but some say they saw him last drinking with other men this isnt unusual so no one can say who the men were and why should they remember such a thing over so long a time there was a whore jacobs lips curved just a little there always is kate i havent been able to locate her whoring kate she died maybe five years ago heart attack jacob added she was a very large woman and smoked two maybe three packs of camels a day her death wasnt much of a surprise another dead end nate thought did these people who talk to you but not to cops tell you anything else some say twotoes flew pat and two others or three others no more than that to climb some say to climb denali some say no name some say deborah the details arent clear but theres memory of the money the pilot the climb and two or three companions jacob sipped his whiskey or i could be lying and be the one who climbed with him you could nate acknowledged itd be ballsy a man who hunts down a bears got balls jacob smiled a man who hunts down a bear eats well i believe you but i could be lying this time jacob laughed and downed the rest of the whiskey you could but since were in megs kitchen and she has love for us both we can pretend to believe each other she has more light now shes always been bright but now shes brighter and she burns off the shadows in you she can take care of herself but he took the glass to the sink rinsed it set it to drain then turned back take care with her chief burke or ill hunt you down noted nate replied when jacob walked out twentyeight nate bid his time it seemed he had plenty of it since he made it a point to stop by the lodge restaurant and see jesse daily it wasnt a problem to find an opportunity for a private word with charlene he found rose taking advantage of a midmorning lull by sitting down in a booth refilling condiment dispensers dont get up he said when she started to slide out wheres my buddy today we have cousins down from nome so jesse has playmates for a few days hes been showing off his uncle the deputy she said with a smile but he wants to bring them all into town to meet his good friend chief nate really he could feel his own grin spreading from ear to ear tell him to bring them on and well give them a tour of the station and hed radio meg see if she could find him a bunch of toy badges when she picked up supplies you wouldnt mind id get a kick out of it he leaned over to take a peek at willow in her carrier shes awfully pretty he could say it with truth now her cheeks had grown plump and sort of pinchable and her eyes so dark seemed to latch on to his as if she knew things he didnt he held out a finger willow wrapped hers around it shook it is charlene in her office no in the storeroom off the kitchen doing inventory okay if i go back youll want a flak jacket rose warned as she dumped ketchup into a bright red squeeze bottle shes been in a mood the last few days ill risk it nate peter told us about the commendation hes so proud were so proud thank you i didnt do anything he did since her eyes filled he made his escape quickly big mike was at the counter making what looked like enough salad to feed an army of rabbits he had the radio on to local and yoyo mas deep and passionate cello streamed out crab florentine a la mikes the lunch special he called out buffalo salad for the heartier appetites yum you going in there mike asked when nate turned toward the storeroom better take a sword and shield so i hear but nate opened the door and since you could never tell with charlene left it open for safetys sake it was a large chilly room lined with metal shelves that were loaded with canned and dry goods a couple of tall coolers held tubs of perishables with a chest freezer squeezed in between them charlene stood among them briskly scribbling on a clipboard well i know where to head in case of thermonuclear war she flipped him a glance one that held none of her usual steamy comeon im busy i can see that i just want to ask you a question nothing but questions out of you she muttered then raised her voice to a shout id like to know why were down to two cans of kidney beans big mikes answer was to turn the radio up charlene give me a couple of minutes and ill be out of your way fine fine fine she slapped the clipboard against a shelf hard enough that nate heard the wood crack im just trying to run a business here why should that matter to anybody im sorry about whatevers bothering you and ill make this as quick as i can do you know anything about galloway having substantial poker winnings between the time he left here and when he went up the mountain she made a sound of derision as if then her eyes narrowed what do you mean substantial a few thousand anyway ive got a source that says he mightve played a couple of nights and hit if there was a game he probably played he hardly ever won though and hardly ever won more than a couple hundred if he got lucky there was that one time in portland he won about three thousand and we blew it on a fancy hotel room a big steak dinner a couple bottles of champagne from room service he bought me an outfit for it a dress and shoes and a pair of little sapphire earrings her eyes went shiny but she shook her head and shoulders briskly and dried the tears up on her own stupid i had to sell the earrings in prince william to pay for motorcycle repairs and supplies lot of good they did me if he had won money what would he have done with it pissed it away no she laid her forehead on one of the shelf posts and looked so tired so lost so sad that he risked rubbing her shoulder no not right then he knew i was on a tear about money if hed gotten his hands on some hed have played a little maybe but hed have held on to the bulk of it so he could bring it home and shut me up would he have banked it in anchorage we didnt have a bank in anchorage hedve stuffed it in his pack and hauled it home for me to deal with he didnt have any respect for money a lot of people that come from it dont she lifted her head are you saying there was money im saying theres a possibility he never sent any home that time he never sent home a dime if he had money and was going on a climb hed have left it stuffed in a drawer if he kept his room or if he didnt keep his room hed have taken it with him the state police didnt say anything about money he didnt have any on him none nate thought as he went out again no wallet no id no cash no pack just matches and the journal zipped into the pocket of his parka on the sidewalk he took out his notebook he wrote down money circled it the saying was follow the woman he thought but a cop knew if money was around murder you always always followed the money he wondered how he could find out if anyone in lunacy had come into a tidy little windfall sixteen years before of course it was just as likely galloway kept a room left the money in it and the maid the owner or the next person to occupy it just got really lucky or hed taken it with him in his pack his killer hadnt opened it up before hed tossed it into a handy crevice but why should the killer take the pack at all if not for a reason for supplies and woohoo look what else weve got here or just to dump it in a panic thinking if the body was found it wouldnt be identifiable but if there had been money nate was willing to bet the killer had known it was there and had helped himself who people might wonder why theyre paying taxes so the chief of police can daydream out on the street he shook himself back looked down at hopp are you everywhere as often as possible im on my way in to get a cup of coffee and brood and plot she wore irritation on her face as visibly as she wore her greenchecked shirt whats up john malmont just tendered his resignation says hes leaving at the end of the school year leaving teaching leaving lunacy we cant afford to lose him she took out her zippo but only stood snapping the top open and shut talk around town was she was wearing the patch hes a superior teacher and added to that hes helping carrie with the lunatic he runs all the school plays heads up the yearbook committee puts us on the tourist map with articles he gets published in magazines ive got to sit down and figure out how to keep him did he say why he decided to leave all of a sudden just that it was time for a change one minute were planning our summer book club which he heads up and the next hes packing son of a bitch she rolled her shoulders im having coffee and pie pie a la mode she snapped the lighter violently thatll get the brain cells working hes not leaving without a fight interesting nate thought interesting timing burke had to go that was the bottom line now poking and prodding into matters that were none of his business well there was more than one way to run a painintheass cheechako out of town there were those who said burke had risen above that status now that hed survived his first winter but he knew some remained cheechakos no matter what they survived galloway had been one when push came to shove hed been gutless and mewling and sneaky most of all sneaky the man had been an asshole pure and simple why should anyone give a damn that he was dead done what had to be done he told himself as he carried the heavy plastic bags through the woods just like he was doing what had to be done now burke would be dealt with another gutless mewling sneaky asshole oh my wife left me for another man woe is me oh i got my partner killed boo hoo i have to run away where nobody knows me so i can wallow in my own muck of selfpity but that wasnt good enough had to try to be a big shot to take over what wasnt his could never be his yeah hed be dealt with and life would get back to normal he hung the plastic bags in the trees closest to the house while the dogs whined and batted their tails not this time boys he said aloud and hung another from the eave by the back door just out of sight of the doorway not this time fellas he gave the dogs a brisk rub but they were more interested in sniffing at and licking his hands he liked the dogs hed liked yukon but that old dog had been half blind arthritic and damn near deaf on top of it putting him down had been a mercy really and had made a point he walked back toward the woods stopping at the edge to look back there were some patches of earth where the snow was busily melting in the sun where the rains had washed it clear a few sprigs of green were rising out of it spring he thought and once the ground thoroughly warmed theyd bring pat galloway home for the last time he planned to stand at the grave site with his head respectfully bowed it was just softening to twilight when nate got home he waited by the side of the road while meg walked over from the lake over boggy green with thinning patches of snow he noted she carried a box of supplies and wore a bright red shirt that made him think of some flashy tropical bird wanna trade she looked at the pizza box he held sniffed at it no i got it and your toy badges but i like a man who brings dinner howd you know for sure id be back for dinner or were you planning on eating all that yourself i heard your plane finished up what i was doing walked up to the italian place and got this figured youd have to offload your cargo and the timing would be pretty close close to perfect im starved she carted the supplies into the house and straight back to the kitchen and it so happens one of the things i picked up today is whats billed as an exceptional cabernet she pulled out the bottle you game sure in a minute he set the pizza aside laid his hands on her shoulders and kissed her hi hi cutie grinning she grabbed his hair yanked him down for a harder longer kiss hello boys she crouched down for a quick rub and wrestle with her dogs didja miss me huh didja we all did last night we consoled ourselves with a bear bone and mac and cheese jacob supplied the bone and the bear meat thats in your freezer umm good she pulled out a plastic bag shook it so the contents jingled then tossed it to him inside he found silver pinon stars cool you said seven but i got you a dozen you can have some on hand if you want to deputize more kids thanks what do i owe you youre running a tab well catch up open that bottle will you chief she slid her hand in the pizza box and tore off a slice missed lunch she said with her mouth full had to set down a little engine trouble and it cost me a couple of hours what kind of engine trouble nothing dire all fixed now but i could use pizza and wine a hot shower and a man who knows how to rub me in all the right places looks like we can handle all of that you keep getting this halfsmile going on whats that about things you want to sit down and eat or are you just going to stand there and stuff it in your face stand here she took another huge bite stuff okay should this breathe or something not when im washing down pizza with it gimme he poured her a glass and another for himself then he pulled out a slice and leaned back on the counter to eat it you know the day peter was shot hard to forget he used to follow me and rose around like a puppy hes doing okay right hes fine but that day when i saw the blood on the snow when i got to him and had his blood on my hands part of my mind wiped out no more rolled back to jack i was back in that alley again i could see it hear it smell it and i wanted to sink away somehow just go away thats not the way i heard it thats what was going on inside hed get this out first nate thought make sure she saw him as hed been as he was and as he hoped to be it seemed like a long time a long time crouched there in the snow with him bleeding on me but it wasnt and i didnt sink away no you didnt you drew his fire away from peter thats not the point cutie she moved forward gave him a light kiss moved back again to lean on the counter youre such a cop i controlled the situation did the job and got everybody out of it alive i couldve killed him spinnaker he saw her take that in just a slight angling of her head i couldve done it and for an instant i considered it nobody wouldve questioned it hed shot my deputy shot at me he was armed and dangerous it wasnt like in the alley with jack then my partner was down my partner was dying he corrected and i was down and that son of a bitch kept coming he looked down at his wine while she listened while she waited he set it on the counter there was no choice and here i had one and i considered blowing him to hell you should know that you should know it was in me to do that do you expect me to care if you had he tried to kill my friend tried to kill you i wouldnt have cared nate i guess you should know thats in me it wouldve been wrong she finished for you for the man you are for the kind of cop you are so im glad you didnt your right and wrong are more defined than mine thats just the way it is it was a year ago that jack died sympathy swam into her eyes oh boy you just keep getting punched in the gut dont you no no i called beth on the day jacks wife i called her and it was good she was good and talking to her i realized iwasnt going to sink again i dont know when i got out of the pit exactly and sometimes the grounds still a little soft and unstable under my feet but im not going back down you never were she poured more wine in her glass i know people who have or who probably will the kind who fly into the side of a mountain on a clear day or go off into the bush to die i know them theyre part of the outer world i run in away from here burnedout pilots or some outsider who stumbles up here because he cant take the world anymore women beat down from being abused or neglected for so long theyll just lie down and let the next man kick them to death on the street you were sad nate and a little lost but you were never one of them youve got too much core to be one of them he said nothing for a moment then he reached out touched the ends of her hair you burned away my shadows huh the half smile came back to his lips marry me meg for a moment she stared at him those crystalblue eyes full power on his then she tossed the halfeaten slice of pizza into the box i knew it throwing her hands up she spun around on her heels and clomped around the kitchen with enough violence to have the dogs leaping up to sniff at her i just knew it give a guy some good sex a couple of hot meals soften up enough to say you love him and boom next breath its marriage talk didnt i tell you didnt i tell you she whirled around to jab a finger at him hearth and home tattooed on your butt looks like you nailed me dont you smirk at me a minute ago it was a halfsmile and you thought it was kind of cute i changed my mind what do you want to get married for i love you you love me so so her arms were still flapping around and now the dogs figured it was a game and made playful little lunges at her why do you want to screw that up just crazy i guess what are you chicken she sucked air in her nose and her eyes went to cold fire dont you play that crap on me you got marriage fear he leaned back on the counter picked up his glass again and sipped his wine the brave little bush pilot gets shaky in the knees when the m word comes up interesting my knees are not shaking you jerk marry me meg his halfsmile went full blown see you went pale i did not i did not i love you you bastard i want to spend my life with you goddamn it i want to have babies with you oh she gripped her hair and pulled as an indescribable sound ground out of her throat cut it out see he contemplated another slice of pizza chicken her right hand closed into a fist dont think i cant take you down burke you already did first time i saw you oh man the fist dropped to her side you think youre cute you think youre smart but what you are is stupid and simple youve already been through this marriage thing got the shit kicked out of you and here you are asking for more she wasnt you i wasnt me what the holy hell does that mean first parts easy theres nobody else like you im not who i was when i was with her different people make well different people im a better man with you meg you make me want to be a better man oh god dont say things like that she could feel her eyes burn the tears rising up from her heart were hot and strong youre the man you always were maybe you were shaky for a while but anybody is when theyve been beaten up and tossed aside im not better nate im selfish and contrary and i was going to say inconsiderate but i dont see why its inconsiderate to live your life the way you want im mean when i want to be i dont care about rules unless theyre mine and im here im still here in this place because im half crazy i know dont change i knew there was going to be trouble with you new years eve when i went with that stupid impulse and brought you out to see the northern lights you wore a red dress you think im such a girl ill go all squishy because you remember what color dress i wore you love me yeah she blew out a long breath wiped her hands over her wet cheeks yeah i do what a damn mess marry me meg youre just going to keep saying that arent you until i get an answer what if the answers no then ill wait work on you a little at a time and ask you again giving up doesnt work for me so im done with it you didnt give up you were just hibernating he smiled again look at you standing there i could look at you forever jesus nate her heart ached literally ached so she had to rub the heel of her hand over it and that ache she realized sweet at the center smothered out the panic you kill me marry me meg oh well she sighed then she laughed because the sweetness spread through everything else what the hell ill give it a shot she took a running leap that wouldve knocked him flat if he hadnt had his back to the counter her legs wrapped around his waist her mouth crushed down on his this goes south its on your head goes without saying ill be a terrible wife she rained kisses over his face his throat ill irritate you and make you crazy half the time ill fight dirty and ill stay pissed off when you win which will be rarely she leaned back framed his face with her hands but i wont lie to you i wont cheat and ill never let you down when it matters itll work for us he rested his cheek on hers and just breathed her in well make it work i dont have a ring youll need to rectify that asap and spare no expense okay laughing she leaned back way back so he had to shift his stance to keep a hold on her this is just crazy enough to be right she reared back up locked her arms around his neck i think its time we went upstairs and had insane engagement sex i was counting on that he hitched her up a bit and carried her out of the room when she nipped her teeth into his throat he took a shaky breath does it have to be upstairs how about on the stairs or just on the floor right here then later we could damn it the dogs ran barking to the door and an instant later he saw the glare of headlights cross the window lock all the doors meg murmured dreamily still working on his throat turn out all the lights well hide well get naked and hide too late but were going to remember where we were and after we get rid of whoever that is even if we have to kill them well pick it up again deal she hopped down hold she ordered the dogs who sat quivering at the door she opened it recognized the man who got out of the car friend she told the dogs then lifted a hand in greeting hey steven hey meg he bent to pet the dogs hi guys hi hows it going ah i saw peter and he said chief burke was out here i wanted to see him a minute if thats okay sure come on in outside boys time for a run hi steven howre you doing chief he shook hands with nate a lot better than the last time you saw me i wanted to thank you again in person and when i was a little more with it for what you did for me for us you too meg heard you kept all your digits ten fingers ten toes well nine and a half toes really lucky all of us were im sorry to bother you at home i mean when youre off duty its no problem go ahead and sit down meg invited you want some wine a beer hes underage nate said even as steven started to accept and hes driving cops meg grumbled always pooping on the party maybe a coke or something if youve got it handy sure steven sat drummed his fingers on his knees im home for a couple of days spring break i wanted to come sooner but ive got a lot of stuff to catch up on missed a lot of classes when i was out you know you making them up yeah putting in a lot of long nights but im making up time i wanted to come when i heard about yukon his voice trembled and the fingers on his knees dug in im sorry i remember when we got him i was just a kid and he was this goofy ball of fluff its hard hardest on my mom he was like her baby or something i dont know what id do if anyone hurt my dogs meg said as she came back into the room she handed nate one of the glasses of wine she had in each hand then took the can of coke under her arm and gave it to steven i know youre doing all you can somebody told me you had some crazy guy around jesus he shot peter he shook his head as he opened the can and some think maybe this guy did that to yukon but you dont think so nate prompted yukon was friendly but he wouldnt have gone with a stranger i just dont think hed have gone with somebody he didnt know not without a fight he was old and mostly blind but he wouldnt have left the yard with somebody he didnt know he drank deep anyway thats not why i came by i just wanted to get that out its about this he hitched up his hips as he dug in the front pocket of his jeans he pulled out a small silver earring in the shape of a maltese cross it was in the cave he said nate took it you found this in the cave with galloway scott did actually i forgot about it i guess we all did he saw this about a foot from he glanced at meg from the body sorry its okay he chipped it out i dont know why something to do he put it in his pack by the time we all got off the mountain the shape we were in the hospital and shit he just forgot about it he found it in his stuff and remembered and gave it to me because i was coming home we thought it was probably your fathers meg so you should have it then i thought how it should probably go through the cops first so i figured i should bring it to chief burke did you show this to sergeant coben nate asked no scott passed it to me right before i left to come home and i wanted to get home i thought it was all right to do it through you thats fine thanks for bringing it by i dont know if it was his meg said when she was alone with nate it couldve been he wore an earring he had a few i cant remember exactly a couple of studs a gold hoop but it mightve been his it couldve been something he bought in anchorage while he was gone it might have been his killers nate finished studying the earring in his palm are you going to give it to coben im going to think about it awhile put it away will you can we put it away for tonight i dont want to be sad nate slipped it into the breast pocket of his shirt buttoned it closed okay okay she laid her head on his shoulder laid a hand over the pocket you can show it to charlene tomorrow maybe shed know but for now she set her hands on his shoulders boosted herself up again where were we i think we were over there and now were here and look theres a nice comfy couch behind you how quick can you get me naked on it lets find out he dropped backward pulling her around at the last minute so she fell laughing under him her legs were still hooked around him as she tugged his shirt out of his pants scraped her nails up his back i expect you to ring the big bell tonight since im an engagementsex virgin im going to work my way up to the big bell he unbuttoned her shirt taking his lips on a trail down the opening to the button of her jeans ring all the little ones on the way up i admire a man with ambition she felt his tongue slide over her his teeth scrape over exposed flesh as he peeled the jeans down her legs she was going to marry this man imagine that ignatious burke with his big sad eyes and strong hands a man just packed with patience and needs and courage and honor she brushed a hand through his hair shed done nothing in her life to deserve him and somehow that made it all that much more wonderful then his teeth nibbled along her inner thigh her system shuddered and she stopped thinking altogether he worked his way up her and down her over her around her washed through with the knowledge that she belonged to him now to cherish and protect to hold up and to lean on love for her was like a sun inside him shining strong and white he found her lips again sank into them into all that heat and power in some part of his brain he heard the dogs barking a frenzied cacophony that cut through the sexual buzz even as he lifted his head to tune into the sound meg was shoving him away somethings at my dogs she sprinted out of the room even as he rolled off the couch meg wait a minute wait a damn minute he heard something something that wasnt a dog sound outside the house and he ran after her twentynine she had a rifle and was yanking open the back door by the time he caught her he made a leap slapped the door closed what the hell are you doing protecting my dogs theyre going to get mauled out there back off burke i know what im doing too rushed for niceties she rapped the butt of the rifle into his belly and was both furious and astonished when instead of buckling he stood his ground and shoved her back give me the gun youve got your own theyre my dogs a pulsing clacking roar cut through the frenzied barks itll kill my dogs no it wont he didnt know what it was but from the sound of it it was bigger than any dog he slapped on the outside lights then picked up the gun hed laid on her counter pulled it out of the holster stay here later he would wonder why hed thought shed listen to him listen to reason be safe but when he opened the door his gun lifted held in combat stance she bolted out ducking under his arm whirling her body and the barrel of the rifle toward the sounds of vicious war there was an instant of wonder struck into him tangled with fear and a terrible respect the bear was massive a great hulk of black against the patchy snow its teeth gleamed sharp and deadly in the light as its jaws opened and it bellowed viciously at the dogs they went at it short testing lunges snapping snarling he saw blood splattered over the ground a pool of it soaking into the thawing ground the raw smell of it and the pungent odor of wild animal stung the air rock bull here come here now too far gone was nates only thought as meg called out too far gone to listen even to her theyd already made their choice between fight or flight and the blood lust was on them the bear dropped onto all fours its back hunched and the sound it made was nothing like the growls hollywood assigned to its breed it was more more savage more chilling more real it swiped out razor claws sweeping and sent one of the dogs tumbling off into the snow on a highpitched yelp then it rose up on its hind legs taller than a man wide as the moon blood on its fangs and its eyes mad with battle he fired as it charged fired again as it got down on all fours to rush them he heard the explosion of megs rifle once twice booming through his own fire it screamed it seemed like a scream to him as blood flew as it matted its fur it fell less than three feet from where they stood and it shook the ground under nates feet meg shoved the rifle at nate and jumped down to run to the dog who limped toward her youre all right youre okay let me see just grazed you didnt he you stupid stupid dog didnt i tell you to come nate stayed where he was a moment making certain the bear was down for good while rock sniffed around the body nosed into the blood then he walked down to where meg knelt in nothing but a pair of panties and an open shirt get inside meg its not too bad she was crooning to bull i can fix it baited baited the house do you see bloody meat her eyes were hard stones as she gestured to the chunks of halfeaten meat near the back of the house hung meat fresh meat at the house probably at the edge of the woods lure the bear in bastard thats what the bastard did get inside meg youre cold he pulled her to her feet felt her trembling take these ill get the dog she took the guns whistled for rock inside she laid the guns on the counter and dashed for a blanket and firstaid supplies lay him on that she called out when nate carried the dog in get down with him keep him quiet hes not going to like this he did as she asked held the dogs head and said nothing while she cleaned the cuts not deep not too deep probably scar war wounds thats okay rock sit she snapped out when he tried to wiggle under her arm to sniff at his companion im going to give him a couple of shots here she took out a hypo tapped it with a steady hand squirted out a small stream hold him still we can take him in to ken its not that bad he wouldnt do any more than i can do here going to give him this make him groggy so i can stitch up the deeper cuts well give him an antibiotic after wrap him up let him sleep it off she pinched a hunk of fur then slid the needle in bull whimpered and rolled his eyes pitifully up at nate just relax big guy youre going to feel better in a minute he stroked the dog while meg started to suture you keep all that stuff around the house out here you never know maybe you slice your leg or whatever cutting wood powers out roads are blocked what are you going to do her brows were knitted as she worked her voice calm and matteroffact cant depend on getting to a doctor for every damn thing there now baby doll nearly done were going to keep you nice and warm ive got this salve here itll help it heal and keep him from gnawing at it cause it tastes foul gonna bandage him up take him in tomorrow have him looked at but its not too bad when the dog was sleeping under a blanket with rock curled beside him she picked up the wine bottle and drank from it now her hands shook violently jesus christ nate took the bottle from her set it carefully aside then he gripped her elbows and jerked her an inch off the floor dont you ever ever do anything like that again look at me listen to me she hardly had a choice as his voice was booming and his face rigid with fury engulfed her vision dont you ever take a risk like that again i had to no you didnt i was here you didnt have to go running out of the house half naked to take on a grizzly it wasnt a grizzly she shouted back at him it was a black bear he dropped her back on her feet damn it meg i can take care of myself and whats mine he spun back around his face so full of rage she backed up a step this wasnt the patient lover it wasnt the coldeyed cop this was a furious man with enough heat blasting out to boil her alive youre mine now so get used to it im not going to stand around and act helpless because helpless my ass who wants you to act helpless theres a big fucking difference between acting helpless and running out of the house in your underwear when you dont know the situation theres a big damn difference meg when you try to shove me aside by ramming the butt of a rifle in my gut i didnt did i oddly enough it was his fullblown temper that cut hers down to manageable that allowed her to think again im sorry im sorry that was wrong she pressed her hands to her face took several deep breaths until the fear the anger the shaky aftermath of both eased some of the other stuff was probably wrong but i just reacted i she held out a hand palm out for peace then picked up her wine again she sipped slowly to soothe her raw throat my dogs are my partners you understand you dont hesitate when your partners in trouble and i did know the situation there wasnt time to explain it and i havent taken time to tell you it felt all kinds of good and different things to know you were beside me out there even if i didnt act like it i knew you were there and it mattered her voice thickened so she pressed the fingers of her free hand to her eyes until she had it under control you want to be mad i wont hold it against you but maybe you could wait to finish yelling at me until i get some clothes on im cold i guess im finished he stepped toward her pulled her into his arms and held on like fury look at that im shaking she burrowed into him i wouldnt be if you werent here to hang on to lets get you dressed he kept an arm around her until they were in the living room then he walked over to put another log on the fire ive got a need to take care of you he said quietly im not going to drown you in it i know ive got a need to take care of myself but ill try not to shove you away with it okay now explain about the baiting bears like to eat thats why you bury or seal your scraps when youre camping why you carry any food supplies in sealed containers and hang them up away from camp thats why you build a cache for supplies and have it on stilts and the ladder you use to get up to them comes down every time you do she pulled on her pants scooped a hand through her hair bears get a scent of something to eat they mosey on over to snack and they can climb a ladder youd be surprised what can climb a ladder theyll even wander into town a populated area to get into garbage cans bird feeders and so on you might have one try to get in the house just to see if theres something more interesting to eat inside mostly you can scare them off sometimes you cant she buttoned up her shirt edged closer to the fire theres meat on the ground out there and i bet well find some shreds of the plastic it was in somebody put it there hoping to bring a bear in toward the house and you can be pretty confident that kind of baiting will work this time of year bears are just waking up theyre hungry someone laid the bait hoping youd step into the trap no not me you and that had her stomach churning think about it had to be baited sometime today before i got back if someoned tried that while we were here wed have heard the dogs carrying on say you were out here alone tonight like you were last night what would you have done if youd heard the dogs start up like we did idve gone out to see why but id have gone out armed with your handgun she said with a nod maybe you can take down a bear with a handgun or scare it off with one if youre lucky enough and get off enough shots before it takes it out of your hand and eats it mostly youre just going to make it mad and a bear whos busy chowing down or fighting a couple of angry huskies hed have gotten through my dogs nate odds are theyd have done some damage before it ripped them to pieces and if youd been out there alone with that mm you might have been ripped to pieces too odds are wounded bear enraged bear hed come right through the door after you too thats what someone was counting on if so i must be making someone very nervous thats what cops do dont they she rubbed a hand over his knee when he sat beside her whoever it was wanted you dead or in a world of hurt and didnt mind sacrificing my dogs to do it or you if things had gone differently or me well hes got me pissed off now she patted his knee before she rose to pace killing my father that hurt me but hed been gone a long time and i could deal tracking him down tossing him in a cell thatd be enough but nobody comes after my dogs she turned and saw that half smile was back or after the guy im going to marry especially before hes bought me a really expensive ring you still mad at me not so much i will always have that image of you standing out there in your red panties with that red shirt open and blowing back in the wind while you held a rifle but after a while its going to be erotic instead of terrifying i really do love you its the damnedest thing okay she scrubbed her hands hard over her face we cant leave that carcass out there itll bring all kinds of other interested visitors and the dogs will be rolling over it in the morning im going to call jacob have him help me deal with it and he can see if he can find any signs from whoever left the bait she saw his face stepped forward i can see your brain working jacob was here today and with bear meat he wouldnt have done this nate i can give you several specific reasons why over and above the fact that hes a good man who loves me first hed never put my dogs in jeopardy he loves them and respects them too much second he knew i was coming home tonight i touched base with him after i did the engine work third if he wanted you dead hed just jam a knife in your heart and bury you somewhere youd never be found simple clean straightforward this this was sneaky and cowardly and not a little desperate i agree with you call him in his office the next morning nate studied his most recently collected evidence some scraps of white plastic which looked like the same material used at the corner store to bag produce some scraps of meat hed sealed in an evidence bag and a silver earring had he seen it before that earring there was something on the fringes of his memory a finger tap on the brain trying to wake it up a single silver earring men wore them more now than they once had fashions changed and evolved and even a suit wouldnt be smirked at for sporting an earring these days but sixteen years ago not as mainstream not as common for a man more a hippy sort of thing or a musician an artist a biker a rebel and this wasnt a discreet little stud or a tiny sporty hoop not with that cross dangling it made more of a statement it wasnt galloways hed checked the photographs and galloway had died with a hoop in his ear best he could tell using a magnifying glass galloways other ear had been unpierced hed check with the me to be sure but he knew what he was looking at belonged to the murderer the little back piece what the hell did they call that was missing he could see in his minds eye that faceless figure rearing back with the ax and the little earring falling off unnoticed bringing the ax down bringing it home had he stood there watching galloways shocked face as his friend had slid bonelessly down that icy wall had he stood there staring studying shocked himself or pleased thrilled or appalled hardly mattered nate thought the job was done take the pack check it no point in leaving supplies or the money if the money was in there have to be practical have to survive how long before hed noticed the loss of the earring too late to go back and check too insignificant a detail to worry about but it was always the details that built the case and the cage nate still holding the earring he reached for his intercom yeah jacobs here to see you peach told him send him back he didnt get up but instead leaned back in his chair as jacob came in and closed the door behind him expected you to come by this morning there are things i want to say i didnt want to say last night in front ofmeg jacob wore a buckskin shirt over faded jeans and the thin string of beads around his neck held a polished brown stone his silvered hair was drawn back in a long tail his exposed lobes sported no jewelry have a seat nate invited and say them ill stand and say them youll use me to finish this or ill do what i have to do on my own but this will end he stepped forward and for the first time in their acquaintance nate saw undisguised rage on jacobs face she is my child shes been mine more years than she was pats this is my daughter whatever you think about me whatever you wonder you will know that ill be a part of finding who put her in danger last night one way or the other nate rocked forward in his chair rocked back again you want a badge he saw jacobs hands ball into fists then open again slowly just as slowly as the rage went under some enigmatic mask no i dont think id like a badge too heavy for me okay well keep my use of you unofficial that suit you better it does these people you were asking questions of ones who told you about the money is it possible wind of that blew back here to lunacy more than possible people talk especially white people and if that wind blew it wouldnt be a stretch to conclude due to your connection to galloway and to meg that youd pass the information to me jacob shrugged why not just shut you down before you got it to me and now jacob smiled ive lived a very long time and am very hard to kill you havent and arent this business last night was sloppy and stupid why not just shoot you in the head when youre alone by the lake weigh you down with stones and sink you i would i appreciate that he doesnt use the direct approach no not even with galloway nate said as jacob looked at the board that was a moment of madness of greed of opportunity maybe all three it wasnt planned no considering now jacob nodded there are easier ways to kill a man than climbing a mountain one stroke of the ax nate continued one afterward hes too delicate to yank it out again to dispose of the body that would be too direct too involved same with max stage a suicide max was responsible as he is he can look at it that way the dog just a dog a cover a distraction and an indirect slap at steven wise he wont come at me facetoface he pushed the earring across the desk recognize that jacob frowned over it a bauble a symbol not a native one we have our own i think the killer lost it sixteen years ago long forgotten but hell remember it if he sees it again ive seen it before somewhere nate picked it up let the cross twirl somewhere he carried it with him it wasnt strictly procedure but nate kept the earring in his pocket as he went about town business he said nothing to anyone about the incident at megs and he asked her and jacob to do the same a little game with a killer he thought in that burgeoning spring while the days lengthened and the green overtook the white he went about his duties talked with the people of his town listened to their troubles and complaints and checked the earlobes of all the men he came in contact with they can close up meg told him one night what the holes in your ear or wherever you decide to skewer yourself she danced her fingers lightly over his penis please he couldnt quite submerge the shudder and made her laugh wickedly ive heard it can really add something to the thrust dont even think what do you mean close up they can heal up if you havent had it for long and you quit wearing anything in it they she made a slurping sound close up again son of a bitch are you sure i used to have four in this one she tugged her left ear got an urge and jabbed a third and fourth hole in yourself you did it yourself sure what am i a weenie she rolled over on him and since she was naked his mind wandered away from the conversation before he dragged it back again i wore four for a few weeks but it started to be too much trouble so i ditched the extras and they closed up she reached over to turn on the light then angled her head see you couldve told me that before i looked at earlobes all over town and made notes on who had piercings she rubbed his earlobe you might look cute with one no i could do it for you absolutely no not in the ear or anywhere else spoilsport yeah thats me ive got to rethink this now since my short list is no longer viable she rose up to straddle him to take him in think later he dropped into the lodge and spotted hopp and ed having a meeting over buffalo salad he stopped at their booth can i interrupt a minute sure slide in hopp made room for him were going over what youd call fiduciary matters gives me a headache and perks ed here right up were trying to figure out how to stretch the budget to building a library section off part of the proposed post office for it at least for now what do you think sounds like a nice idea to me were agreed on that ed dabbed at his lip with a napkin but we need a little more elastic in the budget to make the stretch he winked at hopp i know thats not what you want to hear we get people involved get donations for materials for labor we get books donated or go begging for them people pull together if you get them excited about a project you can count me in nate told them if and when meanwhile i got a fiduciary type of question myself i was going to drop by to see you ed bank question goes back a few years so it may tax your memory no hole in his ear nate thought as ed nodded when it comes to banking my memorys long hit me it deals with galloway pat he lowered his voice glancing around the restaurant maybe we shouldnt discuss this here charlene it wont take long ive got a source saying galloway got himself a good pile of cash playing poker when he was in anchorage pat loved to play poker hopp commented that he did i played with him more than once small stakes though ed added i cant imagine him winning much source says otherwise so i was wondering did he send any money back into his account here in town before he went on that climb not that i recall not even a paycheck we were a smaller operation in those days as i told you before his eyes narrowed in thought though by the time pat left wed built an actual vault and had two parttime tellers still i was involved in nearly every transaction rubbing his chin he sat back pat didnt bother with the finances he wasnt one to come into the bank to deposit or withdraw for that matter how about when he left town for work did he usually send money back now he did sometimes i do remember charlene coming down once even twice every week more than two months checking to see if he had anything direct deposited after he left that time if there was any big money which i tend to doubt he mightve banked it there or just as likely stuffed it in a shoe box ill go with ed on the second hopp said pat never did think twice about money people who come from it usually dont ed gave a shrug then theres us he said with a wink at hopp who have to do some finagling if we want to have a town library ill let you get back to that nate scooted out thanks for the time he ought to spend his time on town business ed shook his head as he lifted his coffee i guess he figures this is we need may day hopp if were going to get that library agreed so far hes keeping it lowkey hes just going to have to see it through until hes satisfied it was max who killed pat tenacious ignatious she said thats how im thinking of him these days boy just wont let go its a good quality to have in your chief of police jacob had been right some people wouldnt talk to cops even with jacob there nate hadnt been able to squeeze any more juice out of the trip he took to anchorage not that it was a wasted trip he hadnt gone to see coben he should have he admitted as jacob skimmed over the lake he should have taken the earring in but he hadnt he wanted a little more time there a little more time to pull it together he let his shoulders relax when the plane was on the water thanks for going with me you want me to secure the plane you coming in you know how its a boat with wings at this point i know how to secure a boat to dock jacob nodded toward meg who walked down to meet them you have other business yeah i do see you later then he stepped out onto the flotation praying he didnt lose his balance and mortify himself by pitching into the lake but he stepped safely on one end of the dock just as meg stepped on the other wheres he going she called out when jacob glided away said there was other business he reached for her hand youre back early no youre back late its nearly eight he looked up at the sky still bright as noon im not used to it yet woman wheres my supper ha ha ha you can throw a couple of moose burgers on the grill moose burgers a personal favorite you get anything more in anchorage no at least not investigationally and how was your day actually i was in anchorage briefly myself and since i was there i happened to wander into this shop where they happened to have wedding dresses really stop grinning im still firm on not wanting a big fancy deal just a wild party right here at the house but i decided i do want a kickass dress one thatll make your eyes pop out did you find it thats for me to know and you to find out she stepped up on the porch ahead of him then gave him a smacking kiss i like my moose burger welldone and the bun lightly toasted check but before we dine i did a little marriage shopping today myself oh yeah oh yeah he pulled the ring box out of his pocket guess what this is mine gimme he flipped the top open and had the pleasure of seeing her eyes pop when she saw the fullcut solitaire flanked by sparkling channel cuts on a platinum band holy shit she grabbed it out of the box held it aloft and jumped off the porch she danced around the yard crowing out sounds he took as approval does that mean you like it sparkly she spun laughing circles all the way back to him this chief burke is a ring how much did it set you back jesus meg she kept laughing like a loon i know tacky and i dont really want to know its a killer nate an absolute killer its stupid and extravagant so its perfect absolutely perfect she held it out then dropped it into his open palm okay put it on me and hurry up excuse me but can we have a little dignity for this part i think weve already crossed the point of no return on that she wiggled her fingers come on give it up good thing i didnt wrack my brain trying to come up with something poetic to say when i did this he slipped it on her finger where it sparkled insanely be careful you dont put your eye out with that thing when do i go splat sorry i just keep falling more and more in love with you when do i finally hit bottom and go splat she framed his face in the way that always made his heart roll over in his chest i dont know if im perfect for you nate but you sure as hell are for me he took the hand that wore the ring and kissed it if and when we splat well do it together lets go make moose burgers thirty what are these meg looked at the ring of keys in nates hand deliberately furrowed her brow those would be keys why do you need so many keys because there are so many locks is this a quiz he jingled them in his palm while she continued to give him a sunny innocent smile meg you dont even lock your doors half the time what are all these keys about well there are times a person needs to get into a place and hey that place is locked then she would need a key and this place that hey is locked wouldnt be the property of that person would that be correct technically but no man is an island and it takes a village and so on were all one in the zen universe so these would be zen keys exactly give them back i dont think so he closed his fist around them you see even in the zen universe id hate to arrest my wife for unlawful entry im not your wife yet buddy did you have a search warrant for those they were in plain sight no warrant necessary gestapo delinquent he cupped her chin in his free hand and kissed her opening the rear hatch of his fourwheel he called the dogs come on boys lets go for a ride she refused to leave the dogs alone at the house now they went with her to jacobs or on a day when jobs made that inconvenient to the run at the lodge he gave the stillhealing bull a little help on the jump fly safe he said to meg yeah yeah with her hands jammed in her pockets she headed down to the plane then turned and walked backward i can get more keys you know i have my ways you sure do nate murmured he waited as was his habit for her to take off he liked to watch her glide from water to air and to stand while the stillness erupted with her engines while he did he let himself think of nothing but her of them of the life they were building she was already working in what hed discovered after the snow had melted was a pair of flower beds flanking her porch she talked of columbine and trollius and of the wolf urine she sprinkled around to protect them from moose her delphiniums she promised would reach near ten feet in the long days of summer imagine that he thought imagine meg galloway bush pilot bear killer illegalentry addict tending a garden she claimed her dahlias were as big as hubcaps he wanted to see them wanted to sit on the porch with her on some endless summer night with the sun ruling the sky and her flowers spread out in front of the house simple he thought their life could be made up of thousands of simple moments and still never be ordinary her plane rose up and up a little red bird in a vast blue sky and he smiled felt the quick lift in his heart when she dipped her wings right then left in salute when there was stillness again he climbed in the car with the dogs and thought of other things maybe it was foolish to pin so much on an earring a small piece of silver and an unsubstantiated claim that galloway had possessed an undisclosed amount of cash but hed seen that earring before and hed remember sooner or later hed remember and money was no stranger to murder he let it sift through his head as he drove into town galloway had possessed ready cash and a beautiful woman triedandtrue motives for murder and in a place like this women were rare commodities the parade committee had already started hanging the bunting for may day it wasnt the red white and blue usual for smalltown parades why would it be usual in lunacy instead banners and bunting were a rainbow of blues yellows greens he saw an eagle perched on a swag of it as if granting his approval along the main street people were sprucing up their homes and businesses for spring pots and hanging baskets of pansies and curly kale both of which hed learned didnt mind a chill were already set out porches and shutters sported fresh coats of paint motorcycles and scooters replaced snowmobiles kids started to ride bikes to school and he saw more doc martens and timberlands than bunny boots and still the mountains that ringed the shimmers of spring that rose into a sky that held the light for fourteen hours a day clung relentlessly to winter nate parked led the dogs to the run they gave him pitiful looks their tails sinking between their legs as they trudged inside i know i know it sucks he crouched sticking his fingers through the chain link so they could be licked let me catch the bad guy then your mom wont worry so much and you can stay home and play they whined when he walked away and gave him a bellyful of guilt he went in through the lobby and tracked down charlene in her office i hired three college students for the summer she gave her computer a pat im going to need them with the bookings weve got thats good local guides always take on a few too the placell be hopping with pretty college boys by june there was a glitter in her eyes as she said it but to nate it looked more like defiance than anticipation thatll keep us all busy charlene he closed the door im going to ask you something and youre not going to like it since when has that stopped you no way to be delicate he decided whos the first person you slept with after galloway left i dont kiss and tell nate if youd ever taken me up on it youd know that this isnt gossip charlene and it isnt a game does it matter to you who killed pat galloway of course it does do you know how hard it is to plan his funeral knowing hes still in some morgue and not knowing exactly when i can bring him home i ask bing every other day when he thinks the groundll be soft enough to dig to dig my pats grave she snatched two tissues out of the box on her desk sniffled into them when my mother buried my father nate said she walked around the house like a ghost for a month longer i guess she did everything she had to do like you are but you couldnt reach her you couldnt touch her she went away somewhere i was never able to reach her again charlene blinked at tears lowered the tissues thats so sad you havent done that you havent let it make a ghost out of you now im asking you to help me who moved on you charlene who didnt i was young and fine to look at you shouldve seen me back then something stirred he reached out to grab the tail of it when she exploded and i was alone i didnt know he was dead if id known i wouldnt have been so quick to i was hurt and i was mad and when the men came swarming around why shouldnt i have taken my pick taken lots of picks theres no blame here i slept with john first her shoulder jerked and she tossed the tissue into her pink wastebasket i knew he had a crush on me and he was so sweet about it attentive she said wistfully now so i went to him but not only him i filled up on it i broke hearts and i broke up marriages and i didnt care she steadied herself and for once looked quiet almost thoughtful nobody killed pat because of me or if they did they wasted their time because i never cared about any of them i never gave them anything i didnt take back he isnt dead because of me if he is i swear i dont think i can live with it hes not dead because of you he walked around her behind her and laid his hands on her shoulders to rub gently hes not she lifted a hand closed it over his i kept waiting for him to come back for him to see i wasnt pining for him and want me again i swear to god nate i think i waited for that until you and meg went up there until you found him i was waiting for him he wouldve come back he tightened his grip when she shook her head you get to know the victim when you do what i do you get inside them and understand them better a lot of the time better than people who knew them living hed have come back thats the nicest thing anyones ever said to me she said after a moment especially somebody whos not trying to get in my pants he gave her shoulders a pat then took the earring out of his pocket do you recognize this hmm she sniffled again flicked her finger over her lashes to dry them its sort of pretty but i dont know male not my kind of thing i like splashier could it have been pats pats no he didnt have anything like that no crosses he didnt go for religious symbols have you ever seen it before i dont think so wouldnt remember if i had i guess its not much of a thing he decided to start showing it around get reactions since bing was having breakfast in the lodge nate walked by his table let the earring dangle from his fingers lose this bing barely gave it a glance before staring back into nates eyes last time i told you i lost something i got nothing but grief i like to get things back to their rightful owner it aint mine know whose it is dont spend a lot of time looking at peoples ears and i dont want to spend any more time looking at your face nice to see you again too bing he put the earring away bing had trimmed his beard an inch or so nate noticed and figured it was his warmweather look february i cant find anybody around who can tell me absolutely you were here through that month have found a couple who think maybe you werent people should mind their own like i do max was gone and i hear you had a hankering lets say for carrie back then no more than any other woman seems like a good time to have moved in on her some you strike me as a man who doesnt let opportunities go to waste she wasnt interested so why waste my time shit easier to find one and pay the hourly rate maybe i went down to anchorage that winter there was a whore named kate i had some transactions with sod galloway his business whoring kate yeah dead now damn shame he shrugged it off as he ate dropped dead of a heart attack between johns they say anyway he leaned forward i didnt kill that dog you say anyway and you seem more concerned with that than with two dead men men can take care of themselves better than an old blind dog maybe i was in the city some that winter maybe i ran into galloway going through kates swinging door didnt mean a damn to me you talk to him i had other things on my mind so did he poker game nate lifted his eyebrows as if mildly surprised mildly interested is that so youre remembering a lot of details all of a sudden youre in my face all the damn time arent you spoiling my appetite so ive been thinking on it you get in on the poker game i went for a whore not to gamble did he mention plans to climb no name he was yanking his pants up christs sake and i was about to yank mine down we didnt chat said he was riding a streak took a break to bang kate and was heading back kate said something about the place being lousy with lunatics and that was fine with her business was good then we got down to it did you see galloway again after your business was concluded dont remember seeing him bing stabbed at his food maybe he came in the bar maybe he didnt i headed on up to see ike transky trapper i knew used to have a place outside skwenta bunked with him a few days and did some hunting little ice fishing came back here transky back you up on that bings eyes went hard as agate beads dont need anybody to back up what i say dead now anyway died in convenient nate thought as he walked out the two people bing named as potential alibis were dead or gone or you could turn the prism and look at it from a different facet stolen gloves a stolen knife both left near a dead dog property of a man whod seen and spoken to galloway it wasnt too much of a stretch to imagine galloway going back to that game or stopping for a drink with friends guess who i just ran into on his way to bang whoring kate small world nate thought small old world if bing was telling the truth it might be the killer was worried galloway had mentioned who else from lunacy was playing poker and paying for whores nate decided to make a few stops dangling his single piece of evidence on the way to the station later in the day he showed it to otto the deputy shrugged doesnt mean anything to me a coolness had come between them a stiff formality nate regretted but it couldnt be helped i always thought the maltese cross was more military than religious otto never blinked marines i served with didnt wear earrings well as he had at every stop through the day nate put the earring back in his pocket buttoned it its going around that youre showing that thing to everybody people are wondering why their chief of police is spending time on a lost earring full service nate said easily chief peach said from her counter weve got a report of a bear in ginny manns garage off rancor her husbands out with a hunting party peach added shes home alone with her twoyearold tell her were coming otto when they pulled onto the pitted lane a mile and a half north of town otto flicked a glance at nate i sure hope you dont plan to have me drive this thing around like a maniac while you lean out the damn window there and shoot warning shots over some bears idiot head well see what we see what the hell is a bear doing in a garage hes not fixing a carburetor at nates snicker otto grinned then sobered again as he remembered what was between them somebody forgot and left the door open most likely they might have a can full of dog food or bird food in there or the dumbass bear went in to see if there was anything interesting when they pulled up in front of the twostory cabin with attached garage nate saw the garage door was indeed open he didnt know if the bear was responsible for the mess he could see inside or if the manns just pitched things in there like it was the town dump ginny opened the front door her red hair was piled up on her head and her loose overshirt and hands were splattered with paint he went around back hes been crashing around inside there for twenty minutes i thought hed just go on but i was afraid hed try to get through the door to the house stay inside ginny nate ordered you get a look at him otto called out i got a look at him through the front when he lumbered up behind her there was the sound of insane barking and the wail of a toddler i had the dog inside and was upstairs working in the studio when roger started carrying on woke the baby im about to go crazy from the noise brown bear didnt look fullgrown but big enough bears are curious otto commented as they checked their rifles and started around the side of the garage if hes a young one he was likely just poking around and hell run off quick enough when he sees us around back nate could see the manns had roped off a patch of ground for a garden apparently the bear had tromped through it coming or going and had spent some time beating up a plastic crate full of newspapers and mailorder catalogs nate scanned and then gestured when he spotted a brown rump through the trees there he goes better give him a little scare get him running discourage him from coming back otto aimed the rifle skyward fired two rounds and nate watched with some amusement as the bear hustled its fat rump and ran he stood watching its progress beside a man who was on his list of suspects that was easy enough more often than not it is sometimes its not meg and i had to take one down the other night at her place is that what got at her dog i heard her dog got clawed up some yeah it wouldve gotten at us too if we hadnt killed it first somebody baited the house ottos eyes narrowed into slits what the hell are you talking about im talking about somebody hanging meat fresh bloody meat in thin plastic bags on megs house ottos mouth went tight then he turned sharply away paced off several steps nate rested his hand on the butt of his weapon youre asking if it was me otto strode back stood toetotoe with nate you want to know if id do something that cowardly that vicious if id do something that could get two people ripped to pieces and one of them a woman he jabbed his finger into nates chest twice ill take you tossing my name into the hat when it comes to galloway even when it comes to max it galls me youd toss it in there over yukon but i swallowed it but ill be goddamned if ill take this i was a marine i know how to kill a man if i need to i know how to do it quick and i know plenty of places i could get rid of a body where nobody on this earth would find it thats what i figured so im asking you otto because you know the people around here whod stoop that low he trembled the rage was still on him nate could see he had the rifle in his hand but even in temper it was pointed at the ground i dont know but he doesnt deserve to live the earring i showed you belongs to him interest won over the anger in his eyes you found it out at megs no in galloways cave so heres what were going to think about who did galloway like and trust who could handle a winter climb who gained something by his death who wore this he added patting his pocket who considered himself a badass back then and could leave town for a couple of weeks without anyone commenting youre letting me back in yeah lets go tell ginny the coast is clear it was a tossup who was more surprised when meg swung by to pick up her dogs she herself or charlene who was caught redhanded feeding the dogs table scraps didnt see why it should go to waste these dogs hate being penned up its just until bulls my healed they stood there awkwardly while the dogs ate do you know what got at him charlene asked after a moment bear well god hes lucky he only got a few scrapes charlene crouched and made kissing noises at bull poor baby i always forget you like dogs you never keep one ive got enough to look after around here she glanced over and megs ring caught the sun and shot light i heard about that too she gripped megs hand pulling it up under her nose as she rose joanna at the clinic got a load of it told rose and rose told me seems i might have heard about it from you he really stepped up to the plate didnt he lucky me yeah lucky you charlene let megs hand go she started to walk away stopped lucky him too meg said nothing for a moment im waiting for the shot no shot you look good together better together than you look otherwise if youre going to go and marry somebody it might as well be somebody you look good with how about somebody who makes me happy thats what i mean okay okay meg repeated um maybe i could give you a party like an engagement party meg dipped her hands into the pockets of her jean jacket were not going to wait very long doesnt seem like wed need a party when well only be engaged about a month well whatever charlene meg said before she could leave maybe you could help with the wedding thing she watched pleasure and surprise run over charlenes face i dont want fancy just something out at the house but i want a party with it a big one youre good at putting those things together i could do that even if you dont want fancy you need good food lots of liquor and it should be pretty flowers and decorations we could talk about it all right theres theres something i have to do now maybe we could talk about it tomorrow tomorrows good maybe since theyve just eaten i could leave the dogs here a little while pick up some supplies and things ill see you tomorrow then charlene went in quickly before she could change her mind she went straight up to johns room knocked its open he sat at his cramped little desk but stood when she came in charlene sorry im grading papers i really need to get this done dont go she leaned back against the door please dont go i cant stay so i have to go ive turned in my resignation im helping hopp find a replacement for me theres no replacement for you john whatever you think about about the other men ive been bad to you i knew you loved me but i didnt let myself care i liked knowing there was somebody who was there whenever i needed him but i didnt let myself care i know i know that all too well charlene ive finally got the belly to deal with it please let me say this eyes pleading she crossed her hands over her breasts im scared and ive got to get it out before i run out of courage i liked having men want me seeing that look in their eyes i liked taking them to bed especially the young ones so i could believe in the dark when their hands are on me in the dark i havent seen forty yet she touched her face now i hate getting older john seeing new lines in the mirror every day as long as men want me i can pretend the lines arent there ive been scared and angry a long time and im tired she took a step forward please dont go john please dont leave me youre the only one since pat i could rest with feel quiet with i dont know if i love you but i want

other men i swear if youll just stay and give me a chance i dont know if i love you she said again but i know thinking about being without yous breaking my heart thats the first time in more than sixteen years youve ever come in this room and talked to me said anything real to me its a long time to wait too long tell me its not too long he crossed to her put his arms around her his cheek to the top of her head i dont know i dont think either one of us knows so i guess well have to wait and see nate pinned his badge on a khaki shirt that carried the lunacy pd symbol on the sleeve hed been informed by her honor the mayor that may day required a more official look when he strapped on his gun meg made a long mmmmm cops are so sexy why dont you come back to bed ive got to go in early

official give me ten and ill fly you in itll take longer for you to do your systems checks and fly there than it will for me to drive it besides you cant get ready in ten can too especially if somebody goes down and makes the coffee even as he looked at his watch and sighed she dashed into the bathroom when he came back with two mugs she was pulling her red shirt over a white scoopnecked tee consider me amazed i know how to budget time cutie this way we can have some wedding talk on the way in i managed to pull the plug on charlenes notion of renting a pergola and covering it with pink roses whats a pergola beats me but were not having it shes majorly bummed because she claims its not only romantic but essential for the wedding photos its nice that the two of you are getting along it wont last but it makes life marginally easier for the time being she gulped down coffee two minutes for the face she said and scooted back into the bathroom she and big mike have their heads together on this behemoth wedding cake im giving her her head there i like cake were tangling about the flowers im not being buried in pink roses but weve agreed on a few things like getting a professional photographer snapshots are great but this is a monumental deal so we go with a pro oh and she says you have to get a new suit i already have a suit she says you have to have a new one and it has to be gray steel gray not dove gray or maybe it was dove gray and not steel gray i dont know and im tossing you to the wolves on that one burke you argue with her i can buy a suit he muttered i can buy a gray suit do i get to pick out my own underwear ask charlene there done lets go arent you ready yet youre holding up the parade she laughed when he made a grab for her and let him chase her down the stairs they were at the door when he stopped when it clicked into place for him when that jolt of memory became knowledge snapshot goddamn what meg pushed at her hair as he charged back upstairs you want a camera men jesus and theyre always harping about women not being on time she trudged back upstairs then stared in astonishment while he dragged her albums and boxes of photos from the closet to dump them on the bed what are you doing its in here i remember im sure of it whats in there what are you doing with my pictures its in here summer picnic no no campfire shot or damn it just a minute here how do you know theres a campfire shot in there or summer picnics or anything else i snooped scold me later you can count on it the earring meg i saw it when i was looking through here i know i saw it she shoved him aside so she could grab a stack who was wearing it who did you see she scanned pictures tossed them out like toy airplanes group shot he murmured straining to bring it into focus party shot holiday christmas he grabbed the album she reached for and flipped through to the end there bullseye new years eve they let me stay up i took that picture myself i took it her hand trembled as she peeled back the plastic pulled the photograph free the edge of the tree was in the corner the colored lights and balls blurry shed gone in close so it was just the faces nearly only the faces though she remembered now that her father had his guitar on his lap hed been laughing with charlene pulled tight against him so her cheek was pressed right up against his max had mugged his way in from behind the couch but shed cut off the top of his head but the one who sat on the other side of her father his head turned slightly as he smiled at someone across the room was clear as was the silver maltese cross dangling from his ear thirtyone its not proof meg not a hundred percent dont give me that cop bullshit burke as he drove she sat with her arms folded tight at her waist as if holding in pain its not bullshit its circumstantial its good but its circumstantial his mind worked back forward covering the ground the earring was handled by at least two people before it came to me no forensics its a common design probably thousands of them out there during that time he could have lost it given it away borrowed it himself the fact that he wore it in a photograph taken more than sixteen years ago doesnt prove he was on that mountain a braindead defense attorney could smash it in trial he killed my father ed holds a grudge hopp had told him that after the runin with hawley all those connecting lines galloway to max galloway to bing galloway to steven wise you can add more woolcott to max the concerned old friend helping the widow with the memorial woolcott to bing implicating the man who might know who might remember a casual conversation from sixteen years before hawleys slashed tires and spraypainted truck payback for the wreck disguised as childish vandalism money ed woolcott was the money man what better way to hide a sudden cash windfall than your own bank that bastard woolcott killed my father thats right i know it you know it he knows it but building a case is a different thing youve been building a case since january piece by step by layer when the state basically closed it up ive watched you let me finish it what do you think im going to do she squinted against the sun shed walked out of the house without her sunglasses without anything but her own bubbling need to act walk up to him and put a gun in his ear because he heard it in her voice the dark grief along with the bright rage he laid a hand over hers squeezed wouldnt put it past you i wont it took an effort to turn her hand over to return that connection when it would have been easy to yank it back stay alone with the storming emotions but im going to see his face nate im going to be there where i can see his face when you take him in the main street was already lined with people staking their claim on position folding chairs and coolers stood on curb and sidewalk many already occupied or in use as people sat and slurped on drinks in plastic cups the air was already buzzing with noise shouts and squeals and laughter spearing up through the blast of music from klun trucks offering snow cones ice cream hot dogs and other parade food were parked on corners and down side streets rainbow bunting waved in the breeze two thousand people nate estimated and a good chunk of them kids a normal day in lunacy he couldve walked into the bank and taken ed quietly in his office it wasnt a normal day in any stretch he parked at the station pulled meg in with him otto and peter he demanded of peach out with the horde where i should be irritation marred her eyes as she smoothed a flowing skirt the color of daffodils over her ample hips we thought youd be here before call them both in nate weve got over a hundred people already lining up on the school grounds we need call them both in he snapped he kept walking one hand on megs arm into his office i want you to stay here no its not only stupid and wrong for you to expect that its disrespectful hes got a concealed license so do i give me a gun meg hes already killed three times hell do whatever he can to protect himself im not something you can bundle away safe im not yes you are its your first instinct but get over it i wont ask you not to bring your work home or complain when it interferes with my life i wont ask you to be what youre not dont ask that of me give me a gun i promise i wont use it unless i have to i dont want him dead i want him alive rotting i want him healthy so he rots for a long long time i want to know whats going on with her hands fisted on her hips peach filled the doorway i called those boys back and now weve got no one out there keeping order a bunch of high school boys have already run a tiedyed bra up the flagpole one of the draft horses kicked a tourist whos probably going to sue and those lamebrain mackie boys hauled in a keg of budweiser and are already skunk drunk frustration had the words shooting out like machinegun fire they stole a bunch of balloons too and are right this damn minute marching up and down the street like fools weve got reporters here nate weve got media attention and it just isnt the image we want to project wheres ed woolcott with hopp at the school by now theyre supposed to ride behind those damn horses what is going on call sergeant coben in anchorage tell him im taking a suspect in the patrick galloway homicide into custody i dont want to spook him nate told his deputies i dont want violence or a panic in the kind of crowd were dealing with civilian safety is first order the three of us ought to be able to take him down pretty quick and simple maybe nate acknowledged but im not risking civilian lives on maybe otto hes not going anywhere at this point he has no reason to attempt flight so we contain him while we have this parade to deal with at least one of us will have him in visual contact at all times he turned to the corkboard weve got peachs parade route and schedule right here he comes right after the high school band thats position six on the program theyll go from the school into the town proper down lunatic and out again theyll stop here at buffalo inlet then turn off to come around the back way to the school to offload at that point it wont be as crowded there and we can take him quietly with minimal civilian risk one of us can go back up to the school grounds peter put in after theyve gotten to the far end of town clear out the civilians thats exactly what i want you to do we take him quietly at the end of the route we bring him back here and let coben know the suspect is in custody youre just going to turn him over to the state cop otto demanded just here you go pal after youve done all the work its cobens case bullshit state brushed this off didnt want the mess and bother and took the easy way not entirely true nate said but regardless this is how its done how its going to be done he didnt need collars and commendations not anymore he just needed to finish the job from dark to light he thought from death to justice our priorities are to maintain civilian safety and take the suspect into custody after that its cobens game its your call looks like ill have to be satisfied to watch ed shit bricks when you slap the cuffs on him bastard killed that poor old dog otto glanced at meg colored a little and the others pat and max just the dog was most recent thats all its okay meg offered a grim smile as long as he pays for all of it its okay well otto cleared his throat stared hard at the maps pinned to the corkboard when they go around the back roads well lose visual he pointed out no ill have that covered a couple of civilian volunteers he glanced up as jacob and bing walked in said you had a job bing scratched his belly whats it pay meg waited until hed dispensed twoways and sent the men out to take up their initial positions and where am i in all this with me good enough shed pulled her shirt out to cover the holstered at the small of her back they might question why youre not doing the flyby as scheduled engine trouble she said as they started out sorry about that the crowd was full of color and noise and cheers with the smell of grilling meat and sugar filling the air kids were running around a streamerandflowerdecorated maypole erected for the event in front of town hall he saw the doors of the lodge were open and charlene was doing a brisk business with those who wanted a more substantial lunch than could be had on the street side streets were barricaded against vehicular traffic a young couple sat on one of the barricades making out with some enthusiasm while a group of their friends played hacky sack in the street behind them a television crew out of anchorage was doing a pan of the crowd from the opposite corner tourists shot videos or browsed the folding tables and portable booths where local crafts and jewelry were sold beaded leather bags dream catchers elaborate native masks hung on folding screens plain and fancy mukluks and handwoven grass baskets ranged over the folding tables or slabs of plywood set on sawhorses though it was warm and sunny caps and scarves made of qiviut the underwool of the arctic musk ox sold briskly the italian place sold slices of pizza to go the corner store had a special on disposable cameras and bug dope a spin rack of postcards stood just outside the door they ran three for two dollars an enterprising little town meg commented as they drove through it is that and after today a safer one thanks to you otto nailed that its thanks to you chief aw shucks maam she rubbed a hand over his you say that like gary cooper but youve got clint eastwood dirty harry years in your eyes just dont im trusting you you can there was an icy calm over the rage now if there was overflow if that rage bubbled up and cracked the calm shed freeze it up again i need to be there but we can say this is your bear to take down okay its going to be a beautiful day for a parade she said after a long breath the airs so still though like its waiting for somethingthey pulled up at the school i guess this is it the marching bands were decked out in bright blue uniforms with their brass buttons and instruments gleaming with polish horns clashed as different sections practiced and adults in charge shouted out instructions drums boomed the hockey team was already loading up sticks clacking as they herded into position theyd lead the parade with their regional champions banner hiding the rust on bings flatbed truck a test of the recording and speakers had queens we are the champions pouring out there you are hopp snappy in a suit of hot candy pink hurried up to him ignatious i thought we were going to have to run this show without you handling things in town youve got a full house and an nbc affiliate to document it her cheeks were nearly as pink as her suit with the excitement of it meg shouldnt you be getting up there she pointed skyward engines down hopp sorry oh well poop do you know if doug clooneys got his boat out on the river yet ive been looking for peach or deb theyre supposed to be driving herd around here but everyones running around like chickens im sure hes out there and debs right over there getting the hockey team settled oh good god were starting ed stop primping for five seconds i dont know why i let them talk me into riding behind these horses dont see why we couldnt have gotten a convertible its more dignified but not as much of a spectacle ed smiled broadly as he joined them he wore a navy threepiece suit bankerly with its chalk stripes and flashy with its paisley tie guess we shouldve had our chief of police behind the horses maybe next time nate said easily i havent congratulated you on your engagement his eyes were watchful on nates as he held out a hand he considered doing it now right now he could have him down and cuffed in under ten seconds and three elementary kids rushed between them chased by another with a plastic gun a pretty young majorette in sparkles hurried over to retrieve the missed baton that landed near his feet sorry sorry chief burke it got away from me no problem thanks ed he extended his hand to complete the aborted shake and again thought maybe now jesse ran up threw his arms around nates knees i get to be in the parade the boy shouted i get to wear a costume and march right down the street are you going to watch me chief nate absolutely dont you look handsome hopp commented and crouched down to jesse as the boy slipped his hand trustfully into nates not here nate told himself not now no one gets hurt today hope youll come to the wedding he said to ed wouldnt miss it couldnt settle for a local eh meg he survived a winter that makes him local enough i suppose it does jesse you better get back to your group hopp gave him a little pat on the butt and he ran off shouting watch me help me up into this thing ed were about to go were going to walk back down aways nate said as they climbed into the buggy things seem under control here i want to make sure the mackies are behaving themselves stealing balloons hopp cast her eyes to heaven i heard about that nate took megs hand and strolled away does he know she asked him im worried too many people around meg too many kids i know she gave his hands a squeeze as the marching bands boots began to click on the pavement itll be over soon doesnt take that long to get from one end of town to the other and back again it would be interminable he knew with the crowds the shouts and cheers the blaring music an hour he told himself an hour tops and he could take him without anyone getting hurt no need to run into an alley this time no need to risk the dark he kept his stride steady but unrushed as he passed the fringes of the crowd and made his way to the heart of town the trio of majorettes danced by waving and tossing their batons to enthusiastic applause the one whod nearly beaned him shot nate a big toothy smile the drum major strutted in his high hat and the band cut loose with we will rock you he spotted peter at the first intersection and turned his head to press his lips to megs ear lets keep walking down there to the balloon guy ill buy you a balloon theyll pass us and well keep them in sight a little longer a red one naturally end of town circle around he thought the hockey team would already be done and moving back into town to see their friends mix with the crowd the band would head into the school to change out of their uniforms out of the way most everyone out of the way and peter there to move any lingerers along he stopped by the clown with the orange mop of hair and a fistful of balloons jeez harry is that you in there debs idea well you look real cute nate angled himself to see the buggy the crowd my girl wants a red one nate reached for his wallet listening with half an ear as harry and meg debated which shape would do he watched peter move down the opposite sidewalk and as the band marched by taking the sound with them he heard the clipclop of the horses kids squealed and dashed out as hopp and ed tossed handfuls of candy he passed bills to harry and continued to turn as if watching the spectacle and spotted coben with his whiteblond hair catching the sunlight in the crowd so he saw instantly did ed damn it damn it why didnt he wait panic streaked across eds face seeing it nate began to fight his way through the crowd that was massed into a wall along curbside he couldnt get there not in time he heard the cheers and shouts of the crowd like a tidal wave rushing around him they applauded when ed leaped out of the buggy even when he pulled a gun from under his suit jacket as if anticipating a show they started to part for him as he dashed for the opposite side of the street then there were screams and shouts as he knocked people aside trampled over them when they fell nate heard gunfire as he shoved his way to the street down everybody down he sprinted across the street leaped over shocked pedestrians and saw ed backing down the empty sidewalk behind the barricades holding a gun to a womans head back away he shouted you just toss your gun down and back away ill kill her you know i will i know you will he could hear the shouts behind him and the fading music as the band marched on without a clue there were cars and trucks parked at the curb here and buildings had side doors that would almost certainly be unlocked he needed to keep eds focus on him before the man could use his panicked brain enough to think about dragging his hostage into a building where are you going to go ed dont you worry about that you worry about her he jerked the woman so that the heels of her jogging shoes bumped the sidewalk ill put a bullet in her brain like you did max did what i had to do thats how you survive here maybe there was sweat on eds face nate could see it glinting in the sunlight but you wont walk away from this one ill drop you where you stand you know will you dont throw that gun down youll have killed her ed dragged the weeping woman back another three feet just like you killed your partner youre a bleeding heart burke you cant live with that i can meg stepped up beside nate aimed her gun between eds eyes you know me you bastard ill down you like i would a sick horse and i wouldnt lose a wink of sleep over it meg nate warned ease back i can kill her and one of you first if thats what it takes her probably meg agreed but she doesnt mean anything to me go ahead shoot her youll be dead before she hits the ground ease back meg nate lifted his voice now and his eyes never left eds do what i tell you and do it now then he heard a chaos of voices stumbling feet the crowd was surging forward nate knew with curiosity fascination and horror outweighing simple fear drop the weapon and let her go nate ordered do it now and youve got a chance nate saw coben come around the back and knew someone was going to die hell broke loose ed whirled fired in a flash nate saw coben roll for cover and the splatter of blood from the bullet that caught him high on the shoulder cobens service revolver lay on the sidewalk where it had flown out of his hand nate heard a second bullet thud into the building beside him and the sound of a thousand people screaming they barely penetrated his blood was ice he shoved meg back sent her sprawling to the ground she cursed him as he stepped forward his gun steady anyone dies today heaid coolly itll be you ed what are you doing ed shouted as nate continued to walk toward him what the hell are you doing my job my town put down the gun or ill take you out like that sick horse go to hell with one violent move he shoved the weeping woman at nate and dived behind a car nate let the woman slide bonelessly to the sidewalk then he rolled under another car came up streetside crouched he glanced over to check on meg and saw her soothing the woman whose life shed claimed didnt mean anything to her go she snapped out get the bastard then she began to belly forward toward the injured coben ed fired the bullet exploding a windshield this ends here it ends now nate shouted throw out your gun or ill come and take it from you youre nothing there was more than panic more than rage in eds voice you dont even belong here there were tears he broke cover firing wildly glass shattered and flew like lethal stars metal pinged and rang nate stood stepped into the street with his weapon lifted he felt something sting his arm like a fat angry bee drop it you stupid son of a bitch on a scream ed swung around aimed and nate fired he saw ed clutch his hip saw him go down and continued forward at the same steady pace until hed reached the gun ed had dropped as hed fallen youre under arrest you asshole you coward his voice was calm as june as he shoved ed onto his belly yanked his arms behind him and cuffed his wrists then he crouched spoke softly while eds painglazed eyes flickered you shot a police officer he glanced without much interest at the thin line of blood just above his own elbow two youre done we need to get ken up here hopps query was conversational but when nate looked up to see her coming toward him crunching broken glass under her dressy shoes he saw the tremor in her hands her shoulders couldnt hurt he jerked a chin toward the people whod jumped over crawled under or simply shoved barricades aside youre going to need to keep those people back thats your job chief she managed a smile then it frosted as she stared down at ed you know that tv crew got damn near all of this on camera cameraman must be certifiable one thing were going to make clear in the upcoming interviews on this unholy mess this ones the outsider now hes not one of us she shifted deliberately away from ed held out a hand to nate as if to help him to his feet but you are you sure as hell are ignatious and thank god for it he took her hand and felt that light tremor in hers as she squeezed his hard anybody back there hurt bumps and bruises tears trembled in her eyes were willed away you took care of us good he nodded when he saw otto and peter working to move the crowd back then he looked over found meg crouched in a doorway she met his eyes there was blood on her hands but it appeared shed fashioned an expert field dressing on cobens wounded shoulder she brushed a hand absently over her cheek smearing blood then she grinned and blew him a kiss they said it was fortunate no lives had been lost and injuries to civilians while plentiful were mostly minor broken bones concussions cuts and bruises all caused by falls and panic they said property damage wasnt extensive broken windows windshields a street light jim mackie with considerable pride told the nbc affiliate reporter he was going to leave the bullet holes in his pickup they said all in all it was a hell of a climax to lunacy alaskas may day parade they said a lot of things media coverage turned out to be more extensive than the injuries the violent and bizarre capture of edward woolcott the alleged killer of patrick galloway the ice man of no name mountain was national fodder for weeks nate didnt watch the coverage and settled for reading reports in the lunatic as may passed so did the interest from outside long day meg said as she came out on the porch to sit beside him i like them long she handed him a beer and watched the sky with him it was nearly ten and brilliantly light her garden was planted her dahlias as expected were spectacular and the delphiniums speared up deeply blue on fivefoot stalks theyd reach taller yet she thought they had the whole summer all those long days washed with light the day before shed buried her father at last the town had come out for it to a man so had the media but it was the town that mattered to meg charlene had been calm she thought for charlene anyway she hadnt even played to the cameras but had stood as dignified as meg had ever seen her with her hand gripped in the professors maybe theyd make it maybe they wouldnt life was full of maybes but she knew one sure thing saturday next she would stand out here in the light of the summer night with the lake and the mountains in front of her and marry the man she loved tell me she said tell me what you found out today when you went down to talk to coben he knew shed ask he knew theyd talk it through not just because of her father but because what he himself did who he was mattered to her ed switched lawyers got a hotshot from outside hes claiming your father was selfdefense that galloway went crazy and he feared for his life and panicked hes a banker and he kept bankers records hes saying he won the twelve thousand that suddenly showed up in his account in march of that year but theyll have witnesses that say different so it wont fly he says he had nothing to do with the rest of it absolutely nothing that wont fly either there was a cloud of mosquitoes near the edge of the woods they buzzed like a chain saw and made him grateful for the bug dope hed slathered on before coming outside he turned his head to kiss her cheek sure you want to hear this keep going his wifes turned inside out so shes spilled enough to rip his alibis for the time of maxs death and yukons put that in with the yellow spray paint in his tool shed and harry stating ed bought some fresh meat from him the day we had our little encounter with the bear weave it all together youve got a tight little net added to all that is the fact that he held a gun to a tourists head shot a state cop and our chief of police she gave his biceps a quick kiss all of which she added was caught for the record by the nbc cameraman she stretched one long sinuous move great tv our brave and handsome hero shooting the bastards leg out from under him while he himself was wounded flesh wound standing that bastard down like cooper in high noon im no grace kelly but i get hot just thinking about it gosh maam he slapped at a sparrowsized mosquito that got through the dope it wasnt nothing and i looked pretty damn good myself even when you sent me to the damn sidewalk you look even better now the lawyers will try to work it diminished capacity temporary insanity but it wont fly meg finished cobenll wrap him up or the da will got their teeth in it now if coben had listened to you youd have wrapped him up without all that show maybe you couldve killed him nate took a small sip of beer and listened to an eagle cry you wanted him alive i aim to please you do please you wouldnt have done it either meg stretched out her legs looked down at the worn toes of her ancient gardening boots probably needed new dont be too sure nate hes not the only one who can bait you were razzing him meg pushing his buttons so hed pull the gun off her and try for one of us did you see her eyes no i was looking at his i did ive seen that kind of scared before a rabbit with its leg caught in a trap she paused to rub the dogs when they galloped up if you tell me no matter how many fancy lower lawyers he hires that hell go to jail for a long long time ill believe you hell go to jail for a long long time okay then case closed would you like to take a walk down by the lake he drew her hand to his lips i believe i would and would you then like to lie down on the bank of the lake and make love until were too weak to move i believe i would the mosquitoes will probably eat us alive some things are worth the risk he was she thought she rose held out a hand for his you know in a little while when we have sex itll be all legal that going to take any of the spark out of it for you not a bit he looked up at the sky again i like the long days but i dont mind the long nights anymore because ive got the light he wrapped his arm around her shoulder to draw her close to his side ive got the light right here he watched the sun so reluctant to set glimmer on the cool deep water and the mountains so fierce and so white mirrored their eternal winter on the summer blue
