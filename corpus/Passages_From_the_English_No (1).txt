 passages from the english notebooks of nathaniel hawthorne vol i to francis bennoch esq the dear and valued friend who by his generous and genial hospitality and unfailing sympathy contributed so largely as is attested by the book itself to render mr hawthornes residence in england agreeable and homelike these english notes are dedicated with sincere respect and regard by the editor preface it seems justly due to mr hawthorne that the occasion of any portion of his private journals being brought before the public should be made known since they were originally designed for his own reference only there had been a constant and an urgent demand for a life or memoir of mr hawthorne yet from the extreme delicacy and difficulty of the subject the editor felt obliged to refuse compliance with this demand moreover mr hawthorne had frequently and emphatically expressed the hope that no one would attempt to write his biography and the editor perceived that it would be impossible for any person outside of his own domestic circle to succeed in doing it on account of his extreme reserve but it was ungracious to do nothing and therefore the editor believing that mr hawthorne himself was alone capable of satisfactorily answering the affectionate call for some sketch of his life concluded to publish as much as possible of his private records and even extracts from his private letters in order to gratify the desire of his friends and of literary artists to become more intimately acquainted with him the editor has been severely blamed and wondered at in some instances for allowing many things now published to see the light but it has been a matter both of conscience and courtesy to withhold nothing that could be given up many of the journals were doubtless destroyed for the earliest date found in his american papers was that of the editor has transcribed the manuscripts just as they were left without making any new arrangement or altering any sequence merely omitting some passages and being especially careful to preserve whatever could throw any light upon his character to persons on a quest for characteristics however each of his books reveals a great many and it is believed that with the aid of the notes both american and english the tales and romances will make out a very complete and true picture of his individuality and the notes are often an open sesame to the artistic works several thickly written pages of observations fine and accurate etchings have been omitted sometimes because too personal with regard to himself or others and sometimes because they were afterwards absorbed into one or another of the romances or papers in our old home it seemed a pity not to give these original cartoons fresh from his mind because they are so carefully finished at the first stroke yet as mr hawthorne chose his own way of presenting them to the public it was thought better not to exhibit what he himself withheld besides to any other than a fellowartist they might seem mere repetitions it is very earnestly hoped that these volumes of notes american english and presently italian will dispel an oftenexpressed opinion that mr hawthorne was gloomy and morbid he had the inevitable pensiveness and gravity of a person who possessed what a friend of his called the awful power of insight but his mood was always cheerful and equal and his mind peculiarly healthful and the airy splendor of his wit and humor was the light of his home he saw too far to be despondent though his vivid sympathies and shaping imagination often made him sad in behalf of others he also perceived morbidness wherever it existed instantly as if by the illumination of his own steady cheer and he had the plastic power of putting himself into each persons situation and of looking from every point of view which made his charity most comprehensive from this cause he necessarily attracted confidences and became confessor to very many sinning and suffering souls to whom he gave tender sympathy and help while resigning judgment to the omniscient and allwise throughout his journals it will be seen that mr hawthorne is entertaining and not asserting opinions and ideas he questions doubts and reflects with his pen and as it were instructs himself so that these notebooks should be read not as definitive conclusions of his mind but merely as passing impressions often whatever conclusions be arrived at are condensed in the works given to the world by his own hand in which will never be found a careless word he was so extremely scrupulous about the value and effect of every expression that the editor has felt great compunction in allowing a single sentence to be printed unrevised by himself but with the consideration of the above remarks always kept in mind these volumes are intrusted to the generous interpretation of the reader if any one must be harshly criticised it ought certainly to be the editor when a person breaks in unannounced upon the morning hours of an artist and finds him not in full dress the intruder and not the surprised artist is doubtless at fault s h dresden april passages from hawthornes english notebooks liverpool august th a month lacking two days since we left america a fortnight and some odd days since we arrived in england i began my services such as they are on monday last august st and here i sit in my private room at the consulate while the viceconsul and clerk are carrying on affairs in the outer office the pleasantest incident of the morning is when mr pearce the viceconsul makes his appearance with the accountbooks containing the receipts and expenditures of the preceding day and deposits on my desk a little rouleau of the queens coin wrapped up in a piece of paper this morning there were eight sovereigns four halfcrowns and a shilling a pretty fair days work though not more than the average ought to be this forenoon thus far i have had two calls not of business one from an american captain and his son another from mr h b whom i met in america and who has showed us great attention here he has arranged for us to go to the theatre with some of his family this evening since i have been in liverpool we have hardly had a day until yesterday without more or less of rain and so cold and shivery that life was miserable i am not warm enough even now but am gradually getting acclimated in that respect just now i have been fooled out of half a crown by a young woman who represents herself as an american and destitute having come over to see an uncle whom she found dead and she has no means of getting back again her accent is not that of an american and her appearance is not particularly prepossessing though not decidedly otherwise she is decently dressed and modest in deportment but i do not quite trust her face she has been separated from her husband as i understand her by course of law has had two children both now dead what she wants is to get back to america and perhaps arrangements may be made with some shipmaster to take her as stewardess or in some subordinate capacity my judgment on the whole is that she is an english woman married to and separated from an american husband of no very decided virtue i might as well have kept my halfcrown and yet i might have bestowed it worse she is very decent in manner cheerful at least not despondent at two oclock i went over to the royal rock hotel about fifteen or twenty minutes steaming from this side of the river we are going there on saturday to reside for a while returning i found that mr b from the american chamber of commerce had called to arrange the time and place of a visit to the consul from a delegation of that body settled for tomorrow at quarter past one at mr blodgetts august th an invitation this morning from the mayor to dine at the town hall on friday next heaven knows i had rather dine at the humblest inn in the city inasmuch as a speech will doubtless be expected from me however things must be as they may at a quarter past one i was duly on hand at mr blodgetts to receive the deputation from the chamber of commerce they arrived pretty seasonably in two or three carriages and were ushered into the drawingroom seven or eight gentlemen some of whom i had met before hereupon ensued a speech from mr b the chairman of the delegation short and sweet alluding to my literary reputation and other laudatory matters and occupying only a minute or two the speaker was rather embarrassed which encouraged me a little and yet i felt more diffidence on this occasion than in my effort at mr crittendens lunch where indeed i was perfectly selfpossessed but here there being less formality and more of a conversational character in what was said my usual diffidence could not so well be kept in abeyance however i did not break down to an intolerable extent and winding up my eloquence as briefly as possible we had a social talk their whole stay could not have been much more than a quarter of an hour a call this morning at the consulate from dr bowrug who is british minister or something of the kind in china and now absent on a twelvemonths leave the doctor is a brisk person with the address of a man of the world free quick to smile and of agreeable manners he has a good face rather american than english in aspect and does not look much above fifty though he says he is between sixty and seventy i should take him rather for an active lawyer or a man of business than for a scholar and a literary man he talked in a lively way for ten or fifteen minutes and then took his leave offering me any service in his power in london as for instance to introduce me to the athenaeum club august th day before yesterday i escorted my family to rock ferry two miles either up or down the mersey and i really dont know which by steamer which runs every halfhour there are steamers going continually to birkenhead and other landings and almost always a great many passengers on the transit at this time the boat was crowded so as to afford scanty standingroom it being saturday and therefore a kind of galaday i think i have never seen a populace before coming to england but this crowd afforded a specimen of one both male and female the women were the most remarkable though they seemed not disreputable there was in them a coarseness a freedom an i dont know what that was purely english in fact men and women here do things that would at least make them ridiculous in america they are not afraid to enjoy themselves in their own way and have no pseudogentility to support some girls danced upon the crowded deck to the miserable music of a little fragment of a band which goes up and down the river on each trip of the boat just before the termination of the voyage a man goes round with a bugle turned upwards to receive the eleemosynary pence and halfpence of the passengers i gave one of them the other day a silver fourpence which fell into the vitals of the instrument and compelled the man to take it to pieces at rock ferry there was a great throng forming a scene not unlike one of our musterdays or a fourth of july and there were bands of music and banners and small processions after them and a school of charity children i believe enjoying a festival and there was a club of respectable persons playing at bowls on the bowlinggreen of the hotel and there were children infants riding on donkeys at a penny a ride while their mothers walked alongside to prevent a fall yesterday while we were at dinner mr b came in his carriage to take us to his residence poulton hall he had invited us to dine but i misunderstood him and thought he only intended to give us a drive poulton hall is about three miles from rock ferry the road passing through some pleasant rural scenery and one or two villages with houses standing close together and old stone or brick cottages with thatched roofs and now and then a better mansion apart among trees we passed an old church with a tower and spire and halfway up a patch of ivy dark green and some yellow wallflowers in full bloom growing out of the crevices of the stone mr b told us that the tower was formerly quite clothed with ivy from bottom to top but that it had fallen away for lack of the nourishment that it used to find in the lime between the stones this old church answered to my transatlantic fancies of england better than anything i have yet seen not far from it was the rectory behind a deep grove of ancient trees and there lives the rector enjoying a thousand pounds a year and his nothingtodo while a curate performs the real duty on a stipend of eighty pounds we passed through a considerable extent of private road and finally drove over a lawn studded with trees and closely shaven till we reached the door of poulton hall part of the mansion is three or four hundred years old another portion is about a hundred and fifty and still another has been built during the present generation the house is two stories high with a sort of beetlebrowed roof in front it is not very striking and does not look older than many wooden houses which i have seen in america there is a curious stately staircase with a twisted balustrade much like that of the old province house in boston the drawingroom is a handsome modern apartment being beautifully painted and gilded and paperhung with a white marble fireplace and rich furniture so that the impression is that of newness not of age it is the same with the diningroom and all the rest of the interior so far as i saw it mr b did not inherit this old hall nor indeed is he the owner but only the tenant of it he is a merchant of liverpool a bachelor with two sisters residing with him in the entrancehall there was a stuffed fox with glass eyes which i never should have doubted to be an actual live fox except for his keeping so quiet also some grouse and other game mr b seems to be a sportsman and is setting out this week on an excursion to scotland moorfowl shooting while the family and two or three guests went to dinner we walked out to see the place the gardener an irishman showed us through the garden which is large and well cared for they certainly get everything from nature which she can possibly be persuaded to give them here in england there were peaches and pears growing against the high brick southern walls the trunk and branches of the trees being spread out perfectly flat against the wall very much like the skin of a dead animal nailed up to dry and not a single branch protruding figs were growing in the same way the brick wall very probably was heated within by means of pipes in order to reenforce the insufficient heat of the sun it seems as if there must be something unreal and unsatisfactory in fruit that owes its existence to such artificial methods squashes were growing under glass poor things there were immensely large gooseberries in the garden and in this particular berry the english i believe have decidedly the advantage over ourselves the raspberries too were large and good i espied one gigantic hogweed in the garden and really my heart warmed to it being strongly reminded of the principal product of my own garden at concord after viewing the garden sufficiently the gardener led us to other parts of the estate and we had glimpses of a delightful valley its sides shady with beautiful trees and a rich grassy meadow at the bottom by means of a steamengine and subterranean pipes and hydrants the liquid manure from the barnyard is distributed wherever it is wanted over the estate being spouted in rich showers from the hydrants under this influence the meadow at the bottom of the valley had already been made to produce three crops of grass during the present season and would produce another the lawn around poulton hall like thousands of other lawns in england is very beautiful but requires great care to keep it so being shorn every three or four days no other country will ever have this charm nor the charm of lovely verdure which almost makes up for the absence of sunshine without the constant rain and shadow which strikes us as so dismal these lawns would be as brown as an autumn leaf i have not thus far found any such magnificent trees as i expected mr b told me that three oaks standing in a row on his lawn were the largest in the county they were very good trees to be sure and perhaps four feet in diameter near the ground but with no very noble spread of foliage in concord there are if not oaks yet certainly elms a great deal more stately and beautiful but on the whole this lawn and the old hall in the midst of it went a good way towards realizing some of my fancies of english life by and by a footman looking very quaint and queer in his livery coat drab breeches and white stockings came to invite me to the table where i found mr b and his sisters and guests sitting at the fruit and wine there were port sherry madeira and one bottle of claret all very good but they take here much heavier wines than we drink now in america after a tolerably long session we went to the tearoom where i drank some coffee and at about the edge of dusk the carriage drew up to the door to take us home mr b and his sisters have shown us genuine kindness and they gave us a hearty invitation to come and ramble over the house whenever we pleased during their absence in scotland they say that there are many legends and ghoststories connected with the house and there is an attic chamber with a skylight which is called the martyrs chamber from the fact of its having in old times been tenanted by a lady who was imprisoned there and persecuted to death for her religion there is an old blackletter library but the room containing it is shut barred and padlocked the owner of the house refusing to let it be opened lest some of the books should be stolen meanwhile the rats are devouring them and the damps destroying them august th a pretty comfortable day as to warmth and i believe there is sunshine overhead but a seacloud composed of fog and coalsmoke envelops liverpool at rock ferry when i left it at half past nine there was promise of a cheerful day a good many gentlemen or rather respectable business people came in the boat and it is not unpleasant on these fine mornings to take the breezy atmosphere of the river the huge steamer great britain bound for australia lies right off the rock ferry landing and at a little distance are two old hulks of ships of war dismantled roofed over and anchored in the river formerly for quarantine purposes but now used chiefly or solely as homes for old seamen whose light labor it is to take care of these condemned ships there are a great many steamers plying up and down the river to various landings in the vicinity and a good many steamtugs also many boats most of which have darkred or tancolored sails being oiled to resist the wet also here and there a yacht or pleasureboat and a few ships riding stately at their anchors probably on the point of sailing the river however is by no means crowded because the immense multitude of ships are ensconced in the docks where their masts make an intricate forest for miles up and down the liverpool shore the small black steamers whizzing industriously along many of them crowded with passengers snake up the chief life of the scene the mersey has the color of a mudpuddle and no atmospheric effect as far as i have seen ever gives it a more agreeable tinge visitors today thus far have been h a b with whom i have arranged to dine with us at rock ferry and then he is to take us on board the great britain of which his father is owner in great part secondly monsieur h the french consul who can speak hardly any english and who was more powerfully scented with cigarsmoke than any man i ever encountered a polite grayhaired rednosed gentleman very courteous and formal heaven keep him from me at one oclock or thereabouts i walked into the city down through lord street church street and back to the consulate through various untraceable crookednesses coming to chapel street i crossed the graveyard of the old church of st nicholas this is i suppose the oldest sacred site in liverpool a church having stood here ever since the conquest though probably there is little or nothing of the old edifice in the present one either the whole of the edifice or else the steeple being thereto shaken by a chime of bells perhaps both at different times has tumbled down but the present church is what we americans should call venerable when the first church was built and long afterwards it must have stood on the grassy verge of the mersey but now there are pavements and warehouses and the thronged princes and georges docks between it and the river and all around it is the very busiest bustle of commerce rumbling wheels hurrying men portershops everything that pertains to the grossest and most practical life and notwithstanding there is the broad churchyard extending on three sides of it just as it used to be a thousand years ago it is absolutely paved from border to border with flat tombstones on a level with the soil and with each other so that it is one floor of stone over the whole space with grass here and there sprouting between the crevices all these stones no doubt formerly had inscriptions but as many people continually pass in various directions across the churchyard and as the tombstones are not of a very hard material the records on many of them are effaced i saw none very old a quarter of a century is sufficient to obliterate the letters and make all smooth where the direct pathway from gate to gate lies over the stones the climate and casual footsteps rub out any inscription in less than a hundred years some of the monuments are cracked on many is merely cut the burial place of so and so on others there is a long list of halfreadable names on some few a laudatory epitaph out of which however it were far too tedious to pick the meaning but it really is interesting and suggestive to think of this old church first built when liverpool was a small village and remaining with its successive dead of ten centuries around it now that the greatest commercial city in the world has its busiest centre there i suppose people still continue to be buried in the cemetery the greatest upholders of burials in cities are those whose progenitors have been deposited around or within the city churches if this spacious churchyard stood in a similar position in one of our american cities i rather suspect that long ere now it would have run the risk of being laid out in buildinglots and covered with warehouses even if the church itself escaped but it would not escape longer than till its disrepair afforded excuse for tearing it down and why should it when its purposes might be better served in another spot we went on board the great britain before dinner between five and six oclock a great structure as to convenient arrangement and adaptation but giving me a strong impression of the tedium and misery of the long voyage to australia by way of amusement she takes over fifty pounds worth of playingcards at two shillings per pack for the use of passengers also a small wellselected library after a considerable time spent on board we returned to the hotel and dined and mr b took his leave at nine oclock august th i left rock ferry for the city at half past nine in the boat which arrived thence there were several men and women with baskets on their heads for this is a favorite way of carrying burdens and they trudge onward beneath them without any apparent fear of an overturn and seldom putting up a hand to steady them one woman this morning had a heavy load of crockery another an immense basket of turnips freshly gathered that seemed to me as much as a man could well carry on his back these must be a stiffnecked people the women step sturdily and freely and with not ungraceful strength the trip over to town was pleasant it being a fair morning only with a lowhanging fog had it been in america i should have anticipated a day of burning heat visitors this morning mr ogden of chicago or somewhere in the western states who arrived in england a fortnight ago and who called on me at that time he has since been in scotland and is now going to london and the continent secondly the captain of the collins steamer pacific which sails today thirdly an american shipmaster who complained that he had never in his heretofore voyages been able to get sight of the american consul mr pearces customary matutinal visit was unusually agreeable today inasmuch as he laid on my desk nineteen golden sovereigns and thirteen shillings it being the day of the steamers departure an unusual number of invoice certificates had been required my signature to each of which brings me two dollars the autograph of a living author has seldom been so much in request at so respectable a price colonel crittenden told me that he had received as much as fifty pounds on a single day heaven prosper the trade between america and liverpool august th many scenes which i should have liked to record have occurred but the pressure of business has prevented me from recording them from day to day on thursday i went on invitation from mr b to the prodigious steamer great britain down the harbor and some miles into the sea to escort her off a little way on her voyage to australia there is an immense enthusiasm among the english people about this ship on account of its being the largest in the world the shores were lined with people to see her sail and there were innumerable small steamers crowded with men all the way out into the ocean nothing seems to touch the english nearer than this question of nautical superiority and if we wish to hit them to the quick we must hit them there on friday at pm i went to dine with the mayor it was a dinner given to the judges and the grand jury the judges of england during the time of holding an assize are the persons first in rank in the kingdom they take precedence of everybody else of the highest military officers of the lord lieutenants of the archbishops of the prince of wales of all except the sovereign whose authority and dignity they represent in case of a royal dinner the judge would lead the queen to the table the dinner was at the town hall and the rooms and the whole affair were all in the most splendid style nothing struck me more than the footmen in the city livery they really looked more magnificent in their goldlace and breeches and white silk stockings than any officers of state the rooms were beautiful gorgeously painted and gilded gorgeously lighted gorgeously hung with paintings the plate was gorgeous and the dinner gorgeous in the english fashion after the removal of the cloth the mayor gave various toasts prefacing each with some remarks the first of course the sovereign after which god save the queen was sung the company standing up and joining in the chorus their ample faces glowing with wine enthusiasm and loyalty afterwards the bar and various other dignities and institutions were toasted and by and by came the toast to the united states and to me as their representative hereupon either hail columbia or yankee doodle or some other of our national tunes but heaven knows which was played and at the conclusion being at bay and with no alternative i got upon my legs and made a response they received me and listened to my nonsense with a good deal of rapping and my speech seemed to give great satisfaction my chief difficulty being in not knowing how to pitch my voice to the size of the room as for the matter it is not of the slightest consequence anybody may make an afterdinner speech who will be content to talk onward without saying anything my speech was not more than two or three inches long and considering that i did not know a soul there except the mayor himself and that i am wholly unpractised in all sorts of oratory and that i had nothing to say it was quite successful i hardly thought it was in me but being once started i felt no embarrassment and went through it as coolly as if i were going to be hanged yesterday after dinner i took a walk with my family we went through byways and private roads and saw more of rural england with its hedgerows its grassy fields and its whitewashed old stone cottages than we have before seen since our arrival august th this being saturday there early commenced a throng of visitants to rock ferry the boat in which i came over brought from the city a multitude of factorypeople they had bands of music and banners inscribed with the names of the mills they belong to and other devices palelooking people but not looking exactly as if they were underfed they are brought on reduced terms by the railways and steamers and come from great distances in the interior these i believe were from preston i have not yet had an opportunity of observing how they amuse themselves during these excursions at the dock the other day the steamer arrived from rock ferry with a countless multitude of little girls in coarse blue gowns who as they landed formed in procession and walked up the dock these girls had been taken from the workhouses and educated at a charityschool and would by and by be apprenticed as servants i should not have conceived it possible that so many children could have been collected together without a single trace of beauty or scarcely of intelligence in so much as one individual such mean coarse vulgar features and figures betraying unmistakably a low origin and ignorant and brutal parents they did not appear wicked but only stupid animal and soulless it must require many generations of better life to wake the soul in them all america could not show the like august d a captain auld an american having died here yesterday i went with my clerk and an american shipmaster to take the inventory of his effects his boardinghouse was in a mean street an old dingy house with narrow entrance the class of boardinghouse frequented by mates of vessels and inferior to those generally patronized by masters a fat elderly landlady of respectable and honest aspect and her daughter a pleasing young woman enough received us and ushered us into the deceaseds bedchamber it was a dusky back room plastered and painted yellow its one window looking into the very narrowest of backyards or courts and out on a confused multitude of back buildings appertaining to other houses most of them old with rude chimneys of washrooms and kitchens the bricks of which seemed half loose the chattels of the dead man were contained in two trunks a chest a sailcloth bag and a barrel and consisted of clothing suggesting a thickset middlesized man papers relative to ships and business a spyglass a loaded iron pistol some books of navigation some charts several great pieces of tobacco and a few cigars some little plaster images that he had probably bought for his children a cotton umbrella and other trumpery of no great value in one of the trunks we found about twenty pounds worth of english and american gold and silver and some notes of hand due in america of all these things the clerk made an inventory after which we took possession of the money and affixed the consular seal to the trunks bag and chest while this was going on we heard a great noise of men quarrelling in an adjoining court and altogether it seemed a squalid and ugly place to live in and a most undesirable one to die in at the conclusion of our labors the young woman asked us if we would not go into another chamber and look at the corpse and appeared to think that we should be rather glad than otherwise of the privilege but never having seen the man during his lifetime i declined to commence his acquaintance now his bills for board and nursing amount to about the sum which we found in his trunk his funeral expenses will be ten pounds more the surgeon has sent in a bill of eight pounds odd shillings and the account of another medical man is still to be rendered as his executor i shall pay his landlady and nurse and for the rest of the expenses a subscription must be made according to the custom in such cases among the shipmasters headed by myself the funeral pomp will consist of a hearse one coach four men with crape hatbands and a few other items together with a grave at five pounds over which his friends will be entitled to place a stone if they choose to do so within twelve months as we left the house we looked into the dark and squalid diningroom where a lunch of cold meat was set out but having no associations with the house except through this one dead man it seemed as if his presence and attributes pervaded it wholly he appears to have been a man of reprehensible habits though well advanced in years i ought not to forget a brandyflask empty among his other effects the landlady and daughter made a good impression on me as honest and respectable persons august th yesterday in the forenoon i received a note and shortly afterwards a call at the consulate from miss h whom i apprehend to be a lady of literary tendencies she said that miss l had promised her an introduction but that happening to pass through liverpool she had snatched the opportunity to make my acquaintance she seems to be a mature lady rather plain but with an honest and intelligent face it was rather a singular freedom methinks to come down upon a perfect stranger in this way to sit with him in his private office an hour or two and then walk about the streets with him as she did for i did the honors of liverpool and showed her the public buildings her talk was sensible but not particularly brilliant nor interesting a good solid personage physically and intellectually she is an english woman in the afternoon at three oclock i attended the funeral of captain auld being ushered into the diningroom of his boardinghouse i found brandy gin and wine set out on a tray together with some little spicecakes by and by came in a woman who asked if i were going to the funeral and then proceeded to put a mourningband on my hat a blacksilk band covering the whole hat and streaming nearly a yard behind after waiting the better part of an hour nobody else appeared although several shipmasters had promised to attend hereupon the undertaker was anxious to set forth but the landlady who was arrayed in shining black silk thought it a shame that the poor man should be buried with such small attendance so we waited a little longer during which interval i heard the landladys daughter sobbing and wailing in the entry and but for this tenderheartedness there would have been no tears at all finally we set forth the undertaker a friend of his and a young man perhaps the landladys son and myself in the blackplumed coach and the landlady her daughter and a female friend in the coach behind previous to this however everybody had taken some wine or spirits for it seemed to be considered disrespectful not to do so before us went the plumed hearse a stately affair with a basrelief of funereal figures upon its sides we proceeded quite across the city to the necropolis where the coffin was carried into a chapel in which we found already another coffin and another set of mourners awaiting the clergyman anon he appeared a stern broadframed large and baldheaded man in a blacksilk gown he mounted his desk and read the service in quite a feeble and unimpressive way though with no lack of solemnity this done our four bearers took up the coffin and carried it out of the chapel but descending the steps and perhaps having taken a little too much brandy one of them stumbled and down came the coffin not quite to the ground however for they grappled with it and contrived with a great struggle to prevent the misadventure but i really expected to see poor captain auld burst forth among us in his graveclothes the necropolis is quite a handsome burialplace shut in by high walls so overrun with shrubbery that no part of the brick or stone is visible part of the space within is an ornamental garden with flowers and green turf the rest is strewn with flat gravestones and a few raised monuments and straight avenues run to and fro between captain aulds grave was dug nine feet deep it is his own for twelve months but if his friends do not choose to give him a stone it will become a common grave at the end of that time and four or five more bodies may then be piled upon his every one seemed greatly to admire the grave the undertaker praised it and also the dryness of its site which he took credit to himself for having chosen the gravedigger too was very proud of its depth and the neatness of his handiwork the clergyman who had marched in advance of us from the chapel now took his stand at the head of the grave and lifting his hat proceeded with what remained of the service while we stood bareheaded around when he came to a particular part ashes to ashes dust to dust the undertaker lifted a handful of earth and threw it rattling on the coffin so did the landladys son and so did i after the funeral the undertakers friend an elderly coarselooking man looked round him and remarked that the grass had never grown on the parties who died in the cholera year but at this the undertaker laughed in scorn as we returned to the gate of the cemetery the sexton met us and pointed to a small office on entering which we found the clergyman who was waiting for his burialfees there was now a dispute between the clergyman and the undertaker the former wishing to receive the whole amount for the gravestone which the undertaker of course refused to pay i explained how the matter stood on which the clergyman acquiesced civilly enough but it was very strange to see the worldly businesslike way in which he entered into this squabble so soon after burying poor captain auld during our drive back in the mourningcoach the undertaker his friend and the landladys son still kept descanting on the excellence of the grave such a fine grave such a nice grave such a splendid grave and really they seemed almost to think it worth while to die for the sake of being buried there they deemed it an especial pity that such a grave should ever become a common grave why said they to me by paying the extra price you may have it for your own grave or for your family meaning that we should have a right to pile ourselves over the defunct captain i wonder how the english ever attain to any conception of a future existence since they so overburden themselves with earth and mortality in their ideas of funerals a drive with an undertaker in a sableplumed coach talking about graves and yet he was a jolly old fellow wonderfully corpulent with a smile breaking out easily all over his face although once in a while he looked professionally lugubrious all the time the scent of that horrible mourningcoach is in my nostrils and i breathe nothing but a funeral atmosphere saturday august th this being the galaday of the manufacturing people about liverpool the steamboats to rock ferry were seasonably crowded with large parties of both sexes they were accompanied with two bands of music in uniform and these bands before i left the hotel were playing in competition and rivalry with each other in the coachyard loud martial strains from shining brass instruments a prize is to be assigned to one or to the other of these bands and i suppose this was a part of the competition meanwhile the merrymaking people who thronged the courtyard were quaffing coffee from blue earthen mugs which they brought with them as likewise they brought the coffee and had it made in the hotel it had poured with rain about the time of their arrival notwithstanding which they did not seem disheartened for of course in this climate it enters into all their calculations to be drenched through and through by and by the sun shone out and it has continued to shine and shade every ten minutes ever since all these people were decently dressed the men generally in dark clothes not so smartly as americans on a festal day but so as not to be greatly different as regards dress they were paler smaller less wholesomelooking and less intelligent and i think less noisy than so many yankees would have been the women and girls differed much more from what american girls and women would be on a pleasureexcursion being so shabbily dressed with no kind of smartness no silks nothing but cotton gowns i believe and illlooking bonnets which however was the only part of their attire that they seemed to care about guarding from the rain as to their persons they generally looked better developed and healthier than the men but there was a woful lack of beauty and grace not a pretty girl among them all coarse and vulgar their bodies it seems to me are apt to be very long in proportion to their limbs in truth this kind of make is rather characteristic of both sexes in england the speech of these folks in some instances was so broad lancashire that i could not well understand it a walk to bebbington rock ferry august th yesterday we all took a walk into the country it was a fine afternoon with clouds of course in different parts of the sky but a clear atmosphere bright sunshine and altogether a septembrish feeling the ramble was very pleasant along the hedgelined roads in which there were flowers blooming and the varnished holly certainly one of the most beautiful shrubs in the world so far as foliage goes we saw one cottage which i suppose was several hundred years old it was of stone filled into a wooden frame the blackoak of which was visible like an external skeleton it had a thatched roof and was whitewashed we passed through a village higher bebbington i believe with narrow streets and mean houses all of brick or stone and not standing wide apart from each other as in american country villages but conjoined there was an immense almshouse in the midst at least i took it to be so in the centre of the village too we saw a moderatesized brick house built in imitation of a castle with a tower and turret in which an upper and an under row of small cannon were mounted now green with moss there were also battlements along the roof of the house which looked as if it might have been built eighty or a hundred years ago in the centre of it there was the dial of a clock but the inner machinery had been removed and the hands hanging listlessly moved to and fro in the wind it was quite a novel symbol of decay and neglect on the wall close to the street there were certain eccentric inscriptions cut into slabs of stone but i could make no sense of them at the end of the house opposite the turret we peeped through the bars of an iron gate and beheld a little paved courtyard and at the farther side of it a small piazza beneath which seemed to stand the figure of a man he appeared well advanced in years and was dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches with a white or straw hat on his head behold too in a kennel beside the porch a large dog sitting on his hind legs chained also close beside the gateway another man seated in a kind of arbor all these were wooden images and the whole castellated small villagedwelling with the inscriptions and the queer statuary was probably the whim of some halfcrazy person who has now no doubt been long asleep in bebbington churchyard the bell of the old church was ringing as we went along and many respectablelooking people and cleanly dressed children were moving towards the sound soon we reached the church and i have seen nothing yet in england that so completely answered my idea of what such a thing was as this old village church of bebbington it is quite a large edifice built in the form of a cross a low peaked porch in the side over which rudely cut in stone is the date and something the steeple has ivy on it and looks old old old so does the whole church though portions of it have been renewed but not so as to impair the aspect of heavy substantial endurance and long long decay which may go on hundreds of years longer before the church is a ruin there it stands among the surrounding graves looking just the same as it did in bloody marys days just as it did in cromwells time a bird and perhaps many birds had its nest in the steeple and flew in and out of the loopholes that were opened into it the stone framework of the windows looked particularly old there were monuments about the church some lying flat on the ground others elevated on low pillars or on cross slabs of stone and almost all looking dark mossgrown and very antique but on reading some of the inscriptions i was surprised to find them very recent for in fact twenty years of this climate suffices to give as much or more antiquity of aspect whether to gravestone or edifice than a hundred years of our own so soon do lichens creep over the surface so soon does it blacken so soon do the edges lose their sharpness so soon does time gnaw away the records the only really old monuments and those not very old were two standing close together and raised on low rude arches the dates on which were and on one a cross was rudely cut into the stone but there may have been hundreds older than this the records on which had been quite obliterated and the stones removed and the graves dug over anew none of the monuments commemorate people of rank on only one the buried person was recorded as gent while we sat on the flat slabs resting ourselves several little girls healthylooking and prettily dressed enough came into the churchyard and began to talk and laugh and to skip merrily from one tombstone to another they stared very broadly at us and one of them by and by ran up to u and j and gave each of them a green apple then they skipped upon the tombstones again while within the church we heard them singing sounding pretty much as i have heard it in our pinebuilt new england meetinghouses meantime the rector had detected the voices of these naughty little girls and perhaps had caught glimpses of them through the windows for anon out came the sexton and addressing himself to us asked whether there had been any noise or disturbance in the churchyard i should not have borne testimony against these little villagers but s was so anxious to exonerate our own children that she pointed out these poor little sinners to the sexton who forthwith turned them out he would have done the same to us no doubt had my coat been worse than it was but as the matter stood his demeanor was rather apologetic than menacing when he informed us that the rector had sent him we stayed a little longer looking at the graves some of which were between the buttresses of the church and quite close to the wall as if the sleepers anticipated greater comfort and security the nearer they could get to the sacred edifice as we went out of the churchyard we passed the aforesaid little girls who were sitting behind the mound of a tomb and busily babbling together they called after us expressing their discontent that we had betrayed them to the sexton and saying that it was not they who made the noise going homeward we went astray in a green lane that terminated in the midst of a field without outlet so that we had to retrace a good many of our footsteps close to the wall of the church beside the door there was an ancient baptismal font of stone in fact it was a pile of roughly hewn stone steps five or six feet high with a block of stone at the summit in which was a hollow about as big as a washbowl it was full of rainwater the church seems to be st andrews church lower bebbington built in september st today we leave the rock ferry hotel where we have spent nearly four weeks it is a comfortable place and we have had a good table and have been kindly treated we occupied a large parlor extending through the whole breadth of the house with a bowwindow looking towards liverpool and adown the intervening river and to birkenhead on the hither side the river would be a pleasanter object if it were blue and transparent instead of such a mudpuddly hue also if it were always full to its brine whereas it generally presents a margin and sometimes a very broad one of glistening mud with here and there a small vessel aground on it nevertheless the parlorwindow has given us a pretty good idea of the nautical business of liverpool the constant objects being the little black steamers puffing unquietly along sometimes to our own ferry sometimes beyond it to eastham and sometimes towing a long string of boats from runcorn or otherwhere up the river laden with goods and sometimes gallanting a tall ship in or out some of these ships lie for days together in the river very majestic and stately objects often with the flag of the stars and stripes waving over them now and then after a gale at sea a vessel comes in with her masts broken short off in the midst and with marks of rough handling about the hull once a week comes a cunard steamer with its red funnel pipe whitened by the salt spray and firing off cannon to announce her arrival she moors to a large iron buoy in the middle of the river and a few hundred yards from the stone pier of our ferry immediately comes poring towards her a little mailsteamer to take away her mailbags and such of the passengers as choose to land and for several hours afterwards the cunard lies with the smoke and steam coming out of her as if she were smoking her pipe after her toilsome passage across the atlantic once a fortnight comes an american steamer of the collins line and then the cunard salutes her with cannon to which the collins responds and moors herself to another iron buoy not far from the cunard when they go to sea it is with similar salutes the two vessels paying each other the more ceremonious respect because they are inimical and jealous of each other besides these there are other steamers of all sorts and sizes for pleasureexcursions for regular trips to dublin the isle of man and elsewhither and vessels which are stationary as floating lights but which seem to relieve one another at intervals and small vessels with sails looking as if made of tanned leather and schooners and yachts and all manner of oddlooking craft but none so odd as the chinese junk this junk lies by our own pier and looks as if it were copied from some picture on an old teacup beyond all these objects we see the other side of the mersey with the delectably green fields opposite to us while the shore becomes more and more thickly populated until about two miles off we see the dense centre of the city with the dome of the custom house and steeples and towers and close to the water the spire of st nicholas and above and intermingled with the whole city scene the duskiness of the coalsmoke gushing upward along the bank we perceive the warehouses of the albert dock and the queens tobacco warehouses and other docks and nigher to us a shipyard or two in the evening all this sombre picture gradually darkens out of sight and in its place appear only the lights of the city kindling into a galaxy of earthly stars for a long distance up and down the shore and in one or two spots the bright red gleam of a furnace like the red planet mars and once in a while a bright wandering beam gliding along the river as a steamer cones or goes between us and liverpool rock park september d we got into our new house in rock park yesterday it is quite a good house with three apartments beside kitchen and pantry on the lower floor and it is three stories high with four good chambers in each story it is a stone edifice like almost all the english houses and handsome in its design the rent without furniture would probably have been one hundred pounds furnished it is one hundred and sixty pounds rock park as the locality is called is private property and is now nearly covered with residences for professional people merchants and others of the upper middling class the houses being mostly built i suppose on speculation and let to those who occupy them it is the quietest place imaginable there being a police station at the entrance and the officer on duty allows no ragged or illlooking person to pass there being a toll it precludes all unnecessary passage of carriages and never were there more noiseless streets than those that give access to these pretty residences on either side there is thick shrubbery with glimpses through it of the ornamented portals or into the trim gardens with smoothshaven lawns of no large extent but still affording reasonable breathingspace they are really an improvement on anything save what the very rich can enjoy in america the former occupants of our house mrs campbell and family having been fond of flowers there are many rare varieties in the garden and we are told that there is scarcely a month in the year when a flower will not be found there the house is respectably though not very elegantly furnished it was a dismal rainy day yesterday and we had a coalfire in the sittingroom beside which i sat last evening as twilight came on and thought rather sadly how many times we have changed our home since we were married in the first place our three years at the old manse then a brief residence at salem then at boston then two or three years at salem again then at lenox then at west newton and then again at concord where we imagined that we were fixed for life but spent only a year then this farther flight to england where we expect to spend four years and afterwards another year or two in italy during all which time we shall have no real home for as i sat in this english house with the chill rainy english twilight brooding over the lawn and a coalfire to keep me comfortable on the first evening of september and the picture of a stranger the dead husband of mrs campbell gazing down at me from above the mantelpiece i felt that i never should be quite at home here nevertheless the fire was very comfortable to look at and the shape of the fireplace an arch with a deep cavity was an improvement on the square shallow opening of an american coalgrate september th it appears by the annals of liverpool contained in gores directory that in there was a baronial castle built by roger de poictiers on the site of the present st georges church it was taken down in the church now stands at one of the busiest points of the principal street of the city the old church of st nicholas founded about the time of the conquest and more recently rebuilt stood within a quarter of a mile of the castle in birkenhead priory was founded on the cheshire side of the mersey the monks used to ferry passengers across to liverpool until when woodside ferry was established twopence for a horseman and a farthing for a footpassenger steam ferryboats now cross to birkenhead monks ferry and woodside every ten minutes and i believe there are large hotels at all these places and many of the business men of liverpool have residences in them in a tower was built by sir john stanley which continued to be a castle of defence to the stanley family for many hundred years and was not finally taken down till when its site had become the present water street in the densest commercial centre of the city there appear to have been other baronial castles and residences in different parts of the city as a hall in old hall street built by sir john de la more on the site of which a countinghouse now stands this knightly family of de la more sometimes supplied mayors to the city as did the family of the earls of derby about edward earl of derby maintained two hundred and fifty citizens of liverpool fed sixty aged persons twice a day and provided twentyseven hundred persons with meat drink and money every good friday in prince rupert besieged the town for twentyfour days and finally took it by storm this was june th and the parliamentarians under sir john meldrum repossessed it the following october in the mayor of liverpool kept an inn in there was only one carriage in town and no stagecoach came nearer than warrington the roads being impassable in the earl of derby gave a great entertainment in the tower in the mayor was george norton a saddler who frequently took the chair with his leather apron on his immediate predecessor seems to have been the earl of derby who gave the abovementioned entertainment during his mayoralty where georges dock now is there used to be a battery of fourteen eighteenpounders for the defence of the town and the old sport of bullbaiting was carried on in that vicinity close to the church of st nicholas september th on saturday a young man was found wandering about in west derby a suburb of liverpool in a state of insanity and being taken before a magistrate he proved to be an american as he seemed to be in a respectable station of life the magistrate sent the master of the workhouse to me in order to find out whether i would take the responsibility of his expenses rather than have him put in the workhouse my clerk went to investigate the matter and brought me his papers his name proves to be belonging to twentyfive years of age one of the papers was a passport from our legation in naples likewise there was a power of attorney from his mother who seems to have been married a second time to dispose of some property of hers abroad a hotel bill also of some length in which were various charges for wine and among other evidences of low funds a pawnbrokers receipt for a watch which he had pledged at five pounds there was also a ticket for his passage to america by the screw steamer andes which sailed on wednesday last the clerk found him to the last degree incommunicative and nothing could be discovered from him but what the papers disclosed there were about a dozen utterly unintelligible notes among the papers written by himself since his derangement i decided to put him into the insane hospital where he now accordingly is and tomorrow by which time he may be in a more conversable mood i mean to pay him a visit the clerk tells me that there is now and has been for three years an american lady in the liverpool almshouse in a state of insanity she is very accomplished especially in music but in all this time it has been impossible to find out who she is or anything about her connections or previous life she calls herself jenny lind and as for any other name or identity she keeps her own secret september th it appears that mrthe insane young gentleman being unable to pay his bill at the inn where he was latterly staying the landlord had taken possession of his luggage and satisfied himself in that way my clerk at my request has taken his watch out of pawn it proves to be not a very good one though doubtless worth more than five pounds for which it was pledged the governor of the lunatic asylum wrote me yesterday stating that the patient was in want of a change of clothes and that according to his own account he had left his luggage at the american hotel after officehours i took a cab and set out with my clerk to pay a visit to the asylum taking the american hotel in our way the american hotel is a small house not at all such a one as american travellers of any pretension would think of stopping at but still very respectable cleanly and with a neat sittingroom where the guests might assemble after the american fashion we asked for the landlady and anon down she came a round rosy comfortablelooking english dame of fifty or thereabouts on being asked whether she knew a mr she readily responded that he had been there but had left no luggage having taken it away before paying his bill and that she had suspected him of meaning to take his departure without paying her at all hereupon she had traced him to the hotel before mentioned where she had found that he had stayed two nights but was then i think gone from thence afterwards she encountered him again and demanding her due went with him to a pawnbrokers where he pledged his watch and paid her this was about the extent of the landladys knowledge of the matter i liked the woman very well with her shrewd goodhumored worldly kindly disposition then we proceeded to the lunatic asylum to which we were admitted by a porter at the gate within doors we found some neat and comely servantwomen one of whom showed us into a handsome parlor and took my card to the governor there was a large bookcase with a glass front containing handsomely bound books many of which i observed were of a religious character in a few minutes the governor came in a middleaged man tall and thin for an englishman kindly and agreeable enough in aspect but not with the marked look of a man of force and ability i should not judge from his conversation that he was an educated man or that he had any scientific acquaintance with the subject of insanity he said that mrwas still quite incommunicative and not in a very promising state that i had perhaps better defer seeing him for a few days that it would not be safe at present to send him home to america without an attendant and this was about all but on returning home i learned from my wife who had had a call from mrs blodgett that mrs blodgett knew mrand his mother who has recently been remarried to a young husband and is now somewhere in italy they seemed to have boarded at mrs blodgetts house on their way to the continent and within a week or two an acquaintance and pastor of mr the rev dr has sailed for america if i could only have caught him i could have transferred the care expense and responsibility of the patient to him the governor of the asylum mentioned by the way that mrdescribes himself as having been formerly a midshipman in the navy i walked through the st jamess cemetery yesterday it is a very pretty place dug out of the rock having formerly i believe been a stonequarry it is now a deep and spacious valley with graves and monuments on its level and grassy floor through which run gravelpaths and where grows luxuriant shrubbery on one of the steep sides of the valley hewn out of the rock are tombs rising in tiers to the height of fifty feet or more some of them cut directly into the rock with arched portals and others built with stone on the other side the bank is of earth and rises abruptly quite covered with trees and looking very pleasant with their green shades it was a warm and sunny day and the cemetery really had a most agreeable aspect i saw several gravestones of americans but what struck me most was one line of an epitaph on an english woman here rests in peace a virtuous wife the statue of huskisson stands in the midst of the valley in a kind of mausoleum with a door of plateglass through which you look at the dead statesmans effigy september d some days ago an american captain came to the office and said he had shot one of his men shortly after sailing from new orleans and while the ship was still in the river as he described the event he was in peril of his life from this man who was an irishman and he fired his pistol only when the man was coming upon him with a knife in one hand and some other weapon of offence in the other while he himself was struggling with one or two more of the crew he was weak at the time having just recovered from the yellow fever the shots struck the man in the pit of the stomach and he lived only about a quarter of an hour no magistrate in england has a right to arrest or examine the captain unless by a warrant from the secretary of state on the charge of murder after his statement to me the mother of the slain man went to the police officer and accused him of killing her son two or three days since moreover two of the sailors came before me and gave their account of the matter and it looked very differently from that of the captain according to them the man had no idea of attacking the captain and was so drunk that he could not keep himself upright without assistance one of these two men was actually holding him up when the captain fired two barrels of his pistol one immediately after the other and lodged two balls in the pit of his stomach the man sank down at once saying jack i am killed and died very shortly meanwhile the captain drove this man away under threats of shooting him likewise both the seamen described the captains conduct both then and during the whole voyage as outrageous and i do not much doubt that it was so they gave their evidence like men who wished to tell the truth and were moved by no more than a natural indignation at the captains wrong i did not much like the captain from the first a hard rough man with little education and nothing of the gentleman about him a red face and a loud voice he seemed a good deal excited and talked fast and much about the event but yet not as if it had sunk deeply into him he observed that he would not have had it happen for a thousand dollars that being the amount of detriment which he conceives himself to suffer by the ineffaceable bloodstain on his hand in my opinion it is little short of murder if at all but what would be murder on shore is almost a natural occurrence when done in such a hell on earth as one of these ships in the first hours of the voyage the men are then all drunk some of them often in delirium tremens and the captain feels no safety for his life except in making himself as terrible as a fiend it is the universal testimony that there is a worse set of sailors in these short voyages between liverpool and america than in any other trade whatever there is no probability that the captain will ever be called to account for this deed he gave at the time his own version of the affair in his logbook and this was signed by the entire crew with the exception of one man who had hidden himself in the hold in terror of the captain his mates will sustain his side of the question and none of the sailors would be within reach of the american courts even should they be sought for october st on thursday i went with mr ticknor to chester by railway it is quite an indescribable old town and i feel at last as if i had had a glimpse of old england the wall encloses a large space within the town but there are numerous houses and streets not included within its precincts some of the principal streets pass under the ancient gateways and at the side there are flights of steps giving access to the summit around the top of the whole wall a circuit of about two miles there runs a walk well paved with flagstones and broad enough for three persons to walk abreast on one side that towards the country there is a parapet of red freestone three or four feet high on the other side there are houses rising up immediately from the wall so that they seem a part of it the height of it i suppose may be thirty or forty feet and in some parts you look down from the parapet into orchards where there are tall appletrees and men on the branches gathering fruit and women and children among the grass filling bags or baskets there are prospects of the surrounding country among the buildings outside the wall at one point a view of the river dee with an old bridge of arches it is all very strange very quaint very curious to see how the town has overflowed its barrier and how like many institutions here the ancient wall still exists but is turned to quite another purpose than what it was meant for so far as it serves any purpose at all there are three or four towers in the course of the circuit the most interesting being one from the top of which king charles the first is said to have seen the rout of his army by the parliamentarians we ascended the short flight of steps that led up into the tower where an old man pointed out the site of the battlefield now thickly studded with buildings and told us what we had already learned from the guidebook after this we went into the cathedral which i will perhaps describe on some other occasion when i shall have seen more of it and to better advantage the cloisters gave us the strongest impression of antiquity the stone arches being so worn and blackened by time still an american must always have imagined a better cathedral than this there were some immense windows of painted glass but all modern in the chapterhouse we found a coalfire burning in a grate and a large heap of old books the library of the cathedral in a discreditable state of decay mildewed rotten neglected for years the sexton told us that they were to be arranged and better ordered over the door inside hung two failed and tattered banners being those of the cheshire regiment the most utterly indescribable feature of chester is the rows which every traveller has attempted to describe at the height of several feet above some of the oldest streets a walk runs through the front of the houses which project over it back of the walk there are shops on the outer side is a space of two or three yards where the shopmen place their tables and stands and showcases overhead just high enough for persons to stand erect a ceiling at frequent intervals little narrow passages go winding in among the houses which all along are closely conjoined and seem to have no access or exit except through the shops or into these narrow passages where you can touch each side with your elbows and the top with your hand we penetrated into one or two of them and they smelt anciently and disagreeably at one of the doors stood a palelooking but cheerful and goodnatured woman who told us that she had come to that house when first married twentyone years before and had lived there ever since and that she felt as if she had been buried through the best years of her life she allowed us to peep into her kitchen and parlor small dingy dismal but yet not wholly destitute of a home look she said that she had seen two or three coffins in a day during cholera times carried out of that narrow passage into which her door opened these avenues put me in mind of those which run through anthills or those which a mole makes underground this fashion of rows does not appear to be going out and for aught i can see it may last hundreds of years longer when a house becomes so old as to be uutenantable it is rebuilt and the new one is fashioned like the old so far as regards the walk running through its front many of the shops are very good and even elegant and these rows are the favorite places of business in chester indeed they have many advantages the passengers being sheltered from the rain and there being within the shops that dimmer light by which tradesmen like to exhibit their wares a large proportion of the edifices in the rows must be comparatively modern but there are some very ancient ones with oaken frames visible on the exterior the row passing through these houses is railed with oak so old that it has turned black and grown to be as hard as stone which it might be mistaken for if one did not see where names and initials have been cut into it with knives at some bygone period overhead crossbeams project through the ceiling so low as almost to hit the head on the front of one of these buildings was the inscription gods providence is mine inheritance said to have been put there by the occupant of the house two hundred years ago when the plague spared this one house only in the whole city not improbably the inscription has operated as a safeguard to prevent the demolition of the house hitherto but a shopman of an adjacent dwelling told us that it was soon to be taken down here and there about some of the streets through which the rows do not run we saw houses of very aged aspect with steep peaked gables the front gableend was supported on stone pillars and the sidewalk passed beneath most of these old houses seemed to be taverns the black bear the green dragon and such names we thought of dining at one of them but on inspection they looked rather too dingy and close and of questionable neatness so we went to the royal hotel where we probably fared just as badly at much more expense and where there was a particularly gruff and crabbed old waiter who i suppose thought himself free to display his surliness because we arrived at the hotel on foot for my part i love to see john bull show himself i must go again and again and again to chester for i suppose there is not a more curious place in the world mr ticknor who has been staying at rock park with us since tuesday has steamed away in the canada this morning his departure seems to make me feel more abroad more dissevered from my native country than before october d saturday evening at six i went to dine with mr aiken a wealthy merchant here to meet two of the sons of burns there was a party of ten or twelve mr aiken and his two daughters included the two sons of burns have both been in the indian army and have attained the ranks of colonel and major one having spent thirty and the other twentyseven years in india they are now old gentlemen of sixty and upwards the elder with a gray head the younger with a perfectly white one rather under than above the middle stature and with a british roundness of figure plain respectable intelligentlooking persons with quiet manners i saw no resemblance in either of them to any portrait of their father after the ladies left the table i sat next to the major the younger of the two and had a good deal of talk with him he seemed a very kindly and social man and was quite ready to speak about his father nor was he at all reluctant to let it be seen how much he valued the glory of being descended from the poet by and by at mr aikens instance he sang one of burnss songs the one about annie and the rigs of barley he sings in a perfectly simple style so that it is little more than a recitative and yet the effect is very good as to humor sense and pathos after rejoining the ladies he sang another a posie for my ain dear may and likewise a mans a man for a that my admiration of his father and partly perhaps my being an american gained me some favor with him and he promised to give me what he considered the best engraving of burns and some other remembrance of him the major is that son of burns who spent an evening at abbotsford with sir walter scott when as lockhart writes the children sang the ballads of their sires he spoke with vast indignation of a recent edition of his fathers works by robert chambers in which the latter appears to have wronged the poet by some misstatements i liked them both and they liked me and asked me to go and see there at cheltenham where they reside we broke up at about midnight the members of this dinnerparty were of the more liberal tone of thinking here in liverpool the colonel and major seemed to be of similar principles and the eyes of the latter glowed when he sang his fathers noble verse the rank is but the guineas stamp etc it would have been too pitiable if burns had left a son who could not feel the spirit of that verse october th coning to my office two or three mornings ago i found mrs the mother of mr the insane young man of whom i had taken charge she is a lady of fifty or thereabouts and not very remarkable anyway nor particularly ladylike however she was just come off a rapid journey having travelled from naples with three small children without taking rest since my letter reached her a son this proved to be her new husband of about twenty had come with her to the consulate she was of course infinitely grieved about the young mans insanity and had two or three bursts of tears while we talked the matter over she said he was the hope of her life the best purest most innocent child that ever was and wholly free from every kind of vice but it appears that he had a previous attack of insanity lasting three months about three years ago after i had told her all i knew about him including my personal observations at a visit a week or two since we drove in a cab to the asylum it must have been a dismal moment to the poor lady as we entered the gateway through a tall prisonlike wall being ushered into the parlor the governor soon appeared and informed us that mrhad had a relapse within a few days and was not now so well as when i saw him he complains of unjust confinement and seems to consider himself if i rightly understand under persecution for political reasons the governor however proposed to call him down and i took my leave feeling that it would be indelicate to be present at his first interview with his mother so here ended my guardianship of the poor young fellow in the afternoon i called at the waterloo hotel where mrswas staying and found her in the coffeeroom with the children she had determined to take a lodging in the vicinity of the asylum and was going to remove thither as soon as the children had had something to eat they seemed to be pleasant and wellbehaved children and impressed me more favorably than the mother whom i suspect to be rather a foolish woman although her present grief makes her appear in a more respectable light than at other times she seemed anxious to impress me with the respectability and distinction of her connections in america and i had observed the same tendency in the insane patient at my interview with him however she has undoubtedly a mothers love for this poor shatterbrain and this may weigh against the folly of her marrying an incongruously youthful second husband and many other follies this was day before yesterday and i have heard nothing of her since the same day i had applications for assistance in two other domestic affairs one from an irishman naturalized in america who wished me to get him a passage thither and to take charge of his wife and family here at my own private expense until he could remit funds to carry them across another was from an irishman who had a power of attorney from a countrywoman of his in america to find and take charge of an infant whom she had left in the liverpool workhouse two years ago i have a great mind to keep a list of all the business i am consulted about and employed in it would be very curious among other things all penniless americans or pretenders to americanism look upon me as their banker and i could ruin myself any week if i had not laid down a rule to consider every applicant for assistance an impostor until he prove himself a true and responsible man which it is very difficult to do yesterday there limped in a very respectablelooking old man who described himself as a citizen of baltimore who had been on a trip to england and elsewhere and being detained longer than he expected and having had an attack of rheumatism was now short of funds to pay his passage home and hoped that i would supply the deficiency he had quite a plain homely though respectable manner and for aught i know was the very honestest man alive but as he could produce no kind of proof of his character and responsibility i very quietly explained the impossibility of my helping him i advised him to try to obtain a passage on board of some baltimore ship the master of which might be acquainted with him or at all events take his word for payment after arrival this he seemed inclined to do and took his leave there was a decided aspect of simplicity about this old man and yet i rather judge him to be an impostor it is easy enough to refuse money to strangers and unknown people or whenever there may be any question about identity but it will not be so easy when i am asked for money by persons whom i know but do not like to trust they shall meet the eternal no however october th in ormerods history of chester it is mentioned that randal earl of chester having made an inroad into wales about the welshmen gathered in mass against him and drove him into the castle of nothelert in flintshire the earl sent for succor to the constable of chester roger lacy surnamed hell on account of his fierceness it was then fairtime at chester and the constable collected a miscellaneous rabble of fiddlers players cobblers tailors and all manner of debauched people and led them to the relief of the earl at sight of this strange army the welshmen fled and forever after the earl assigned to the constable of chester power over all fiddlers shoemakers etc within the bounds of cheshire the constable retained for himself and his heirs the control of the shoemakers and made over to his own steward dutton that of the fiddlers and players and for many hundreds of years afterwards the duttons of dutton retained the power on midsummerday they used to ride through chester attended by all the minstrels playing on their several instruments to the church of st john and there renew their licenses it is a good theme for a legend sir peter leycester writing in charles the seconds time copies the latin deed from the constable to dutton rightly translated it seems to mean the magisterial power over all the lewd people in the whole of cheshire but the custom grew into what is above stated in the time of henry vii the duttons claimed by prescriptive right that the cheshire minstrels should deliver them at the feast of st john four bottles of wine and a lance and that each separate minstrel should pay fourpence halfpenny another account says ralph dutton was the constables soninlaw and a lusty youth october th coming to the ferry this morning a few minutes before the boat arrived from town i went into the ferryhouse a small stone edifice and found there an irishman his wife and three children the oldest eight or nine years old and all girls there was a good fire burning in the room and the family was clustered round it apparently enjoying the warmth very much but when i went in both husband and wife very hospitably asked me to come to the fire although there was not more than room at it for their own party i declined on the plea that i was warm enough and then the woman said that they were very cold having been long on the road the man was grayhaired and graybearded clad in an old drab overcoat and laden with a huge bag which seemed to contain bedclothing or something of the kind the woman was pale with a thin anxious wrinkled face but with a good and kind expression the children were quite pretty with delicate faces and a look of patience and endurance in them but yet as if they had suffered as little as they possibly could the two elder were cuddled up close to the father the youngest about four years old sat in its mothers lap and she had taken off its small shoes and stockings and was warming its feet at the fire their little voices had a sweet and kindly sound as they talked in low tones to their parents and one another they all looked very shabby and yet had a decency about them and it was touching to see how they made themselves at home at this casual fireside and got all the comfort they could out of the circumstances by and by two or three marketwomen came in and looked pleasantly at them and said a word or two to the children they did not beg of me as i supposed they would but after looking at them awhile i pulled out a piece of silver and handed it to one of the little girls she took it very readily as if she partly expected it and then the father and mother thanked me and said they had been travelling a long distance and had nothing to subsist upon except what they picked up on the road they found it impossible to live in england and were now on their way to liverpool hoping to get a passage back to ireland where i suppose extreme poverty is rather better off than here i heard the little girl say that she should buy bread with the money there is not much that can be caught in the description of this scene but it made me understand better than before how poor people feel wandering about in such destitute circumstances and how they suffer and yet how they have a life not quite miserable after all and how family love goes along with them soon the boat arrived at the pier and we all went on board and as i sat in the cabin looking up through a broken pane in the skylight i saw the womans thin face with its anxious motherly aspect and the youngest child in her arms shrinking from the chill wind but yet not impatiently and the eldest of the girls standing close by with her expression of childish endurance but yet so bright and intelligent that it would evidently take but a few days to make a happy and playful child of her i got into the interior of this poor family and understand through sympathy more of them than i can tell i am getting to possess some of the english indifference as to beggars and poor people but still whenever i come face to face with them and have any intercourse it seems as if they ought to be the better for me i wish instead of sixpence i had given the poor family ten shillings and denied it to a begging subscriptionist who has just fleeced me to that amount how silly a man feels in this latter predicament i have had a good many visitors at the consulate from the united states within a short time among others mr d d barnard our late minister to berlin returning homeward today by the arctic and mr sickles secretary of legation to london a finelooking intelligent gentlemanly young man with him came judge douglas the chosen man of young america he is very short extremely short but has an uncommonly good head and uncommon dignity without seeming to aim at it being free and simple in manners i judge him to be a very able man with the western sociability and freefellowship generally i see no reason to be ashamed of my countrymen who come out here in public position or otherwise assuming the rank of gentlemen october th one sees incidents in the streets here occasionally which could not be seen in an american city for instance a week or two since i was passing a quietlooking elderly gentleman when all of a sudden without any apparent provocation he uplifted his stick and struck a blackgowned boy a smart blow on the shoulders the boy looked at him wofully and resentfully but said nothing nor can i imagine why the thing was done in tythebarne street today i saw a woman suddenly assault a man clutch at his hair and cuff him about the ears the man who was of decent aspect enough immediately took to his heels full speed and the woman ran after him and as far as i could discern the pair the chase continued october d at a dinnerparty at mr hollands last evening a gentleman in instance of charles dickenss unweariability said that during some theatrical performances in liverpool he acted in play and farce spent the rest of the night making speeches feasting and drinking at table and ended at seven oclock in the morning by jumping leapfrog over the backs of the whole company in moores diary he mentions a beautiful guernsey lily having been given to his wife and says that the flower was originally from guernsey a ship from there had been wrecked on the coast of japan having many of the lilies on board and the next year the flowers appeared springing up i suppose on the wavebeaten strand wishing to send a letter to a dead man who may be supposed to have gone to tophet throw it into the fire sir arthur aston had his brains beaten out with his own wooden leg at the storming of tredagh in ireland by cromwell in the county of cheshire many centuries ago there lived a halfidiot named nixon who had the gift of prophecy and made many predictions about places families and important public events since fulfilled he seems to have fallen into fits of insensibility previous to uttering his prophecies the family of mainwaring pronounced mannering of bromborough had an asss head for a crest richard dawson being sick of the plague and perceiving he must die rose out of his bed and made his grave and caused his nephew to cast straw into the grave which was not far from the house and went and laid him down in the said grave and caused clothes to be laid upon him and so departed out of this world this he did because he was a strong man and heavier than his said nephew and a servingwench were able to bury he died about the th of august thus was i credibly told he did this was in the township of malpas recorded in the parish register at bickley hall taken down a few years ago used to be shown the room where the body of the earl of leicester was laid for a whole twelvemonth to he having been kept unburied all that time owing to a dispute which of his heirs should pay his funeral expenses november th we all together with mr squarey went to chester last sunday and attended the cathedral service a great deal of ceremony and not unimposing but rather tedious before it was finished occupying two hours or more the bishop was present but did nothing except to pronounce the benediction in america the sermon is the principal thing but here all this magnificent ceremonial of prayer and chanted responses and psalms and anthems was the setting to a short meagre discourse which would not have been considered of any account among the elaborate intellectual efforts of new england ministers while this was going on the light came through the stained glass windows and fell upon the congregation tingeing them with crimson after service we wandered about the aisles and looked at the tombs and monuments the oldest of which was that of some nameless abbot with a staff and mitre half obliterated from his tomb which was under a shallow arch on one side of the cathedral there were also marbles on the walls and lettered stones in the pavement under our feet but chiefly if not entirely of modern date we lunched at the royal hotel and then walked round the city walls also crossing the bridge of one great arch over the dee and penetrating as far into wales as the entrance of the marquis of westminsters park at eaton it was i think the most lovely day as regards weather that i have seen in england i passed today a man chanting a ballad in the street about a recent murder in a voice that had innumerable cracks in it and was most lugubrious the other day i saw a man who was reading in a loud voice what seemed to be an account of the late riots and loss of life in wigan he walked slowly along the street as he read surrounded by a small crowd of men women and children and close by his elbow stalked a policeman as if guarding against a disturbance november th there is a heavy dun fog on the river and over the city today the very gloomiest atmosphere that ever i was acquainted with on the river the steamboats strike gongs or ring bells to give warning of their approach there are lamps burning in the countingrooms and lobbies of the warehouses and they gleam distinctly through the windows the other day at the entrance of the markethouse i saw a woman sitting in a small handwagon apparently for the purpose of receiving alms there was no attendant at hand but i noticed that one or two persons who passed by seemed to inquire whether she wished her wagon to be moved perhaps this is her mode of making progress about the city by the voluntary aid of boys and other people who help to drag her there is something in this i dont yet well know what that has impressed me as if i could make a romance out of the idea of a woman living in this manner a public life and moving about by such means november th mr h a b told me of his friend mrwho was formerly attache to the british legation at washington and whom i saw at concord that his father a clergyman married a second wife after the marriage the noise of a coffin being nightly carried down the stairs was heard in the parsonage it could be distinguished when the coffin reached a certain broad lauding and rested on it finally his father had to remove to another residence besides this mrhad had another ghostly experience having seen a dim apparition of an uncle at the precise instant when the latter died in a distant place the attache is a credible and honorable fellow and talks of these matters as if he positively believed them but ghostland lies beyond the jurisdiction of veracity in a garden near chester in taking down a summerhouse a tomb was discovered beneath it with a latin inscription to the memory of an old doctor of medicine william bentley who had owned the place long ago and died in and his dust and bones had lain beneath all the merry times in the summerhouse december st it is curious to observe how many methods people put in practice here to pick up a halfpenny yesterday i saw a man standing bareheaded and barelegged in the mud and misty weather playing on a fife in hopes to get a circle of auditors nobody however seemed to take any notice very often a whole band of musicians will strike up passing a hat round after playing a tune or two on board the ferry until the coldest weather began there were always some wretched musicians with an old fiddle an old clarinet and an old verdigrised brass bugle performing during the passage and as the boat neared the shore sending round one of their number to gather contributions in the hollow of the brass bugle they were a very shabby set and must have made a very scanty living at best sometimes it was a boy with an accordion and his sister a smart little girl with a timbrel which being so shattered that she could not play on it she used only to collect halfpence in balladsingers or rather chanters or croakers are often to be met with in the streets but handorgan players are not more frequent than in our cities i still observe little girls and other children barelegged and barefooted on the wet sidewalks there certainly never was anything so dismal as the november weather has been never any real sunshine almost always a mist sometimes a dense fog like slightly rarefied wool pervading the atmosphere an epitaph on a person buried on a hillside in cheshire together with some others supposed to have died of the plague and therefore not admitted into the churchyards think it not strange our bones ly here thine may ly thou knowst not where elizabeth hampson these graves were near the remains of two rude stone crosses the purpose of which was not certainly known although they were supposed to be boundary marks probably as the plaguecorpses were debarred from sanctified ground the vicinity of these crosses was chosen as having a sort of sanctity bang beggar an old cheshire term for a parish beadle hawthorne hall cheshire macclesfield hundred parish of wilmslow and within the hamlet of morley it was vested at an early period in the lathoms of irlam lancaster county and passed through the leighs to the pages of earlshaw thomas leigh page sold it to mr ralph bower of wilmslow whose children owned it in the leighs built a chancel in the church of wilmslow where some of them are buried their arms painted in the windows the hall is an ancient respectable mansion of brick december d yesterday a chill misty december day yet i saw a woman barefooted in the street not to speak of children cold and uncertain as the weather is there is still a great deal of small trade carried on in the open air women and men sit in the streets with a stock of combs and such small things to sell the women knitting as if they sat by a fireside cheap crockery is laid out in the street so far out that without any great deviation from the regular carriagetrack a wheel might pass straight through it stalls of apples are innumerable but the apples are not fit for a pig in some streets herrings are very abundant laid out on boards coals seem to be for sale by the wheelbarrowful here and there you see children with some small article for sale as for instance a girl with two linen caps a somewhat overladen cart of coal was passing along and some small quantity of the coal fell off no sooner had the wheels passed than several women and children gathered to the spot like hens and chickens round a handful of corn and picked it up in their aprons we have nothing similar to these streetwomen in our country december th i dont know any place that brings all classes into contiguity on equal ground so completely as the waitingroom at rock ferry on these frosty days the room is not more than eight feet square with walls of stone and wooden benches ranged round them and an open stove in one corner generally well furnished with coal it is almost always crowded and i rather suspect that many persons who have no fireside elsewhere creep in here and spend the most comfortable part of their day this morning when i looked into the room there were one or two gentlemen and other respectable persons but in the best place close to the fire and crouching almost into it was an elderly beggar with the raggedest of overcoats two great rents in the shoulders of it disclosing the dingy lining all bepatched with various stuff covered with dirt and on his shoes and trousers the mud of an interminable pilgrimage owing to the posture in which he sat i could not see his face but only the battered crown and rim of the very shabbiest hat that ever was worn regardless of the presence of women which indeed englishmen seldom do regard when they wish to smoke he was smoking a pipe of vile tobacco but after all this was fortunate because the man himself was not personally fragrant he was terribly squalid terribly and when i had a glimpse of his face it well befitted the rest of his development grizzled wrinkled weatherbeaten yet sallow and downlooking with a watchful kind of eye turning upon everybody and everything meeting the glances of other people rather boldly yet soon shrinking away a long thin nose a gray beard of a weeks growth hair not much mixed with gray but rusty and lifeless a miserable object but it was curious to see how he was not ashamed of himself but seemed to feel that he was one of the estates of the kingdom and had as much right to live as other men he did just as he pleased took the best place by the fire nor would have cared though a nobleman were forced to stand aside for him when the steamers bell rang he shouldered a large and heavy pack like a pilgrim with his burden of sin but certainly journeying to hell instead of heaven on board he looked round for the best position at first stationing himself near the boilerpipe but finding the deck damp underfoot he went to the cabindoor and took his stand on the stairs protected from the wind but very incommodiously placed for those who wished to pass all this was done without any bravado or forced impudence but in the most quiet way merely because he was seeking his own comfort and considered that he had a right to seek it it was an englishmans spirit but in our country i imagine a beggar considers himself a kind of outlaw and would hardly assume the privileges of a man in any place of public resort here beggary is a system and beggars are a numerous class and make themselves in a certain way respected as such nobody evinced the slightest disapprobation of the mans proceedings in america i think we should see many aristocratic airs on such provocation and probably the ferry people would there have rudely thrust the beggar aside giving him a shilling however which no englishman would ever think of doing there would also have been a great deal of fun made of his squalid and ragged figure whereas nobody smiled at him this morning nor in any way showed the slightest disrespect this is good but it is the result of a state of things by no means good for many days there has been a great deal of fog on the river and the boats have groped their way along continually striking their bells while on all sides there are responses of bell and gong and the vessels at anchor look shadowlike as we glide past them and the master of one steamer shouts a warning to the master of another which he meets the englishmen who hate to run any risk without an equivalent object show a good deal of caution and timidity on these foggy days december th chill frosty weather such an atmosphere as forebodes snow in new england and there has been a little here yet i saw a barefooted young woman yesterday the feet of these poor creatures have exactly the red complexion of their hands acquired by constant exposure to the cold air at the ferryroom this morning was a small thin anxiouslooking woman with a bundle seeming in rather poor circumstances but decently dressed and eying other women i thought with an expression of slight illwill and distrust also an elderly stout grayhaired woman of respectable aspect and two young ladylike persons quite pretty one of whom was reading a shilling volume of jamess arabella stuart they talked to one another with that upanddown intonation which english ladies practise and which strikes an unaccustomed ear as rather affected especially in women of size and mass it is very different from an american ladys mode of talking there is the difference between color and no color the tone variegates it one of these young ladies spoke to me making some remark about the weather the first instance i have met with of a gentlewomans speaking to an unintroduced gentleman besides these a middleaged man of the lower class and also a gentlemans outdoor servant clad in a drab greatcoat corduroy breeches and drab cloth gaiters buttoned from the knee to the ankle he complained to the other man of the cold weather said that a glass of whiskey every halfhour would keep a man comfortable and accidentally hitting his coarse foot against one of the young ladys feet said beg pardon maam which she acknowledged with a slight movement of the head somehow or other different classes seem to encounter one another in an easier manner than with us the shock is less palpable i suppose the reason is that the distinctions are real and therefore need not be continually asserted nervous and excitable persons need to talk a great deal by way of letting off their steam on board the rock ferry steamer a gentleman coming into the cabin a voice addresses him from a dark corner how do you do sir speak again says the gentleman no answer from the dark corner and the gentleman repeats speak again the speaker now comes out of the dark corner and sits down in a place where he can be seen ah cries the gentleman very well i thank you how do you do i did not recognize your voice observable the english caution shown in the gentlemans not vouchsafing to say very well thank you till he knew his man what was the after life of the young man whom jesus looking on loved and bade him sell all that he had and give to the poor and take up his cross and follow him something very deep and beautiful might be made out of this december st among the beggars of liverpool the hardest to encounter is a man without any legs and if i mistake not likewise deficient in arms you see him before you all at once as if he had sprouted halfway out of the earth and would sink down and reappear in some other place the moment he has done with you his countenance is large fresh and very intelligent but his great power lies in his fixed gaze which is inconceivably difficult to bear he never once removes his eye from you till you are quite past his range and you feel it all the same although you do not meet his glance he is perfectly respectful but the intentness and directness of his silent appeal is far worse than any impudence in fact it is the very flower of impudence i would rather go a mile about than pass before his battery i feel wronged by him and yet unutterably ashamed there must be great force in the man to produce such an effect there is nothing of the customary squalidness of beggary about him but remarkable trimness and cleanliness a girl of twenty or thereabouts who vagabondizes about the city on her hands and knees possesses to a considerable degree the same characteristics i think they hit their victims the more effectually from being below the common level of vision january d night before last there was a fall of snow about three or four inches and following it a pretty hard frost on the river the vessels at anchor showed the snow along their yards and on every ledge where it could lie a blue sky and sunshine overhead and apparently a clear atmosphere close at hand but in the distance a mistiness became perceptible obscuring the shores of the river and making the vessels look dim and uncertain the steamers were ploughing along smoking their pipes through the frosty air on the landing stage and in the streets hardtrodden snow looking more like my new england home than anything i have yet seen last night the thermometer fell as low as degrees nor probably is it above degrees today no such frost has been known in england these forty years and mr wilding tells me that he never saw so much snow before january th i saw yesterday stopping at a cabinetmakers shop in church street a coach with four beautiful white horses and a postilion on each nearhorse behind in the dicky a footman and on the box a coachman all dressed in livery the coachpanel bore a coatofarms with a coronet and i presume it must have been the equipage of the earl of derby a crowd of people stood round gazing at the coach and horses and when any of them spoke it was in a lower tone than usual i doubt not they all had a kind of enjoyment of the spectacle for these english are strangely proud of having a class above them every englishman runs to the times with his little grievance as a child runs to his mother i was sent for to the police court the other morning in the case of an american sailor accused of robbing a shipmate at sea a large room with a great coalfire burning on one side and above it the portrait of mr rushton deceased a magistrate of many years continuance a long table with chairs and a witnessbox one of the borough magistrates a merchant of the city sat at the head of the table with paper and pen and ink before him but the real judge was the clerk of the court whose professional knowledge and experience governed all the proceedings in the short time while i was waiting two cases were tried in the first of which the prisoner was discharged the second case was of a woman a thin sallow hardlooking careworn rather young woman for stealing a pair of slippers out of a shop the trial occupied five minutes or less and she was sentenced to twentyone days imprisonment whereupon without speaking she looked up wildly first into one policemans face then into anothers at the same time wringing her hands with no theatric gesture but because her torment took this outward shape and was led away the yankee sailor was then brought up an intelligent but ruffianlike fellow and as the case was out of the jurisdiction of the english magistrates and as it was not worth while to get him sent over to america for trial he was forthwith discharged he stole a comforter if mankind were all intellect they would be continually changing so that one age would be entirely unlike another the great conservative is the heart which remains the same in all ages so that commonplaces of a thousand years standing are as effective as ever monday february th at the police court on saturday i attended the case of the second mate and four seamen of the john and albert for assaulting beating and stabbing the chief mate the chief mate has been in the hospital ever since the assault and was brought into the court today to give evidence a man of thirty black hair black eyes a dark complexion disagreeable expression sallow emaciated feeble apparently in pain one arm disabled he sat bent and drawn upward and had evidently been severely hurt and was not yet fit to be out of bed he had some brandyandwater to enable him to sustain himself he gave his evidence very clearly beginning sailorlike with telling in what quarter the wind was at the time of the assault and which sail was taken in his testimony bore on one man only at whom he cast a vindictive look but i think he told the truth as far as he knew and remembered it of the prisoners the second mate was a mere youth with long sandy hair and an intelligent and not unprepossessing face dressed as neatly as a three or four weeks captive with small or no means could well allow in a frockcoat and with clean linen the only linen or cotton shirt in the company the other four were rude brutish sailors in flannel or redbaize shirts three of them appeared to give themselves little concern but the fourth a redhaired and redbearded man paraman by name evidently felt the pressure of the case upon himself he was the one whom the mate swore to have given him the first blow and there was other evidence of his having been stabbed with a knife the captain of the ship the pilot the cook and the steward all gave their evidence and the general bearing of it was that the chief mate had a devilish temper and had misused the second mate and crew that the four seamen had attacked him and that paraman had stabbed him while all but the steward concurred in saying that the second mate had taken no part in the affray the steward however swore to having seen him strike the chief mate with a wooden marlinspike which was broken by the blow the magistrate dismissed all but paraman whom i am to send to america for trial in my opinion the chief mate got pretty nearly what he deserved under the code of natural justice while business was going forward the magistrate mr mansfield talked about a fancy ball at which he had been present the evening before and of other matters grave and gay it was very informal we sat at the table or stood with our backs to the fire policemen came and went witnesses were sworn on the greasiest copy of the gospels i ever saw polluted by hundreds and thousands of perjured kisses and for hours the prisoners were kept standing at the foot of the table interested to the full extent of their capacity while all others were indifferent at the close of the case the police officers and witnesses applied to me about their expenses yesterday i took a walk with my wife and two children to bebbington church a beautifully sunny morning my wife and u attended church j and i continued our walk when we were at a little distance from the church the bells suddenly chimed out with a most cheerful sound and sunny as the morning it is a pity we have no chimes of bells to give the churchward summons at home people were standing about the ancient churchporch and among the tombstones in the course of our walk we passed many old thatched cottages built of stone and with what looked like a cowhouse or pigsty at one end making part of the cottage also an old stone farmhouse which may have been a residence of gentility in its day we passed too a small methodist chapel making one of a row of low brick edifices there was a sound of prayer within i never saw a more unbeautiful place of worship and it had not even a separate existence for itself the adjoining tenement being an alehouse the grass along the wayside was green with a few daisies there was green holly in the hedges and we passed through a wood up some of the treetrunks of which ran clustering ivy february d there came to see me the other day a young gentleman with a mustache and a blue cloak who announced himself as william allingham and handed me a copy of his poems a thin volume with paper covers published by routledge i thought i remembered hearing his name but had never seen any of his works his face was intelligent dark pleasing and not at all johnbullish he said that he had been employed in the customs in ireland and was now going to london to live by literature to be connected with some newspaper i imagine he had been in london before and was acquainted with some of the principal literary people among others tennyson and carlyle he seemed to have been on rather intimate terms with tennyson we talked awhile in my dingy and dusky consulate and he then took leave his manners are good and he appears to possess independence of mind yesterday i saw a british regiment march down to georges pier to embark in the niagara for malta the troops had nothing very remarkable about them but the thousands of ragged and squalid wretches who thronged the pier and streets to gaze on them were what i had not seen before in such masses this was the first populace i have beheld for even the irish on the other side of the water acquire a respectability of aspect john bull is going with his whole heart into the turkish war he is very foolish whatever the czar may propose to himself it is for the interest of democracy that he should not be easily put down the regiment on its way to embark carried the queens colors and side by side with them the banner of the th yellow with the names of the peninsular and other battles in which it had been engaged inscribed on it in a double column it is a very distinguished regiment and mr henry bright mentioned as one of its distinctions that washington had formerly been an officer in it i never heard of this february th we walked to woodside in the pleasant forenoon and thence crossed to liverpool on our way to woodside we saw the remains of the old birkenhead priory built of the common red freestone much timeworn with ivy creeping over it and birds evidently at hone in its old crevices these ruins are pretty extensive and seem to be the remains of a quadrangle a handsome modern church likewise of the same red freestone has been built on part of the site occupied by the priory and the organ was sounding within while we walked about the premises on some of the ancient arches there were grotesquely carved stone faces the old walls have been sufficiently restored to make them secure without destroying their venerable aspect it is a very interesting spot and so much the more so because a modern town with its brick and stone houses its flags and pavements has sprung up about the ruins which were new a thousand years ago the station of the chester railway is within a hundred yards formerly the monks of this priory kept the only ferry that then existed on the mersey at a dinner at mr bramley moores a little while ago we had a prairiehen from the west of america it was a very delicate bird and a gentleman carved it most skilfully to a dozen guests and had still a second slice to offer to them aboard the ferryboat yesterday there was a laboring man eating oysters he took them one by one from his pocket in interminable succession opened them with his jackknife swallowed each one threw the shell overboard and then sought for another having concluded his meal he took out a clay tobaccopipe filled it lighted it with a match and smoked it all this while the other passengers were looking at him and with a perfect coolness and independence such as no single man can ever feel in america here a man does not seem to consider what other people will think of his conduct but only whether it suits his own convenience to do so and so it may be the better way a french military man a veteran of all napoleons wars is now living with a false leg and arm both movable by springs false teeth a false eye a silver nose with a fleshcolored covering and a silver plate replacing part of the skull he has the cross of the legion of honor march th on saturday i went with mr b to the dingle a pleasant domain on the banks of the mersey almost opposite to rock ferry walking home we looked into mr thorns unitarian chapel mr bs familys place of worship there is a little graveyard connected with the chapel a most uninviting and unpicturesque square of ground perhaps thirty or forty yards across in the midst of back fronts of city buildings about half the space was occupied by flat tombstones level with the ground the remainder being yet vacant nevertheless there were perhaps more names of men generally known to the world on these few tombstones than in any other churchyard in liverpool roscoe blanco white and the rev william enfield whose name has a classical sound in my ears because when a little boy i used to read his speaker at school in the vestry of the chapel there were many books chiefly old theological works in ancient print and binding much mildewed and injured by the damp the body of the chapel is neat but plain and being not very large has a kind of social and family aspect as if the clergyman and his people must needs have intimate relations among themselves the unitarian sect in liverpool have as a body great wealth and respectability yesterday i walked with my wife and children to the brow of a hill overlooking birkenhead and tranmere and commanding a fine view of the river and liverpool beyond all round about new and neat residences for city people are springing up with fine names eldon terrace rose cottage belvoir villa etc etc with little patches of ornamented garden or lawn in front and heaps of curious rockwork with which the english are ridiculously fond of adorning their front yards i rather think the middling classes meaning shopkeepers and other respectabilities of that level are better lodged here than in america and what i did not expect the houses are a great deal newer than in our new country of course this can only be the case in places circumstanced like liverpool and its suburbs but scattered among these modern villas there are old stone cottages of the rudest structure and doubtless hundreds of years old with thatched roofs into which the grass has rooted itself and now looks verdant these cottages are in themselves as ugly as possible resembling a large kind of pigsty but often by dint of the verdure on their thatch and the shrubbery clustering about them they look picturesque the oldfashioned flowers in the gardens of new england bluebells crocuses primroses foxglove and many others appear to be wild flowers here on english soil there is something very touching and pretty in this fact that the puritans should have carried their field and hedge flowers and nurtured theme in their gardens until to us they seem entirely the product of cultivation march th yesterday at the coroners court attending the inquest on a black sailor who died on board an american vessel after her arrival at this port the courtroom is capable of accommodating perhaps fifty people dingy with a pyramidal skylight above and a single window on one side opening into a gloomy back court a private room also lighted with a pyramidal skylight is behind the courtroom into which i was asked and found the coroner a grayheaded grave intelligent broad redfaced man with an air of some authority well mannered and dignified but not exactly a gentleman dressed in a blue coat with a black cravat showing a shirtcollar above it considering how many and what a variety of cases of the ugliest death are constantly coming before him he was much more cheerful than could be expected and had a kind of formality and orderliness which i suppose balances the exceptionalities with which he has to deal in the private room with him was likewise the surgeon who professionally attends the court we chatted about suicide and such matters the surgeon the coroner and i until the american case was ready when we adjourned to the courtroom and the coroner began the examination the american captain was a rude uncouth downeaster about thirty years old and sat on a bench doubled and bent into an indescribable attitude out of which he occasionally straightened himself all the time toying with a ruler or some such article the case was one of no interest the man had been frostbitten and died from natural causes so that no censure was deserved or passed upon the captain the jury who had been examining the body were at first inclined to think that the man had not been frostbitten but that his feet had been immersed in boiling water but on explanation by the surgeon readily yielded their opinion and gave the verdict which the coroner put into their mouths exculpating the captain from all blame in fact it is utterly impossible that a jury of chance individuals should not be entirely governed by the judgment of so experienced and weighty a man as the coroner in the courtroom were two or three police officers in uniform and some other officials a very few idle spectators and a few witnesses waiting to be examined and while the case was going forward a poorlooking woman came in and i heard her in an undertone telling an attendant of a death that had just occurred the attendant received the communication in a very quiet and matterofcourse way said that it should be attended to and the woman retired the diary of a coroner would be a work likely to meet with large popular acceptance a dark passageway only a few yards in extent leads from the liveliest street in liverpool to this coroners courtroom where all the discussion is about murder and suicide it seems that after a verdict of suicide the corpse can only be buried at midnight without religious rites his lines are cast in pleasant places applied to a successful angler a womans chastity consists like an onion of a series of coats you may strip off the outer ones without doing much mischief perhaps none at all but you keep taking off one after another in expectation of coming to the inner nucleus including the whole value of the matter it proves however that there is no such nucleus and that chastity is diffused through the whole series of coats is lessened with the removal of each and vanishes with the final one which you supposed would introduce you to the hidden pearl march d mr b and i took a cab saturday afternoon and drove out of the city in the direction of knowsley on our way we saw many gentlemens or rich peoples places some of them dignified with the title of halls with lodges at their gates and standing considerably removed from the road the greater part of them were built of brick a material with which i have not been accustomed to associate ideas of grandeur but it was much in use here in lancashire in the elizabethan age more i think than now these suburban residences however are of much later date than elizabeths time among other places mr b called at the hazels the residence of sir thomas birch a kinsman of his it is a large brick mansion and has old trees and shrubbery about it the latter very fine and verdant hazels holly rhododendron etc mr b went in and shortly afterwards sir thomas birch came out a very frank and hospitable gentleman and pressed me to enter and take luncheon which latter hospitality i declined his house is in very nice order he had a good many pictures and amongst them a small portrait of his mother painted by sir thomas lawrence when a youth it is unfinished and when the painter was at the height of his fame he was asked to finish it but lawrence after looking at the picture refused to retouch it saying that there was a merit in this early sketch which he could no longer attain it was really a very beautiful picture of a lovely woman sir thomas birch proposed to go with us and get us admittance into knowsley park where we could not possibly find entrance without his aid so we went to the stables where the old groom had already shown hospitality to our cabman by giving his horse some provender and himself some beer there seemed to be a kindly and familiar sort of intercourse between the old servant and the baronet each of them i presume looking on their connection as indissoluble the gatewarden of knowsley park was an old woman who readily gave us admittance at sir thomas birchs request the family of the earl of derby is not now at the park it was a very bad time of year to see it the trees just showing the earliest symptoms of vitality while whole acres of ground were covered with large dry brown ferns which i suppose are very beautiful when green two or three hares scampered out of these ferns and sat on their hind legs looking about them as we drove by a sheet of water had been drawn off in order to deepen its bed the oaks did not seem to me so magnificent as they should be in an ancient noble property like this a century does not accomplish so much for a tree in this slow region as it does in ours i think however that they were more individual and picturesque with more character in their contorted trunks therein somewhat resembling appletrees our foresttrees have a great sameness of character like our people because one and the other grow too closely in one part of the park we came to a small tower for what purpose i know not unless as an observatory and near it was a marble statue on a high pedestal the statue had been long exposed to the weather and was overgrown and ingrained with moss and lichens so that its classic beauty was in some sort gothicized a halfmile or so from this point we saw the mansion of kuowsley in the midst of a very fine prospect with a tolerably high ridge of hills in the distance the house itself is exceedingly vast a front and two wings with suites of rooms i suppose interminable the oldest part sir thomas birch told us is a tower of the time of henry vii nevertheless the effect is not overwhelming because the edifice looks low in proportion to its great extent over the ground and besides a good deal of it is built of brick with white windowframes so that looking at separate parts i might think them american structures without the smart addition of green venetian blinds so universal with us portions however were built of red freestone and if i had looked at it longer no doubt i should have admired it more we merely drove round it from the rear to the front it stands in my memory rather like a college or a hospital than as the ancestral residence of a great english noble we left the park in another direction and passed through a part of lord seftons property by a private road by the by we saw half a dozen policemen in their blue coats and embroidered collars after entering knowsley park but the earls own servants would probably have supplied their place had the family been at home the mansion of croxteth the seat of lord sefton stands near the public road and though large looked of rather narrow compass after knowsley the rooks were talking together very loquaciously in the high tops of the trees near sir thomas birchs house it being now their buildingtime it was a very pleasant sound the noise being comfortably softened by the remote height sir thomas said that more than half a century ago the rooks used to inhabit another grove of lofty trees close in front of the house but being noisy and not altogether cleanly in their habits the ladies of the family grew weary of them and wished to remove them accordingly the colony was driven away and made their present settlement in a grove behind the house ever since that time not a rook has built in the ancient grove every year however one or another pair of young rooks attempt to build among the deserted treetops but the old rooks tear the new nest to pieces as often as it is put together thus either the memory of aged individual rooks or an authenticated tradition in their society has preserved the idea that the old grove is forbidden and inauspicious to them a soil of general arnold named william fitch arnold and born in now possesses the estate of little messenden abbey bucks county and is a magistrate for that county he was formerly captain of the th lancers he has now two sons and four daughters the other three sons of general arnold all older than this one and all military men do not appear to have left children but a daughter married to colonel phipps of the mulgrave family has a son and two daughters i question whether any of our truehearted revolutionary heroes have left a more prosperous progeny than this archtraitor i should like to know their feelings with respect to their ancestor april d i walked with j two days ago to eastham a village on the road to chester and five or six miles from rock ferry on our way we passed through a village in the centre of which was a small stone pillar standing on a pedestal of several steps on which children were sitting and playing i take it to have been an old catholic cross at least i know not what else it is it seemed very ancient eastham is the finest old english village i have seen with many antique houses and with altogether a rural and picturesque aspect unlike anything in america and yet possessing a familiar look as if it were something i had dreamed about there were thatched stone cottages intermixed with houses of a better kind and likewise a gateway and gravelled walk that perhaps gave admittance to the squires mansion it was not merely one long wide street as in most new england villages but there were several crooked ways gathering the whole settlement into a pretty small compass in the midst of it stood a venerable church of the common red freestone with a most reverend air considerably smaller than that of bebbington but more beautiful and looking quite as old there was ivy on its spire and elsewhere it looked very quiet and peaceful and as if it had received the people into its low arched door every sabbath for many centuries there were many tombstones about it some level with the ground some raised on blocks of stone on low pillars mossgrown and weatherworn and probably these were but the successors of other stones that had quite crumbled away or been buried by the accumulation of dead mens dust above them in the centre of the churchyard stood an old yewtree with immense trunk which was all decayed within so that it is a wonder how the tree retains any life which nevertheless it does it was called the old yew of eastham six hundred years ago after passing through the churchyard we saw the village inn on the other side the doors were fastened but a girl peeped out of the window at us and let us in ushering us into a very neat parlor there was a cheerful fire in the grate a straw carpet on the floor a mahogany sideboard and a mahogany table in the middle of the room and on the walls the portraits of mine host no doubt and of his wife and daughters a very nice parlor and looking like what i might have found in a country tavern at home only this was an ancient house and there is nothing at home like the glimpse from the window of the church and its red ivygrown tower i ordered some lunch being waited on by the girl who was very neat intelligent and comely and more respectful than a new england maid as we came out of the inn some village urchins left their play and ran to me begging calling me master they turned at once from play to begging and as i gave them nothing they turned to their play again this village is too far from liverpool to have been much injured as yet by the novelty of cockney residences which have grown up almost everywhere else so far as i have visited about a mile from it however is the landingplace of a steamer which runs regularly except in the winter months where a large new hotel is built the grounds about it are extensive and well wooded we got some biscuits at the hotel and i gave the waiter a splendid gentleman in black four halfpence being the surplus of a shilling he bowed and thanked me very humbly an american does not easily bring his mind to the small measure of english liberality to servants if anything is to be given we are ashamed not to give more especially to clericallooking persons in black suits and white neckcloths i stood on the exchange at noon today to see the th regiment the connaught rangers marching down to embark for the east they were a body of young healthy and cheerfullooking men and looked greatly better than the dirty crowd that thronged to gaze at them the royal banner of england quartering the lion the leopard and the harp waved on the townhouse and looked gorgeous and venerable here and there a woman exchanged greetings with an individual soldier as he marched along and gentlemen shook hands with officers with whom they happened to be acquainted being a stranger in the land it seemed as if i could see the future in the present better than if i had been an englishman so i questioned with myself how many of these ruddycheeked young fellows marching so stoutly away would ever tread english ground again the populace did not evince any enthusiasm yet there could not possibly be a war to which the country could assent more fully than to this i somewhat doubt whether the english populace really feels a vital interest in the nation some years ago a piece of rude marble sculpture representing st george and the dragon was found over the fireplace of a cottage near rock ferry on the road to chester it was plastered over with pipeclay and its existence was unknown to the cottagers until a lady noticed the projection and asked what it was it was supposed to have originally adorned the walls of the priory at birkenhead it measured fourteen and a half by nine inches in which space were the heads of a king and queen with uplifted hands in prayer their daughters also in prayer and looking very grim a lamb the slain dragon and st george proudly prancing on what looks like a donkey brandishing a sword over his head the following is a legend inscribed on the inner margin of a curious old box from birkenhead into hilbree a squirrel might leap from tree to tree i do not know where hilbree is but all round birkenhead a squirrel would scarcely find a single tree to climb upon all is pavement and brick buildings now good friday the english and irish think it good to plant on this day because it was the day when our saviours body was laid in the grave seeds therefore are certain to rise again at dinner the other day mrsmentioned the origin of franklins adoption of the customary civil dress when going to court as a diplomatist it was simply that his tailor had disappointed him of his court suit and he wore his plain one with great reluctance because he had no other afterwards gaining great success and praise by his mishap he continued to wear it from policy the grandmother of mrsdied fifty years ago at the age of twentyeight she had great personal charms and among them a head of beautiful chestnut hair after her burial in the family tomb the coffin of one of her children was laid on her own so that the lid seems to have decayed or been broken from this cause at any rate this was the case when the tomb was opened about a year ago the grandmothers coffin was then found to be filled with beautiful glossy living chestnut ringlets into which her whole substance seems to have been transformed for there was nothing else but these shining curls the growth of half a century in the tomb an old man with a ringlet of his youthful mistress treasured on his heart might be supposed to witness this wonderful thing madam who is now at my house and very infirm though not old was once carried to the grave and on the point of being buried it was in barbary where her husband was consulgeneral he was greatly attached to her and told the pallbearers at the grave that he must see her once more when her face was uncovered he thought he discerned signs of life and felt a warmth finally she revived and for many years afterwards supposed the funeral procession to have been a dream she having been partially conscious throughout and having felt the wind blowing on her and lifting the shroud from her feet for i presume she was to be buried in oriental style without a coffin long after in london when she was speaking of this dream her husband told her the facts and she fainted away whenever it is now mentioned her face turns white mr her son was born on shipboard on the coast of spain and claims four nationalities those of spain england ireland and the united states his father being irish his mother a native of england himself a naturalized citizen of the united states and his father having registered his birth and baptism in a catholic church of gibraltar which gives him spanish privileges he has hereditary claims to a spanish countship his infancy was spent in barbary and his lips first lisped in arabic there has been an unsettled and wandering character in his whole life the grandfather of madam who was a british officer once horsewhipped paul jones jones being a poltroon how singular it is that the personal courage of famous warriors should be so often called in question may th i went yesterday to a hospital to take the oath of a mate to a protest he had met with a severe accident by a fall on shipboard the hospital is a large edifice of red freestone with wide airy passages resounding with footsteps passing through them a porter was waiting in the vestibule mr wilding and myself were shown to the parlor in the first instance a neat plainly furnished room with newspapers and pamphlets lying on the table and sofas soon the surgeon of the house came a brisk alacritous civil cheerful young man by whom we were shown to the apartment where the mate was lying as we went through the principal passage a man was borne along in a chair looking very pale rather wild and altogether as if he had just been through great tribulation and hardly knew as yet whereabouts he was i noticed that his left arm was but a stump and seemed done up in red baize at all events it was of a scarlet line the surgeon shook his right hand cheerily and he was carried on this was a patient who had just had his arm cut off he had been a rough person apparently but now there was a kind of tenderness about him through pain and helplessness in the chamber where the mate lay there were seven beds all of them occupied by persons who had met with accidents in the centre of the room was a stationary pine table about the length of a man intended i suppose to stretch patients upon for necessary operations the furniture of the beds was plain and homely i thought that the faces of the patients all looked remarkably intelligent though they were evidently men of the lower classes suffering had educated them morally and intellectually they gazed curiously at mr wilding and me but nobody said a word in the bed next to the mate lay a little boy with a broken thigh the surgeon observed that children generally did well with accidents and this boy certainly looked very bright and cheerful there was nothing particularly interesting about the mate after finishing our business the surgeon showed us into another room of the surgical ward likewise devoted to cases of accident and injury all the beds were occupied and in two of them lay two american sailors who had recently been stabbed they had been severely hurt but were doing very well the surgeon thought that it was a good arrangement to have several cases together and that the patients kept up one anothers spirits being often merry together smiles and laughter may operate favorably enough from bed to bed but dying groans i should think must be somewhat of a discouragement nevertheless the previous habits and modes of life of such people as compose the more numerous class of patients in a hospital must be considered before deciding this matter it is very possible that their misery likes such bedfellows as it here finds as we were taking our leave the surgeon asked us if we should not like to see the operatingroom and before we could reply he threw open the door and behold there was a roll of linen garments rolled in blood and a bloody fragment of a human arm the surgeon glanced at me and smiled kindly but as if pitying my discomposure gervase elwes son of sir gervase elwes baronet of stoke suffolk married isabella daughter of sir thomas hervey knight and sister of the first earl of bristol this gervase died before his father but left a son henry who succeeded to the baronetcy sir henry died without issue and was succeeded by his sisters son john maggott twining who assumed the name of elwes he was the famous miser and must have had hawthorne blood in him through his grandfather gervase whose mother was a hawthorne it was to this gervase that my ancestor william hawthorne devised some land in massachusetts if he would come over and enjoy it my ancestor calls him his nephew june th barry cornwall mr procter called on me a week or more ago but i happened not to be in the office saturday last he called again and as i had crossed to rock park he followed me thither a plain middlesized englishlooking gentleman elderly with short white hair and particularly quiet in his manners he talks in a somewhat low tone without emphasis scarcely distinct his head has a good outline and would look well in marble i liked him very well he talked unaffectedly showing an authors regard to his reputation and was evidently pleased to hear of his american celebrity he said that in his younger days he was a scientific pugilist and once took a journey to have a sparring encounter with the gamechicken certainly no one would have looked for a pugilist in this subdued old gentleman he is now commissioner of lunacy and makes periodical circuits through the country attending to the business of his office he is slightly deaf and this may be the cause of his unaccented utterance owing to his not being able to regulate his voice exactly by his own ear he is a good man and much better expressed by his real name procter than by his poetical one barry cornwall he took my hand in both of his at parting june th at eleven at this season and how much longer i know not there is still a twilight if we could only have such dry deliciously warm evenings as we used to have in our own land what enjoyment there might be in these interminable twilights but here we close the windowshutters and make ourselves cosey by a coalfire all three of the children and i think my wife and myself are going through the hoopingcough the eastwind of this season and region is most horrible there have been no really warm days for though the sunshine is sometimes hot there is never any diffused heat throughout the air on passing from the sunshine into the shade we immediately feel too cool june th the vagabond musicians about town are very numerous on board the steam ferryboats i have heretofore spoken of them they infest them from may to november for very little gain apparently a shilling a day per man must be the utmost of their emolument it is rather sad to see somewhat respectable old men engaged in this way with two or three younger associates their instruments look much the worse for wear and even my unmusical ear can distinguish more discord than harmony they appear to be a very quiet and harmless people sometimes there is a woman playing on a fiddle while her husband blows a wind instrument in the streets it is not unusual to find a band of half a dozen performers who without any provocation or reason whatever sound their brazen instruments till the houses reecho sometimes one passes a man who stands whistling a tune most unweariably though i never saw anybody give him anything the balladsingers are the strangest from the total lack of any music in their cracked voices sometimes you see a space cleared in the street and a foreigner playing while a girl weatherbeaten tanned and wholly uncomely in face and shabby in attire dances ballets the common people look on and never criticise or treat any of these poor devils unkindly or uncivilly but i do not observe that they give them anything a crowd or at all events a moderatesized group is much more easily drawn together here than with us the people have a good deal of idle and momentary curiosity and are always ready to stop when another person has stopped so as to see what has attracted his attention i hardly ever pause to look at a shopwindow without being immediately incommoded by boys and men who stop likewise and would forthwith throng the pavement if i did not move on june th if it is not known how and when a man dies it makes a ghost of him for many years thereafter perhaps for centuries king arthur is an example also the emperor frederic and other famous men who were thought to be alive ages after their disappearance so with private individuals i had an uncle john who went a voyage to sea about the beginning of the war of and has never returned to this hour but as long as his mother lived as many as twenty years she never gave up the hope of his return and was constantly hearing stories of persons whose description answered to his some people actually affirmed that they had seen him in various parts of the world thus so far as her belief was concerned he still walked the earth and even to this day i never see his name which is no very uncommon one without thinking that this may be the lost uncle thus too the french dauphin still exists or a kind of ghost of him the three tells too in the cavern of uri july th mr cecil the other day was saying that england could produce as fine peaches as any other country i asked what was the particular excellence of a peach and he answered its cooling and refreshing quality like that of a melon just think of this idea of the richest most luscious of all fruits but the untravelled englishman has no more idea of what fruit is than of what sunshine is he thinks he has tasted the first and felt the last but they are both alike watery i heard a lady in lord street talking about the broiling sun when i was almost in a shiver they keep up their animal heat by means of wine and ale else they could not bear this climate july th a week ago i made a little tour in north wales with mr bright we left birkenhead by railway for chester at two oclock thence for bangor thence by carriage over the menai bridge to beaumaris at beaumaris a fine old castle quite coming up to my idea of what an old castle should be a gray ivyhung exterior wall with large round towers at intervals within this another wall the place of the portcullis between and again within the second wall the castle itself with a spacious green courtyard in front the outer wall is so thick that a passage runs in it all round the castle which covers a space of three acres this passage gives access to a chapel still very perfect and to various apartments in the towers all exceedingly dismal and giving very unpleasant impressions of the way in which the garrison of the castle lived the main castle is entirely roofless but the hall and other rooms are pointed out by the guide and the whole is tapestried with abundant ivy so that my impression is of gray walls with here and there a vast green curtain a carpet of green over the floors of halls and apartments and festoons around all the outer battlement with an uneven and rather perilous footpath running along the top there is a fine vista through the castle itself and the two gateways of the two encompassing walls the passage within the wall is very rude both underfoot and on each side with various ascents and descents of rough steps sometimes so low that your head is in danger and dark except where a little light comes through a loophole or window in the thickness of the wall in front of the castle a tenniscourt was fitted up by laying a smooth pavement on the ground and casing the walls with tin or zinc if i recollect aright all this was open to the sky and when we were there some young men of the town were playing at the game there are but very few of these tenniscourts in england and this old castle was a very strange place for one the castle is the property of sir richard bulkely whose seat is in the vicinity and who owns a great part of the island of anglesea on which beaumaris lies the hotel where we stopped was the bulkely arms and sir richard has a kind of feudal influence in the town in the morning we walked along a delightful road bordering on the menai straits to bangor ferry it was really a very pleasant road overhung by a growth of young wood exceedingly green and fresh english trees are green all about their stems owing to the creeping plants that overrun them there were some flowers in the hedges such as we cultivate in gardens at the ferry there was a whitewashed cottage a woman or two some children and a fishermanlike personage walking to and fro before the door the scenery of the strait is very beautiful and picturesque and directly opposite to us lay bangor the strait being here almost a mile across an american ship from boston lay in the middle of it the ferryboat was just putting off for the bangor side and by the aid of a sail soon neared the shore at bangor we went to a handsome hotel and hired a carriage and two horses for some welsh place the name of which i forget neither can i remember a single name of the places through which we posted that day nor could i spell them if i heard them pronounced nor pronounce them if i saw them spelt it was a circuit of about forty miles bringing us to conway at last i remember a great slatequarry and also that many of the cottages in the first part of our drive were built of blocks of slate the mountains were very bold thrusting themselves up abruptly in peaks not of the dumpling formation which is somewhat too prevalent among the new england mountains at one point we saw snowdon with its bifold summit we also visited the smaller waterfall this is a translation of an unpronounceable welsh name which is the largest in wales it was a very beautiful rapid and the guidebook considers it equal in sublimity to niagara likewise there were one or two lakes which the guidebook greatly admired but which to me who remembered a hundred sheets of blue water in new england seemed nothing more than sullen and dreary puddles with bare banks and wholly destitute of beauty i think they were nowhere more than a hundred yards across but the hills were certainly very good and though generally bare of trees their outlines thereby were rendered the stronger and more striking many of the welsh women particularly the older ones wear black beaver hats highcrowned and almost precisely like mens it makes them look ugly and witchlike welsh is still the prevalent language and the only one spoken by a great many of the inhabitants i have had welsh people in my office on official business with whom i could not communicate except through an interpreter at some unutterable village we went into a little church where we saw an old stone image of a warrior lying on his back with his hands clasped it was the natural son if i remember rightly of david prince of wales and was doubtless the better part of a thousand years old there was likewise a stone coffin of still greater age some person of rank and renown had mouldered to dust within it but it was now open and empty also there were monumental brasses on the walls engraved with portraits of a gentleman and lady in the costumes of elizabeths time also on one of the pews a brass record of some persons who slept in the vault beneath so that every sunday the survivors and descendants kneel and worship directly over their dead ancestors in the churchyard on a flat tombstone there was the representation of a harp i supposed that it must be the restingplace of a bard but the inscription was in memory of a merchant and a skilful manufacturer of harps this was a very delightful town we saw a great many things which it is now too late to describe the sharpness of the first impression being gone but i think i can produce something of the sentiment of it hereafter we arrived at conway late in the afternoon to take the rail for chester i must see conway with its old gray wall and its unrivalled castle again it was better than beaumaris and i never saw anything more picturesque than the prospect from the castlewall towards the sea we reached chester at p m the next morning mr bright left for liverpool before i was awake i visited the cathedral where the organ was sounding sauntered through the rows bought some playthings for the children and left for home soon after twelve liverpool august th visiting the zoological gardens the other day with j it occurred to me what a fantastic kind of life a person connected with them might be depicted as leading a child for instance the grounds are very extensive and include arrangements for all kinds of exhibitions calculated to attract the idle people of a great city in one enclosure is a bear who climbs a pole to get cake and gingerbread from the spectators elsewhere a circular building with compartments for lions wolves and tigers in another part of the garden is a colony of monkeys the skeleton of an elephant birds of all kinds swans and various rare waterfowl were swimming on a piece of water which was green by the by and when the fowls dived they stirred up black mud a stork was parading along the margin with melancholy strides of its long legs and came slowly towards its as if for companionship in one apartment was an obstreperously noisy society of parrots and macaws most gorgeous and diversified of hue these different colonies of birds and beasts were scattered about in various parts of the grounds so that you came upon them unexpectedly also there were archery and shootinggrounds and a sewing a theatre also at which a rehearsal was going on we standing at one of the doors and looking in towards the dusky stage where the company in their ordinary dresses were rehearsing something that had a good deal of dance and action in it in the open air there was an arrangement of painted scenery representing a wide expanse of mountains with a city at their feet and before it the sea with actual water and large vessels upon it the vessels having only the side that would be presented to the spectator but the scenery was so good that at a first casual glance i almost mistook it for reality there was a refreshmentroom with drinks and cakes and pastry but so far as i saw no substantial victual about in the centre of the garden there was an actual homelylooking small dwellinghouse where perhaps the overlookers of the place live now this might be wrought in an imaginative description into a pleasant sort of a fools paradise where all sorts of unreal delights should cluster round some suitable personage and it would relieve in a very odd and effective way the stern realities of life on the outside of the gardenwalls i saw a little girl simply dressed who seemed to have her habitat within the grounds there was also a daguerreotypist with his wife and family carrying on his business in a shanty and perhaps having his home in its inner room he seemed to be an honest intelligent pleasant young man and his wife a pleasant woman and i had j s daguerreotype taken for three shillings in a little gilded frame in the description of the garden the velvet turf of a charming verdure and the shrubbery and shadowy walks and large trees and the slopes and inequalities of ground must not he forgotten in one place there was a maze and labyrinth where a person might wander a long while in the vain endeavor to get out although all the time looking at the exterior garden over the low hedges that border the walks of the maze and this is like the inappreciable difficulties that often beset us in life i will see it again before long and get some additional record of it august th we went to the isle of man a few weeks ago where s and the children spent a fortnight i spent two sundays with them i never saw anything prettier than the little church of kirk madden there it stands in a perfect seclusion of shadowy trees a plain little church that would not be at all remarkable in another situation but is most picturesque in its solitude and bowery environment the churchyard is quite full and overflowing with graves and extends down the gentle slope of a hill with a dark mass of shadow above it some of the tombstones are flat on the ground some erect or laid horizontally on low pillars or masonry there were no very old dates on any of these stones for the climate soon effaces inscriptions and makes a stone of fifty years look as old as one of five hundred unless it be slate or something harder than the usual red freestone there was an old runic monument however near the centre of the churchyard that had some strange sculpture on it and an inscription still legible by persons learned in such matters against the tower of the church too there is a circular stone with carving on it said to be of immemorial antiquity there is likewise a tall marble monument as much as fifty feet high erected some years ago to the memory of one of the athol family by his brotherofficers of a local regiment of which he was colonel at one of the sideentrances of the church and forming the threshold within the thickness of the wall so that the feet of all who enter must tread on it is a flat tombstone of somebody who felt himself a sinner no doubt and desired to be thus trampled upon the stone is much worn the structure is extremely plain inside and very small on the walls over the pews are several monumental sculptures a quite elaborate one to a colonel murray of the coldstreamn guards his military profession being designated by banners and swords in marble another was to a farmer on one side of the churchtower there was a little penthouse or leanto merely a stone roof about three or four feet high and supported by a single pillar beneath which was once deposited the bier i have let too much time pass before attempting to record my impressions of the isle of man but as regards this church no description can come up to its quiet beauty its seclusion and its every requisite for an english country church last sunday i went to eastham and entering the churchyard sat down on a tombstone under the yewtree which has been known for centuries as the great tree of eastham some of the village people were sitting on the graves near the door and an old woman came towards me and said in a low kindly admonishing tone that i must not let the sexton see me because he would not allow any one to be there in sacramenttime i inquired why she and her companions were there and she said they were waiting for the sacrament so i thanked her gave her a sixpence and departed close under the eaves i saw two upright stones in memory of two old servants of the stanley family one over ninety and the other over eighty years of age august th j and i went to birkenhead park yesterday there is a large ornamental gateway to the park and the grounds within are neatly laid out with borders of shrubbery there is a sheet of water with swans and other aquatic fowl which swim about and are fed with dainties by the visitors nothing can be more beautiful than a swan it is the ideal of a goose a goose beautified and beatified there were not a great many visitors but some children were dancing on the green and a few loverlike people straying about i think the english behave better than the americans at similar places there was a cameraobscure very wretchedly indistinct at the refreshmentroom were gingerbeer and british wines august st i was in the crown court on saturday sitting in the sheriffs seat the judge was baron an old gentleman of sixty with very large long features his wig helped him to look like some strange kind of animal very queer but yet with a sagacious and on the whole beneficent aspect during the session some mischievous young barrister occupied himself with sketching the judge in pencil and being handed about it found its way to me it was very like and very laughable but hardly caricatured the judicial wig is an exceedingly odd affair and as it covers both ears it would seem intended to prevent his lordship and justice in his person from hearing any of the case on either side that thereby he may decide the better it is like the old idea of blindfolding the statue of justice it seems to me there is less formality less distance between the judge jury witnesses and bar in the english courts than in our own the judge takes a very active part in the trial constantly asking a question of the witness on the stand making remarks on the conduct of the trial putting in his word on all occasions and allowing his own sense of the matter in hand to be pretty plainly seen so that before the trial is over and long before his own charge is delivered he must have exercised a very powerful influence over the minds of the jury all this is done not without dignity yet in a familiar kind of way it is a sort of paternal supervision of the whole matter quite unlike the cold awfulness of an american judge but all this may be owing partly to the personal characteristics of baron it appeared to me however that from the closer relations of all parties truth was likely to be arrived at and justice to be done as an innocent man i should not be afraid to be tried by baron eaton hall august th i went to eaton hall yesterday with my wife and mr g p bradford via chester on our way at the latter place we visited st johns church it is built of the same red freestone as the cathedral and looked exceedingly antique and venerable this kind of stone from its softness and its liability to be acted upon by the weather being liable to an early decay nevertheless i believe the church was built above a thousand years ago some parts of it at least and the surface of the tower and walls is worn away and hollowed in shallow sweeps by the hand of time there were broken niches in several places where statues had formerly stood all except two or three had fallen or crumbled away and those which remained were much damaged the face and details of the figure were almost obliterated there were many gravestones round the church but none of them of any antiquity probably as the names become indistinguishable on the older stones the graves are dug over again and filled with new occupants and covered with new stones or perhaps with the old ones newly inscribed closely connected with the church was the clergymans house a comfortablelooking residence and likewise in the churchyard with tombstones all about it even almost at the threshold so that the doorstep itself might have been a tombstone was another house of respectable size and aspect we surmised that this might be the sextons dwelling but it proved not to be so and a woman answering our knock directed us to the place where he might be found so mr bradford and i went in search of him leaving s seated on a tombstone the sexton was a jollylooking ruddyfaced man a mechanic of some sort apparently and he followed us to the churchyard with much alacrity we found s standing at a gateway which opened into the most ancient and now quite ruinous part of the church the present edifice covering much less ground than it did some centuries ago we went through this gateway and found ourselves in an enclosure of venerable walls open to the sky with old norman arches standing about beneath the loftiest of which the sexton told us the high altar used to stand of course there were weeds and ivy growing in the crevices but not so abundantly as i have seen them elsewhere the sexton pointed out a piece of a statue that had once stood in one of the niches and which he himself i think had dug up from several feet below the earth also in a niche of the walls high above our heads he showed us an ancient wooden coffin hewn out of a solid log of oak the hollow being made rudely in the shape of a human figure this too had been dug up and nobody knew how old it was while we looked at all this solemn old trumpery the curate quite a young man stood at the back door of his house elevated considerably above the ruins with his young wife i presume and a friend or two chatting cheerfully among themselves it was pleasant to see them there after examining the ruins we went inside of the church and found it a dim and dusky old place quite paved over with tombstones not an inch of space being left in the aisles or near the altar or in any nook or corner uncovered by a tombstone there were also mural monuments and escutcheons and close against the wall lay the mutilated statue of a crusader with his legs crossed in the style which one has so often read about the old fellow seemed to have been represented in chain armor but he had been more battered and bruised since death than even during his pugnacious life and his nose was almost knocked away this figure had been dug up many years ago and nobody knows whom it was meant to commemorate the nave of the church is supported by two rows of saxon pillars not very lofty but six feet six inches so the sexton says in diameter they are covered with plaster which was laid on ages ago and is now so hard and smooth that i took the pillars to be really composed of solid shafts of gray stone but at one end of the church the plaster had been removed from two of the pillars in order to discover whether they were still sound enough to support the building and they prove to be made of blocks of red freestone just as sound as when it came from the quarry for though this stone soon crumbles in the open air it is as good as indestructible when sheltered from the weather it looked very strange to see the fresh hue of these two pillars amidst the dingy antiquity of the rest of the structure the body of the church is covered with pews the wooden enclosures of which seemed of antique fashion there were also modern stoves but the sexton said it was very cold there in spite of the stoves it had i must say a disagreeable odor pervading it in which the dead people of long ago had doubtless some share a musty odor by no means amounting to a stench but unpleasant and i should think unwholesome old woodwork and old stones and antiquity of all kinds moral and physical go to make up this smell i observed it in the cathedral and chester generally has it especially under the rows after all the necessary damp and lack of sunshine in such a shadowy old church as this have probably more to do with it than the dead people have although i did think the odor was particularly strong over some of the tombstones not having shillings to give the sexton we were forced to give him half a crown the church of st john is outside of the city walls entering the east gate we walked awhile under the rows bought our tickets for eaton hall and its gardens and likewise some playthings for the children for this old city of chester seems to me to possess an unusual number of toyshops finally we took a cab and drove to the hall about four miles distant nearly the whole of the way lying through the wooded park there are many sorts of trees making up a wilderness which looked not unlike the woods of our own concord only less wild the english oak is not a handsome tree being short and sturdy with a round thick mass of foliage lying all within its own bounds it was a showery day had there been any sunshine there might doubtless have been many beautiful effects of light and shadow in these woods we saw one or two herds of deer quietly feeding a hundred yards or so distant they appeared to be somewhat wilder than cattle but i think not much wilder than sheep their ancestors have probably been in a halfdomesticated state receiving food at the hands of man in winter for centuries there is a kind of poetry in this quite as much as if they were really wild deer such as their forefathers were when hugh lupus used to hunt them our miserable cab drew up at the steps of eaton hall and ascending under the portico the door swung silently open and we were received very civilly by two old men one a tall footman in livery the other of higher grade in plain clothes the entrancehall is very spacious and the floor is tessellated or somehow inlaid with marble there was statuary in marble on the floor and in niches stood several figures in antique armor of various dates some with lances and others with battleaxes and swords there was a twohanded sword as much as six feet long but not nearly so ponderous as i have supposed this kind of weapon to be from reading of it i could easily have brandished it i dont think i am a good sightseer at least i soon get satisfied with looking at the sights and wish to go on to the next the plainly dressed old man now led us into a long corridor which goes i think the whole length of the house about five hundred feet arched all the way and lengthened interminably by a lookingglass at the end in which i saw our own party approaching like a party of strangers but i have so often seen this effect produced in drygoods stores and elsewhere that i was not much impressed there were family portraits and other pictures and likewise pieces of statuary along this arched corridor and it communicated with a chapel with a scriptural altarpiece copied from rubens and a picture of st michael and the dragon and two or perhaps three richly painted windows everything here is entirely new and fresh this part having been repaired and never yet inhabited by the family this brandnewness makes it much less effective than if it had been lived in and i felt pretty much as if i were strolling through any other renewed house after all the utmost force of man can do positively very little towards making grand things or beautiful things the imagination can do so much more merely on shutting ones eyes that the actual effect seems meagre so that a new house unassociated with the past is exceedingly unsatisfactory especially when you have heard that the wealth mud skill of man has here done its best besides the rooms as we saw them did not look by any means their best the carpets not being down and the furniture being covered with protective envelopes however rooms cannot be seen to advantage by daylight it being altogether essential to the effect that they should be illuminated by artificial light which takes them somewhat out of the region of bare reality nevertheless there was undoubtedly great splendor for the details of which i refer to the guidebook among the family portraits there was one of a lady famous for her beautiful hand and she was holding it up to notice in the funniest way and very beautiful it certainly was the private apartments of the family were not shown us i should think it impossible for the owner of this house to imbue it with his personality to such a degree as to feel it to be his home it must be like a small lobster in a shell much too large for him after seeing what was to be seen of the rooms we visited the gardens in which are noble conservatories and hothouses containing all manner of rare and beautiful flowers and tropical fruits i noticed some large pines looking as if they were really made of gold the gardener undergardener i suppose he was who showed this part of the spectacle was very intelligent as well as kindly and seemed to take an interest in his business he gave s a purple everlasting flower which will endure a great many years as a memento of our visit to eaton hall finally we took a view of the front of the edifice which is very fine and much more satisfactory than the interior and returned to chester we strolled about under the unsavory rows sometimes scudding from side to side of the street through the shower took lunch in a confectioners shop and drove to the railway station in time for the threeoclock train it looked picturesque to see two little girls hand in hand racing along the ancient passages of the rows but chester has a very evil smell at the railroad station s saw a small edition of twicetold tales forming a volume of the cottage library and opening it there was the queerest imaginable portrait of myself so very queer that we could not but buy it the shilling edition of the scarlet letter and seven gables are at all the bookstalls and shopwindows but so is the lamplighter and still more trashy books august th all past affairs all home conclusions all people whom i have known in america and meet again here are strangely compelled to undergo a new trial it is not that they suffer by comparison with circumstances of english life and forms of english manhood or womanhood but being free from my old surroundings and the inevitable prejudices of home i decide upon them absolutely i think i neglected to record that i saw miss martineau a few weeks since she is a large robust elderly woman and plainly dressed but withal she has so kind cheerful and intelligent a face that she is pleasanter to look at than most beauties her hair is of a decided gray and she does not shrink from calling herself old she is the most continual talker i ever heard it is really like the babbling of a brook and very lively and sensible too and all the while she talks she moves the bowl of her eartrumpet from one auditor to another so that it becomes quite an organ of intelligence and sympathy between her and yourself the eartrumpet seems a sensible part of her like the antennae of some insects if you have any little remark to make you drop it in and she helps you to make remarks by this delicate little appeal of the trumpet as she slightly directs it towards you and if you have nothing to say the appeal is not strong enough to embarrass you all her talk was about herself and her affairs but it did not seem like egotism because it was so cheerful and free from morbidness and this woman is an atheist and thinks that the principle of life will become extinct when her body is laid in the grave i will not think so were it only for her sake what only a few weeds to spring out of her mortality instead of her intellect and sympathies flowering and fruiting forever september th my family went to rhyl last thursday and on saturday i joined them there in company with osullivan who arrived in the behama from lisbon that morning we went by way of chester and found s waiting for us at the rhyl station rhyl is a most uninteresting place a collection of new lodginghouses and hotels on a long sandbeach which the tide leaves bare almost to the horizon the sand is by no means a marble pavement but sinks under the foot and makes very heavy walking but there is a promenade in front of the principal range of houses looking on the sea whereon we have rather better footing almost all the houses were full and s had taken a parlor and two bedrooms and is living after the english fashion providing her own table lights fuel and everything it is very awkward to our american notions but there is an independence about it which i think must make it agreeable on better acquaintance but the place is certainly destitute of attraction and life seems to pass very heavily the english do not appear to have a turn for amusing themselves sunday was a bright and hot day and in the forenoon i set out on a walk not well knowing whither over a very dusty road with not a particle of shade along its dead level the welsh mountains were before me at the distance of three or four miles long ridgy hills descending pretty abruptly upon the plain on either side of the road here and there an old whitewashed thatched stone cottage or a stone farmhouse with an aspect of some antiquity i never suffered so much before on this side of the water from heat and dust and should probably have turned back had i not espied the round towers and walls of an old castle at some distance before me having looked at a guidebook previously to setting out i knew that this must be rhyddlan castle about three miles from rhyl so i plodded on and by and by entered an antiquated village on one side of which the castle stood this welsh village is very much like the english villages with narrow streets and mean houses or cottages built in blocks and here and there a larger house standing alone everything far more compact than in our rural villages and with no grassy streetmargin nor trees aged and dirty also with dirty children staring at the passenger and an undue supply of mean inns most or many of the men in breeches and some of the women especially the elder ones in black beaver hats the streets were paved with round pebbles and looked squalid and ugly the children and grown people stared lazily at me as i passed but showed no such alert and vivacious curiosity as a community of yankees would have done i turned up a street that led me to the castle which looked very picturesque close at hand more so than at a distance because the towers and walls have not a sufficiently broken outline against the sky there are several round towers at the angles of the wall very large in their circles built of gray stone crumbling ivygrown everything that one thinks of in an old ruin i could not get into the inner space of the castle without climbing over a fence or clambering down into the moat so i contented myself with walking round it and viewing it from the outside through the gateway i saw a cow feeding on the green grass in the inner court of the castle in one of the walls there was a large triangular gap where perhaps the assailants had made a breach of course there were weeds on the ruinous top of the towers and along the summit of the wall this was the first castle built by edward i in wales and he resided here during the erection of conway castle and here queen eleanor gave birth to a princess some few years since a meeting of welsh bards was held within it after viewing it awhile and listening to the babble of some children who lay on the grass near by i resumed my walk and meeting a welshman in the village street i asked him my nearest way back to rhyl dim sassenach said he after a pause how odd that an hour or two on the railway should have brought me amongst a people who speak no english just below the castle there is an arched stone bridge over the river clwyd and the best view of the edifice is from hence it stands on a gentle eminence commanding the passage of the river and two twin round towers rise close beside one another whence i suppose archers have often drawn their bows against the wild welshmen on the riverbanks behind was the line of mountains and this was the point of defence between the hill country and the lowlands on the bridge stood a good many idle welshmen leaning over the parapet and looking at some small vessels that had come up the river from the sea there was the frame of a new vessel on the stocks near by as i returned on my way home i again inquired my way of a man in breeches who i found could speak english very well he was kind and took pains to direct me giving me the choice of three ways viz the one by which i came another across the fields and a third by the embankment along the riverside i chose the latter and so followed the course of the clwyd which is very ugly with a tidal flow and wide marshy banks on its farther side was rhyddlan marsh where a battle was fought between the welsh and saxons a thousand years ago i have forgotten to mention that the castle and its vicinity was the scene of the famous battle of the fiddlers between de blandeville earl of chester and the welsh about the time of the conqueror conway castle september th on monday we went with osullivan to conway by rail certainly this must be the most perfect specimen of a ruinous old castle in the whole world it quite fills up ones idea we first walked round the exterior of the wall at the base of which are hovels with dirty children playing about them and pigs rambling along and squalid women visible in the doorways but all these things melt into the picturesqueness of the scene and do not harm it the whole town of conway is built in what was once the castleyard and the whole circuit of the wall is still standing in a delightful state of decay at the angles and at regular intervals there are round towers having half their circle on the outside of the walls and half within most of these towers have a great crack pervading them irregularly from top to bottom the ivy hangs upon them the weeds grow on the tops gateways three or four of them open through the walls and streets proceed from them into the town at some points very old cottages or small houses are close against the sides and old as they are they must have been built after the whole structure was a ruin in one place i saw the sign of an alehouse painted on the gray stones of one of the old round towers as we entered one of the gates after making the entire circuit we saw an omnibus coming down the street towards us with its horn sounding llandudno was its place of destination and knowing no more about it than that it was four miles off we took our seats llandudno is a wateringvillage at the base of the great ormes head at the mouth of the conway river in this omnibus there were two pleasantlooking girls who talked welsh together a guttural childish kind of a babble afterwards we got into conversation with them and found them very agreeable one of them was reading tuppers proverbial philosophy on reaching llandudno s waited at the hotel while osullivan u and i ascended the great ormes head there are coppermines here and we heard of a large cave with stalactites but did not go so far as that we found the old shaft of a mine however and threw stones down it and counted twenty before we heard them strike the bottom at the base of the head on the side opposite the village we saw a small church with a broken roof and horizontal gravestones of slate within the stone enclosure around it the view from the hill was most beautiful a blue summer sea with the distant trail of smoke from a steamer and many snowy sails in another direction the mountains near and distant some of them with clouds below their peaks we went to one of the mines which are still worked and boys came running to meet us with specimens of the copper ore for sale the miners were not now hoisting ore from the shaft but were washing and selecting the valuable fragments from great heaps of crumbled stone and earth all about this spot there are shafts and wellholes looking fearfully deep and black and without the slightest protection so that we might just as easily have walked into them as not having examined these matters sufficiently we descended the hill towards the village meeting parties of visitors mounted on donkeys which is a much more sensible way of ascending in a hot day than to walk on the sides and summit of the hill we found yellow gorse heath of two colors i think and very beautiful and here and there a harebell owing to the longcontinued dry weather the grass was getting withered and brown though not so much so as on american hillpastures at this season returning to the village we all went into a confectioners shop and made a good luncheon the two prettiest young ladies whom i have seen in england came into the shop and ate cakes while we were there they appeared to be living together in a lodginghouse and ordered some of their housekeeping articles from the confectioner next we went into the village bazaar a sort of tent or open shop full of knickknacks and gewgaws and bought some playthings for the children at half past one we took our seats in the omnibus to return to conway we had as yet only seen the castle wall and the exterior of the castle now we were to see the inside right at the foot of it an old woman has her stand for the sale of lithographic views of conway and other places but these views are ridiculously inadequate so that we did not buy any of them the admittance into the castle is by a wooden door of modern construction and the present seneschal is i believe the sexton of a church he remembered me as having been there a month or two ago and probably considering that i was already initiated or else because he had many other visitors he left us to wander about the castle at will it is altogether impossible to describe conway castle nothing ever can have been so perfect in its own style and for its own purposes when it was first built and now nothing else can be so perfect as a picture of ivygrown peaceful ruin the banquetinghall all open to the sky and with thick curtains of ivy tapestrying the walls and grass and weeds growing on the arches that overpass it is indescribably beautiful the hearthstones of the great old fireplaces all about the castle seem to be favorite spots for weeds to grow there are eight large round towers and out of four of them i think rise smaller towers ascending to a much greater height and once containing winding staircases all of which are now broken and inaccessible from below though in at least one of the towers the stairs seemed perfect high aloft it must have been the rudest violence that broke down these stairs for each step was a thick and heavy slab of stone built into the wall of the tower there is no such thing as a roof in any part towers hall kitchen all are open to the sky one round tower directly overhanging the railway is so shattered by the falling away of the lower part that you can look quite up into it and through it while sitting in the cars and yet it has stood thus without falling into complete ruin for more than two hundred years i think that it was in this tower that we found the castle oven an immense cavern big enough to bake bread for an army the railway passes exactly at the base of the high rock on which this part of the castle is situated and goes into the town through a great arch that has been opened in the castle wall the tubular bridge across the conway has been built in a style that accords with the old architecture and i observed that one little sprig of ivy had rooted itself in the new structure there are numberless intricate passages in the thickness of the castle walls forming communications between tower and tower damp chill passages with rough stone on either hand darksome and very likely leading to dark pitfalls the thickness of the walls is amazing and the people of those days must have been content with very scanty light so small were the apertures sometimes merely slits and loopholes glimmering through many feet of thickness of stone one of the towers was said to have been the residence of queen eleanor and this was better lighted than the others containing an orielwindow looking out of a little oratory as it seemed to be with groined arches and traces of ornamental sculpture so that we could dress up some imperfect image of a queenly chamber though the tower was roofless and floorless there was another pleasant little windowed nook close beside the oratory where the queen might have sat sewing or looking down the river conway at the picturesque headlands towards the sea we imagined her stately figure in antique robes standing beneath the groined arches of the oratory there seem to have been three chambers one above another in these towers and the one in which was the embowed window was the middle one i suppose the diameter of each of these circular rooms could not have been more than twenty feet on the inside all traces of woodwork and ironwork are quite gone from the whole castle these are said to have been taken away by a lord conway in the reign of charles ii there is a grassy space under the windows of queen eleanors tower a sort of outwork of the castle where probably when no enemy was near the queen used to take the open air in summer afternoons like this here we sat down on the grass of the ruined wall and agreed that nothing in the world could be so beautiful and picturesque as conway castle and that never could there have been so fit a time to see it as this sunny quiet lovely afternoon sunshine adapts itself to the character of a ruin in a wonderful way it does not flout the ruins gray as scott says but sympathizes with their decay and saddens itself for their sake it beautifies the ivy too we saw at the corner of this grassplot around queen eleanors tower a real trunk of a tree of ivy with so stalwart a stem and such a vigorous grasp of its strong branches that it would be a very efficient support to the wall were it otherwise inclined to fall o that we could have ivy in america what is there to beautify us when our time of ruin comes before departing we made the entire circuit of the castle on its walls and osullivan and i climbed by a ladder to the top of one of the towers while there we looked down into the street beneath and saw a photographist preparing to take a view of the castle and calling out to some little girl in some niche or on some pinnacle of the walls to stand still that he might catch her figure and face i think it added to the impressiveness of the old castle to see the streets and the kitchengardens and the homely dwellings that had grown up within the precincts of this feudal fortress and the people of today following their little businesses about it this does not destroy the charm but tourists and idle visitors do impair it the earnest life of today however petty and homely as it may be has a right to its place alongside of what is left of the life of other days and if it be vulgar itself it does not vulgarize the scene but tourists do vulgarize it and i suppose we did so just like others we took the train back to rhyl where we arrived at about four oclock and having dined we again took the rail for chester and thence to rock park that is osullivan and i and reached home at about eleven oclock yesterday september th i began to wear a watch from bennets cheapside london w c bennet warrants it as the best watch which they can produce if it prove as good and as durable as he prophesies j will find it a perfect timekeeper long after his father has done with time if i had not thought of his wearing it hereafter i should have been content with a much inferior one no september th i went back to rhyl last friday in the steamer we arrived at the landingplace at nearly four oclock having started at twelve and i walked thence to our lodgings west parade the children and their mother were all gone out and i sat some time in our parlor before anybody came the next morning i made an excursion in the omnibus as far as ruthin passing through rhyddlan st asaph denbigh and reaching ruthin at one oclock all these are very ancient places st asaph has a cathedral which is not quite worthy of that name but is a very large and stately church in excellent repair its square battlemented tower has a very fine appearance crowning the clump of village houses on the hilltop as you approach from rhyddlan the ascent of the hill is very steep so it is at denbigh and at ruthin the steepest streets indeed that i ever climbed denbigh is a place of still more antique aspect than st asaph it looks i think even older than chester with its gabled houses many of their windows opening on hinges and their fronts resting on pillars with an open porch beneath the castle makes an admirably ruinous figure on the hill higher than the village i had come hither with the purpose of inspecting it but as it began to rain just then i concluded to get into the omnibus and go to ruthin there was another steep ascent from the commencement of the long street of ruthin till i reached the marketplace which is of nearly triangular shape and an exceedingly oldlooking place houses of stone or plastered brick one or two with timber frames the roofs of an uneven line and bulging out or sinking in the slates mossgrown some of them have two peaks and even three in a row fronting on the streets and there is a stone markethouse with a table of regulations in this marketplace there is said to be a stone on which king arthur beheaded one of his enemies but this i did not see all these villages were very lively as the omnibus drove in and i rather imagine it was marketday in each of them there being quite a bustle of welsh people the old women came round the omnibus courtesying and intimating their willingness to receive alms witchlike women such as one sees in pictures or reads of in romances and very unlike anything feminine in america their style of dress cannot have changed for centuries it was quite unexpected to me to hear welsh so universally and familiarly spoken everybody spoke it the omnibusdriver could speak but imperfect english there was a jabber of welsh all through the streets and marketplaces and it flowed out with a freedom quite different from the way in which they expressed themselves in english i had had an idea that welsh was spoken rather as a freak and in fun than as a native language it was so strange to find another language the peoples actual and earnest medium of thought within so short a distance of england but english is scarcely more known to the body of the welsh people than to the peasantry of france however they sometimes pretend to ignorance when they might speak it fairly enough i took luncheon at the hotel where the omnibus stopped and then went to search out the castle it appears to have been once extensive but the remains of it are now very few except a part of the external wall whatever other portion may still exist has been built into a modern castellated mansion which has risen within the wide circuit of the fortress a handsome and spacious edifice of red freestone with a high tower on which a flag was flying the grounds were well laid out in walks and really i think the site of the castle could not have been turned to better account i am getting tired of antiquity it is certainly less interesting in the long run than novelty and so i was well content with the fresh warm red hue of the modern house and the unworn outline of its walls and its cheerful large windows and was willing that the old ivygrown ruins should exist now only to contrast with the modernisms these ancient walls by the by are of immense thickness there is a passage through the interior of a portion of them the width from this interior passage to the outer one being fifteen feet on one side and i know not how much on the other it continued showery all day and the omnibus was crowded i had chosen the outside from rhyl to denbigh but all the rest of the journey imprisoned myself within on our way home an old lady got into the omnibus a lady of tremendous rotundity and as she tumbled from the door to the farthest part of the carriage she kept advising all the rest of the passengers to get out i dont think there will be much rain gentlemen quoth she youll be much more comfortable on the outside as none of us complied she glanced along the seats what are you all saasuach she inquired as we drove along she talked welsh with great fluency to one of the passengers a young woman with a baby and to as many others as could understand her it has a strange wild sound like a language half blown away by the wind the ladys english was very good but she probably prided herself on her proficiency in welsh my excursion today had been along the valley of the clwyd a very rich and fertile tract of country the next day we all took a long walk on the beach picking up shells on monday we took an open carriage and drove to rhyddlan whence we sent back the carriage meaning to walk home along the embankment of the river clwyd after inspecting the castle the fortress is very ruinous having been dismantled by the parliamentarians there are great gaps two at least in the walls that connect the round towers of which there were six one on each side of a gateway in front and the same at a gateway towards the river where there is a steep descent to a wall and square tower at the waterside great pains and a great deal of gunpowder must have been used in converting this castle into a ruin there were one or two fragments lying where they had fallen more than two hundred years ago which though merely a conglomeration of small stones and mortar were just as hard as if they had been solid masses of granite the substantial thickness of the walls is composed of these agglomerated small stones and mortar the casing being hewn blocks of red freestone this is much worn away by the weather wherever it has been exposed to the air but under shelter it looks as if it might have been hewn only a year or two ago each of the round towers had formerly a small staircase turret rising beside and ascending above it in which a warder might be posted but they have all been so battered and shattered that it is impossible for an uninstructed observer to make out a satisfactory plan of then the interior of each tower was a small room not more than twelve or fifteen feet across and of these there seem to have been three stories with loopholes for archery and not much other light than what came through them then there are various passages and nooks and corners and square recesses in the stone some of which must have been intended for dungeons and the ugliest and gloomiest dungeons imaginable for they could not have had any light or air there is not the least splinter of woodwork remaining in any part of the castle nothing but bare stone and a little plaster in one or two places on the wall in the front gateway we looked at the groove on each side in which the portcullis used to rise and fall and in each of the contiguous round towers there was a loophole whence an enemy on the outer side of the portcullis might be shot through with an arrow the inner courtyard is a parallelogram nearly a square and is about fortyfive of my paces across it is entirely grassgrown and vacant except for two or three trees that have been recently set out and which are surrounded with palings to keep away the cows that pasture in and about the place no window looks from the walls or towers into this courtyard nor are there any traces of buildings having stood within the enclosure unless it be what looks something like the flue of a chimney within one of the walls i should suppose however that there must have been when the castle was in its perfect state a hall a kitchen and other commodious apartments and offices for the king and his train such as there were at conway and beaumaris but if so all fragments have been carried away and all hollows of the old foundations scrupulously filled up the round towers could not have comprised all the accommodation of the castle there is nothing more striking in these ruins than to look upward from the crumbling base and see flights of stairs still comparatively perfect by which you might securely ascend to the upper heights of the tower although all traces of a staircase have disappeared below and the upper portion cannot be attained on three sides of the fortress is a moat about sixty feet wide and cased with stone it was probably of great depth in its day but it is now partly filled up with earth and is quite dry and grassy throughout its whole extent on the inner side of the moat was the outer wall of the castle portions of which still remain between the outer wall and the castle itself the space is also about sixty feet the day was cloudy and lowering and there were several little spatterings of rain while we rambled about the two children ran shouting hither and thither and were continually clambering into dangerous places racing along ledges of broken wall at last they altogether disappeared for a good while their voices which had heretofore been plainly audible were hushed nor was there any answer when we began to call them while making ready for our departure but they finally appeared coming out of the moat where they had been picking and eating blackberries which they said grew very plentifully there and which they were very reluctant to leave before quitting the castle i must not forget the ivy which makes a perfect tapestry over a large portion of the walls we walked about the village which is old and ugly small irregular streets contriving to be intricate though there are few of them mean houses joining to each other we saw in the principal one the parliament house in which edward i gave a charter or allowed rights of some kind to his welsh subjects the ancient part of its wall is entirely distinguishable from what has since been built upon it thence we set out to walk along the embankment although the sky looked very threatening the wind however was so strong and had such a full sweep at us on the top of the bank that we decided on taking a path that led from it across the moor but we soon had cause to repent of this for which way soever we turned we found ourselves cut off by a ditch or a little stream so that here we were fairly astray on rhyddlan moor the old battlefield of the saxons and britons and across which i suppose the fiddlers and mountebanks had marched to the relief of the earl of chester anon too it began to shower and it was only after various leaps and scramblings that we made our way to a large farmhouse and took shelter under a cartshed the back of the house to which we gained access was very dirty and illkept some dirty children peeped at us as we approached and nobody had the civility to ask us in so we took advantage of the first cessation of the shower to resume our way we were shortly overtaken by a very intelligentlooking and civil man who seemed to have come from rhyddlan and said he was going to rhyl we followed his guidance over stiles and along hedgerow paths which we never could have threaded rightly by ourselves by and by our kind guide had to stop at an intermediate farm but he gave us full directions how to proceed and we went on till it began to shower again pretty briskly and we took refuge in a little bit of old stone cottage which small as it was had a greater antiquity than any mansion in america the door was open and as we approached we saw several children gazing at us and their mother a pleasantlooking woman who seemed rather astounded at the visit that was about to befall her tried to draw a tattered curtain over a part of her interior which she fancied even less fit to be seen than the rest to say the truth the house was not at all better than a pigsty and while we sat there a pig came familiarly to the door thrust in his snout and seemed surprised that he should he driven away instead of being admitted as one of the family the floor was of brick there was no ceiling but only the peaked gable overhead the room was kitchen parlor and i suppose bedroom for the whole family at all events there was only the tattered curtain between us and the sleeping accommodations the good woman either could not or would not speak a word of english only laughing when s said dim sassenach but she was kind and hospitable and found a chair for each of us she had been making some bread and the dough was on the dresser life with these people is reduced to its simplest elements it is only a pity that they cannot or do not choose to keep themselves cleaner poverty except in cities need not be squalid when the shower abated a little we gave all the pennies we had to the children and set forth again by the by there were several colored prints stuck up against the walls and there was a clock ticking in a corner and some paperhangings pinned upon the slanting roof it began to rain again before we arrived at rhyl and we were driven into a small tavern after staying there awhile we set forth between the drops but the rain fell still heavier so that we were pretty well damped before we got to our lodgings after dinner i took the rail for chester and rock park and s and the children and maid followed the next day september d i dined on wednesday evening at mr john heywoods norris green mr mouckton mimes and lady were of the company mr mimes is a very agreeable kindly man resembling longfellow a good deal in personal appearance and he promotes by his genial manners the same pleasant intercourse which is so easily established with longfellow he is said to be a very kind patron of literary men and to do a great deal of good among young and neglected people of that class he is considered one of the best conversationists at present in society it may very well be so his style of talking being very simple and natural anything but obtrusive so that you might enjoy its agreeableness without suspecting it he introduced me to his wife a daughter of lord crewe with whom and himself i had a good deal of talk mr milnes told me that he owns the land in yorkshire whence some of the pilgrims of the mayflower emigrated to plymouth and that elder brewster was the postmaster of the village he also said that in the next voyage of the mayflower after she carried the pilgrims she was employed in transporting a cargo of slaves from africa to the west indies i suppose this is a queer fact and would be nuts for the southerners mem an american would never understand the passage in bunyan about christian and hopeful going astray along a bypath into the grounds of giant despair from there being no stiles and bypaths in our country september th on saturday evening my wife and i went to a soiree given by the mayor and mrs lloyd at the town hall to receive the earl of harrowby it was quite brilliant the public rooms being really magnificent and adorned for the occasion with a large collection of pictures belonging to mr naylor they were mostly if not entirely of modern artists of turner wilkie landseer and others of the best english painters turners seemed too ethereal to have been done by mortal hands the british scientific association being now in session here many distinguished strangers were present september th mr monekton milnes called on me at the consulate day before yesterday he is pleasant and sensible speaking of american politicians i remarked that they were seldom anything but politicians and had no literary or other culture beyond their own calling he said the case was the same in england and instanced sir who once called on him for information when an appeal had been made to him respecting two literary gentlemen sirhad never heard the names of either of these gentlemen and applied to mr milnes as being somewhat conversant with the literary class to know whether they were distinguished and what were their claims the names of the two literary men were james sheridan knowles and alfred tennyson october th yesterday i was present at a dejeuner on board the james barnes on occasion of her coming under the british flag having been built for the messrs barnes by donald mckay of boston she is a splendid vessel and magnificently fitted up though not with consummate taste it would be worth while that ornamental architects and upholsterers should study this branch of art since the shipbuilders seem willing to expend a good deal of money on it in fact i do not see that there is anywhere else so much encouragement to the exercise of ornamental art i saw nothing to criticise in the solid and useful details of the ship the ventilation in particular being free and abundant so that the hundreds of passengers who will have their berths between decks and at a still lower depth will have good air and enough of it there were four or five hundred persons principally liverpool merchants and their wives invited to the dejeuner and the tables were spread between decks the berths for passengers not being yet put in there was not quite light enough to make the scene cheerful it being an overcast day and indeed there was an english plainness in the arrangement of the festal room which might have been better exchanged for the flowery american taste which i have just been criticising with flowers and the arrangement of flags we should have made something very pretty of the space between decks but there was nothing to hide the fact that in a few days hence there would be crowded berths and seasick steerage passengers where we were now feasting the cheer was very good cold fowl and meats cold pies of foreign manufacture very rich and of mysterious composition and champagne in plenty with other wines for those who liked them i sat between two ladies one of them mrs a pleasant young woman who i believe is of american provincial nativity and whom i therefore regarded as half a countrywoman we talked a good deal together and i confided to her my annoyance at the prospect of being called up to answer a toast but she did not pity me at all though she felt much alarm about her husband captain who was in the same predicament seriously it is the most awful part of my official duty this necessity of making dinnerspeeches at the mayors and other public or semipublic tables however my neighborhood to mrswas good for me inasmuch as by laughing over the matter with her came to regard it in a light and ludicrous way and so when the time actually came i stood up with a careless daredevil feeling the chairman toasted the president immediately after the queen and did me the honor to speak of myself in a most flattering manner something like this great by his position under the republic greater still i am bold to say in the republic of letters i made no reply at all to this in truth i forgot all about it when i began to speak and merely thanked the company in behalf of the president and my countrymen and made a few remarks with no very decided point to them however they cheered and applauded and i took advantage of the applause to sit down and mrsinformed me that i had succeeded admirably it was no success at all to be sure neither was it a failure for i had aimed at nothing and i had exactly hit it but after sitting down i was conscious of an enjoyment in speaking to a public assembly and felt as if i should like to rise again it is something like being under fire a sort of excitement not exactly pleasure but more piquant than most pleasures i have felt this before in the same circumstances but while on my legs my impulse is to get through with my remarks and sit down again as quickly as possible the next speech i think was by rev dr the celebrated arctic gentleman in reply to a toast complimentary to the clergy he turned aside from the matter in hand to express his kind feelings towards america where he said he had been most hospitably received especially at cambridge university he also made allusions to me and i suppose it would have been no more than civil in me to have answered with a speech in acknowledgment but i did not choose to make another venture so merely thanked him across the corner of the table for he sat near me he is a venerablelooking whitehaired gentleman tall and slender with a pale intelligent kindly face other speeches were made but from beginning to end there was not one breath of eloquence nor even one neat sentence and i rather think that englishmen would purposely avoid eloquence or neatness in afterdinner speeches it seems to be no part of their object yet any englishman almost much more generally than americans will stand up and talk on in a plain way uttering one rough ragged and shapeless sentence after another and will have expressed himself sensibly though in a very rude manner before he sits down and this is quite satisfactory to his audience who indeed are rather prejudiced against the man who speaks too glibly the guests began to depart shortly after three oclock this morning i have seen two reports of my little speech one exceedingly incorrect another pretty exact but not much to my taste for i seem to have left out everything that would have been fittest to say october th the people for several days have been in the utmost anxiety and latterly in the highest exultation about sebastopol and all england and europe to boot have been fooled by the belief that it had fallen this however now turns out to be incorrect and the public visage is somewhat grim in consequence i am glad of it in spite of his actual sympathies it is impossible for a true american to be otherwise than glad success makes an englishman intolerable and already on the mistaken idea that the way was open to a prosperous conclusion of the war the times had begun to throw out menaces against america i shall never love england till she sues to us for help and in the mean time the fewer triumphs she obtains the better for all parties an englishman in adversity is a very respectable character he does not lose his dignity but merely comes to a proper conception of himself it is rather touching to an observer to see how much the universal heart is in this matter to see the merchants gathering round the telegraphic messages posted on the pillars of the exchange newsroom the people in the street who cannot afford to buy a paper clustering round the windows of the newsoffices where a copy is pinned up the groups of corporals and sergeants at the recruiting rendezvous with a newspaper in the midst of them and all earnest and sombre and feeling like one man together whatever their rank i seem to myself like a spy or a traitor when i meet their eyes and am conscious that i neither hope nor fear in sympathy with them although they look at me in full confidence of sympathy their heart knoweth its own bitterness and as for me being a stranger and all alien i intermeddle not with their joy october th my ancestor left england in i return in i sometimes feel as if i myself had been absent these two hundred and twentythree years leaving england just emerging from the feudal system and finding it on my return on the verge of republicanism it brings the two farseparated points of time very closely together to view the matter thus october th a day or two ago arrived the sad news of the loss of the arctic by collision with a french steamer off newfoundland and the loss also of three or four hundred people i have seldom been more affected by anything quite alien from my personal and friendly concerns than by the death of captain luce and his son the boy was a delicate lad and it is said that he had never been absent from his mother till this time when his father had taken him to england to consult a physician about a complaint in his hip so his father while the ship was sinking was obliged to decide whether he would put the poor weakly timorous child on board the boat to take his hard chance of life there or keep him to go down with himself and the ship he chose the latter and within half an hour i suppose the boy was among the childangels captain luce could not do less than die for his own part with the responsibility of all those lost lives upon him he may not have been in the least to blame for the calamity but it was certainly too heavy a one for him to survive he was a sensible man and a gentleman courteous quiet with something almost melancholy in his address and aspect oftentimes he has come into my inner office to say goodby before his departures but i cannot precisely remember whether or no he took leave of me before this latest voyage i never exchanged a great many words with him but those were kind ones october th it appears to be customary for people of decent station but in distressed circumstances to go round among their neighbors and the public accompanied by a friend who explains the case i have been accosted in the street in regard to one of these matters and today there came to my office a grocer who had become security for a friend and who was threatened with an execution with another grocer for supporter and advocate the beneficiary takes very little active part in the affair merely looking careworn distressed and pitiable and throwing in a word of corroboration or a sigh or an acknowledgment as the case may demand in the present instance the friend a young respectablelooking tradesman with a lancashire accent spoke freely and simply of his clients misfortunes not pressing the case unduly but doing it full justice and saying at the close of the interview that it was no pleasant business for himself the broken grocer was an elderly man of somewhat sickly aspect the whole matter is very foreign to american habits no respectable american would think of retrieving his affairs by such means but would prefer ruin ten times over no friend would take up his cause no public would think it worth while to prevent the small catastrophe and yet the custom is not without its good side as indicating a closer feeling of brotherhood a more efficient sense of neighborhood than exists among ourselves although perhaps we are more careless of a fellowcreatures ruin because ruin with us is by no means the fatal and irretrievable event that it is in england i am impressed with the ponderous and imposing look of an english legal document an assignment of real estate in england for instance engrossed on an immense sheet of thickest paper in a formal hand beginning with this indenture in german text and with occasional phrases of form breaking out into large script very long and repetitious fortified with the mayor of manchesters seal two or three inches in diameter which is certified by a notarypublic whose signature again is to have my consular certificate and official seal november d a young frenchman enters of gentlemanly aspect with a grayish cloak or paletot overspreading his upper person and a handsome and wellmade pair of black trousers and wellfitting boots below on sitting down he does not throw off nor at all disturb the cloak eying him more closely one discerns that he has no shirtcollar and that what little is visible of his shirtbosom seems not to be of today nor of yesterday perhaps not even of the day before his manner is not very good nevertheless he is a coxcomb and a jackanapes he avers himself a naturalized citizen of america where he has been tutor in several families of distinction and has been treated like a son he left america on account of his health and came near being tutor in the duke of norfolks family but failed for lack of testimonials he is exceedingly capable and accomplished but reduced in funds and wants employment here of the means of returning to america where he intends to take a situation under government which he is sure of obtaining he mentioned a quarrel which he had recently had with an englishman in behalf of america and would have fought a duel had such been the custom of the country he made the englishman foam at the mouth and told him that he had been twelve years at a military school and could easily kill him i say to him that i see little or no prospect of his getting employment here but offer to inquire whether any situation as clerk or otherwise can be obtained for him in a vessel returning to america and ask his address he has no address much to my surprise he takes his leave without requesting pecuniary aid but hints that he shall call again he is a very disagreeable young fellow like scores of others who call on me in the like situation his english is very good for a frenchman and he says he speaks it the least well of five languages he has been three years in america and obtained his naturalization papers he says as a special favor and by means of strong interest nothing is so absolutely odious as the sense of freedom and equality pertaining to an american grafted on the mind of a native of any other country in the world a naturalized citizen is hateful nobody has a right to our ideas unless born to them november th i lent the above frenchman a small sum he advertised for employment as a teacher and he called this morning to thank me for my aid and says mr chas engaged him for his children at a guinea a week and that he has also another engagement the poor fellow seems to have been brought to a very low ebb he has pawned everything even to his last shirt save the one he had on and had been living at the rate of twopence a day i had procured him a chance to return to america but he was ashamed to go back in such poor circumstances and so determined to seek better fortune here i like him better than i did partly i suppose because i have helped him november th the other day i saw an elderly gentleman walking in dale street apparently in a state of mania for as he limped along being afflicted with lameness he kept talking to himself and sometimes breaking out into a threat against some casual passenger he was a very respectablelooking man and i remember to have seen him last summer in the steamer returning from the isle of man where he had been staying at castle mona what a strange and ugly predicament it would be for a person of quiet habits to be suddenly smitten with lunacy at noonday in a crowded street and to walk along through a dim maze of extravagances partly conscious of then but unable to resist the impulse to give way to them a longsuppressed nature might be represented as bursting out in this way for want of any other safetyvalve in america people seem to consider the government merely as a political administration and they care nothing for the credit of it unless it be the administration of their own political party in england all people of whatever party are anxious for the credit of their rulers our government as a knot of persons changes so entirely every four years that the institution has come to be considered a temporary thing looking at the moon the other evening little r said it blooms out in the morning taking the moon to be the bud of the sun the english are a most intolerant people nobody is permitted nowadays to have any opinion but the prevalent one there seems to be very little difference between their educated and ignorant classes in this respect if any it is to the credit of the latter who do not show tokens of such extreme interest in the war it is agreeable however to observe how all englishmen pull together how each man comes forward with his little scheme for helping on the war how they feel themselves members of one family talking together about their common interest as if they were gathered around one fireside and then what a hearty meed of honor they award to their soldiers it is worth facing death for whereas in america when our soldiers fought as good battles with as great proportionate loss and far more valuable triumphs the country seemed rather ashamed than proud of them mrs heywood tells me that there are many catholics among the lower classes in lancashire and cheshire probably the descendants of retainers of the old catholic nobility and gentry who are more numerous in these shires than in other parts of england the present lord seftons grandfather was the first of that race who became protestant december th commodore pcalled to see me this morning a brisk gentlemanly offhand but not rough unaffected and sensible man looking not so elderly as he ought on account of a very well made wig he is now on his return from a cruise in the east indian seas and goes home by the baltic with a prospect of being very well received on account of his treaty with japan i seldom meet with a man who puts himself more immediately on conversable terms than the commodore he soon introduced his particular business with me it being to inquire whether i would recommend some suitable person to prepare his notes and materials for the publication of an account of his voyage he was good enough to say that he had fixed upon me in his own mind for this office but that my public duties would of course prevent me from engaging in it i spoke of herman melville and one or two others but he seems to have some acquaintance with the literature of the day and did not grasp very cordially at any name that i could think of nor indeed could i recommend any one with full confidence it would be a very desirable task for a young literary man or for that matter for an old one for the world can scarcely have in reserve a less hackneyed theme than japan this is a most beautiful day of english winter clear and bright with the ground a little frozen and the green grass along the waysides at rock ferry sprouting up through the frozen pools of yesterdays rain england is forever green on christmas day the children found wallflowers pansies and pinks in the garden and we had a beautiful rose from the garden of the hotel grown in the open air yet one is sensible of the cold here as much as in the zero atmosphere of america the chief advantage of the english climate is that we are not tempted to heat our rooms to so unhealthy a degree as in new england i think i have been happier this christmas than ever before by my own fireside and with my wife and children about me more content to enjoy what i have less anxious for anything beyond it in this life my early life was perhaps a good preparation for the declining half of life it having been such a blank that any thereafter would compare favorably with it for a long long while i have occasionally been visited with a singular dream and i have an impression that i have dreamed it ever since i have been in england it is that i am still at college or sometimes even at school and there is a sense that i have been there unconscionably long and have quite failed to make such progress as my contemporaries have done and i seem to meet some of them with a feeling of shame and depression that broods over me as i think of it even when awake this dream recurring all through these twenty or thirty years must be one of the effects of that heavy seclusion in which i shut myself up for twelve years after leaving college when everybody moved onward and left me behind how strange that it should come now when i may call myself famous and prosperous when i am happy too january d the progress of the age is trampling over the aristocratic institutions of england and they crumble beneath it this war has given the country a vast impulse towards democracy the nobility will never hereafter i think assume or be permitted to rule the nation in peace or command armies in war on any ground except the individual ability which may appertain to one of their number as well as to a commoner and yet the nobles were never positively more noble than now never perhaps so chivalrous so honorable so highly cultivated but relatively to the rest of the world they do not maintain their old place the pressure of the war has tested and proved this fact at home and abroad at this moment it would be an absurdity in the nobles to pretend to the position which was quietly conceded to them a year ago this one year has done the work of fifty ordinary ones or more accurately it has made apparent what has long been preparing itself january th the american ambassador called on me today and stayed a good while an hour or two he is visiting at mr william brownes at richmond hill having come to this region to bring his niece who is to be bridesmaid at the wedding of an american girl i like mr he cannot exactly be called gentlemanly in his manners there being a sort of rusticity about him moreover he has a habit of squinting one eye and an awkward carriage of his head hut withal a dignity in his large person and a consciousness of high position and importance which gives him ease and freedom very simple and frank in his address he may be as crafty as other diplomatists are said to be but i see only good sense and plainness of speech appreciative too and genial enough to make himself conversable he talked very freely of himself and of other public people and of american and english affairs he returns to america he says next october and then retires forever from public life being sixtyfour years of age and having now no desire except to write memoirs of his times and especially of the administration of mr polk i suggested a doubt whether the people would permit him to retire and he immediately responded to my hint as regards his prospects for the presidency he said that his mind was fully made up and that he would never be a candidate and that he had expressed this decision to his friends in such a way as to put it out of his own power to change it he acknowledged that he should have been glad of the nomination for the presidency in but that it was now too late and that he was too old and in short he seemed to be quite sincere in his nolo episcopari although really he is the only democrat at this moment whom it would not be absurd to talk of for the office as he talked his face flushed and he seemed to feel inwardly excited doubtless it was the high vision of half his lifetime which he here relinquished i cannot question that he is sincere but of course should the people insist upon having him for president he is too good a patriot to refuse i wonder whether he can have had any object in saying all this to me he might see that it would be perfectly natural for me to tell it to general pierce but it is a very vulgar idea this of seeing craft and subtlety when there is a plain and honest aspect january th i dined at mr william brownes m p last evening with a large party the whole table and dessert service was of silver speaking of shakespeare mrsaid that the duke of somerset who is now nearly fourscore told him that the father of john and charles kemble had made all possible research into the events of shakespeares life and that he had found reason to believe that shakespeare attended a certain revel at stratford and indulging too much in the conviviality of the occasion he tumbled into a ditch on his way home and died there the kemble patriarch was an aged man when he communicated this to the duke and their ages linked to each other would extend back a good way scarcely to the beginning of the last century however if i mistake not it was from the traditions of stratford that kemble had learned the above i do not remember ever to have seen it in print which is most singular miss l has an english rather than an american aspect being of stronger outline than most of our young ladies although handsomer than english women generally extremely selfpossessed and well poised without affectation or assumption but quietly conscious of rank as much so as if she were an earls daughter in truth she felt pretty much as an earls daughter would do towards the merchants wives and daughters who made up the feminine portion of the party i talked with her a little and found her sensible vivacious and firmtextured rather than soft and sentimental she paid me some compliments but i do not remember paying her any mr j s daughters two pale handsome girls were present one of them is to be married to a grandson of mr who was also at the dinner he is a small young man with a thin and fair mustache and a lady who sat next me whispered that his expectations are pounds per annum it struck me that being a country gentlemans son he kept himself silent and reserved as feeling himself too good for this commercial dinnerparty but perhaps and i rather think so he was really shy and had nothing to say being only twentyone and therefore quite a boy among englishmen the only man of cognizable rank present except mrand the mayor of liverpool was a baronet sir thomas birch january th s and i were invited to be present at the wedding of mr j s daughter this morning but we were also bidden to the funeral services of mrs g a young american lady and we went to the house of mourning rather than to the house of feasting her death was very sudden i crossed to rock ferry on saturday and met her husband in the boat he said his wife was rather unwell and that he had just been sent for to see her but he did not seem at all alarmed and yet on reaching home he found her dead the body is to be conveyed to america and the funeral service was read over her in her house only a few neighbors and friends being present we were shown into a darkened room where there was a dim gaslight burning and a fire glimmering and here and there a streak of sunshine struggling through the drawn curtains mr glooked pale and quite overcome with grief this i suppose being his first sorrow and he has a young baby on his hands and no doubt feels altogether forlorn in this foreign land the clergyman entered in his canonicals and we walked in a little procession into another room where the coffin was placed mr gsat down and rested his head on the coffin the clergyman read the service then knelt down as did most of the company and prayed with great propriety of manner but with no earnestness and we separated mr gis a small smooth and pretty young man not emphasized in any way but grief threw its awfulness about him today in a degree which i should not have expected january th mr steele a gentleman of rock ferry showed me this morning a pencilcase formerly belonging to dr johnson it is six or seven inches long of large calibre and very clumsily manufactured of iron perhaps plated in its better days but now quite bare indeed it looks as rough as an article of kitchen furniture the intaglio on the end is a lion rampant on the whole it well became dr johnson to have used such a stalwart pencilcase it had a sixinch measure on a part of it so that it must have been at least eight inches long mr steele says he has seen a cracked earthen teapot of large size in which miss williams used to make tea for dr johnson god himself cannot compensate us for being born for any period short of eternity all the misery endured here constitutes a claim for another life and still more all the happiness because all true happiness involves something more than the earth owns and needs something more than a mortal capacity for the enjoyment of it after receiving an injury on the head a person fancied all the rest of his life that he heard voices flouting jeering and upbraiding him february th i dined with the mayor at the town hall last friday evening i sat next to mr w j an irishamerican merchant who is in very good standing here he told me that he used to be very well acquainted with general jackson and that he was present at the street fight between him and the bentons and helped to take general jackson off the ground colonel benton shot at him from behind but it was jesse bentons ball that hit him and broke his arm i did not understand him to infer any treachery or cowardice from the circumstance of colonel bentons shooting at jackson from behind but suppose it occurred in the confusion and excitement of a street fight mr w jseems to think that after all the reconciliation between the old general and benton was merely external and that they really hated one another as before i do not think so these dinners of the mayors are rather agreeable than otherwise except for the annoyance in my case of being called up to speak to a toast and that is less disagreeable than at first the suite of rooms at the town house is stately and splendid and all the mayors as far as i have seen exercise hospitality in a manner worthy of the chief magistrates of a great city they are supposed always to spend much more than their salary which is pounds in these entertainments the town provides the wines i am told and it might be expected that they should be particularly good at least those which improve by age for a quarter of a century should be only a moderate age for wine from the cellars of centurieslong institutions like a corporate borough each mayor might lay in a supply of the best vintage he could find and trust his good name to posterity to the credit of that wine and so he would be kindly and warmly remembered long after his own nose had lost its rubicundity in point of fact the wines seem to be good but not remarkable the dinner was good and very handsomely served with attendance enough both in the hall below where the door was wide open at the appointed hour notwithstanding the cold and at table some being in the rich livery of the borough and some in plain clothes servants too were stationed at various points from the hall to the receptionroom and the last one shouted forth the name of the entering guest there were i should think about fifty guests at this dinner two bishops were present the bishops of chester and new south wales dressed in a kind of long tunics with black breeches and silk stockings insomuch that i first fancied they were catholics also dr mcneil in a stiffcollared coat looking more like a general than a divine there were two officers in blue uniforms and all the rest of us were in black with only two white waistcoats my own being one and a rare sprinkling of white cravats how hideously a man looks in them i should like to have seen such assemblages as must have gathered in that receptionroom and walked with stately tread to the dininghall in times past the mayor and other civic dignitaries in their robes noblemen in their state dresses the consul in his oliveleaf embroidery everybody in some sort of bedizenment and then the dinner would have been a magnificent spectacle worthy of the gilded hall the rich tableservice and the powdered and goldlaced servitors at a former dinner i remember seeing a gentleman in smallclothes with a dresssword but all formalities of the kind are passing away the mayors dinners too will no doubt be extinct before many years go by i drove home from the woodside ferry in a cab with bishop burke and two other gentlemen the bishop is nearly seven feet high after writing the foregoing account of a civic banquet where i ate turtlesoup salmon woodcock oyster patties and i know not what else i have been to the newsroom and found the exchange pavement densely thronged with people of all ages and of all manner of dirt and rags they were waiting for souptickets and waiting very patiently too without outcry or disturbance or even sour looks only patience and meekness in their faces well i dont know that they have a right to he impatient of starvation but still there does seem to be an insolence of riches and prosperity which one day or another will have a downfall and this will be a pity too on saturday i went with my friend mr bright to otterpool and to larkhill to see the skaters on the private waters of those two seats of gentlemen and it is a wonder to behold and it is always a new wonder to me how comfortable englishmen know how to make themselves locating their dwellings far within private grounds with secure gateways and porters lodges and the smoothest roads and trimmest paths and shaven lawns and clumps of trees and every bit of the ground every hill and dell made the most of for convenience and beauty and so well kept that even winter cannot cause disarray and all this appropriated to the same family for generations so that i suppose they come to believe it created exclusively and on purpose for them and really the result is good and beautiful it is a home an institution which we americans have not but then i doubt whether anybody is entitled to a home in this world in so full a sense the day was very cold and the skaters seemed to enjoy themselves exceedingly they were i suppose friends of the owners of the grounds and mr bright said they were treated in a jolly way with hot luncheons the skaters practise skating more as an art and can perform finer manoeuvres on the ice than our new england skaters usually can though the english have so much less opportunity for practice a beggarwoman was haunting the grounds at otterpool but i saw nobody give her anything i wonder how she got inside of the gate mr w jspoke of general jackson as having come from the same part of ireland as himself and perhaps of the same family i wonder whether he meant to say that the general was born in ireland that having been suspected in america february st yesterday two companies of workpeople came to our house in rock park asking assistance being out of work and with no resource other than charity there were a dozen or more in each party their deportment was quiet and altogether unexceptionable no rudeness no gruffness nothing of menace indeed such demonstrations would not have been safe as they were followed about by two policemen but they really seem to take their distress as their own misfortune and gods will and impute it to nobody as a fault this meekness is very touching and makes one question the more whether they have all their rights there have been disturbances within a day or two in liverpool and shops have been broken open and robbed of bread and money but this is said to have been done by idle vagabonds and not by the really hungry workpeople these last submit to starvation gently and patiently as if it were an everyday matter with them or at least nothing but what lay fairly within their horoscope i suppose in fact their stomachs have the physical habit that makes hunger not intolerable because customary if they had been used to a full meat diet their hunger would be fierce like that of ravenous beasts but now they are trained to it i think that the feeling of an american divided as i am by the ocean from his country has a continual and immediate correspondence with the national feeling at home and it seems to be independent of any external communication thus my ideas about the russian war vary in accordance with the state of the public mind at home so that i am conscious whereabouts public sympathy is march th j and i walked to tranmere and passed an old house which i suppose to be tranmere hall our way to it was up a hollow lane with a bank and hedge on each side and with a few thatched stone cottages centuries old their ridgepoles crooked and the stones timeworn scattered along at one point there was a wide deep well hewn out of the solid red freestone and with steps also hewn in solid rock leading down to it these steps were much hollowed by the feet of those who had come to the well and they reach beneath the water which is very high the well probably supplied water to the old cotters and retainers of tranmere hall five hundred years ago the hall stands on the verge of a long hill which stretches behind tranmere and as far as birkenhead it is an old gray stone edifice with a good many gables and windows with mullions and some of them extending the whole breadth of the gable in some parts of the house the windows seem to have been built up probably in the days when daylight was taxed the form of the hall is multiplex the roofs sloping down and intersecting one another so as to make the general result indescribable there were two sundials on different sides of the house both the dialplates of which were of stone and on one the figures so far as i could see were quite worn off but the gnomon still cast a shadow over it in such a way that i could judge that it was about noon the other dial had some halfworn hourmarks but no gnomon the chinks of the stones of the house were very weedy and the building looked quaint and venerable but it is now converted into a farmhouse with the farmyard and outbuildings closely appended a village too has grown up about it so that it seems out of place among modern stuccoed dwellings such as are erected for tradesmen and other moderate people who have their residences in the neighborhood of a great city among these there are a few thatched cottages the homeliest domiciles that ever mortals lived in belonging to the old estate directly across the street is a wayside inn licensed to sell wine spirits ale and tobacco the street itself has been laid out since the land grew valuable by the increase of liverpool and birkenhead for the old hall would never have been built on the verge of a public way march th i attended court to day at st georges hall with my wife mr bright and mr channing sitting in the high sheriffs seat it was the civil side and mr justice cresswell presided the lawyers as far as aspect goes seemed to me inferior to an american bar judging from their countenances whether as intellectual men or gentlemen their wigs and gowns do not impose on the spectator though they strike him as an imposition their date is past mr warren of the ten thousand a year was in court a pale thin intelligent face evidently a nervous man more unquiet than anybody else in court always restless in his seat whispering to his neighbors settling his wig perhaps with an idea that people single him out st georges hall the interior hall itself i mean is a spacious lofty and most rich and noble apartment and very satisfactory the pavement is made of mosaic tiles and has a beautiful effect april th i dined at mr j p heywoods on thursday and met there mr and mrsof smithells hall the hall is an old edifice of some five hundred years and mrssays there is a bloody footstep at the foot of the great staircase the tradition is that a certain martyr in bloody marys time being examined before the occupant of the hall and committed to prison stamped his foot in earnest protest against the injustice with which he was treated blood issued from his foot which slid along the stone pavement leaving a long footmark printed in blood and there it has remained ever since in spite of the scrubbings of all succeeding generations mrsspoke of it with much solemnity real or affected she says that they now cover the bloody impress with a carpet being unable to remove it in the history of lancashire which i looked at last night there is quite a different account according to which the footstep is not a bloody one but is a slight cavity or inequality in the surface of the stone somewhat in the shape of a mans foot with a peaked shoe the martyrs name was george marsh he was a curate and was afterwards burnt mrsasked me to go and see the hall and the footmark and as it is in lancashire and not a great way off and a curious old place perhaps i may april th the earl of whom i saw the other day at st georges hall has a somewhat elderly look a pale and rather thin face which strikes one as remarkably short or compressed from top to bottom nevertheless it has great intelligence and sensitiveness too i should think but a cold disagreeable expression i should take him to be a man of not very pleasant temper not genial he has no physical presence nor dignity yet one sees him to be a person of rank and consequence but after all there is nothing about him which it need have taken centuries of illustrious nobility to produce especially in a man of remarkable ability as lordcertainly is s who attended court all through the hapgood trial and saw lordfor hours together every day has come to conclusions quite different from mine she thinks him a perfectly natural person without any assumption any selfconsciousness any scorn of the lower world she was delighted with his ready appreciation and feeling of what was passing around him his quick enjoyment of a joke the simplicity and unaffectedness of his emotion at whatever incidents excited his interest the genial acknowledgment of sympathy causing him to look round and exchange glances with those near him who were not his individual friends but barristers and other casual persons he seemed to her all that a nobleman ought to be entirely simple and free from pretence and selfassertion which persons of lower rank can hardly help bedevilling themselves with i saw him only for a very few moments so cannot put my observation against hers especially as i was influenced by what i had heard the liverpool people say of him i do not know whether i have mentioned that the handsomest man i have seen in england was a young footman of mr heywoods in his rich livery he was a perfect joseph andrews in my romance the original emigrant to america may have carried away with him a family secret whereby it was in his power had he so chosen to have brought about the ruin of the family this secret he transmits to his american progeny by whom it is inherited throughout all the intervening generations at last the hero of the romance comes to england and finds that by means of this secret he still has it in his power to procure the downfall of the family it would be something similar to the story of meleager whose fate depended on the firebrand that his mother had snatched from the flames april th on saturday i was present at a dejeuner on board the donald mckay the principal guest being mr layard m p there were several hundred people quite filling the between decks of the ship which was converted into a saloon for the occasion i sat next to mr layard at the head of the table and so had a good opportunity of seeing and getting acquainted with him he is a man in early middle age of middle stature with an open frank intelligent kindly face his forehead is not expansive but is prominent in the perceptive regions and retreats a good deal his mouth is full i liked him from the first he was very kind and complimentary to me and made me promise to go and see him in london it would have been a very pleasant entertainment only that my pleasure in it was much marred by having to acknowledge a toast in honor of the president however such things do not trouble me nearly so much as they used to do and i came through it tolerably enough mr layards speech was the great affair of the day he speaks with much fluency though he assured me that he had to put great force upon himself to speak publicly and as he warms up seems to engage with his whole moral and physical man quite possessed with what he has to say his evident earnestness and good faith make him eloquent and stand him instead of oratorical graces his views of the position of england and the prospects of the war were as dark as well could be and his speech was exceedingly to the purpose full of commonsense and with not one word of claptrap judging from its effect upon the audience he spoke the voice of the whole english people although an english baronet who sat next below me seemed to dissent or at least to think that it was not exactly the thing for a stranger to hear it concluded amidst great cheering mr layard appears to be a true englishman with a moral force and strength of character and earnestness of purpose and fulness of commonsense such as have always served englands turn in her past successes but rather fit for resistance than progress no doubt he is a good and very able man but i question whether he could get england out of the difficulties which he sees so clearly or could do much better than lord palmerston whom he so decries april th taking the deposition of sailors yesterday in a case of alleged illusage by the officers of a vessel one of the witnesses was an old seaman of sixty in reply to some testimony of his the captain said you were the oldest man in the ship and we honored you as such the mate also said that he never could have thought of striking an old man like that indeed the poor old fellow had a kind of dignity and venerableness about him though he confessed to having been drunk and seems to have been a mischiefmaker what they call a seapreacher promoting discontent and grumbling he must have been a very handsome man in his youth having regular features of a noble and beautiful cast his beard was gray but his dark hair had hardly a streak of white and was abundant all over his head he was deaf and seemed to sit in a kind of seclusion unless when loudly questioned or appealed to once he broke forth from a deep silence thus i defy any man and then was silent again it had a strange effect this general defiance which he meant i suppose in answer to some accusation that he thought was made against him his general behavior throughout the examination was very decorous and proper and he said he had never but once hitherto been before a consul and that was in when a mate had illused him and being a young man then i gave him a beating whereupon his face gleamed with a quiet smile like faint sunshine on an old ruin by many a tempest has his beard been shook and i suppose he must soon go into a workhouse and thence shortly to his grave he is now in a hospital having as the surgeon certifies some ribs fractured but there does not appear to have been any violence used upon him aboard the ship of such a nature as to cause this injury though he swears it was a blow from a rope and nothing else what struck me in the case was the respect and rank that his age seemed to give him in the view of the officers and how as the captains expression signified it lifted him out of his low position and made him a person to be honored the dignity of his manner is perhaps partly owing to the ancient mariner with his long experience being an oracle among the forecastle men may d it rains today after a very long period of eastwind and dry weather the eastwind here blowing across the island seems to be the least damp of all the winds but it is full of malice and mischief of an indescribably evil temper and stabs one like a cold poisoned dagger i never spent so disagreeable a spring as this although almost every day for a month has been bright friday may th a few weeks ago a sailor a most pitiable object came to my office to complain of cruelty from his captain and mate they had beaten him shamefully of which he bore grievous marks about his face and eyes and bruises on his head and other parts of his person and finally the ship had sailed leaving him behind i never in my life saw so forlorn a fellow so ragged so wretched and even his wits seemed to have been beaten out of him if perchance he ever had any he got an order for the hospital and there he has been off and on ever since till yesterday when i received a message that he was dying and wished to see the consul so i went with mr wilding to the hospital we were ushered into the waitingroom a kind of parlor with a fire in the grate and a centretable whereon lay one or two medical journals with wood engravings and there was a young man who seemed to be an official of the house reading shortly the surgeon appeared a brisk cheerful kindly sort of person whom i have met there on previous visits he told us that the man was dying and probably would not be able to communicate anything but nevertheless ushered us up to the highest floor and into the room where he lay it was a large oblong room with ten or twelve beds in it each occupied by a patient the surgeon said that the hospital was often so crowded that they were compelled to lay some of the patients on the floor the man whom we came to see lay on his bed in a little recess formed by a projecting window so that there was a kind of seclusion for him to die in he seemed quite insensible to outward things and took no notice of our approach nor responded to what was said to him lying on his side breathing with short gasps his apparent disease being inflammation of the chest although the surgeon said that he might be found to have sustained internal injury by bruises he was restless tossing his head continually mostly with his eyes shut and much compressed and screwed up but sometimes opening them and then they looked brighter and darker than when i first saw them i think his face was not at any time so stupid as at his first interview with me but whatever intelligence he had was rather inward than outward as if there might be life and consciousness at a depth within while as to external matters he was in a mist the surgeon felt his wrist and said that there was absolutely no pulsation and that he might die at any moment or might perhaps live an hour but that there was no prospect of his being able to communicate with me he was quite restless nevertheless and sometimes half raised himself in bed sometimes turned himself quite over and then lay gasping for an instant his woollen shirt being thrust up on his arm there appeared a tattooing of a ship and anchor and other nautical emblems on both of them which another sailorpatient on examining them said must have been done years ago this might be of some importance because the dying man had told me when i first saw him that he was no sailor but a farmer and that this being his first voyage he had been beaten by the captain for not doing a sailors duty which he had had no opportunity of learning these seaemblems indicated that he was probably a seaman of some years service while we stood in the little recess such of the other patients as were convalescent gathered near the foot of the bed and the nurse came and looked on and hovered about us a sharpeyed intelligent woman of middle age with a careful and kind expression neglecting nothing that was for the patients good yet taking his death as coolly as any other incident in her daily business certainly it was a very forlorn deathbed and i felt what i have heretofore been inclined to doubt that it might be a comfort to have persons whom one loves to go with us to the threshold of the other world and leave us only when we are fairly across it this poor fellow had a wife and two children on the other side of the water at first he did not utter any sound but by and by he moaned a little and gave tokens of being more sensible to outward concerns not quite so misty and dreamy as hitherto we had been talking all the while myself in a whisper but the surgeon in his ordinary tones about his state without his paying any attention but now the surgeon put his mouth down to the mans face and said do you know that you are dying at this the patients head began to move upon the pillow and i thought at first that it was only the restlessness that he had shown all along but soon it appeared to be an expression of emphatic dissent a negative shake of the head he shook it with all his might and groaned and mumbled so that it was very evident how miserably reluctant he was to die soon after this he absolutely spoke o i want you to get me well i want to get away from here in a groaning and moaning utterance the surgeons question had revived him but to no purpose for being told that the consul had come to see him and asked whether he had anything to communicate he said only o i want him to get me well and the whole life that was left in him seemed to be unwillingness to die this did not last long for he soon relapsed into his first state only with his face a little more pinched and screwed up and his eyes strangely sunken and lost in his head and the surgeon said that there would be no use in my remaining so i took my leave mr wilding had brought a deposition of the mans evidence which he had clearly made at the consulate for him to sign and this we left with the surgeon in case there should be such an interval of consciousness and intelligence before death as to make it possible for him to sign it but of this there is no probability i have just received a note from the hospital stating that the sailor daniel smith died about three quarters of an hour after i saw him may th the abovementioned daniel smith had about him a bundle of letters which i have examined they are all very yellow stained with seawater smelling of bad tobaccosmoke and much worn at the folds never were such illwritten letters nor such incredibly fantastic spelling they seem to be from various members of his family most of them from a brother who purports to have been a deckhand in the coasting and steamboat trade between charleston and other ports others from female relations one from his father in which he inquires how long his son has been in jail and when the trial is to come on the offence however of which he was accused not being indicated but from the tenor of his brothers letters it would appear that he was a small farmer in the interior of south carolina sending butter eggs and poultry to be sold in charleston by his brother and receiving the returns in articles purchased there this was his own account of himself and he affirmed in his deposition before me that he had never had any purpose of shipping for liverpool or anywhere else but that going on board the ship to bring a mans trunk ashore he was compelled to remain and serve as a sailor this was a hard fate certainly and a strange thing to happen in the united states at this day that a free citizen should be absolutely kidnapped carried to a foreign country treated with savage cruelty during the voyage and left to die on his arrival yet all this has unquestionably been done and will probably go unpunished the seed of the longstapled cotton now cultivated in america was sent there in from the bahama islands by some of the royalist refugees who had settled there the inferior shortstapled cotton had been previously cultivated for domestic purposes the seeds of every other variety have been tried without success the kind now grown was first introduced into georgia thus to the refugees america owes as much of her prosperity as is due to the cottoncrops and much of whatever harm is to result from slavery may d captain jsays that he saw in his late voyage to australia and india a vessel commanded by an englishman who had with him his wife and thirteen children this ship was the home of the family and they had no other the thirteen children had all been born on board and had been brought up on board and knew nothing of dry land except by occasionally setting foot on it captain jis a very agreeable specimen of the american shipmaster a pleasant gentlemanly man not at all refined and yet with fine and honorable sensibilities very easy in his manners and conversation yet gentle talking on freely and not much minding grammar but finding a sufficient and picturesque expression for what he wishes to say very cheerful and vivacious accessible to feeling as yesterday when talking about the recent death of his mother his voice faltered and the tears came into his eyes though before and afterwards he smiled merrily and made us smile fond of his wife and carrying her about the world with him and blending her with all his enjoyments an excellent and sagacious man of business liberal in his expenditure proud of his ship and flag always well dressed with some little touch of sailorlike flashiness but not a whit too much slender in figure with a handsome face and rather profuse brown beard and whiskers active and alert about thirtytwo a daguerreotype sketch of any conversation of his would do him no justice for its slang its grammatical mistakes its mistaken words as portable for portly would represent a vulgar man whereas the impression he leaves is by no means that of vulgarity but he is a character quite perfect within itself fit for the deck and the cabin and agreeable in the drawingroom though not amenable altogether to its rules being so perfectly natural he is more of a gentleman for those little violations of rule which most men with his opportunities might escape the men whose appeals to the consuls charity are the hardest to be denied are those who have no country hungarians poles cubans spanishamericans and french republicans all exiles for liberty come to me if the representative of america were their representative yesterday came an old french soldier and showed his wounds today a spaniard a friend of lopez bringing his little daughter with him he said he was starving and looked so the little girl was in good condition enough and decently dressed may d may th the two past days have been whitsuntide holidays and they have been celebrated at tranmere in a manner very similar to that of the old election in massachusetts as i remember it a good many years ago though the festival has now almost or quite died out whitsuntide was kept up on our side of the water i am convinced under pretence of rejoicings at the election of governor it occurred at precisely the same period of the year the same week the only difference being that monday and tuesday are the whitsun festival days whereas in massachusetts wednesday was election day and the acme of the merrymaking i passed through tranmere yesterday forenoon and lingered awhile to see the sports the greatest peculiarity of the crowd to my eye was that they seemed not to have any best clothes and therefore had put on no holiday suits a grimy people as at all times heavy obtuse with thick beer in their blood coarse roughcomplexioned women and girls were intermingled the girls with no maiden trimness in their attire large and blowsy nobody seemed to have been washed that day all the enjoyment was of an exceedingly sombre character so far as i saw it though there was a richer variety of sports than at similar festivals in america there were wooden horses revolving in circles to be ridden a certain number of rounds for a penny also swinging cars gorgeously painted and the newest named after lord raglan and four cars balancing one another and turned by a winch and people with targets and rifles the principal aim being to hit an apple bobbing on a string before the target other guns for shooting at the distance of a foot or two for a prize of filberts and a game much in fashion of throwing heavy sticks at earthen mugs suspended on lines three throws for a penny also there was a posturemaster showing his art in the centre of a ring of miscellaneous spectators and handing round his bat after going through all his attitudes the collection amounted to only one halfpenny and to eke it out i threw in three more there were some large booths with tables placed the whole length at which sat men and women drinking and smoking pipes orangegirls a great many selling the worst possible oranges which had evidently been boiled to give them a show of freshness there were likewise two very large structures the walls made of boards roughly patched together and rooted with canvas which seemed to have withstood a thousand storms theatres were there and in front there were pictures of scenes which were to be represented within the price of admission being twopence to one theatre and a penny to the other but small as the price of tickets was i could not see that anybody bought them behind the theatres close to the board wall and perhaps serving as the general dressingroom was a large windowed wagon in which i suppose the company travel and live together never to my imagination was the mysterious glory that has surrounded theatrical representation ever since my childhood brought down into such dingy reality as this the tragedy queens were the same coarse and homely women and girls that surrounded me on the green some of the people had evidently been drinking more than was good for them but their drunkenness was silent and stolid with no madness in it no ebullition of any sort was apparent may st last sunday week for the first time i heard the note of the cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo it says repeating the word twice not in a brilliant metallic tone but low and flutelike without the excessive sweetness of the flute without an excess of saccharine juice in the sound there are said to be always two cuckoos seen together the note is very soft and pleasant the larks i have not yet heard in the sky though it is not infrequent to hear one singing in a cage in the streets of liverpool brewers draymen are allowed to drink as much of their masters beverage as they like and they grow very brawny and corpulent resembling their own horses in size and presenting one would suppose perfect pictures of physical comfort and wellbeing but the least bruise or even the hurt of a finger is liable to turn to gangrene or erysipelas and become fatal when the wind blows violently however clear the sky the english say it is a stormy day and on the other hand when the air is still and it does not actually rain however dark and lowering the sky may be they say the weather is fine june d the english women of the lower classes have a grace of their own not seen in each individual but nevertheless belonging to their order which is not to be found in american women of the corresponding class the other day in the police court a girl was put into the witnessbox whose native graces of this sort impressed me a good deal she was coarse and her dress was none of the cleanest and nowise smart she appeared to have been up all night too drinking at the tranmere wake and had since ridden in a cart covered up with a rug she described herself as a servantgirl out of place and her charm lay in all her manifestations her tones her gestures her look her way of speaking and what she said being so appropriate and natural in a girl of that class nothing affected no proper grace thrown away by attempting to appear ladylike which an american girl would have attempted and she would also have succeeded in a certain degree if each class would but keep within itself and show its respect for itself by aiming at nothing beyond they would all be more respectable but this kind of fitness is evidently not to be expected in the future and something else must be substituted for it these scenes at the police court are often well worth witnessing the controlling genius of the court except when the stipendiary magistrate presides is the clerk who is a man learned in the law nominally the cases are decided by the aldermen who sit in rotation but at every important point there comes a nod or a whisper from the clerk and it is that whisper which sets the defendant free or sends him to prison nevertheless i suppose the aldermans commonsense and native shrewdness are not without their efficacy in producing a general tendency towards the right and no doubt the decisions of the police court are quite as often just as those of any other court whatever june th i walked with j yesterday to bebington church when i first saw this church nearly two years since it seemed to me the fulfilment of my ideal of an old english country church it is not so satisfactory now although certainly a venerable edifice there used some time ago to be ivy all over the tower and at my first view of it there was still a little remaining on the upper parts of the spire but the main roots i believe were destroyed and pains were taken to clear away the whole of the ivy so that now it is quite bare nothing but homely gray stone with marks of age but no beauty the most curious thing about the church is the font it is a massive pile composed of five or six layers of freestone in an octagon shape placed in the angle formed by the projecting side porch and the wall of the church and standing under a stainedglass window the base is six or seven feet across and it is built solidly up in successive steps to the height of about six feet an octagonal pyramid with the basin of the font crowning the pile hewn out of the solid stone and about a foot in diameter and the same in depth there was water in it from the recent rains water just from heaven and therefore as holy as any water it ever held in old romish times the aspect of this aged font is extremely venerable with moss in the basin and all over the stones grass and weeds of various kinds and little shrubs rooted in the chinks of the stones and between the successive steps at each entrance of rock park where we live there is a small gothic structure of stone each inhabited by a policeman and his family very small dwellings indeed with the main apartment opening directly outofdoors and when the door is open one can see the household fire the good wife at work perhaps the table set and a throng of children clustering round and generally overflowing the threshold the policeman walks about the park in stately fashion with his silverlaced blue uniform and snowwhite gloves touching his hat to gentlemen who reside in the park in his public capacity he has rather an awful aspect but privately he is a humble man enough glad of any little job and of old clothes for his many children or i believe for himself one of the two policemen is a shoemaker and cobbler his pay officially is somewhere about a guinea a week the park just now is very agreeable to look at shadowy with trees and shrubs and with glimpses of green leaves and flowergardens through the branches and twigs that line the iron fences after a shower the hawthorn blossoms are delightfully fragrant golden tassels of the laburnum are abundant i may have mentioned elsewhere the traditional prophecy that when the ivy should reach the top of bebbington spire the tower was doomed to fall it lies still therefore a chance of standing for centuries mr turner tells me that the font now used is inside of the church but the one outside is of unknown antiquity and that it was customary in papistical time to have the font without the church there is a little boy often on board the rock ferry steamer with an accordion an instrument i detest but nevertheless it becomes tolerable in his hands not so much for its music as for the earnestness and interest with which he plays it his body and the accordion together become one musical instrument on which his soul plays tunes for he sways and vibrates with the music from head to foot and throughout his frame half closing his eyes and uplifting his face as painters represent st cecilia and other famous musicians and sometimes he swings his accordion in the air as if in a perfect rapture after all my ears though not very nice are somewhat tortured by his melodies especially when confined within the cabin the boy is ten years old perhaps and rather pretty clean too and neatly dressed very unlike all other street and vagabond children whom i have seen in liverpool people give him their halfpence more readily than to any other musicians who infest the boat j the other day was describing a soldiercrab to his mother he being much interested in natural history and endeavoring to give as strong an idea as possible of its warlike characteristics and power to harm those who molest it little r sat by quietly listening and sewing and at last lifting her head she remarked i hope god did not hurt himself when he was making him leamington june st we left rock ferry and liverpool on monday the th by the rail for this place a very dim and rainy day so that we had no pleasant prospects of the country neither would the scenery along the great western railway have been in any case very striking though sunshine would have made the abundant verdure and foliage warm and genial but a railway naturally finds its way through all the common places of a country and is certainly a most unsatisfactory mode of travelling the only object being to arrive however we had a whole carriage to ourselves and the children enjoyed the earlier part of the journey very much we skirted shrewsbury and i think i saw the old tower of a church near the station perhaps the same that struck falstaffs long hour as we left the town i saw the wrekin a round pointed hill of regular shape and remembered the old toast to all friends round the wrekin as we approached birmingham the country began to look somewhat brummagemish with its manufacturing chimneys and pennons of flame quivering out of their tops its forges and great heaps of mineral refuse its smokiness and other ugly symptoms of birmingham itself we saw little or nothing except the mean and new brick lodginghouses on the outskirts of the town passing through warwick we had a glimpse of the castle an ivied wall and two turrets rising out of imbosoming foliage ones very idea of an old castle we reached leamington at a little past six and drove to the clarendon hotel a very spacious and stately house by far the most splendid hotel i have yet seen in england the landlady a courteous old lady in black showed my wife our rooms and we established ourselves in an immensely large and lofty parlor with red curtains and ponderous furniture perhaps a very little out of date the waiter brought me the book of arrivals containing the names of all visitors for from three to five years back during two years i estimated that there had been about three hundred and fifty persons only and while we were there i saw nobody but ourselves to support the great hotel among the names were those of princes earls countesses and baronets and when the people of the house heard from r s nurse that i too was a man of office and held the title of honorable in my own country they greatly regretted that i entered myself as plain mister in the book we found this hotel very comfortable and might doubtless have made it luxurious had we chosen to go to five times the expense of similar luxuries in america but we merely ordered comfortable things and so came off at no very extravagant rate and with great honor at all events in the estimation of the waiter during the afternoon we found lodgings and established ourselves in them before dark this english custom of lodgings of which we had some experience at rhyl last year has its advantages but is rather uncomfortable for strangers who in first settling themselves down find that they must undertake all the responsibility of housekeeping at an instants warming and cannot get even a cup of tea till they have made arrangements with the grocer soon however there comes a sense of being at home and by our exclusive selves which never can be attained at hotels nor boardinghouses our house is well situated and respectably furnished with the dinginess however which is inseparable from lodginghouses as if others had used these things before and would use them again after we had gone a wellenough adaptation but a lack of peculiar appropriateness and i think one puts off real enjoyment from a sense of not being truly fitted july st on friday i took the rail with j for coventry it was a bright and very warm day oppressively so indeed though i think that there is never in this english climate the pervading warmth of an american summer day the sunshine may be excessively hot but an overshadowing cloud or the shade of a tree or of a building at once affords relief and if the slightest breeze stirs you feel the latent freshness of the air coventry is some nine or ten miles from leamington the approach to it from the railway presents nothing very striking a few churchtowers and one or two tall steeples and the houses first seen are of modern and unnoticeable aspect getting into the interior of the town however you find the streets very crooked and some of them very narrow i saw one place where it seemed possible to shake hands from one jutting storied old house to another there were whole streets of the same kind of houses one story impending over another such as used to be familiar to me in salem and in some streets of boston in fact the whole aspect of the town its irregularity and continual indirectness reminded me very much of boston as i used to see it in rare visits thither when a child these coventry houses however many of them are much larger than any of similar style that i have seen elsewhere and they spread into greater bulk as they ascend by means of one story jutting over the other probably the newenglanders continued to follow this fashion of architecture after it had been abandoned in the mother country the old house built by philip english in salem dated about and it was in this style many gabled and impending here the edifices of such architecture seem to be elizabethan and of earlier date a woman in stratford told us that the rooms very low on the groundfloor grew loftier from story to story to the attic the fashion of windows in coventry is such as i have not hitherto seen in the highest story a window of the ordinary height extends along the whole breadth of the house ten fifteen perhaps twenty feet just like any other window of a commonplace house except for this inordinate width one does not easily see what the inhabitants want of so much windowlight but the fashion is very general and in modern houses or houses that have been modernized this style of window is retained thus young people who grow up amidst old people contract quaint and oldfashioned manners and aspect i imagine that these ancient towns such as chester and stratford warwick and coventry contain even a great deal more antiquity than meets the eye you see many modern fronts but if you peep or penetrate inside you find an antique arrangement old rafters intricate passages and ancient staircases which have put on merely a new outside and are likely still to prove good for the usual date of a new house they put such an immense and stalwart ponderosity into their frameworks that i suppose a house of elizabeths time if renewed has at least an equal chance of durability with one that is new in every part all the hotels in coventry so far as i noticed them are old with new fronts and they have an archway for the admission of vehicles into the courtyard and doors opening into the rooms of the building on each side of the arch maids and waiters are seen darting across the arched passage from door to door and it requires a guide in my case at least to show you the way to the coffeeroom or the bar i have never been up stairs in any of them but can conceive of infinite bewilderment of zigzag corridors between staircase and chamber it was fairday in coventry and this gave what no doubt is an unusual bustle to the streets in fact i have not seen such crowded and busy streets in any english town various kinds of merchandise being for sale in the open air and auctioneers disposing of miscellaneous wares pretty much as they do at musters and other gatherings in the united states the oratory of the american auctioneer however greatly surpasses that of the englishman in vivacity and fun but this movement and throng together with the white glow of the sun on the pavements make the scene in my recollection assume an american aspect and this is strange in so antique and quaint a town as coventry we rambled about without any definite aim but found our way i believe to most of the objects that are worth seeing st michaels church was most magnificent so old yet enduring so huge so rich with such intricate minuteness in its finish that look as long as you will at it you can always discover something new directly before your eyes i admire this in gothic architecture that you cannot master it all at once that it is not a naked outline but as deep and rich as human nature itself always revealing new ideas it is as if the builder had built himself and his age up into it and as if the edifice had life grecian temples are less interesting to me being so cold and crystalline i think this is the only church i have seen where there are any statues still left standing in the niches of the exterior walls we did not go inside the steeple of st michaels is three hundred and three feet high and no doubt the clouds often envelop the tip of the spire trinity another church with a tall spire stands near st michaels but did not attract me so much though i perhaps might have admired it equally had i seen it first or alone we certainly know nothing of churchbuilding in america and of all english things that i have seen methinks the churches disappoint me least i feel too that there is something much more wonderful in them than i have yet had time to know and experience in the course of the forenoon searching about everywhere in quest of gothic architecture we found our way into st marys hall the doors were wide open it seemed to be public there was a notice on the wall desiring visitors to give nothing to attendants for showing it and so we walked in i observed in the guidebooks that we should have obtained an order for admission from some member of the town council but we had none and found no need of it an old woman and afterwards an old man both of whom seemed to be at home on the premises told us that we might enter and troubled neither themselves nor us any further st marys hall is now the property of the corporation of coventry and seems to be the place where the mayor and council hold their meetings it was built by one of the old guilds or fraternities of merchants and tradesmen the woman shut the kitchen door when i approached so that i did not see the great fireplaces and huge cookingutensils which are said to be there whether these are ever used nowadays and whether the mayor of coventry gives such hospitable banquets as the mayor of liverpool i do not know we went to the red lion and had a luncheon of cold lamb and cold pigeonpie this is the best way of dining at english hotels to call the meal a luncheon in which case you will get as good or better a variety than if it were a dinner and at less than half the cost having lunched we again wandered about town and entered a quadrangle of gabled houses with a church and its churchyard on one side this proved to be st johns church and a part of the houses were the locality of bonds hospital for the reception of ten poor men and the remainder was devoted to the bablake school into this latter i peered with a real american intrusiveness which i never found in myself before but which i must now assume or miss a great many things which i am anxious to see running along the front of the house under the jut of the impending story there was a cloistered walk with windows opening on the quadrangle an arched oaken door with long iron hinges admitted us into a schoolroom about twenty feet square paved with brick tiles blue and red adjoining this there is a larger schoolroom which we did not enter but peeped at through one of the inner windows from the cloistered walk in the room which we entered there were seven scholars desks and an immense arched fireplace with seats on each side under the chimney on a stone slab resting on a brick pedestal the opening of the fireplace was at least twelve feet in width on one side of the room were pegs for fiftytwo boys hats and clothes and there was a boys coat of peculiar cut hanging on a peg with the number in brass upon it the coat looked ragged and shabby an old schoolbook was lying on one of the desks much tattered and without a title but it seemed to treat wholly of saints days and festivals of the church a flight of stairs with a heavy balustrade of carved oak ascended to a gallery about eight or nine feet from the lower floor which runs along two sides of the room looking down upon it the room is without a ceiling and rises into a peaked gable about twenty feet high there is a large clock in it and it is lighted by two windows each about ten feet wide one in the gallery and the other beneath it two benches or settles with backs stood one on each side of the fireplace an old woman in black passed through the room while i was making my observations and looked at me but said nothing the school was founded in by thomas whealby mayor of coventry the revenue is about pounds and admits children of the workingclasses at eleven years old clothes and provides for them and finally apprentices them for seven years we saw some of the boys playing in the quadrangle dressed in long blue coats or gowns with cloth caps on their heads i know not how the atmosphere of antiquity and massive continuance from age to age which was the charm to me in this scene of a charityschoolroom can be thrown over it in description after noting down these matters i looked into the quiet precincts of bonds hospital which no doubt was more than equally interesting but the old men were lounging about or lolling at length looking very drowsy and i had not the heart nor the face to intrude among them there is something altogether strange to an american in these charitable institutions in the preservation of antique modes and customs which is effected by them insomuch that doubtless without at all intending it the founders have succeeded in preserving a model of their own longpast age down into the midst of ours and how much later nobody can know we were now rather tired and went to the railroad intending to go home but we got into the wrong train and were carried by express with hurricane speed to bradon where we alighted and waited a good while for the return train to coventry at coventry again we had more than an hour to wait and therefore wandered wearily up into the city and took another look at its bustling streets in which there seems to be a good emblem of what england itself really is with a great deal of antiquity in it and which is now chiefly a modification of the old the new things are based and supported on the sturdy old things and often limited and impeded by them but this antiquity is so massive that there seems to be no means of getting rid of it without tearing society to pieces july d today i shall set out on my return to liverpool leaving my family here to the lakes july th i left leamington on monday shortly after twelve having been accompanied to the railway station by u and j whom i sent away before the train started while i was waiting a rather gentlemanly welltodo englishlooking man sat down by me and began to talk of the crimea of human affairs in general of god and his providence of the coming troubles of the world and of spiritualism in a strange free way for an englishman or indeed for any man it was easy to see that he was an enthusiast of some line or other he being bound for birmingham and i for rugby we soon had to part but he asked my name and told me his own which i did not much attend to and immediately forgot here follows a long account of a visit to lichfield and uttoxeter condensed in our old home july th the day after my arrival by way of lichfield and uttoxeter at liverpool the door of the consulate opened and in came the very sociable personage who accosted me at the railway station at leamington he was on his way towards edinburgh to deliver a course of lectures or a lecture and had called he said to talk with me about spiritualism being desirous of having the judgment of a sincere mind on the subject in his own mind i should suppose he is past the stage of doubt and inquiry for he told me that in every action of his life he is governed by the counsels received from the spiritual world through a medium i did not inquire whether this medium who is a small boy had suggested his visit to me my remarks to him were quite of a sceptical character in regard to the faith to which he had surrendered himself he has formerly lived in america and had had a son born there he gave me a pamphlet written by himself on the cure of consumption and other diseases by antiseptic remedies i hope he will not bore me any more though he seems to be a very sincere and good man but these enthusiasts who adopt such extravagant ideas appear to one to lack imagination instead of being misled by it as they are generally supposed to be newby bridge foot of windermere july th i left liverpool on saturday last by the london and northwestern railway for leamington spent sunday there and started on monday for the english lakes with the whole family we should not have taken this journey just now but i had an official engagement which it was convenient to combine with a pleasureexcursion the first night we arrived at chester and put up at the albion hotel where we found ourselves very comfortable we took the rail at twelve the next day and went as far as milnethorpe station where we engaged seats in an oldfashioned stagecoach and came to newby bridge i suppose there are not many of these coaches now running on any road in great britain but this appears to be the genuine machine in all respects and especially in the round ruddy coachman well moistened with ale goodnatured courteous and with a proper sense of his dignity and important position u j and i mounted atop s nurse and r got inside and we bowled off merrily towards the hearts of the hills it was more than half past nine when we arrived at newby bridge and alighted at the swan hotel where we now are it is a very agreeable place not striking as to scenery but with a pleasant rural aspect a stone bridge of five arches crosses the river severn which is the communication between windermere lake and morecambe bay close to the house which sits low and well sheltered in the lap of hills an oldfashioned inn where the landlord and his people have a simple and friendly way of dealing with their guests and yet provide them with all sorts of facilities for being comfortable they load our supper and breakfast tables with trout cold beef ham toast and muffins and give us three fair courses for dinner and excellent wine the cost of all which remains to be seen this is not one of the celebrated stations among the lakes but twice a day the stagecoach passes from milnethorpe towards ulverton and twice returns and three times a little steamer passes to and fro between our hotel and the head of the lake young ladies in broadbrimmed hats stroll about or row on the river in the light shallops of which there are abundance sportsmen sit on the benches under the windows of the hotel arranging their fishingtackle phaetons and postchaises with postilions in scarlet jackets and white breeches with one hightopped boot and the other leathered far up on the leg to guard against friction between the horses dash up to the door morning and night comes the stagecoach and we inspect the outside passengers almost face to face with us from our parlorwindows up one pair of stairs little boys and j among them spend hours on hours fishing in the clear shallow river for the perch chubs and minnows that may be seen flashing like gleams of light over the flat stones with which the bottom is paved i cannot answer for the other boys but j catches nothing there are a good many trees on the hills and roundabout and pleasant roads loitering along by the gentle riverside and it has been so sunny and warm since we came here that we shall have quite a genial recollection of the place if we leave it before the skies have time to frown the day after we came we climbed a high and pretty steep hill through a path shadowed with trees and shrubbery up to a tower from the summit of which we had a wide view of mountain scenery and the greater part of windermere this lake is a lovely little pool among the hills long and narrow beautifully indented with tiny bays and headlands and when we saw it it was one smile as broad a smile as its narrowness allowed with really brilliant sunshine all the scenery we have yet met with is in excellent taste and keeps itself within very proper bounds never getting too wild and rugged to shock the sensibilities of cultivated people as american scenery is apt to do on the rudest surface of english earth there is seen the effect of centuries of civilization so that you do not quite get at naked nature anywhere and then every point of beauty is so well known and has been described so much that one must needs look through other peoples eyes and feels as if he were seeing a picture rather than a reality man has in short entire possession of nature here and i should think young men might sometimes yearn for a fresher draught but an american likes it furness abbey yesterday july th we took a phaeton and went to furness abbey a drive of about sixteen miles passing along the course of the leam to morecambe bay and through ulverton and other villages these villages all look antique and the smallest of them generally are formed of such close contiguous clusters of houses and have such narrow and crooked streets that they give you an idea of a metropolis in miniature the houses along the road of which there are not many except in the villages are almost invariably old built of stone and covered with a light gray plaster generally they have a little flowergarden in front and often honeysuckles roses or some other sweet and pretty rustic adornment are flowering over the porch i have hardly had such images of simple quiet rustic comfort and beauty as from the look of these houses and the whole impression of our winding and undulating road bordered by hedges luxuriantly green and not too closely clipped accords with this aspect there is nothing arid in an english landscape and one cannot but fancy that the same may be true of english rural life the people look wholesome and welltodo not specimens of hard dry sunburnt muscle like our yeomen and are kind and civil to strangers sometimes making a little inclination of the head in passing miss martineau however does not seem to think well of their mental and moral condition we reached furness abbey about twelve there is a railway station close by the ruins and a new hotel stands within the precincts of the abbey grounds and continually there is the shriek the whiz the rumble the bellringing denoting the arrival of the trains and passengers alight and step at once as their choice may be into the refreshmentroom to get a glass of ale or a cigar or upon the gravelled paths of the lawn leading to the old broken walls and arches of the abbey the ruins are extensive and the enclosure of the abbey is stated to have covered a space of sixtyfive acres it is impossible to describe them the most interesting part is that which was formerly the church and which though now roofless is still surrounded by walls and retains the remnants of the pillars that formerly supported the intermingling curves of the arches the floor is all overgrown with grass strewn with fragments and capitals of pillars it was a great and stately edifice the length of the nave and choir having been nearly three hundred feet and that of the transept more than half as much the pillars along the nave were alternately a round solid one and a clustered one now what remains of some of them is even with the ground others present a stump just high enough to form a seat and others are perhaps a mans height from the ground and all are mossy and with grass and weeds rooted into their chinks and here and there a tuft of flowers giving its tender little beauty to their decay the material of the edifice is a soft red stone and it is now extensively overgrown with a lichen of a very light gray line which at a little distance makes the walls look as if they had long ago been whitewashed and now had partially returned to their original color the arches of the nave and transept were noble and immense there were four of them together supporting a tower which has long since disappeared arches loftier than i ever conceived to have been made by man very possibly in some cathedral that i have seen or am yet to see there may be arches as stately as these but i doubt whether they can ever show to such advantage in a perfect edifice as they do in this ruin most of them broken only one as far as i recollect still completing its sweep in this state they suggest a greater majesty and beauty than any finished human work can show the crumbling traces of the halfobliterated design producing somewhat of the effect of the first idea of anything admirable when it dawns upon the mind of an artist or a poet an idea which do what he may he is sure to fall short of in his attempt to embody it in the middle of the choir is a muchdilapidated monument of a crosslegged knight a crusader of course in armor very rudely executed and against the wall lie two or three more bruised and battered warriors with square helmets on their heads and visors down nothing can be uglier than these figures the sculpture of those days seems to have been far behind the architecture and yet they knew how to put a grotesque expression into the faces of their images and we saw some fantastic shapes and heads at the lower points of arches which would do to copy into punch in the chancel just at the point below where the high altar stands was the burialplace of the old barons of kendal the broken crusader perhaps represents one of them and some of their stalwart bones might be found by digging down against the wall of the choir near the vacant space where the altar was are some stone seats with canopies richly carved in stone all quite perfectly preserved where the priests used to sit at intervals during the celebration of mass conceive all these shattered walls with here and there an arched door or the great arched vacancy of a window these broken stones and monuments scattered about these rows of pillars up and down the nave these arches through which a giant might have stepped and not needed to bow his head unless in reverence to the sanctity of the place conceive it all with such verdure and embroidery of flowers as the gentle kindly moisture of the english climate procreates on all old things making them more beautiful than new conceive it with the grass for sole pavement of the long and spacious aisle and the sky above for the only roof the sky to be sure is more majestic than the tallest of those arches and yet these latter perhaps make the stronger impression of sublimity because they translate the sweep of the sky to our finite comprehension it was a most beautiful warm sunny day and the ruins had all the pictorial advantage of bright light and deep shadows i must not forget that birds flew in and out among the recesses and chirped and warbled and made themselves at home there doubtless the birds of the present generation are the posterity of those who first settled in the ruins after the reformation and perhaps the old monks of a still earlier day may have watched them building about the abbey before it was a ruin at all we had an old description of the place with us aided by which we traced out the principal part of the edifice such as the church as already mentioned and contiguous to this the chapterhouse which is better preserved than the church also the kitchen and the room where the monks met to talk and the range of wall where their cells probably were i never before had given myself the trouble to form any distinct idea of what an abbey or monastery was a place where holy rites were daily and continually to be performed with places to eat and sleep contiguous and convenient in order that the monks might always be at hand to perform those rites they lived only to worship and therefore lived under the same roof with their place of worship which of course was the principal object in the edifice and hallowed the whole of it we found too at one end of the ruins what is supposed to have been a schoolhouse for the children of the tenantry or villeins of the abbey all round this room is a bench of stone against the wall and the pedestal also of the masters seat there are likewise the ruins of the mill and the millstream which is just as new as ever it was still goes murmuring and babbling and passes under two or three old bridges consisting of a low gray arch overgrown with grass and shrubbery that stream was the most fleeting and vanishing thing about the ponderous and highpiled abbey and yet it has outlasted everything else and might still outlast another such edifice and be none the worse for wear there is not a great deal of ivy upon the walls and though an ivied wall is a beautiful object yet it is better not to have too much else it is but one wall of unbroken verdure on which you can see none of the sculptural ornaments nor any of the hieroglyphics of time a sweep of ivy here and there with the gray wall everywhere showing through makes the better picture and i think that nothing is so effective as the little bunches of flowers a mere handful that grow in spots where the seeds have been carried by the wind ages ago i have made a miserable botch of this description it is no description but merely an attempt to preserve something of the impression it made on me and in this i do not seem to have succeeded at all i liked the contrast between the sombreness of the old walls and the sunshine falling through them and gladdening the grass that floored the aisles also i liked the effect of so many idle and cheerful people strolling into the haunts of the dead monks and going babbling about and peering into the dark nooks and listening to catch some idea of what the building was from a clericallooking personage who was explaining it to a party of his friends i dont know how well acquainted this gentleman might be with the subject but he seemed anxious not to impart his knowledge too extensively and gave a pretty direct rebuff to an honest man who ventured an inquiry of him i think that the railway and the hotel within the abbey grounds add to the charm of the place a moonlight solitary visit might be very good too in its way but i believe that one great charm and beauty of antiquity is that we view it out of the midst of quite another mode of life and the more perfectly this can be done the better it can never be done more perfectly than at furness abbey which is in itself a very sombre scene and stands moreover in the midst of a melancholy valley the saxon name of which means the vale of the deadly nightshade the entrance to the stableyard of the hotel is beneath a pointed arch of saxon architecture and on one side of this stands an old building looking like a chapel but which may have been a porters lodge the abbots residence was in this quarter and the clerical personage before alluded to spoke of these as the oldest part of the ruins about half a mile on the hither side of the abbey stands the village of dalton in which is a castle built on a roman foundation and which was afterwards used by the abbots in their capacity of feudal lords as a prison the abbey was founded about by king stephen before he came to the throne and the faces of himself and of his queen are still to be seen on one of the walls we had a very agreeable drive home our drive hither had been uncomfortably sunny and hot and we stopped at ulverton to buy a pair of shoes for j and some drawingbooks and stationery as we passed through the little town in the morning it was all alive with the bustle and throng of the weekly market and though this had ceased on our return the streets still looked animated because the heat of the day drew most of the population i should imagine out of doors old men look very antiquated here in their oldfashioned coats and breeches sunning themselves by the wayside we reached home somewhere about eight oclock home i see i have called it and it seems as homelike a spot as any we have found in england the old inn close by the bridge beside the clear river pleasantly overshadowed by trees it is entirely english and like nothing that one sees in america and yet i feel as if i might have lived here a long while ago and had now come back because i retained pleasant recollections of it the children too make themselves at home j spends his time from morning to night fishing for minnows or trout and catching nothing at all and u and r have been riding between fields and barn in a haycart the roads give us beautiful walks along the riverside or wind away among the gentle hills and if we had nothing else to look at in these walks the hedges and stone fences would afford interest enough so many and pretty are the flowers roses honeysuckles and other sweet things and so abundantly does the moss and ivy grow among the old stones of the fences which would never have a single shoot of vegetation on them in america till the very end of time but here no sooner is a stone fence built than nature sets to work to make it a part of herself she adopts it and adorns it as if it were her own child a little sprig of ivy may be seen creeping up the side and clinging fast with its many feet a tuft of grass roots itself between two of the stones where a little dust from the road has been moistened into soil for it a small bunch of fern grows in another such crevice a deep soft green moss spreads itself over the top and all along the sides of the fence and wherever nothing else will grow lichens adhere to the stones and variegate their lines finally a great deal of shrubbery is sure to cluster along its extent and take away all hardness from the outline and so the whole stone fence looks as if god had had at least as much to do with it as man the trunks of the trees too exhibit a similar parasitical vegetation parasitical is an unkind phrase to bestow on this beautiful love and kindness which seems to exist here between one plant and another the strong thing being always ready to give support and sustenance and the weak thing to repay with beauty so that both are the richer as in the case of ivy and woodbine clustering up the trunk of a tall tree and adding corinthian grace to its lofty beauty mr w our landlord has lent us a splendid work with engravings illustrating the antiquities of furness abbey i gather from it that the hotel must have been rebuilt or repaired from an old manorhouse which was itself erected by a family of prestons after the reformation and was a renewal from the abbots residence much of the edifice probably as it exists now may have been part of the original one and there are basreliefs of scripture subjects sculptured in stone and fixed in the wall of the diningroom which have been there since the abbots time this author thinks that what we had supposed to be the schoolhouse on the authority of an old book was really the building for the reception of guests with its chapel he says that the tall arches in the church are sixty feet high the earl of burlington i believe is the present proprietor of the abbey the lakes july th on saturday we left newby bridge and came by steamboat up windermere lake to lowwood hotel where we now are the foot of the lake is just above newby bridge and it widens from that point but never to such a breadth that objects are not pretty distinctly visible from shore to shore the steamer stops at two or three places in the course of its voyage the principal one being bowness which has a little bustle and air of business about it proper to the principal port of the lake there are several small yachts and many skiffs rowing about the banks are everywhere beautiful and the water in one portion is strewn with islands few of which are large enough to be inhabitable but they all seem to be appropriated and kept in the neatest order as yet i have seen no wildness everything is perfectly subdued and polished and imbued with human taste except indeed the outlines of the hills which continue very much the same as god made them as we approached the head of the lake the congregation of great hills in the distance became very striking the shapes of these english mountains are certainly far more picturesque than those which i have seen in eastern america where their summits are almost invariably rounded as i remember them they are great hillocks great bunches of earth similar to one another in their developments here they have variety of shape rising into peaks falling in abrupt precipices stretching along in zigzag outlines and thus making the most of their not very gigantic masses and producing a remarkable effect we arrived at the lowwood hotel which is very near the head of the lake not long after two oclock it stands almost on the shore of windermere with only a green lawn between an extensive hotel covering a good deal of ground but low and rather villageinnlike than lofty we found the house so crowded as to afford us no very comfortable accommodations either as to parlor or sleepingrooms and we find nothing like the homefeeling into which we at once settled down at newby bridge there is a very pretty vicinity and a fine view of mountains to the northwest sitting together in a family group sometimes in full sunshine sometimes with only a golden gleam on one or two of them sometimes all in a veil of cloud from which here and there a great dusky head raises itself while you are looking at a dim obscurity nearer there are high green slopes well wooded but with such decent and wellbehaved wood as you perceive has grown up under the care of man still no wildness no ruggedness as how should there be when every halfmile or so a porters lodge or a gentlemans gateway indicates that the whole region is used up for villas on the opposite shore of the lake there is a mimic castle which i suppose i might have mistaken for a real one two years ago it is a great foolish toy of gray stone a steamboat comes to the pier as many as six times a day and stagecoaches and omnibuses stop at the door still oftener communicating with ambleside and the town of windermere and with the railway which opens london and all the world to us we get no knowledge of our fellowguests all of whom like ourselves live in their own circles and are just as remote from us as if the lake lay between the only words i have spoken since arriving here have been to my own family or to a waiter save to one or two young pedestrians who met me on a walk and asked me the distance to lowwood hotel just beyond here said i and i might stay for months without occasion to speak again yesterday forenoon j and i walked to ambleside distant barely two miles it is a little town chiefly of modern aspect built on a very uneven hillside and with very irregular streets and lanes which bewilder the stranger as much as those of a larger city many of the houses look old and are probably the cottages and farmhouses which composed the rude village a century ago but there are stuccoed shops and dwellings such as may have been built within a year or two and three hotels one of which has the look of a good old village inn and the others are fashionable or commercial establishments through the midst of the village comes tumbling and rumbling a mountain streamlet rushing through a deep rocky dell gliding under an old stone inch and turning when occasion calls the great block of a watermill this is the only very striking feature of the village the stream taking its rough pathway to the lake as it used to do before the poets had made this region fashionable in the evening just before eight oclock i took a walk alone by a road which goes up the hill back of our hotel and which i supposed might be the road to the town of windermere but it went up higher and higher and for the mile or two that it led me along winding up i saw no traces of a town but at last it turned into a valley between two high ridges leading quite away from the lake within view of which the town of windermere is situated it was a very lonely road though as smooth hard and well kept as any thoroughfare in the suburbs of a city hardly a dwelling on either side except one half barn half farmhouse and one gentlemans gateway near the beginning of the road and another more than a mile above at two or three points there were stone barns which are here built with great solidity at one place there was a painted board announcing that a field of five acres was to be sold and referring those desirous of purchasing to a solicitor in london the lake country is but a london suburb nevertheless the walk was lonely and lovely the copses and the broad hillside the glimpses of the lake the great misty company of pikes and fells beguiled me into a sense of something like solitude and the bleating of the sheep remote and near had a like tendency gaining the summit of the hill i had the best view of windermere which i have yet attained the best i should think that can be had though being towards the south it brings the softer instead of the more striking features of the landscape into view but it shows nearly the whole extent of the lake all the way from lowwood beyond newby bridge and i think there can hardly be anything more beautiful in the world the water was like a strip and gleam of sky fitly set among lovely slopes of earth it was no broader than many a river and yet you saw at once that it could be no river its outline being so different from that of a running stream not straight nor winding but stretching to one side or the other as the shores made room for it this morning it is raining and we are not very comfortable nor contented being all confined to our little parlor which has a broken window against which i have pinned the times to keep out the chill damp air u has been ill in consequence of having been overheated at newby bridge we have no books except guidebooks no means of amusement nothing to do there are no newspapers and i shall remember lowwood not very agreeably as far as we are concerned it is a scrambling illordered hotel with insufficient attendance wretched sleepingaccommodations a pretty fair table but germansilver forks and spoons our food does not taste very good and yet there is really no definite fault to be found with it since writing the above i have found the first volume of sir charles grandison and two of g p r jamess works in the coffeeroom the days pass heavily here and leave behind them a sense of having answered no very good purpose they are long enough at all events for the sun does not set till after eight oclock and rises i know not when one of the most remarkable distinctions between england and the united states is the ignorance into which we fall of whatever is going on in the world the moment we get away from the great thoroughfares and centres of life in leamington we heard no news from weeks end to weeks end and knew not where to find a newspaper and here the case is neither better nor worse the rural people really seem to take no interest in public affairs at all events they have no intelligence on such subjects it is possible that the cheap newspapers may in time find their way into the cottages or at least into the country taverns but it is not at all so now if they generally know that sebastopol is besieged it is the extent of their knowledge the public life of america is lived through the mind and heart of every man in it here the people feel that they have nothing to do with what is going forward and i suspect care little or nothing about it such things they permit to be the exclusive concern of the higher classes in front of our hotel on the lawn between us and the lake there are two trees which we have hitherto taken to be yews but on examining them more closely i find that they are pinetrees and quite dead and dry although they have the aspect of dark rich life but this is caused by the verdure of two great ivyvines which have twisted round them like gigantic snakes and clambering up and throttling the life out of them have put out branches and made crowns of thick green leaves so that at a little distance it is quite impossible not to take them for genuine trees the trunks of the ivyvines must be more than a foot in circumference and one feels they have stolen the life that belonged to the pines the dead branches of one of the pines stick out horizontally through the ivyboughs the other shows nothing but the ivy and in shape a good deal resembles a poplar when the pine trunks shall have quite crumbled away the ivystems will doubtless have gained sufficient strength to sustain themselves independently july th yesterday s went down the lake in the steamboat to take u baby and nurse to newby bridge while the three rest of us should make a tour through the lake region after mammas departure and when i had finished some letters j and i set out on a walk which finally brought us to bowness through much delightful shade of woods and past beautiful rivulets or brooklets and up and down many hills this chief harbor of the lakes seemed alive and bustling with tourists it being a sunny and pleasant day so that they were all abroad like summer insects the town is a confused and irregular little place of very uneven surface there is an old church in it and two or three large hotels we stayed there perhaps half an hour and then went to the pier where shortly a steamer arrived with music sounding on the deck of which with her back to us sat a lady in a gray travellingdress j cried out mamma mamma to which the lady deigned no notice but he repeating it she turned round and was as much surprised no doubt to see her husband and son as if this little lake had been the great ocean and we meeting each other from opposite shores of it we soon steamed back to lowwood and took a car thence for rydal and grasmere after a cold luncheon at bowness i met miss charlotte cushman who has been staying at the lowwood hotel with us since monday without either party being aware of it our road to rydal lay through ambleside which is certainly a very pretty town and looks cheerfully in a sunny day we saw miss martineaus residence called the knoll standing high up on a hillock and having at its foot a methodist chapel for which or whatever place of christian worship this good lady can have no occasion we stopped a moment in the street below her house and deliberated a little whether to call on her but concluded we would not after leaving ambleside the road winds in and out among the hills and soon brings us to a sheet or napkin rather than a sheet of water which the driver tells us is rydal lake we had already heard that it was but three quarters of a mile long and one quarter broad still it being an idea of considerable size in our minds we had inevitably drawn its ideal physical proportions on a somewhat corresponding scale it certainly did look very small and i said in my american scorn that i could carry it away easily in a porringer for it is nothing more than a grassbordered pool among the surrounding hills which ascend directly from its margin so that one might fancy it not a permanent body of water but a rather extensive accumulation of recent rain moreover it was rippled with a breeze and so as i remember it though the sun shone it looked dull and sulky like a child out of humor now the best thing these small ponds can do is to keep perfectly calm and smooth and not attempt to show off any airs of their own but content themselves with serving as a mirror for whatever of beautiful or picturesque there may be in the scenery around them the hills about rydal water are not very lofty but are sufficiently so as objects of everyday view objects to live with and they are craggier than those we have hitherto seen and bare of wood which indeed would hardly grow on some of their precipitous sides on the roadside as we reach the foot of the lake stands a spruce and rather large house of modern aspect but with several gables and much overgrown with ivy a very pretty and comfortable house built adorned and cared for with commendable taste we inquired whose it was and the coachman said it was mr wordsworths and that mrs wordsworth was still residing there so we were much delighted to have seen his abode and as we were to stay the night at grasmere about two miles farther on we determined to come back and inspect it as particularly as should be allowable accordingly after taking rooms at browns hotel we drove back in our return car and reaching the head of rydal water alighted to walk through this familiar scene of so many years of wordsworths life we ought to have seen de quinceys former residence and hartley coleridges cottage i believe on our way but were not aware of it at the time near the lake there is a stonequarry and a cavern of some extent artificially formed probably by taking out the stone above the shore of the lake not a great way from wordsworths residence there is a flight of steps hewn in a rock and ascending to a rock seat where a good view of the lake may be attained and as wordsworth has doubtless sat there hundreds of times so did we ascend and sit down and look at the hills and at the flags on the lakes shore reaching the house that had been pointed out to us as wordsworths residence we began to peer about at its front and gables and over the garden wall on both sides of the road quickening our enthusiasm as much as we could and meditating to pilfer some flower or ivyleaf from the house or its vicinity to be kept as sacred memorials at this juncture a man approached who announced himself as the gardener of the place and said too that this was not wordsworths house at all but the residence of mr ball a quaker gentleman but that his ground adjoined wordsworths and that he had liberty to take visitors through the latter how absurd it would have been if we had carried away ivyleaves and tender recollections from this domicile of a respectable quaker the gardener was an intelligent man of pleasant sociable and respectful address and as we went along he talked about the poet whom he had known and who he said was very familiar with the country people he led us through mr balls grounds up a steep hillside by winding gravelled walks with summerhouses at points favorable for them it was a very shady and pleasant spot containing about an acre of ground and all turned to good account by the manner of laying it out so that it seemed more than it really is in one place on a small smooth slab of slate let into a rock there is an inscription by wordsworth which i think i have read in his works claiming kindly regards from those who visit the spot after his departure because many trees had been spared at his intercession his own grounds or rather his ornamental garden is separated from mr balls only by a wire fence or some such barrier and the gates have no fastening so that the whole appears like one possession and doubtless was so as regarded the poets walks and enjoyments we approached by paths so winding that i hardly know how the house stands in relation to the road but after much circuity we really did see wordsworths residence an old house with an uneven ridgepole built of stone no doubt but plastered over with some neutral tint a house that would not have been remarkably pretty in itself but so delightfully situated so secluded so hedged about with shrubbery and adorned with flowers so ivygrown on one side so beautified with the personal care of him who lived in it and loved it that it seemed the very place for a poets residence and as if while he lived so long in it his poetry had manifested itself in flowers shrubbery and ivy i never smelt such a delightful fragrance of flowers as there was all through the garden in front of the house there is a circular terrace of two ascents in raising which wordsworth had himself performed much of the labor and here there are seats from which we obtained a fine view down the valley of the rothay with windermere in the distance a view of several miles and which we did not suppose could be seen after winding among the hills so far from the lake it is very beautiful and picturelike while we sat here s happened to refer to the ballad of little barbara lewthwaite and j began to repeat the poem concerning her and the gardener said that little barbara had died not a great while ago an elderly woman leaving grownup children behind her her marriagename was thompson and the gardener believed there was nothing remarkable in her character there is a summerhouse at one extremity of the grounds in deepest shadow but with glimpses of mountain views through trees which shut it in and which have spread intercepting boughs since wordsworth died it is lined with pinecones in a pretty way enough but of doubtful taste i rather wonder that people of real taste should help nature out and beautify her or perhaps rather prettify her so much as they do opening vistas showing one thing hiding another making a scene picturesque whether or no i cannot rid myself of the feeling that there is something false a kind of humbug in all this at any rate the traces of it do not contribute to my enjoyment and indeed it ought to be done so exquisitely as to leave no trace but i ought not to criticise in any way a spot which gave me so much pleasure and where it is good to think of wordsworth in quiet past days walking in his homeshadow of trees which he knew and training flowers and trimming shrubs and chanting in an undertone his own verses up and down the winding walks the gardener gave j a cone from the summerhouse which had fallen on the seat and s got some mignonette and leaves of laurel and ivy and we wended our way back to the hotel wordsworth was not the owner of this house it being the property of lady fleming mrs wordsworth still lives there and is now at home five oclock all day it has been cloudy and showery with thunder now and then the mists hang low on the surrounding hills adown which at various points we can see the snowwhite fall of little streamlets forces they call them here swollen by the rain an overcast day is not so gloomy in the hillcountry as in the lowlands there are more breaks more transfusion of skylight through the gloom as has been the case today and as i found in lenox we get better acquainted with clouds by seeing at what height they be on the hillsides and find that the difference betwixt a fair day and a cloudy and rainy one is very superficial after all nevertheless rain is rain and wets a man just as much among the mountains as anywhere else so we have been kept within doors all day till an hour or so ago when j and i went down to the village in quest of the postoffice we took a path that leads from the hotel across the fields and coming into a wood crosses the rothay by a onearched bridge and passes the village church the rothay is very swift and turbulent today and hurries along with foamspecks on its surface filling its banks from brim to brim a stream perhaps twenty feet wide perhaps more for i am willing that the good little river should have all it can fairly claim it is the st lawrence of several of these english lakes through which it flows and carries off their superfluous waters in its haste and with its rushing sound it was pleasant both to see and hear and it sweeps by one side of the old churchyard where wordsworth lies buried the side where his grave is made the church of grasmere is a very plain structure with a low body on one side of which is a small porch with a pointed arch the tower is square and looks ancient but the whole is overlaid with plaster of a buff or pale yellow hue it was originally built i suppose of rough shingly stones as many of the houses hereabouts are now and like many of them the plaster is used to give a finish we found the gate of the churchyard wide open and the grass was lying on the graves having probably been mowed yesterday it is but a small churchyard and with few monuments of any pretension in it most of them being slate headstones standing erect from the gate at which we entered a distinct foottrack leads to the corner nearest the riverside and i turned into it by a sort of instinct the more readily as i saw a touristlooking man approaching from that point and a woman looking among the gravestones both of these persons had gone by the time i came up so that j and i were left to find wordsworths grave all by ourselves at this corner of the churchyard there is a hawthorn bush or tree the extremest branches of which stretch as far as where wordsworth lies this whole corner seems to be devoted to himself and his family and friends and they all lie very closely together side by side and head to foot as room could conveniently be found hartley coleridge lies a little behind in the direction of the church his feet being towards wordsworths head who lies in the row of those of his own blood i found out hartley coleridges grave sooner than wordsworths for it is of marble and though simple enough has more of sculptured device about it having been erected as i think the inscription states by his brother and sister wordsworth has only the very simplest slab of slate with william wordsworth and nothing else upon it as i recollect it it is the midmost grave of the row it is or has been well grassgrown but the grass is quite worn away from the top though sufficiently luxuriant at the sides it looks as if people had stood upon it and so does the grave next to it which i believe is one of his children i plucked some grass and weeds from it and as he was buried within so few years they may fairly be supposed to have drawn their nutriment from his mortal remains and i gathered them from just above his head there is no fault to be found with his grave within view of the hills within sound of the river murmuring near by no fault except that he is crowded so closely with his kindred and moreover that being so old a churchyard the earth over him must all have been human once he might have had fresh earth to himself but he chose this grave deliberately no very stately and broadbased monument can ever be erected over it without infringing upon covering and overshadowing the graves not only of his family but of individuals who probably were quite disconnected with him but it is pleasant to think and know were it but on the evidence of this choice of a restingplace that he did not care for a stately monument after leaving the churchyard we wandered about in quest of the postoffice and for a long time without success this little town of grasmere seems to me as pretty a place as ever i met with in my life it is quite shut in by hills that rise up immediately around it like a neighborhood of kindly giants these hills descend steeply to the verge of the level on which the village stands and there they terminate at once the whole site of the little town being as even as a floor i call it a village but it is no village at all all the dwellings standing apart each in its own little domain and each i believe with its own little lane leading to it independently of the rest most of these are old cottages plastered white with antique porches and roses and other vines trained against them and shrubbery growing about them and some are covered with ivy there are a few edifices of more pretension and of modern build but not so strikingly so as to put the rest out of countenance the postoffice when we found it proved to be an ivied cottage with a good deal of shrubbery round it having its own pathway like the other cottages the whole looks like a real seclusion shut out from the great world by these encircling hills on the sides of which whenever they are not too steep you see the division lines of property and tokens of cultivation taking from them their pretensions to savage majesty but bringing them nearer to the heart of man since writing the above i have been again with s to see wordsworths grave and finding the door of the church open we went in a woman and little girl were sweeping at the farther end and the woman came towards us out of the cloud of dust which she had raised we were surprised at the extremely antique appearance of the church it is paved with bluishgray flagstones over which uncounted generations have trodden leaving the floor as well laid as ever the walls are very thick and the arched windows open through them at a considerable distance above the floor there is no middle aisle but first a row of pews next either wall and then an aisle on each side of the pews occupying the centre of the church then two side aisles but no middle one and down through the centre or the church runs a row of five arches very rude and roundheaded all of rough stone supported by rough and massive pillars or rather square stone blocks which stand in the pews and stood in the same places probably long before the wood of those pews began to grow above this row of arches is another row built upon the same mass of stone and almost as broad but lower and on this upper row rests the framework the oaken beams the black skeleton of the roof it is a very clumsy contrivance for supporting the roof and if it were modern we certainly should condemn it as very ugly but being the relic of a simple age it comes in well with the antique simplicity of the whole structure the roof goes up barnlike into its natural angle and all the rafters and crossbeams are visible there is an old font and in the chancel is a niche where judging from a similar one in furness abbey the holy water used to be placed for the priests use while celebrating mass around the inside of the porch is a stone bench against the wall narrow and uneasy but where a great many people had sat who now have found quieter restingplaces the woman was a very intelligentlooking person not of the usual english ruddiness but rather thin and somewhat pale though bright of aspect her way of talking was very agreeable she inquired if we wished to see wordsworths monument and at once showed it to us a slab of white marble fixed against the upper end of the central row of stone arches with a pretty long inscription and a profile bust in basrelief of his aged countenance the monument is placed directly over wordsworths pew and could best be seen and read from the very corner seat where he used to sit the pew is one of those occupying the centre of the church and is just across the aisle from the pulpit and is the best of all for the purpose of seeing and hearing the clergyman and likewise as convenient as any from its neighborhood to the altar on the other side of the aisle beneath the pulpit is lady flemings pew this and one or two others are curtained wordsworths was not i think i can bring up his image in that corner seat of his pew a whiteheaded tall spare man plain in aspect better than in any other situation the woman said that she had known him very well and that he had made some verses on a sister of hers she repeated the first lines something about a lamb but neither s nor i remembered them on the walls of the chancel there are monuments to the flemings and painted escutcheons of their arms and along the side walls also and on the square pillars of the row of arches there are other monuments generally of white marble with the letters of the inscription blackened on these pillars likewise and in many places in the walls were hung verses from scripture painted on boards at one of the doors was a poorbox an elaborately carved little box of oak with the date and the name of the church st oswalds upon it the whole interior of the edifice was plain simple almost to grimness or would have been so only that the foolish churchwardens or other authority have washed it over with the same buff color with which they have overlaid the exterior it is a pity it lightens it up and desecrates it greatly especially as the woman says that there were formerly paintings on the walls now obliterated forever i could have stayed in the old church much longer and could write much more about it but there must be an end to everything pacing it from the farther end to the elevation before the altar i found that it was twentyfive paces long on looking again at the rothay i find i did it some injustice for at the bridge in its present swollen state it is nearer twenty yards than twenty feet across its waters are very clear and it rushes along with a speed which is delightful to see after an acquaintance with the muddy and sluggish avon and leam since tea i have taken a stroll from the hotel in a different direction from heretofore and passed the swan inn where scott used to go daily to get a draught of liquor when he was visiting wordsworth who had no wine nor other inspiriting fluid in his house it stands directly on the wayside a small whitewashed house with an addition in the rear that seems to have been built since scotts time on the door is the painted sign of a swan and the name scotts swan hotel i walked a considerable distance beyond it but a shower cooling up i turned back entered the inn and following the mistress into a snug little room was served with a glass of bitter ale it is a very plain and homely inn and certainly could not have satisfied scotts wants if he had required anything very farfetched or delicate in his potations i found two westmoreland peasants in the room with ale before them one went away almost immediately but the other remained and entering into conversation with him he told me that he was going to new zealand and expected to sail in september i announced myself as an american and he said that a large party had lately gone from hereabouts to america but he seemed not to understand that there was any distinction between canada and the states these people had gone to quebec he was a very civil wellbehaved kindly sort of person of a simple character which i took to belong to the class and locality rather than to himself individually i could not very well understand all that he said owing to his provincial dialect and when he spoke to his own countrymen or to the women of the house i really could but just catch a word here and there how long it takes to melt english down into a homogeneous mass he told me that there was a public library in grasmere to which he has access in common with the other inhabitants and a readingroom connected with it where he reads the times in the evening there was no american smartness in his mind when i left the house it was showering briskly but the drops quite ceased and the clouds began to break away before i reached my hotel and i saw the new moon over my right shoulder july st we left grasmere yesterday after breakfast it being a delightful morning with some clouds but the cheerfullest sunshine on great part of the mountainsides and on ourselves we returned in the first place to ambleside along the border of grasmere lake which would be a pretty little piece of water with its steep and high surrounding hills were it not that a stubborn and straightlined stone fence running along the eastern shore by the roadside quite spoils its appearance rydal water though nothing can make a lake of it looked prettier and less diminutive than at the first view and in fact i find that it is impossible to know accurately how any prospect or other thing looks until after at least a second view which always essentially corrects the first this i think is especially true in regard to objects which we have heard much about and exercised our imagination upon the first view being a vain attempt to reconcile our idea with the reality and at the second we begin to accept the thing for what it really is wordsworths situation is really a beautiful one and nab scaur behind his house rises with a grand protecting air we passed nabs cottage in which de quincey formerly lived and where hartley coleridge lived and died it is a small bufftinted plastered stone cottage immediately on the roadside and originally i should think of a very humble class but it now looks as if persons of taste might some time or other have sat down in it and caused flowers to spring up about it it is very agreeably situated under the great precipitous hill and with rydal water close at band on the other side of the road an advertisement of lodgings to let was put up on this cottage i question whether any part of the world looks so beautiful as england this part of england at least on a fine summer morning it makes one think the more cheerfully of human life to see such a bright universal verdure such sweet rural peaceful flowerbordered cottages not cottages of gentility but dwellings of the laboring poor such nice villas along the roadside so tastefully contrived for comfort and beauty and adorned more and more year after year with the care and afterthought of people who mean to live in them a great while and feel as if their children might live in them also and so they plant trees to overshadow their walks and train ivy and all beautiful vines up against their walls and thus live for the future in another sense than we americans do and the climate helps them out and makes everything moist and green and full of tender life instead of dry and arid as human life and vegetable life is so apt to be with us certainly england can present a more attractive face than we can even in its humbler modes of life to say nothing of the beautiful lives that might be led one would think by the higher classes whose gateways with broad smooth gravelled drives leading through them one sees every mile or two along the road winding into some proud seclusion all this is passing away and society most assume new relations but there is no harm in believing that there has been something very good in english life good for all classes while the world was in a state out of which these forms naturally grew passing through ambleside our phaeton and pair turned towards ullswater which we were to reach through the pass of kirkstone this is some three or four miles from ambleside and as we approached it the road kept ascending higher and higher the hills grew more bare and the country lost its soft and delightful verdure at last the road became so steep that j and i alighted to walk this is the aspiring road that wordsworth speaks of in his ode it passes through the gorge of precipitous hills or almost precipitous too much so for even the grass to grow on many portions which are covered with gray smugly stones and i think this pass in its middle part must have looked just the same when the romans marched through it as it looks now no trees could ever have grown on the steep hillsides whereon even the english climate can generate no available soil i do not know that i have seen anything more impressive than the stern gray sweep of these naked mountains with nothing whatever to soften or adorn them the notch of the white mountains as i remember it in my youthful days is more wonderful and richly picturesque but of quite a different character about the centre and at the highest point of the pass stands an old stone building of mean appearance with the usual sign of an alehouse licensed to retail foreign spirits ale and tobacco over the door and another small sign designating it as the highest inhabitable house in england it is a chill and desolate place for a residence they keep a visitors book here and we recorded our names in it and were not too sorry to leave the mean little hovel smelling as it did of tobaccosmoke and possessing all other characteristics of the humblest alehouse on the level earth the kirkstone which gives the pass its name is not seen in approaching from ambleside until some time after you begin to descend towards brothers water when the driver first pointed it out a little way up the hill on our left it looked no more than a bowlder of a ton or two in weight among a hundred others nearly as big and i saw hardly any resemblance to a church or churchspire to which the fancies of past generations have likened it as we descended the pass however and left the stone farther and farther behind it continued to show itself and assumed a more striking and prominent aspect standing out clearly relieved against the sky so that no traveller would fail to observe it where there are so few defined objects to attract notice amid the naked monotony of the stern hills though indeed if i had taken it for any sort of an edifice it would rather have been for a wayside inn or a shepherds hut than for a church we lost sight of it and again beheld it more and more brought out against the sky by the turns of the road several times in the course of our descent there is a very fine view of brothers water shut in by steep hills as we go down kirkstone pass at about half past twelve we reached patterdale at the foot of ullswater and here took luncheon the hotels are mostly very good all through this region and this deserved that character a blackcoated waiter of more gentlemanly appearance than most englishmen yet taking a sixpence with as little scruple as a lawyer would take his fee the mistress in ladylike attire receiving us at the door and waiting upon us to the carriagesteps clean comely housemaids everywhere at hand all appliances in short for being comfortable and comfortable too within ones own circle and on taking leave everybody who has done anything for you or who might by possibility have done anything is to be feed you pay the landlord enough in all conscience and then you pay all his servants who have been your servants for the time but to say the truth there is a degree of the same kind of annoyance in an american hotel although it is not so much an acknowledged custom here in the houses where attendance is not charged in the bill no wages are paid by the host to those servants chambermaid waiter and boots who come into immediate contact with travellers the drivers of the cars phaetons and flys are likewise unpaid except by their passengers and claim threepence a mile with the same sense of right as their masters in charging for the vehicles and horses when you come to understand this claim not as an appeal to your generosity but as an actual and necessary part of the cost of the journey it is yielded to with a more comfortable feeling and the traveller has really option enough as to the amount which he will give to insure civility and good behavior on the drivers part ullswater is a beautiful lake with steep hills walling it about so steep on the eastern side that there seems hardly room for a road to run along the base we passed up the western shore and turned off from it about midway to take the road towards keswick we stopped however at lyulphs tower while our chariot went on up a hill and took a guide to show us the way to airey force a small cataract which is claimed as private property and out of which no doubt a pretty little revenue is raised i do not think that there can be any rightful appropriation as private property of objects of natural beauty the fruits of the land and whatever human labor can produce from it belong fairly enough to the person who has a deed or a lease but the beautiful is the property of him who can hive it and enjoy it it is very unsatisfactory to think of a cataract under lock and key however we were shown to airey force by a tall and graceful mountainmaid with a healthy cheek and a step that had no possibility of weariness in it the cascade is an irregular streak of foamy water pouring adown a rude shadowy glen i liked well enough to see it but it is wearisome on the whole to go the rounds of what everybody thinks it necessary to see it makes me a little ashamed it is somewhat as if we were drinking out of the same glass and eating from the same dish as a multitude of other people within a few miles of keswick we passed along at the foot of saddleback and by the entrance of the vale of st john and down the valley on one of the slopes we saw the enchanted castle thence we drove along by the course of the greta and soon arrived at keswick which lies at the base of skiddaw and among a brotherhood of picturesque eminences and is itself a compact little town with a markethouse built of the old stones of the earl of derwentwaters ruined castle standing in the centre the principal street forking into two as it passes it we alighted at the kings arms and went in search of southeys residence which we found easily enough as it lies just on the outskirts of the town we inquired of a group of people two of whom i thought did not seem to know much about the matter but the third an elderly man pointed it out at once a house surrounded by trees so as to be seen only partially and standing on a little eminence a hundred yards or so from the road we went up a private lane that led to the rear of the place and so penetrated quite into the backyard without meeting anybody passing a small kennel in which were two hounds who gazed at us but neither growled nor wagged their tails the house is three stories high and seems to have a great deal of room in it so as not to discredit its name greta hall a very spacious dwelling for a poet the windows were nearly all closed there were no signs of occupancy but a general air of neglect s who is bolder than i in these matters ventured through what seemed a back garden gate and i soon heard her in conversation with some man who now presented himself and proved to be a gardener he said he had formerly acted in that capacity for southey although a gardener had not been kept by him as a regular part of his establishment this was an old man with an odd crookedness of legs and strange disjointed limp s had told him that we were americans and he took the idea that we had come this long distance over sea and land with the sole purpose of seeing southeys residence so that he was inclined to do what he could towards exhibiting it this was but little the present occupant a mr radday i believe the gardener called him being away and the house shut up but he showed us about the grounds and allowed us to peep into the windows of what had been southeys library and into those of another of the front apartments and showed us the window of the chamber in the rear in which southey died the apartments into which we peeped looked rather small and low not particularly so but enough to indicate an old building they are now handsomely furnished and we saw over one of the fireplaces an inscription about southey and in the corner of the same room stood a suit of bright armor it is taller than the countryhouses of english gentlemen usually are and it is even stately all about in front beside it and behind there is a great profusion of trees most of which were planted by southey who came to live here more than fifty years ago and they have of course grown much more shadowy now than he ever beheld them for he died about fourteen years since the grounds are well laid out and neatly kept with the usual lawn and gravelled walks and quaint little devices in the ornamental way these may be of later date than southeys time the gardener spoke respectfully of southey and of his first wife and observed that it was a great loss to the neighborhood when that family went down the house stands directly above the greta the murmur of which is audible all about it for the greta is a swift little river and goes on its way with a continual sound which has both depth and breadth the gardener led us to a walk along its banks close by the hall where he said southey used to walk for hours and hours together he might indeed get there from his study in a moment there are two paths one above the other well laid out on the steep declivity of the high bank and there is such a very thick shade of oaks and elms planted by southey himself over the bank that all the ground and grass were moist although it had been a sunny day it is a very sombre walk not many glimpses of the sky through those dense boughs the greta is here perhaps twenty yards across and very dark of hue and its voice is melancholy and very suggestive of musings and reveries but i should question whether it were favorable to any settled scheme of thought the gardener told us that there used to be a pebbly beach on the margin of the river and that it was southeys habit to sit and write there using a tree of peculiar shape for a table an alteration in the current of the river has swept away the beach and the tree too has fallen all these things were interesting to me although southey was not i think a picturesque man not one whose personal character takes a strong hold on the imagination in these walks he used to wear a pair of shoes heavily clamped with iron very ponderous they must have been from the particularity with which the gardener mentioned them the gardener took leave of us at the front entrance of the grounds and returning to the kings arms we ordered a onehorse fly for the fall of lodore our drive thither was along the banks of derwentwater and it is as beautiful a road i imagine as can be found in england or anywhere else i like derwentwater the best of all the lakes so far as i have yet seen them skiddaw lies at the head of a long even ridge of mountains rising into several peaks and one higher than the rest on the eastern side there are many noble eminences and on the west along which we drove there is a part of the way a lovely wood and nearly the whole distance a precipitous range of lofty cliffs descending sheer down without any slope except what has been formed in the lapse of ages by the fall of fragments and the washing down of smaller stones the declivity thus formed along the base of the cliffs is in some places covered with trees or shrubs elsewhere it is quite bare and barren the precipitous parts of the cliffs are very grand the whole scene indeed might be characterized as one of stern grandeur with an embroidery of rich beauty without lauding it too much all the sternness of it is softened by vegetative beauty wherever it can possibly be thrown in and there is not here so strongly as along windermere evidence that human art has been helping out nature i wish it were possible to give any idea of the shapes of the hills with these at least man has nothing to do nor ever will have anything to do as we approached the bottom of the lake and of the beautiful valley in which it lies we saw one hill that seemed to crouch down like a titanic watchdog with its rear towards the spectator guarding the entrance to the valley the great superiority of these mountains over those of new england is their variety and definiteness of shape besides the abundance everywhere of water prospects which are wanting among our own hills they rise up decidedly and each is a hill by itself while ours mingle into one another and besides have such large bases that you can tell neither where they begin nor where they end many of these cumberland mountains have a marked vertebral shape so that they often look like a group of huge lions lying down with their backs turned toward each other they slope down steeply from narrow ridges hence their picturesque seclusions of valleys and dales which subdivide the lake region into so many communities our hills like appledumplings in a dish have no such valleys as these there is a good inn at lodore a small primitive country inn which has latterly been enlarged and otherwise adapted to meet the convenience of the guests brought thither by the fame of the cascade but it is still a country inn though it takes upon itself the title of hotel we found pleasant rooms here and established ourselves for the night from this point we have a view of the beautiful lake and of skiddaw at the head of it the cascade is within three or four minutes walk through the garden gate towards the cliff at the base of which the inn stands the visitor would need no other guide than its own voice which is said to be audible sometimes at the distance of four miles as we were coming from keswick we caught glimpses of its white foam high up the precipice and it is only glimpses that can be caught anywhere because there is no regular sheet of falling water once i think it must have fallen abruptly over the edge of the long line of precipice that here extends along parallel with the shore of the lake but in the course of time it has gnawed and sawed its way into the heart of the cliff this persistent little stream so that now it has formed a rude gorge adown which it hurries and tumbles in the wildest way over the roughest imaginable staircase standing at the bottom of the fall you have a far vista sloping upward to the sky with the water everywhere as white as snow pouring and pouring down now on one side of the gorge now on the other among immense bowlders which try to choke its passage it does not attempt to leap over these huge rocks but finds its way in and out among then and finally gets to the bottom after a hundred tumbles it cannot be better described than in southeys verses though it is worthy of better poetry than that after all i do not know that the cascade is anything more than a beautiful fringe to the grandeur of the scene for it is very grand this fissure through the cliff with a steep lofty precipice on the right hand sheer up and down and on the other hand too another lofty precipice with a slope of its own ruin on which trees and shrubbery have grown the righthand precipice however has shelves affording sufficient hold for small trees but nowhere does it slant if it were not for the white little stream falling gently downward and for the soft verdure upon either precipice and even along the very pathway of the cascade it would be a very stern vista up that gorge i shall not try to describe it any more it has not been praised too much though it may have been praised amiss i went thither again in the morning and climbed a good way up through the midst of its rocky descent and i think i could have reached the top in this way it is remarkable that the bounds of the water from one step of its broken staircase to another give an impression of softness and gentleness but there are black turbulent pools among the great bowlders where the stream seems angry at the difficulties which it meets with looking upward in the sunshine i could see a rising mist and i should not wonder if a speck of rainbow were sometimes visible i noticed a small oak in the bed of the cascade and there is a lighter vegetation scattered about at noon we took a car for portinscale and drove back along the road to keswick through which we passed stopping to get a perhaps of letters at the postoffice and reached portinscale which is a mile from keswick after dinner we walked over a bridge and through a green lane to the church where southey is buried it is a white church of norman architecture with a low square tower as we approached we saw two persons entering the portal and following them in we found the sexton who was a tall thin old man with white hair and an intelligent reverent face showing the edifice to a stout redfaced selfimportant goodnatured john bull of a gentleman without any question on our part the old sexton immediately led us to southeys monument which is placed in a side aisle where there is not breadth for it to stand free of the wall neither is it in a very good light but it seemed to me a good work of art a recumbent figure of white marble on a couch the drapery of which he has drawn about him being quite enveloped in what may be a shroud the sculptor has not intended to represent death for the figure lies on its side and has a book in its hand and the face is lifelike and looks full of expression a thin highfeatured poetic face with a finely proportioned head and abundant hair it represents southey rightly at whatever age he died in the full maturity of manhood when he was strongest and richest i liked the statue and wished that it lay in a broader aisle or in the chancel where there is an old tomb of a knight and lady of the ratcliffe family who have held the place of honor long enough to yield it now to a poet southeys sculptor was lough i must not forget to mention that john bull climbing on a bench to get a better view of the statue tumbled off with a racket that resounded irreverently through the church the old whiteheaded thin sexton was a model man of his class and appeared to take a loving and cheerful interest in the building and in those who from age to age have worshipped and been buried there it is a very ancient and interesting church within a few years it has been thoroughly repaired as to the interior and now looks as if it might endure ten more centuries and i suppose we see little that is really ancient except the double row of norman arches of light freestone that support the oaken beams and rafters of the roof all the walls however are venerable and quite preserve the identity of the edifice there is a stainedglass window of modern manufacture and in one of the side windows set amidst plain glass there is a single piece five hundred years old representing st anthony very finely executed though it looks a little faded along the walls on each side between the arched windows there are marble slabs affixed with inscriptions to the memories of those who used to occupy the seats beneath i remember none of great antiquity nor any old monument except that in the chancel over the knight and lady of the ratcliffe family this consists of a slab of stone on four small stone pillars about two feet high the slab is inlaid with a brass plate on which is sculptured the knight in armor and the lady in the costume of elizabeths time exceedingly well done and well preserved and each figure about eighteen inches in length the sexton showed us a rubbing of them on paper under the slab which supported by the low stone pillars forms a canopy for them lie two sculptured figures of stone of life size and at full length representing the same persons but i think the sculptor was hardly equal in his art to the engraver the mostcurious antique relic in the church is the font the bowl is very capacious sufficiently so to admit of the complete immersion of a child of two or three months old on the outside in several compartments there are basreliefs of scriptural and symbolic subjects such as the tree of life the word proceeding out of gods mouth the crown of thorns all in the quaintest taste sculptured by some hand of a thousand years ago and preserving the fancies of monkish brains in stone the sexton was very proud of this font and its sculpture and took a kindly personal interest in showing it and when we had spent as much time as we could inside he led us to southeys grave in the churchyard he told us that he had known southey long and well from early manhood to old age for he was only twentynine when he came to keswick to reside he had known wordsworth too and coleridge and lovell and he had seen southey and wordsworth walking arm in arm together in that churchyard he seemed to revere southeys memory and said that he had been much lamented and that as many as a hundred people came to the churchyard when he was buried he spoke with great praise of mrs southey his first wife telling of her charity to the poor and how she was a blessing to the neighborhood but he said nothing in favor of the second mrs southey and only mentioned her selling the library and other things after her husbands death and going to london yet i think she was probably a good woman and meets with less than justice because she took the place of another good woman and had not time and opportunity to prove herself as good as for southey himself my idea is that few better or more blameless men have ever lived but he seems to lack color passion warmth or something that should enable me to bring him into close relation with myself the graveyard where his body lies is not so rural and picturesque as that where wordsworth is buried although skiddaw rises behind it and the greta is murmuring at no very great distance away but the spot itself has a somewhat bare and bold aspect with no shadow of trees no shrubbery over his grave there is a ponderous oblong block of slate a native mineral of this region as hard as iron and which will doubtless last quite as long as southeys works retain any vitality in english literature it is not a monument fit for a poet there is nothing airy or graceful about it and indeed there cannot he many men so solid and matteroffact as to deserve a tomb like that wordsworths grave is much better with only a simple headstone and the grass growing over his mortality which for a thousand years at least it never can over southeys most of the monuments are of this same black slate and some erect headstones are curiously sculptured and seem to have been recently erected we now returned to the hotel and took a car for the valley of st john the sky seemed to portend rain in no long time and skiddaw had put on his cap but the people of the hotel and the driver said that there would be no rain this afternoon and their opinion proved correct after driving a few miles we again cane within sight of the enchanted castle it stands rather more than midway adown the declivity of one of the ridges that form the valley to the left as you go southward and its site would have been a good one for a fortress intended to defend the lower entrance of this mountain defile at a proper distance it looks not unlike the gray dilapidation of a gothic castle which has been crumbling and crumbling away for ages until time might be supposed to have imperceptibly stolen its massive pile from man and given it back to nature its towers and battlements and arched entrances being so much defaced and decayed that all the marks of human labor had nearly been obliterated and the angles of the hewn stone rounded away while mosses and weeds and bushes grow over it as freely as over a natural ledge of rocks it is conceivable that in some lights and in some states of the atmosphere a traveller at the entrance of the valley might really imagine that he beheld a castle here but for myself i must acknowledge that it required a willing fancy to make me see it as we drew nearer the delusion did not immediately grow less strong but at length we found ourselves passing at the foot of the declivity and behold it was nothing but an enormous ledge of rock coming squarely out of the hillside with other parts of the ledge cropping out in its vicinity looking back after passing we saw a knoll or hillock of which the castled rock is the bare face there are two or three stone cottages along the roadside beneath the magic castle and within the enchanted ground scott in the bridal of triermain locates the castle in the middle of the valley and makes king arthur ride around it which any mortal would have great difficulty in doing this vale of st john has very striking scenery blencathra shuts it in to the northward lying right across the entrance and on either side there are lofty crags and declivities those to the west being more broken and better wooded than the ridge to the eastward which stretches along for several miles steep high and bare producing only grass enough for sheep pasture until it rises into the dark brow of helvellyn adown this ridge seen afar like a white ribbon comes here and there a cascade sending its voice before it which distance robs of all its fury and makes it the quietest sound in the world and while you see the foamy leap of its upper course a mile or two away you may see and hear the selfsame little brook babbling through a field and passing under the arch of a rustic bridge beneath your feet it is a deep seclusion with mountains and crags on all sides about a mile beyond the castle we stopped at a little wayside inn the kings head and put up for the night this i believe is the only inn which i have found in england the only one where i have eaten and slept that does not call itself a hotel it is very primitive in its arrangements a long low whitewashed unadorned and ugly cottage of two stories at one extremity is a barn and cowhouse and next to these the part devoted to the better class of guests where we had our parlor and chambers contiguous to which is the kitchen and common room paved with flagstones and lastly another barn and stable all which departments are not under separate roofs but under the same long contiguity and forming the same building our parlor opens immediately upon the roadside without any vestibule the house appears to be of some antiquity with beams across the low ceilings but the people made us pretty comfortable at bed and board and fed us with ham and eggs vealsteaks honey oatcakes gooseberrytarts and such cates and dainties making a moderate charge for all the parlor was adorned with rude engravings i remember only a plate of the duke of wellington at three stages of his life and there were minerals delved doubtless out of the hearts of the mountains upon the mantelpiece the chairs were of an antiquated fashion and had very capacious seats we were waited upon by two women who looked and acted not unlike the countryfolk of new england say of new hampshire except that these may have been more deferential while we remained here i took various walks to get a glimpse of helvellyn and a view of thirlmere which is rather two lakes than one being so narrow at one point as to be crossed by a footbridge its shores are very picturesque coming down abruptly upon it and broken into crags and prominences which view their shaggy faces in its mirror and helvellyn slopes steeply upward from its southern shore into the clouds on its eastern bank near the footbridge stands armboth house which miss martineau says is haunted and i saw a painted board at the entrance of the road which leads to it advertising lodgings there the ghosts of course pay nothing for their accommodations at noon on the day after our arrival j and i went to visit the enchanted castle and we were so venturesome as to turn aside from the road and ascend the declivity towards its walls which indeed we hoped to surmount it proved a very difficult undertaking the site of the fortress being much higher and steeper than we had supposed but we did clamber upon what we took for the most elevated portion when lo we found that we had only taken one of the outworks and that there was a gorge of the hill betwixt us and the main walls while the citadel rose high above at more than twice the elevation which we had climbed j wished to go on and i allowed him to climb till he appeared to have reached so steep and lofty a height that he looked hardly bigger than a monkey and i should not at all have wondered had he come rolling down to the base of the rock where i sat but neither did he get actually within the castle though he might have done so but for a high stone fence too difficult for him to climb which runs from the rock along the hillside the sheep probably go thither much oftener than any other living thing and to them we left the castle of st john with a shrub waving from its battlements instead of a banner after dinner we ordered a car for ambleside and while it was getting ready i went to look at the river of st john which indeed flows close beside our inn only just across the road though it might well be overlooked unless you specially sought for it it is a brook brawling over the stones very much as brooks do in new england only we never think of calling them rivers there i could easily have made a leap from shore to shore and j scrambled across on no better footing than a rail i believe i have complained of the want of brooks in other parts of england but there is no want of them here and they are always interesting being of what size they may we drove down the valley and gazed at the vast slope of helvellyn and at thirlmere beneath it and at eagles crag and ravens crag which beheld themselves in it and we cast many a look behind at blencathra and that noble brotherhood of mountains out of the midst of which we came but to say the truth i was weary of fine scenery and it seemed to me that i had eaten a score of mountains and quaffed as many lakes all in the space of two or three days and the natural consequence was a surfeit there was scarcely a single place in all our tour where i should not have been glad to spend a month but by flitting so quickly from one point to another i lost all the more recondite beauties and had come away without retaining even the surface of much that i had seen i am slow to feel slow i suppose to comprehend and like the anaconda i need to lubricate any object a great deal before i can swallow it and actually make it my own yet i shall always enjoy having made this journey and shall wonder the more at england which comprehends so much such a rich variety within its narrow bounds if england were all the world it still would have been worth while for the creator to have made it and mankind would have had no cause to find fault with their abode except that there is not room enough for so many as might be happy here we left the great inverted arch of the valley behind us looking back as long as we could at blencathra and skiddaw over its shoulder and the clouds were gathering over them at our last glimpse passing by dummail raise which is a mound of stones over an old british king we entered westmoreland and soon had the vale of grasmere before us with the church where wordsworth lies and nab scaur and rydal water farther on at ambleside we took another car for newby bridge whither we drove along the eastern shore of windermere the superb scenery through which we had been passing made what we now saw look tame although a week ago we should have thought it more than commonly interesting hawkshead is the only village on our road a small whitewashed old town with a whitewashed old norman church low and with a low tower on the same pattern with others that we have seen hereabouts it was between seven and eight oclock when we reached newby bridge and heard us voice greeting us and saw her head crowned with a wreath of flowers looking down at us out of the window of our parlor and today july d i have written this most incomplete and unsatisfactory record of what we have done and seen since wednesday last i am pretty well convinced that all attempts at describing scenery especially mountain scenery are sheer nonsense for one thing the point of view being changed the whole description which you made up from the previous point of view is immediately falsified and when you have done your utmost such items as those setting forth the scene in a play a mountainous country in the distance a cascade tumbling over a precipice and in front a lake on one side an ivycovered cottage this dry detail brings the matter before ones minds eyes more effectually than all the art of wordpainting july th we are still at newby bridge and nothing has occurred of remarkable interest nor have we made any excursions beyond moderate walks two days have been rainy and today there is more rain we find such weather as tolerable here as it would probably be anywhere but it passes rather heavily with the children and for myself i should prefer sunshine though mr whites books afford me some entertainment especially an odd volume of ben jonsons plays containing volpone the alchemist bartholomew fair and others the alchemist is certainly a great play we watch all arrivals and other events from our parlor window a stagecoach driving up four times in the twentyfour hours with its forlorn outsiders all saturated with rain the steamer from the head of the lake landing a crowd of passengers who stroll up to the hotel drink a glass of ale lean over the parapet of the bridge gaze at the flat stones which pave the bottom of the liver and then hurry back to the steamer again cars phaetons horsemen all damped and disconsolate there are a number of young men staying at the hotel some of whom go forth in all the rain fishing and come back at nightfall trudging heavily but with creels on their backs that do not seem very heavy yesterday was fair and enlivened us a good deal returning from a walk in the forenoon i found a troop of yeomanry cavalry in the stableyard of the hotel they were the north lancashire regiment and were on their way to liverpool for the purpose of drill not being old campaigners their uniforms and accoutrements were in so much the finer order all bright and looking spannew and they themselves were a body of handsome and stalwart young men and it was pleasant to look at their helmets and red jackets and carbines and steel scabbarded swords and gallant steeds all so martial in aspect and to know that they were only playsoldiers after all and were never likely to do nor suffer any warlike mischief by and by their bugles sounded and they trotted away wheeling over the ivygrown stone bridge and disappearing behind the trees on the milnethorpe road our host comes forth from the bar with a bill which he presents to an orderlysergeant he the host then tells me that he himself once rode many years a trooper in this regiment and that all his comrades were larger men than himself yet mr thomas white is a goodsized man and now at all events rather overweight for a dragoon yesterday came one of those bands of music that seem to itinerate everywhere about the country it consisted of a young woman who played the harp a bassviol player a fiddler a flutist and a bugler besides a little child of whom i suppose the woman was the mother they sat down on a bench by the roadside opposite the house and played several tunes and by and by the waiter brought them a large pitcher of ale which they quaffed with apparent satisfaction though they seemed to be foreigners by their mustachios and sallow hue and would perhaps have preferred a vinous potation one would like to follow these people through their vagrant life and see them in their social relations and overhear their talk with each other all vagrants are interesting and there is a much greater variety of them here than in america people who cast themselves on fortune and take whatever she gives without a certainty of anything i saw a travelling tinker yesterday a man with a leather apron and a string of skewers hung at his girdle and a pack over his shoulders in which no doubt were his tools and materials of trade it is remarkable what a natural interest everybody feels in fishing an angler from the bridge immediately attracts a group to watch his luck it is the same with j fishing for minnows on the platform near which the steamer lands its passengers by the by u caught a minnow last evening and immediately after a goodsized perch her first fish july th we left newby bridge all of us on saturday at twelve oclock and steamed up the lake to ambleside a pretty good day as to weather but with a little tendency to shower there was nothing new on the lake and no new impressions as far as i can remember at ambleside s and nurse went shopping after which we took a carriage for grasmere and established ourselves at browns hotel i find that my impressions from our previous sight of all these scenes do not change on revision they are very beautiful but if i must say it i am a little weary of them we soon tire of things which we visit merely by way of spectacle and with which we have no real and permanent connection in such cases we very quickly wish the spectacle to be taken away and another substituted at all events i do not care about seeing anything more of the english lakes for at least a year perhaps a part of my weariness is owing to the hotellife which we lead at an english hotel the traveller feels as if everybody from the landlord downward united in a joint and individual purpose to fleece him because all the attendants who come in contact with him are to be separately considered so after paying in the first instance a very heavy bill for what would seem to cover the whole indebtedness there remain divers dues still to be paid to no trifling amount to the landlords servants dues not to be ascertained and which you never can know whether you have properly satisfied you can know perhaps when you have less than satisfied them by the aspect of the waiter which i wish i could describe not disrespectful in the slightest degree but a look of profound surprise a gaze at the offered coin which he nevertheless pockets as if he either did not see it or did not know it or could not believe his eyesight all this however with the most quiet forbearance a christianlike nonrecognition of an unmerited wrong and insult and finally all in a moments space indeed he quits you and goes about his other business if you have given him too much you are made sensible of your folly by the extra amount of his gratitude and the bows with which he salutes you from the doorstep generally you cannot very decidedly say whether you have been right or wrong but in almost all cases you decidedly feel that you have been fleeced then the living at the best of english hotels so far as my travels have brought me acquainted with them deserves but moderate praise and is especially lacking in variety nothing but joints joints joints sometimes perhaps a meatpie which if you eat it weighs upon your conscience with the idea that you have eaten the scraps of other peoples dinners at the lake hotels the fare is lamb and mutton and grout the latter not always fresh and soon tired of we pay like nabobs and are expected to be content with plain mutton we spent the day yesterday at grasmere in quiet walks about the hotel and at a little past six in the afternoon i took my departure in the stagecoach for windermere the coach was greatly overburdened with outside passengers fifteen in all besides the four insiders and one of the fifteen formed the apex of an immense pile of luggage on the top it seems to me miraculous that we did not topple over the road being so hilly and uneven and the driver i suspect none the steadier for his visits to all the taprooms along the route from cockermouth there was a tremendous vibration of the coach now and then and i saw that in case of our going over i should be flung headlong against the high stone fence that bordered most of the road in view of this i determined to muffle my head in the folds of my thick shawl at the moment of overturn and as i could do no better for myself i awaited my fate with equanimity as far as apprehension goes i had rather travel from maine to georgia by rail than from grasmere to windermere by stagecoach at lowwood the landlady espied me from the window and sent out a large packet that had arrived by mail but as it was addressed to some person of the christian name of william i did not venture to open it she said also that a gentleman had been there who very earnestly desired to see me and i have since had reason to suppose that this was allingham the poet we arrived at windermere at half past seven and waited nearly an hour for the train to start i took a ticket for lancaster and talked there about the war with a gentleman in the coffeeroom who took me for an englishman as most people do nowadays and i heard from him as you may from all his countrymen an expression of weariness and dissatisfaction with the whole business these fickle islanders how differently they talked a year ago john bull sees now that he never was in a worse predicament in his life and yet it would not take much to make him roar as bellicosely as ever i went to bed at eleven and slept unquietly on feathers i had purposed to rise betimes and see the town of lancaster before breakfast but here i reckoned without my host for in the first place i had no water for my ablutions and my boots were not brushed and so i could not get down stairs till the hour i named for my coffee and chops and secondly the breakfast was delayed half an hour though promised every minute in fine i had but just time to take a hasty walk round lancaster castle and see what i could of the town on my way a not very remarkable town built of stone with taller houses than in the middle shires of england narrow streets up and down an eminence on which the castle is situated with the town immediately about it the castle is a satisfactory edifice but so renovated that the walls look almost entirely modern with the exception of the fine old front with the statue of an armed warrior very likely john of gaunt himself in a niche over the norman arch of the entrance close beside the castle stands an old church the train left lancaster at half past nine and reached liverpool at twelve over as flat and uninteresting a country as i ever travelled i have betaken myself to the rock ferry hotel where i am as comfortable as i could be anywhere but at home but it is rather comfortless to think of hone as three years off and three thousand miles away with what a sense of utter weariness not fully realized till then we shall sink down on our own threshold when we reach it the moral effect of being without a settled abode is very wearisome our coachman from grasmere to windermere looked like a great beerbarrel oozy with his proper liquor i suppose such solid soakers never get upset the launch august d mrhas urged me very much to go with his father and family to see the launch of a great ship which has been built for their house and afterwards to partake of a picnic so on tuesday morning i presented myself at the landingstage and met the party to take passage for chester it was a showery morning and looked wofully like a rainy day but nothing better is to be expected in england and after all there is seldom such a day that you cannot glide about pretty securely between the drops of rain this however did not turn out one of those tolerable days but grew darker and darker and worse and worse and was worst of all when we had passed about six miles beyond chester and were just on the borders of wales on the hither side of the river dee where the ship was to be launched here the train stopped and absolutely deposited our whole party of excursionists under a heavy shower in the midst of a muddy potatofield whence we were to wade through mud and mire to the shipyard almost half a mile off some kind christian i know not whom gave me half of his umbrella and half of his cloak and thereby i got to a shed near the ship without being entirely soaked through the ship had been built on the banks of the dee at a spot where it is too narrow for her to be launched directly across and so she lay lengthwise of the river and was so arranged as to take the water parallel with the stream she is for aught i know the largest ship in the world at any rate longer than the great britain an ironscrew steamer and looked immense and magnificent and was gorgeously dressed out in flags had it been a pleasant day all chester and half wales would have been there to see the launch and in spite of the rain there were a good many people on the opposite shore as well as on our side and one or two booths and many of the characteristics of a fair that is to say men and women getting intoxicated without any great noise and confusion the ship was expected to go off at about twelve oclock and at that juncture all mr s friends assembled under the bows of the ship where we were a little sheltered from the rain by the projection of that part of the vessel over our heads the bottle of portwine with which she was to be christened was suspended from the bows to the platform where we stood by a blue ribbon and the ceremony was to be performed by mrs who i could see was very nervous in anticipation of the ceremony mrkept giving her instructions in a whisper and showing her how to throw the bottle and as the critical moment approached he took hold of it along with her all this time we were waiting in momentary expectation of the ship going off everything being ready and only the touch of a spring as it were needed to make her slide into the water but the chief manager kept delaying a little longer and a little longer though the pilot on board sent to tell him that it was time she was off yes yes but i want as much water as i can get answered the manager and so he held on till i suppose the tide had raised the river dee to its very acme of height at last the word was given the ship began slowly to move mrsthrew the bottle against the bow with a spasmodic effort that dashed it into a thousand pieces and diffused the fragrance of the old port all around where it lingered several minutes i did not think that there could have been such a breathless moment in an affair of this kind the ship moved majestically down toward the river and unless it were niagara i never saw anything grander and more impressive than the motion of this mighty mass as she departed from us we on the platform and everybody along both shores of the dee took off our hats in the rain waved handkerchiefs cheered shouted beautiful what a noble launch never was so fair a sight and really it was so grand that calm majestic movement that i felt the tears come into my eyes the wooden pathway adown which she was gliding began to smoke with the friction when all at once when we expected to see her plunge into the dee she came to a full stop mr the father of my friend a gentleman with white hair a dark expressive face bright eyes and an oriental cast of features immediately took the alarm a moment before his countenance had been kindled with triumph but now he turned pale as death and seemed to grow ten years older while i was looking at him well he might for his noble ship was stuck fast in the land of the dee and without deepening the bed of the river i do not see how her vast iron hulk is ever to be got out this steamer was afterwards successfully floated off on the th of the same month there was no help for it a steamboat was hitched on to the stranded vessel but broke two or three cables without stirring her an inch so after waiting long after we had given up all hope we went to the office of the shipyard and there took a lunch and still the rain was pouring pouring pouring and i never experienced a blacker affair in all my days then we had to wait a great while for a train to take us back so that it was almost five oclock before we arrived at chester where i spent an hour in rambling about the old town under the rows and on the walls looking down on the treetops directly under my feet and through their thick branches at the canal which creeps at the base and at the cathedral walking under the dark intertwining arches of the cloisters and looking up at the great cathedral tower so wasted away externally by time and weather that it looks save for the difference of color between white snow and red freestone like a structure of snow half dissolved by several warm days at the lunch i met with a graduate of cambridge england tutor of a grandson of percival with his pupil percival the assassinated minister i mean i should not like this position of tutor to a young englishman it certainly has an ugly twang of upper servitude i observed that the tutor gave his pupil the best seat in the railway carriage and in all respects provided for his comfort before thinking of his own and this not as a father does for his child out of love but from a sense of place and duty which i did not quite see how a gentleman could consent to feel and yet this mr cwas evidently a gentleman and a quiet intelligent agreeable and no doubt learned man kbeing mentioned mr cobserved that he had known him well at college having been his contemporary there he did not like him however thought him a dangerous man as well as i could gather he thinks there is some radical defect in ks moral nature a lack of sincerity and furthermore he believes him to be a sensualist in his disposition in support of which view he said mr khad made drawings such as no pure man could have made or could allow himself to show or look at this was the only fact which mr cadduced bearing on his opinion of k otherwise it seemed to be one of those early impressions which a collegian gets of his fellowstudents and which he never gets rid of whatever the character of the person may turn out to be in after years i have judged several persons in this way and still judge them so though the world has cone to very different conclusions which is right the world which has the mans whole mature life on its side or his early companion who has nothing for it but some idle passages of his youth mr mremarked of newspaper reporters that they may be known at all celebrations and of any public occasion by the enormous quantity of luncheon they eat august th mr bdined with us at the rock ferry hotel the day before yesterday speaking of helvellyn and the death of charles cough about whom wordsworth and scott have both sung mr bmentioned a version of that story which rather detracts from the character of the faithful dog but somehow it lowers ones opinion of human nature itself to be compelled so to lower ones standard of a dogs nature i dont intend to believe the disparaging story but it reminds me of the story of the newzealander who was asked whether he loved a missionary who had been laboring for his soul and those of his countrymen to be sure i loved him why i ate a piece of him for my breakfast this morning for the last week or two i have passed my time between the hotel and the consulate and a weary life it is and one that leaves little of profit behind it i am sick to death of my office brutal captains and brutal sailors continual complaints of mutual wrong which i have no power to set right and which indeed seem to have no right on either side calls of idleness or ceremony from my travelling countrymen who seldom know what they are in search of at the commencement of their tour and never have attained any desirable end at the close of it beggars cheats simpletons unfortunates so mixed up that it is impossible to distinguish one from another and so in selfdefence the consul distrusts them all at the hotel yesterday there was a large company of factory people from preston who marched up from the pier with a band of military music playing before them they spent the day in the gardens and ballroom of the hotel dancing and otherwise merrymaking but i saw little of them being at the consulate towards evening it drizzled and the assemblage melted away gradually and when the band marched down to the pier there were few to follow although one man went dancing before the musicians flinging out his arms and footing it with great energy and gesticulation some young women along the road likewise began to dance as the music approached thackeray has a dread of servants insomuch that he hates to address them or to ask them for anything his morbid sensibility in this regard has perhaps led him to study and muse upon them so that he may be presumed to have a more intimate knowledge of this class than any other man carlyle dresses so badly and wears such a rough outside that the flunkies are rude to him at gentlemens doors in the afternoon j and i took a walk towards tranmere hall and beyond as far as oxton this part of the country being so near liverpool and birkenhead is all sprinkled over with what they call terraces bellevues and other pretty names for semidetached villas recluse cottage was one for a somewhat higher class but the old whitewashed stone cottage is still frequent with its roof of slate or thatch which perhaps is green with weeds or grass through its open door you see that it has a pavement of flagstones or perhaps of red freestone and hogs and donkeys are familiar with the threshold the door always opens directly into the kitchen without any vestibule and glimpsing in you see that a cottagers life must be the very plainest and homeliest that ever was lived by men and women yet the flowers about the door often indicate a native capacity for the beautiful but often there is only a pavement of round stones or of flagstones like those within at one point where there was a little bay as it were in the hedge fence we saw something like a small tent or wigwam an arch of canvas three or four feet high and open in front under which sat a darkcomplexioned woman and some children the woman was sewing and i took them for gypsies august th yesterday afternoon j and i went to birkenhead park which i have already described it so happened that there was a large school spending its holiday there a school of girls of the lower classes to the number of a hundred and fifty who disported themselves on the green under the direction of the schoolmistresses and of an old gentleman it struck me as it always has to observe how the lower orders of this country indicate their birth and station by their aspect and features in america there would be a good deal of grace and beauty among a hundred and fifty children and budding girls belonging to whatever rank of life but here they had universally a most plebeian look stubbed sturdy figures round coarse faces snubnoses the most evident specimens of the brown bread of human nature they looked wholesome and good enough and fit to sustain their rough share of life but it would have been impossible to make a lady out of any one of them climate no doubt has most to do with diffusing a slender elegance over american youngwomanhood but something perhaps is also due to the circumstance of classes not being kept apart there as they are here they interfuse amid the continual ups and downs of our social life and so in the lowest stations of life you may see the refining influence of gentle blood at all events it is only necessary to look at such an assemblage of children as i saw yesterday to be convinced that birth and blood do produce certain characteristics to be sure i have seen no similar evidence in england or elsewhere of old gentility refining and elevating the race these girls were all dressed in black gowns with white aprons and neckerchiefs and white linen caps on their heads a very dowdyish attire and well suited to their figures i saw only two of their games in one they stood in a circle while two of their number chased one another within and without the ring of girls which opened to let the fugitive pass but closed again to impede the passage of the pursuer the other was blindmansbuff on a new plan several of the girls sometimes as many as twenty being blinded at once and pursuing a single one who rang a handbell to indicate her whereabouts this was very funny the bellgirl keeping just beyond their reach and drawing them after her in a huddled group so that they sometimes tumbled over one another and lay sprawling i think i have read of this game in strutts english sports and pastimes we walked from the park home to rock ferry a distance of three or four miles a part of which was made delightful by a footpath leading us through fields where the grass had just been mown and others where the wheat harvest was commenced the path led us into the very midst of the rural labor that was going forward and the laborers rested a moment to look at us in fact they seemed to be more willing to rest than american laborers would have been children were loitering along this path or sitting down beside it and we met one little maid passing from village to village intent on some errand reaching tranmere i went into an alehouse nearly opposite the hall and called for a glass of ale the doorstep before the house and the flagstone floor of the entry and taproom were chalked all over in corkscrew lines an adornment that gave an impression of care and neatness the chalked lines being evidently freshly made it was a low oldfashioned room ornamented with a couple of seashells and an earthenware figure on the mantelpiece also with advertisements of allsops ale and other drinks and with a pasteboard handbill of the ancient order of foresters any member of which paying sixpence weekly is entitled to ten shillings per week and the attendance of a firstrate physician in sickness and twelve pounds to be paid to his friends in case of death any member of this order when travelling is sure says the handbill to meet with a brother member to lend him a helping hand there being nearly three thousand districts of this order and more than a hundred and nine thousand members in great britain whence it has extended to australia america and other countries looking up at the gateway of tranmere hall i discovered an inscription on the red freestone lintel and though much timeworn i succeeded in reading it labor omnia vincit there were likewise some initials which i could not satisfactorily make out the sense of this motto would rather befit the present agricultural occupants of the house than the idle gentlefolks who built and formerly inhabited it smithells hall august th on thursday i went by invitation to smithells hall in bolton le moors to dine and spend the night the hall is two or three miles from the town of bolton where i arrived by railway from liverpool and which seems to be a pretty large town though the houses are generally modern or with modernized fronts of brick or stucco it is a manufacturing town and the tall brick chimneys rise numerously in the neighborhood and are so near smithells hall that i suspect the atmosphere is somewhat impregnated with their breath mrcan comfort himself with the rent which he receives from the factories erected upon his own grounds and i suppose the value of his estate has greatly increased by the growth of manufactories although unless he wish to sell it i do not see what good this can do him smithells hall is one of the oldest residences of england and still retains very much the aspect that it must have had several centuries ago the house formerly stood around all four sides of a quadrangle enclosing a court and with an entrance through an archway one side of this quadrangle was removed in the time of the present mr s father and the front is now formed by the remaining three sides they look exceedingly ancient and venerable with their range of gables and lesser peaks the house is probably timberframed throughout and is overlaid with plaster and its generally light line is painted with a row of trefoils in black producing a very quaint effect the wing forming one side of the quadrangle is a chapel and has been so from time immemorial and mrtold me that he had a clergyman and even a bishop in his own diocese the drawingroom is on the opposite side of the quadrangle and through an arched door in the central portion there is a passage to the rear of the house it is impossible to describe such an old rambling edifice as this or to get any clear idea of its plan even by going over it without the aid of a map mrhas added some portions and altered others but with due regard to harmony with the original structure and the great body of it is still mediaeval the entrancehall opens right upon the quadrangular court and is a large low room with a settle of carved old oak and other old oaken furniture a centretable with periodicals and newspapers on it some family pictures on the walls and a large bright coalfire in the spacious grate the fire is always kept up throughout summer and winter and it seemed to me an excellent plan and rich with cheerful effects insuring one comfortable place and that the most central in the house whatever may be the inclemency of the weather it was a cloudy moist showery day when i arrived and this fire gave me the brightest and most hospitable smile and took away any shivery feeling by its mere presence the servant showed me thence into a lowstudded diningroom where soon mrsmade her appearance and after some talk brought me into the billiardroom opening from the hall where mrand a young gentleman were playing billiards and two ladies looking on after the game was finished mrtook me round to see the house and grounds the peculiarity of this house is what is called the bloody footstep in the time of bloody mary a protestant clergyman george marsh by name was examined before the then proprietor of the hall sir roger barton i think and committed to prison for his heretical opinions and was ultimately burned at the stake as his guards were conducting him from the justiceroom through the stonepaved passage that leads from front to rear of smithells hall he stamped his foot upon one of the flagstones in earnest protestation against the wrong which he was undergoing the foot as some say left a bloody mark in the stone others have it that the stone yielded like wax under his foot and that there has been a shallow cavity ever since this miraculous footprint is still extant and mrsshowed it to me before her husband took me round the estate it is almost at the threshold of the door opening from the rear of the house a stone two or three feet square set among similar ones that seem to have been worn by the tread of many generations the footprint is a dark brown stain in the smooth gray surface of the flagstone and looking sidelong at it there is a shallow cavity perceptible which mrsaccounted for as having been worn by people setting their feet just on this place so as to tread the very spot where the martyr wrought the miracle the mark is longer than any mortal foot as if caused by sliding along the stone rather than sinking into it and it might be supposed to have been made by a pointed shoe being blunt at the heel and decreasing towards the toe the bloodstained version of the story is more consistent with the appearance of the mark than the imprint would be for if the martyrs blood oozed out through his shoe and stocking it might have made his foot slide along the stone and thus have lengthened the shape of course it is all a humbug a darker vein cropping up through the gray flagstone but it is probably a fact and for aught i know may be found in foxs book of martyrs that george marsh underwent an examination in this house there is a full and pathetic account of the examination and martyrdom of george marsh in the eleventh section of foxs book of martyrs as i have just found june he went to smithells hall among other places to be questioned by mr barton ed and the tradition may have connected itself with the stone within a short time after the martyrdom or perhaps when the old persecuting knight departed this life and bloody mary was also dead people who had stood at a little distance from the hall door and had seen george marsh lift his hand and stamp his foot just at this spot perhaps they remembered this action and gesture and really believed that providence had thus made an indelible record of it on the stone although the very stone and the very mark might have lain there at the threshold hundreds of years before but even if it had been always there the footprint might after the fact be looked upon as a prophecy from the time when the foundation of the old house was laid that a holy and persecuted man should one day set his foot here on the way that was to lead him to the stake at any rate the legend is a good one mrstells me that the miraculous stone was once taken up from the pavement and flung out of doors where it remained many years and in proof of this it is cracked quite across at one end this is a pity and rather interferes with the authenticity if not of the stone itself yet of its position in the pavement it is not far from the foot of the staircase leading up to sir roger bartons examinationroom whither we ascended after examining the footprint this room now opens sideways on the chapel into which it looks down and which is spacious enough to accommodate a pretty large congregation on one of the walls of the chapel there is a marble tablet to the memory of one of the present family mrs father i suppose he being the first of the name who possessed the estate the present owners however seem to feel pretty much the same pride in the antiquity and legends of the house as if it had come down to them in an unbroken succession of their own forefathers it has in reality passed several times from one family to another since the conquest mrled me through a spacious old room which was formerly panelled with carved oak but which is converted into a brewhouse up a pair of stairs into the garret of one of the gables in order to show me the ancient framework of the house it is of oak and preposterously ponderous immense beams and rafters which no modern walls could support a gigantic old skeleton which architects say must have stood a thousand years and indeed it is impossible to ascertain the date of the original foundation though it is known to have been repaired and restored between five and six centuries ago of course in the lapse of ages it must continually have been undergoing minor changes but without at all losing its identity mrsays that this old oak wood though it looks as strong and as solid as ever has really lost its strength and that it would snap short off on application of any force after this we took our walk through the grounds which are well wooded though the trees will bear no comparison with those which i have seen in the midland parts of england it takes i suspect a much longer time for trees to attain a good size here than in america and these trees i think mrtold me were principally set out by himself he is upwards of sixty a good specimen of the old english countrygentleman sensible loving his land and his trees and his dogs and his game doing a little justicebusiness and showing a fitness for his position so that you feel satisfied to have him keep it he was formerly a member of parliament i had met him before at dinner at mrs hs he took pleasure in showing me his grounds through which he has laid out a walk winding up and down through dells and over hillocks and now and then crossing a rustic bridge so that you have an idea of quite an extensive domain beneath the trees there is a thick growth of ferns serving as cover for the game a little terrierdog who had hitherto kept us company all at once disappeared and soon afterwards we heard the squeak of some poor victim in the cover whereupon mrset out with agility and ran to the rescue by and by the terrier came back with a very guilty look from the wood we passed into the open park whence we had a distant view of the house and returning thither we viewed it in other aspects and on all sides one portion of it is occupied by mr s gardener and seems not to have been repaired at least as to its exterior for a great many years showing the old wooden frame painted black with plaster in the interstices and broad windows extending across the whole breadth of the rooms with hundreds of little diamondshaped panes of glass before dinner i was shown to my room which opens from an ancient gallery lined with oak and lighted by a row of windows along one side of the quadrangle along this gallery are the doors of several sleepingchambers one of which i think it is here is called the dead mans chamber it is supposed to have been the room where the corpses of persons connected with the household used to be laid out my own room was called the beam chamber from am immense crossbeam that projects from the ceiling and seems to be an entire tree laid across and left roughhewn though at present it is whitewashed the but of the tree for it diminishes from one end of the chamber to the other is nearly two feet square in its visible part we dined at seven oclock in a room some thirtyfive or forty feet long and proportionably broad all panelled with the old carved oak which mrtook from the room which he had converted into a brewhouse the oak is now of a very dark brown hue and being highly polished it produces a sombre but rich effect it is supposed to be of the era of henry the seventh and when i examined it the next morning i found it very delicately and curiously wrought there are carved profiles of persons in the costume of the times done with great skill also foliage intricate puzzles of intersecting lines sacred devices anagrams and among others the device of a bar across a tun indicating the name of barton most of the carving however is less elaborate and intricate than these specimens being in a perpendicular style and on one pattern before the wood grew so very dark the beauty of the work must have been much more easily seen than now as to particulars though i hardly think that the general effect could have been better at least the sombre richness that overspreads the entire square of the room is suitable to such an antique house an elaborate gothic cornice runs round the whole apartment the sideboard and other furniture are of gothic patterns and very likely of genuine antiquity but the fireplace is perhaps rather out of keeping being of white marble with the arms of this family sculptured on it though hardly sunset when we sat down to dinner yet it being an overcast day and the oaken room so sombre we had candles burning on the table and long before dinner was over the candlelight was all the light we had it is always pleasanter to dine by artificial light mrs s dinner was a good one and mr s wines were very good i had mrson one side and another lady on the other side after dinner there were two cardparties formed in the diningroom at one of which there was a game of vingtetun and at the other a game of whist at which mrsand i lost several shillings to a mrs halton and mr gaskell after finishing our games at cards mrs halton drove off in a ponychaise to her own house the other ladies retired and the gentlemen sat down to chat awhile over the hall fire occasionally sipping a glass of wineandwater and finally we all went off to our rooms it was past twelve oclock when i composed myself to sleep and i could not have slept long when a tremendous clap of thunder woke me just in time to see a vivid flash of lightning i saw no ghosts though mrstells me there is one which makes a disturbance unless religious services are regularly kept up in the chapel in the morning before breakfast we had prayers read by mr in the oak diningroom all the servants coming in and everybody kneeling down i should like to know how much true religious feeling is indicated by this regular observance of religious rites in english families in america if people kneel down to pray it is pretty certain that they feel a genuine interest in the matter and their daily life is supposed to be in accordance with their devotions if an american is an infidel he knows it but an englishman is often so without suspecting it being kept from that knowledge by this formality of family prayer and his other regularities of external worship there was a parrot in a corner of the diningroom and when prayers were over mrspraised it very highly for having been so silent it being polls habit probably to break in upon the sacred exercises with unseemly interjections and remarks while we were at breakfast poll began to whistle and talk very vociferously and in a tone and with expressions that surprised me till i learned that the bird is usually kept in the kitchen and servants hall and is only brought into the diningroom at prayertime and breakfast thus its mouth is full of kitchen talk which flows out before the gentlefolks with the queerest effect after breakfast i examined the carvings of the room mrhas added to its decorations the coats of arms of all the successive possessors of the house with those of the families into which they married including the ratcliffes stanleys and others from the diningroom i passed into the library which contains books enough to make a rainy day pass pleasantly i remember nothing else that i need to record and as i sat by the hall fire talking with mr gaskell at about eleven oclock the butler brought me word that a fly which i had bespoken was ready to convey me to the railway i took leave of mrs her last request being that i would write a ghoststory for her house and drove off shrewsbury september th yesterday we all of us set forth from rock ferry at half past twelve and reached shrewsbury between three and four oclock and took up our quarters at the lion hotel we found shrewsbury situated on an eminence around which the severn winds making a peninsula of it quite densely covered by the town the streets ascend and curve about and intersect each other with the customary irregularity of these old english towns so that it is quite impossible to go directly to any given point or for a stranger to find his way to a place which he wishes to reach though by what seems a singular good fortune the soughtfor place is always offering itself when least expected on this account i never knew such pleasant walking as in old streets like those of shrewsbury and there are passages opening under archways and winding up between high edifices very tempting to the explorer and generally leading to some court or some queer old range of buildings or piece of architecture which it would be the greatest pity to miss seeing there was a delightful want of plan in the laying out of these ancient towns in fact they never were laid out at all nor were restrained by any plan whatever but grew naturally with streets as eccentric as the pathway of a young child toddling about the floor the first curious thing we particularly noticed when we strolled out after dinner was the old markethouse which stands in the midst of an oblong square a gray edifice elevated on pillars and arches and with the statue of an armed knight richard plantagenet duke of york in a central niche in its front the statue is older than the markethouse having been moved thither from one of the demolished towers of the city wall in the markethouse was erected in there are other curious sculptures and carvings and quirks of architecture about this building and the houses that stand about the square are many of them very striking specimens of what dwellinghouses used to be in elizabeths time and earlier i have seen no such stately houses in that style as we found here in shrewsbury there were no such fine ones in coventry stratford warwick chester nor anywhere else where we have been their stately height and spaciousness seem to have been owing to the fact that shrewsbury was a sort of metropolis of the country round about and therefore the neighboring gentry had their townhouses there when london was several days journey off instead of a very few hours and besides it was once much the resort of kings and the centrepoint of great schemes of war and policy one such house formerly belonging to a now extinct family that of ireland rises to the height of four stories and has a front consisting of what look like four projecting towers there are ranges of embowered windows one above another to the full height of the house and these are surmounted by peaked gables the people of those times certainly did not deny themselves light and while windowglass was an article of no very remote introduction it was probably a point of magnificence and wealthy display to have enough of it one whole side of the room must often have been formed by the window this ireland mansion as well as all the rest of the old houses in shrewsbury is a timber house that is a skeleton of oak filled up with brick plaster or other material and with the beams of the timber marked out with black paint besides which in houses of any pretension there are generally trefoils and other gothiclooking ornaments likewise painted black they have an indescribable charm for me the more i think because they are wooden but indeed i cannot tell why it is that i like them so well and am never tired of looking at them a street was a development of human life in the days when these houses were built whereas a modern street is but the cold plan of an architect without individuality or character and without the human emotion which a man kneads into the walls which he builds on a scheme of his own we strolled to a pleasant walk under a range of trees along the shore of the severn it is called the quarry walk the severn is a pretty river the largest i think unless it be such an estuary as the mersey that i have met with in england that is to say about a fair stonesthrow across it is very gentle in its course and winds along between grassy and sedgy banks with a good growth of weeds in some part of its current it has one stately bridge called the english bridge of several arches and as we sauntered along the quarry walk we saw a ferry where the boat seemed to be navigated across by means of a rope stretched from bank to bank of the river after leaving the quarry walk we passed an old tower of red freestone the only one remaining of those formerly standing at intervals along the whole course of the town wall and we also went along what little is now left of the wall itself and thence through the irregular streets which gave no account of themselves we found our way i know not how back to our hotel it is an uncheerful old hotel which takes upon itself to be in the best class of english country hotels and charges the best price very dark in the lower apartments pervaded with a musty odor but provided with a whiteneckclothed waiter who spares no ceremony in serving the joints of mutton j and i afterwards walked forth again and went this time to the castle which stands exactly above the railway station a path from its breadth quite a street leads up to the arched gateway but we found a board giving notice that these are private grounds and no strangers admitted so that we only passed through the gate a few steps and looked about us and retired on perceiving a man approaching us through the trees and shrubbery a private individual it seems has burrowed in this old warlike den and turned the keep and any other available apartment into a modern dwelling and laid out his pleasuregrounds within the precincts of the castle wall which allows verge enough for the purpose the ruins have been considerably repaired this castle was built at various times the keep by edward i and other portions at an earlier period and it stands on the isthmus left by the severn in its wandering course about the town the duke of cleveland now owns it i do not know who occupies it in the course of this walk we passed st marys church a very old church indeed no matter how old but say eight hundred or a thousand years it has a very tall spire and the spire is now undergoing repairs and seeing the door open i went into the porch but found no admission further then walking around it through the churchyard we saw that all the venerable gothic windows one of them grand in size were set with stained glass representing coats of arms and ancient armor and kingly robes and saints with glories about their heads and scriptural people but all of these as far as our actual perception was concerned quite colorless and with only a cold outline dimly filled up yet had we been within the church and had the sunlight been streaming through what a warm rich gorgeous roseate golden life would these figures have showed in the churchyard close upon the street so that its dust must be continually scattered over the spot i saw a heavy gray tombstone with a latin inscription purporting that bishop butler the author of the analogy in his lifetime had chosen this as a burialplace for himself and his family there is a statue of him within the church from the top of the spire a man above a hundred years ago attempted to descend by means of a rope to the other side of the severn but the rope broke and he fell in his midway flight and was killed it was an undertaking worthy of sam patch there is a record of the fact on the outside of the tower i remember nothing more that we saw yesterday but before breakfast j and i sallied forth again and inspected the gateway and interior court of the council house a very interesting place both in itself and for the circumstances connected with it it having been the place where the councillors for the welsh marches used to reside during their annual meetings and charles the first also lived here for six weeks in james ii likewise held his court here in the house was originally built in that is the council house itself the gateway and the house through which it passes being of as late date as this latter is a fine old house in the usual style of timber architecture with the timber lines marked out and quaint adornments in black paint and the pillars of the gateway which passes beneath the front chamber are of curiously carved oak which has probably stood the action of english atmosphere better than marble would have done passing through this gateway we entered a court and saw some old buildings more or less modernized but without destroying their aged stateliness standing round three sides of it with arched entrances and bowwindows and windows in the roofs and peaked gables and all the delightful irregularity and variety that these houses have and which make them always so fresh and with so much detail that every minute you see something heretofore unseen it must have been no unfit residence for a king and his court when those three sides of the square all composing one great fantastic house were in their splendor the square itself too must have been a busy and cheerful scene thronged with attendants guests horses etc after breakfast we all walked out and crossing the english bridge looked at the severn over its parapet the river is here broader than elsewhere and very shallow and has an island covered with bushes about midway across just over the bridge we saw a church of red freestone and evidently very ancient this is the church of the holy cross and is a portion of the abbey of st peter and st john which formerly covered ten acres of ground we did not have time to go into the church but the windows and other points of architecture so far as we could discern them and knew how to admire them were exceedingly venerable and beautiful on the other side of the street over a wide space there are other remains of the old abbey and the most interesting was a stone pulpit now standing in the open air seemingly in a garden but which originally stood in the refectory of the abbey and was the station whence one of the monks read to his brethren at their meals the pulpit is much overgrown with ivy we should have made further researches among these remains though they seem now to be in private grounds but a large mastiff came nut of his kennel and approaching us to the length of his iron chain began barking very fiercely nor had we time to see half that we would gladly have seen and studied here and elsewhere about shrewsbury it would have been very interesting to have visited hotspurs and falstaffs battlefield which is four miles from the town too distant certainly for falstaff to have measured the length of the fight by shrewsbury clock there is now a church built there by henry iv and said to cover the bones of those slain in the battle returning into the town we penetrated some narrow lanes where as the old story goes people might almost shake hands across from the top windows of the opposite houses impending towards each other emerging into a wider street at a spot somewhat more elevated than other parts of the town we went into a shop to buy some royal shrewsbury cakes which we had seen advertised at several shop windows they are a very rich cake with plenty of eggs sugar and butter and very little flour a small public building of stone of modern date was close by and asking the shopwoman what it was she said it was the butter cross or market for butter eggs and poultry it is a remarkable site for here in ancient times stood a stone cross where heralds used to make proclamation and where criminals of state used to be executed david the last of the welsh princes was here cruelly put to death by edward i and many noblemen were beheaded on this spot after being taken prisoners in the battle of shrewsbury i can only notice one other memorable place in shrewsbury and that is the raven inn where farquhar wrote his comedy of the recruiting officer in the window of the room in which he wrote is said to look into the inn yard and i went through the arched entrance to see if i could distinguish it the hostlers were currying horses in the yard and so stared at me that i gave but the merest glance the shrewsbury inns have not only the customary names of english inns as the lion the stag but they have also the carved wooden figures of the object named whereas in all other towns the name alone remains we left shrewsbury at half past ten and arrived in london at about four in the afternoon london september th on wednesday just before dusk j and i walked forth for the first time in london our lodgings are in george street hanover square no and st georges church where so many marriages in romance and in fashionable life have been celebrated is a short distance below our house in the same street the edifice seems to be of white marble now much blackened with london smoke and has a grecian pillared portico in the square just above us is a statue of william pitt we went down bond street and part of regent street just estraying a little way from our temporary nest and taking good account of landmarks and corners so as to find our way readily back again it is long since i have had such a childish feeling but all that i had heard and felt about the vastness of london made it seem like swimming in a boundless ocean to venture one step beyond the only spot i knew my first actual impression of london was of stately and spacious streets and by no means so dusky and grimy as i had expected not merely in the streets about this quarter of the town which is the aristocratic quarter but in all the streets through which we had passed from the railway station if i had not first been so imbued with the smoke and dinginess of liverpool i should doubtless have seen a stronger contrast betwixt dusky london and the cheerful glare of our american cities there are no red bricks here all are of a dark hue and whatever of stone or stucco has been white soon clothes itself in mourning yesterday forenoon i went out alone and plunged headlong into london and wandered about all day without any particular object in view but only to lose myself for the sake of finding myself unexpectedly among things that i had always read and dreamed about the plan was perfectly successful for besides vague and unprofitable wanderings i saw in the course of the day hyde park regents park whitehall the two new houses of parliament charing cross st pauls the strand fleet street cheapside whitechapel leadenhall street the haymarket and a great many other places the names of which were classic in my memory i think what interests me most here is the london of the writers of queen annes age whatever pope the spectator de foe and down as late as johnson and goldsmith have mentioned the monument for instance which is of no great height nor beauty compared with that on bunker hill charmed me prodigiously st pauls appeared to me unspeakably grand and noble and the more so from the throng and bustle continually going on around its base without in the least disturbing the sublime repose of its great dome and indeed of all its massive height and breadth other edifices may crowd close to its foundation and people may tramp as they like about it but still the great cathedral is as quiet and serene as if it stood in the middle of salisbury plain there cannot be anything else in its way so good in the world as just this effect of st pauls in the very heart and densest tumult of london i do not know whether the church is built of marble or of whatever other white or nearly white material but in the time that it has been standing there it has grown black with the smoke of ages through which there are nevertheless gleams of white that make a most picturesque impression on the whole it is much better than staring white the edifice would not be nearly so grand without this drapery of black i did not find these streets of the old city so narrow and irregular as i expected all the principal ones are sufficiently broad and there are few houses that look antique being i suppose generally modernfronted when not actually of modern substance there is little or no show or pretension in this part of london it has a plain business air an air of homely actual life as of a metropolis of tradesmen who have been carrying on their traffic here in sober earnest for hundreds of years you observe on the signboards established ninety years in threadneedle street established in denoting long pedigrees of silkmercers and hosiers de foes contemporaries still represented by their posterity who handle the hereditary yardstick on the same spot i must not forget to say that i crossed the thames over a bridge which i think is near charing cross afterwards i found my way to london bridge where there was a delightful density of throng the thames is not so wide and majestic as i had imagined nothing like the mersey for example as a picturesque object however flowing through the midst of a city it would lose by any increase of width omnibuses are a most important aid to wanderers about london i reached home well wearied about six oclock in the course of the day i had seen one person whom i knew mr clarke to whom henry bintroduced me when we went to see the great ship launched on the dee this i believe was in regent street in that street too i saw a company of dragoons beautifully mounted and defensively armed in brass helmets and steel cuirasses polished to the utmost excess of splendor it was a pretty sight at one of the public edifices on each side of the portal sat a mounted trooper similarly armed and with his carbine resting on his knee just as motionless as a statue this too as a picturesque circumstance was very good and really made an impression on me with respect to the power and stability of the government though i could not help smiling at myself for it but then the thought that for generations an armed warrior has always sat just there on his warsteed and with his weapon in his hand is pleasant to the imagination although it is questionable whether his carbine be loaded and no doubt if the authorities had any message to send they would choose some other messenger than this heavy dragoon the electric wire for instance still if he and his horse were to be withdrawn from their post night or day for i suppose the sentinels are on duty all night it seems as if the monarchy would be subverted and the english constitution crumble into rubbish and in honest fact it will signify something like that when guard is relieved there for the last time september th yesterday forenoon s the two eldest children and i went forth into london streets and proceeded down regent street and thence to st jamess park at the entrance of which is a statue of somebody i forget whom on the very spacious gravelwalks covering several acres in the rear of the horse guards some soldiers were going through their exercise and after looking at them awhile we strolled through the park alongside of a sheet of water in which various kinds of ducks geese and rare species of waterfowl were swimming there was one swan of immense size which moved about among the lesser fowls like a stately fullrigged ship among gunboats by and by we found ourselves near what we since have discovered to be buckingham palace a long building in the italian style but of no impressiveness and which one soon wearies of looking at the queen having gone to scotland the day before the palace now looked deserted although there was a onehorse cab of shabby aspect standing at the principal front where doubtless the carriages of princes and the nobility draw up there is a fountain playing before the palace and waterfowl love to swim under its perpetual showers these ducks and geese are very tame and swim to the margin of the pond to be fed by visitors looking up at you with great intelligence s asked a man in a sober suit of livery of whom we saw several about the park whose were some of the large mansions which we saw and he pointed out stafford house the residence of the duke of sutherland a very noble edifice much more beautiful than the palace though not so large also the house of the earl of ellesmere and residences of other noblemen this range of mansions along the park from the spot whence we viewed them looks very much like beacon street in boston bordering on the common allowing for a considerable enlargement of scale in favor of the park residences the park however has not the beautiful elms that overshadow boston common nor such a pleasant undulation of surface nor the fine offview of the country like that across charles river i doubt whether london can show so delightful a spot as that common always excepting the superiority of english lawns which however is not so evident in the london parks there being less care bestowed on the grass than i should have expected from this place we wandered into what i believe to be hyde park attracted by a gigantic figure on horseback which loomed up in the distance the effect of this enormous steed and his rider is very grand seen in the misty atmosphere i do not understand why we did not see st jamess palace which is situated i believe at the extremity of the same range of mansions of which stafford house is the opposite end from the entrance of hyde park we seem to have gone along piccadilly and making two or three turns and getting bewildered i put s and the children into a cab and sent them home continuing my wanderings i went astray among squares of large aristocraticlooking edifices all apparently new with no shops among them some yet unfinished and the whole seeming like a city built for a colony of gentlefolks who might be expected to emigrate thither in a body it was a dreary business to wander there turning corner after corner and finding no way of getting into a less stately and more genial region at last however i passed in front of the queens mews where sentinels were on guard and where a jollylooking man in a splendidly laced scarlet coat and whitetopped boots was lounging at the entrance he looked like the prince of grooms or coachmen the corner of hyde park was within a short distance and i took a hansom at the cabstand there and drove to the american despatch agency henrietta street covent garden having some documents of state to be sent by todays steamer the business of forwarding despatches to america and distributing them to the various legations and consulates in europe must be a pretty extensive one for mr miller has a large office and two clerks in attendance from this point i went through covent garden market and got astray in the city so that i can give no clear account of my afternoons wanderings i passed through holborn however and i think it was from that street that i passed through an archway which i almost invariably do when i see one and found myself in a very spacious gravelled square surrounded on the four sides by a continuous edifice of dark brick very plain and of cold and stern aspect this was grays inn all tenanted by a multitude of lawyers passing thence i saw furnivals inn over another archway but being on the opposite side of the street i did not go thither in holborn still i went through another arched entrance over which was staples inn and here likewise seemed to be offices but in a court opening inwards from this there was a surrounding seclusion of quiet dwellinghouses with beautiful green shrubbery and grassplots in the court and a great many sunflowers in full bloom the windows were open it was a lovely summer afternoon and i have a sense that bees were humming in the court though this may have been suggested by my fancy because the sound would have been so well suited to the scene a boy was reading at one of the windows there was not a quieter spot in england than this and it was very strange to have drifted into it so suddenly out of the bustle and rumble of holborn and to lose all this repose as suddenly on passing through the arch of the outer court in all the hundreds of years since london was built it has not been able to sweep its roaring tide over that little island of quiet in holborn i saw the most antiquelooking houses that i have yet met with in london but none of very remarkable aspect i think i must have been under a spell of enchantment today connecting me with st pauls for trying to get away from it by various avenues i still got bewildered and again and again saw its great dome and pinnacles before me i observe that the smoke has chiefly settled on the lower part of the edifice leaving its loftier portions and its spires much less begrimed it is very beautiful very rich i did not think that anything but gothic architecture could so have interested me the statues the niches the embroidery as it were of sculpture traced around it produced a delightful effect in front of st pauls there is a statue of queen anne which looks rather more majestic i doubt not than that fat old dame ever did st pauls churchyard had always been a place of immense interest in my imagination it is merely the not very spacious street running round the base of the church at least this street is included in the churchyard together with the enclosure immediately about the church sowed with tombstones i meant to look for the childrens bookshop but forgot it or neglected it from not feeling so much interest in a thing near at hand as when it seemed unattainable i watched a man tearing down the brick wall of a house that did not appear very old but it surprised me to see how crumbly the brickwork was one stroke of his pick often loosening several bricks in a row it is my opinion that brick houses after a moderate term of years stand more by habit and courtesy than through any adhesive force of the old mortar i recommenced my wanderings but i remember nothing else particularly claiming to be mentioned unless it be paternoster row a little narrow darksome lane in which it being now dusk in that density of the city i could not very well see what signs were over the doors in this street or thereabouts i got into an omnibus and being set down near regents circus reached home well wearied september th yesterday having some tickets to the zoological gardens we went thither with the two eldest children it was a most beautiful sunny day the very perfection of english weather which is as much as to say the best weather in the world except perhaps some few days in an american october these gardens are at the end of regents park farthest from london and they are very extensive though i think not quite worthy of london not so good as one would expect them to be not so fine and perfect a collection of beasts birds and fishes as one might fairly look for when the greatest metropolis of the world sets out to have such a collection at all my idea was that here every living thing was provided for in the way best suited to its nature and habits and that the refinement of civilization had here restored a garden of eden where all the animal kingdom had regained a happy home this is not quite the case though i believe the creatures are as comfortable as could he expected and there are certainly a good many strange beasts here the hippopotamus is the chief treasure of the collection an immense almost misshapen mass of flesh at this moment i do not remember anything that interested me except a sick monkey a very large monkey and elderly he seemed to be his keeper brought him some sweetened apple and water and some tea for the monkey had quite lost his appetite and refused all ordinary diet he came however quite eagerly and smelt of the tea and apple the keeper exhorting him very tenderly to eat but the poor monkey shook his head slowly and with the most pitiable expression at the same time extending his hand to take the keepers as if claiming his sympathy and friendship by and by the keeper who is rather a surly fellow essayed harsher measures and insisted that the monkey should eat what had been brought for him and hereupon ensued somewhat of a struggle and the tea was overturned upon the straw of the bed then the keeper scolded him and seizing him by one arm drew him out of his little bedroom into the larger cage upon which the wronged monkey began a loud dissonant reproachful chatter more expressive of a sense of injury than any words could be observing the spectators in front of the cage he seemed to appeal to them and addressed his chatter thitherward and stretched out his long lean arm and black hand between the bars as if claiming the grasp of any one friend he might have in the whole world he was placable however for when the keeper called him in a gentler tone he hobbled towards him with a very stiff and rusty movement and the scene closed with their affectionately hugging one another but i fear the poor monkey will die in a future state of being i think it will be one of my inquiries in reference to the mysteries of the present state why monkeys were made the creator could not surely have meant to ridicule his own work it might rather be fancied that satan had perpetrated monkeys with a malicious purpose of parodying the masterpiece of creation the aquarium containing in some of its compartments specimens of the animal and vegetable life of the sea and in others those of the fresh water was richly worth inspecting but not nearly so perfect as it might be now i think we have a right to claim in a metropolitan establishment of this kind in all its departments a degree of perfection that shall quite outdo the unpractised thought of any man on that particular subject there were a good many welldressed people and children in the gardens saturday being a fashionable day for visiting them one great amusement was feeding some bears with biscuits and cakes of which they seemed exceedingly fond one of the three bears clambered to the top of a high pole whence he invited the spectators to hand him bits of cake on the end of a stick or to toss them into his mouth which he opened widely for that purpose another apparently an elderly bear not having skill nor agility for these gymnastics sat on the ground on his hinder end groaning most pitifully the third took what stray bits he could get without earning them by any antics at four oclock there was some music from the band of the first lifeguards a great multitude of chairs being set on the greensward in the sunshine and shade for the accommodation of the auditors here we had the usual exhibition of english beauty neither superior nor otherwise to what i have seen in other parts of england before the music was over we walked slowly homeward along beside regents park which is very prettily laid out but lacks some last touch of richness and beauty though after all i do not well see what more could be done with grass trees and gravelwalks the children especially j who had raced from one thing to another all day long grew tired so we put them into a cab and walked slowly through portland place where are a great many noble mansions yet no very admirable architecture none that possessed nor that ever can possess the indefinable charm of some of those poor old timber houses in shrewsbury the art of domestic architecture is lost we can rear stately and beautiful dwellings though we seldom do but they do not seem proper to the life of man in the same way that his shell is proper to the lobster nor indeed is the mansion of the nobleman proper to him in the same kind and degree that a hut is proper to a peasant from portland place we passed into regent street and soon reached home september th yesterday forenoon we walked out with the children intending for charing cross but missing our way as usual we went down a rather wide and stately street and saw before us an old brick edifice with a pretty extensive front over which rose a clocktower the whole dingy and looking both gloomy and mean there was an arched entrance beneath the clocktower at which two guardsmen in their bearskin caps were stationed as sentinels and from this circumstance and our having some guess at the locality we concluded the old brick building to be st jamess palace otherwise we might have taken it for a prison or for a hospital which in truth it was at first intended for but certainly there are many paupers in england who live in edifices of far more architectural pretension externally than this principal palace of the english sovereigns seeing other people go through the archway we also went meeting no impediment from the sentinels and found ourselves in a large paved court in the centre of which a banner was stuck down with a few soldiers standing near it this flag was the banner of the regiment of guards on duty the aspect of the interior court was as naked and dismal as the outside the brick being of that dark hue almost universal in england on one side of the court there was a door which seemed to give admission to a chapel into which several persons went and probably we might have gone too had we liked from this court we penetrated into at least two or three others for the palace is very extensive and all of it so far as i could see on the same pattern large enclosed courts paved and quite bare of grass shrubbery or any beautiful thing dark stern brick walls without the slightest show of architectural beauty or even an ornament over the square commonplace windows looking down on those forlorn courts a carriagedrive passes through it if i remember aright from the principal front emerging by one of the sides and i suppose that the carriages roll through the palace at the levees and drawingrooms there was nothing to detain us here any long time so we went from court to court and came out through a sideopening the edifice is battlemented all round and this with somewhat of fantastic in the shape of the clocktower is the only attempt at ornament in the whole then we skirted along st jamess park passing marlborough house a red brick building and a very long range of stone edifices which whether they were public or private one house or twenty we knew not we ascended the steps of the york column and soon reached charing cross and trafalgar square where there are more architectural monuments than in any other one place in london besides two fountains playing in large reservoirs of water and various edifices of note and interest northumberland house now and for a long while the town residence of the percys stands on the strand side over the entrance a lion very spiritedly sculptured flinging out his long tail on another side of the square is morleys hotel exceedingly spacious and looking more american than anything else in the hotel line that i have seen here the nelson monument with lord nelson in a cocked hat on its top is very grand in its effect all about the square there were sundry loungers people looking at the basreliefs on nelsons column children paddling in the reservoirs of the fountains and it being a sunny day it was a cheerful and lightsome as well as an impressive scene on second thoughts i do not know but that london should have a far better display of architecture and sculpture than this on its finest site and in its very centre for after all there is nothing of the very best but i missed nothing at the time in the afternoon s and i set out to attend divine service in westminster abbey on our way thither we passed through pall mall which is full of clubhouses and we were much struck with the beauty of the one lately erected for the carleton club it is built of a buffcolored or yellowish stone with pillars or pilasters of polished aberdeen granite wonderfully rich and beautiful and there is a running border of sculptured figures all round the upper part of the building besides other ornament and embroidery wherever there was room or occasion for it it being an oblong square the smooth and polished aspect in this union of two rich colors in it this delicacy and minuteness of finish this lavish ornament made me think of a ladys jewelbox and if it could be reduced to the size of about a foot square or less it would make the very prettiest one that ever was seen i question whether it have any right to be larger than a jewelbox but it is certainly a most beautiful edifice we turned down whitehall at the head of which over the very spot where the regicides were executed stands the bronze equestrian statue of charles i the statue that was buried under the earth during the whole of cromwells time and emerged after the restoration we saw the admiralty and the horseguards and in front of the latter the two mounted sentinels one of whom was flirting and laughing with some girls on the other side of the street stands the banquetinghouse built by inigo jones from a window of which king charles stepped forth wearing a kingly head which within a few minutes afterwards fell with a dead thump on the scaffold it was nobly done and nobly suffered how rich is history in the little space around this spot i find that the day after i reached london i entirely passed by westminster abbey without knowing it partly because my eyes were attracted by the gaudier show of the new houses of parliament and partly because this part of the abbey has been so much repaired and renewed that it has not the marks of age looking at its front i now found it very grand and venerable but it is useless to attempt a description these things are not to be translated into words they can be known only by seeing them and until seen it is well to shape out no idea of them impressions states of mind produced by noble spectacles of whatever kind are all that it seems worth while to attempt reproducing with the pen after coming out of the abbey we looked at the two houses of parliament directly across the way an immense structure and certainly most splendid built of a beautiful warmcolored stone the building has a very elaborate finish and delighted me at first but by and by i began to be sensible of a weariness in the effect a lack of variety in the plan and ornament a deficiency of invention so that instead of being more and more interested the longer one looks as is the case with an old gothic edifice and continually reading deeper into it one finds that one has seen all in seeing a little piece and that the magnificent palace has nothing better to show one or to do for one it is wonderful how the old weatherstained and smokeblackened abbey shames down this brandnewness not that the parliament houses are not fine objects to look at too yesterday morning we walked to charing cross with u and j and there took a cab to the tower driving thither through the strand fleet street past st pauls and amid all the thickest throng of the city i have not a very distinct idea of the tower but remember that our cab drove within an outer gate where we alighted at a ticketoffice the old royal fortress being now a regular showplace at sixpence a head including the sight of armory and crownjewels we saw about the gate several warders or yeomen of the guard or beefeaters dressed in scarlet coats of antique fashion richly embroidered with golden crowns both on the breast and back and other royal devices and insignia so that they looked very much like the kings on a pack of cards or regular trumps at all events i believe they are old soldiers promoted to this position for good conduct one of them took charge of us and when a sufficient number of visitors had collected with us he led us to see what very small portion of the tower is shown there is a great deal of ground within the outer precincts and it has streets and houses and inhabitants and a church within it and going up and down behind the warder without any freedom to get acquainted with the place by strolling about i know little more about it than when i went in only recollecting a mean and disagreeable confusion of brick walls barracks paved courts with here and there a low bulky turret of rather antique aspect and in front of one of the edifices a range of curious old cannon lying on the ground some of them immensely large and long and beautifully wrought in brass i observed by a plan however that the white tower containing the armory stands about in the centre of the fortress and that it is a square battlemented structure having a turret at each angle we followed the warder into the white tower and there saw in the first place a long gallery of mounted knights and men at arms which has been so often described that when i wish to recall it to memory i shall turn to some other persons account of it i was much struck however with the beautiful execution of a good many of the suits of armor and the exquisite detail with which they were engraved the artists of those days attained very great skill in this kind of manufacture the figures of the knights too in full array undoubtedly may have shown a combination of stateliness and grace which heretofore i have not believed in not seeing how it could be compatible with iron garments but it is quite incomprehensible how in the time of the heaviest armor they could strike a blow or possess any freedom of movement except such as a turtle is capable of and in truth they are said not to have been able to rise up when overthrown they probably stuck out their lances and rode straight at the enemy depending upon upsetting him by their mass and weight in the row of knights is henry viii also charles brandon duke of suffolk who must have been an immensely bulky man also a splendid suit of armor gilded all over presented by the city of london to charles i also two or three suits of boys armor for the little princes of the house of stuart they began to wear these burdens betimes in order that their manhood might be the more tolerant of them we went through this gallery so hastily that it would have been about as well not to have seen it at all then we went up a winding stair to another room containing armor and weapons and beautiful brass cannon that appeared to have been for ornament rather than use some of them being quite covered with embossed sculpture marvellously well wrought in this room was john of gaunts suit indicating a man seven feet high and the armor seems to bear the marks of much wear but this may be owing to great scrubbing throughout the centuries since john of gaunt died there too we saw the cloak in which wolfe fell on the plains of abraham a coarse faded threadbare lightcolored garment folded up under a glass case many other things we might have seen worthy of being attended to had there been time to look at them following into still another room we were told that this was sir walter raleighs apartment while confined in the tower so that it was within these walls that he wrote the history of the world the room was formerly lighted by lancet windows and must have been very gloomy but if he had the whole length of it to himself it was a good space to walk and meditate in on one side of the apartment is a low door giving admittance we were told to the cell where raleigh slept so we went in and found it destitute of any window and so dark that we could not estimate its small extent except by feeling about at the threshold of this sleepingkennel there were one or two inscriptions scratched in the wall but not i believe by raleigh in this apartment among a great many other curious things are shown the devilish instruments of torture which the spaniards were bringing to england in their armada and at the end of the room sits queen elizabeth on horseback in her high ruff and faded finery very likely none of these clothes were ever on her actual person here too we saw a headsmans block not that on which raleigh was beheaded which i would have given gold to see but the one which was used for the scotch lords kilmarnock lovat and others executed on account of the rebellion of it is a block of oak about two feet high with a large knot in it so that it would not easily be split by a blow of the axe hewn and smoothed in a very workmanlike way and with a hollow to accommodate the head and shoulders on each side there were two or three very strong marks of the axe in the part over which the neck lay and several smaller cuts as if the first stroke nearly severed the head and then the chopping off was finished by smaller blows as we see a butcher cutting meat with his cleaver a headsmans axe was likewise shown us its date unknown in the white tower we were shown the regalia under a glass and within an iron cage edward the confessors golden staff was very finely wrought and there were a great many pretty things but i have a suspicion i know not why that these are not the real jewels at least that such inestimable ones as the kohinoor or however it is spelt are less freely exhibited the warder then led us into a paved court which he said was the place of execution of all royal personages and others who from motives of fear or favor were beheaded privately raleigh was among these and so was anne boleyn we then followed to the beauchamp tower where many state prisoners of note were confined and where on the walls of one of the chambers there are several inscriptions and sculptures of various devices done by the prisoners and very skilfully done too though perhaps with no better instrument than an old nail these poor wretches had time and leisure enough to spend upon their work this chamber is lighted by small lancet windows pierced at equal intervals round the circle of the beauchamp tower and it contains a large square fireplace in which is now placed a small modern stove we were hurried away before we could even glance at the inscriptions and we saw nothing else except the low obscure doorway in the bloody tower leading to the staircase under which were found the supposed bones of the little princes and lastly the round norman arch opening to the water passage called the traitors gate finally we ate some cakes and buns in the refreshmentroom connected with the ticketoffice and then left the fortress the ancient moat by the way has been drained within a few years and now forms a great hollow space with grassy banks round about the citadel we now wished to see the thames and therefore threaded our way along thames street towards london bridge passing through a fishmarket which i suppose to be the actual billingsgate whence originated all the foul language in england under london bridge there is a station for steamers running to greenwich and woolwich we got on board one of these not very well knowing nor much caring whither it might take us and steamed down the river which is bordered with the shabbiest blackest ugliest meanest buildings it is the back side of the town and in truth the muddy tide of the thames deserves to see no better there was a great deal of shipping in the river and many steamers and it was much more crowded than the mersey where all the ships go into docks but the vessels were not so fine by and by we reached greenwich and went ashore there proceeding up from the quay past beershops and eatinghouses in great numbers and variety greenwich hospital is here a very prominent object and after passing along its extensive front facing towards the river we entered one of the principal gates as we found ourselves free to do we now left the hospital and steamed back to london bridge whence we went up into the city and to finish the labors of the day ascended the monument this seems to be still a favorite adventure with the cockneys for we heard one woman who went up with us saying that she had been thinking of going up all her life and another said that she had gone up thirty years ago there is an iron railing or rather a cage round the top through which it would be impossible for people to force their way in order to precipitate themselves as six persons have heretofore done there was a mist over london so that we did not gain a very clear view except of the swarms of people running about like ants in the streets at the foot of the monument descending i put s and the children into a cab and i myself wandered about the city passing along fleet street i turned in through an archway which i rightly guessed to be the entrance to the temple it is a very large space containing many large solemn and serious edifices of dark brick and no sooner do you pass under the arch than all the rumble and bustle of london dies away at once and it seems as if a person might live there in perfect quiet without suspecting that it was not always a sabbath people appear to have their separate residences here but i do not understand what is the economy of their lives quite in the deepest interior of this region there is a large garden bordering on the thames along which it has a gravelwalk and benches where it would be pleasant to sit on one edge of the garden there is some scanty shrubbery and flowers of no great brilliancy and the greensward with which the garden is mostly covered is not particularly rich nor verdant emerging from the temple i stopped at a tavern in the strand the waiter of which observed to me they say sebastopol is taken sir it was only such an interesting event that could have induced an english waiter to make a remark to a stranger not called for in the way of business the best view we had of the town in fact the only external view and the only time we really saw the white tower was from the river as we steamed past it here the high square battlemented white tower with the four turrets at its corners rises prominently above all other parts of the fortress september th mr the american minister called on me on tuesday and left his card an intimation that i ought sooner to have paid my respects to him so yesterday forenoon i set out to find his residence harley street it is a street out of cavendish square in a fashionable quarter although fashion is said to be ebbing away from it the ambassador seems to intend some little state in his arrangements but no doubt the establishment compares shabbily enough with those of the legations of other great countries and with the houses of the english aristocracy a servant not in livery or in a very unrecognizable one opened the door for me and gave my card to a sort of upper attendant who took it in to mr he had three gentlemen with him so desired that i should be ushered into the office of the legation until he should be able to receive me here i found a clerk or attache mr m who has been two or three years on this side of the water an intelligent person who seems to be in correspondence with the new york courier and enquirer by and by came in another american to get a passport for the continent and soon the three gentlemen took leave of the ambassador and i was invited to his presence the tall large figure of mrhas a certain air of state and dignity he carries his head in a very awkward way but still looks like a man of long and high authority and with his white hair is now quite venerable there is certainly a lack of polish a kind of rusticity notwithstanding which you feel him to be a man of the world i should think he might succeed very tolerably in english society being heavy and sensible cool kindly and goodhumored with a great deal of experience of life we talked about various matters politics among the rest and he observed that if the president had taken the advice which he gave him in two long letters before his inauguration he would have had a perfectly quiet and successful term of office the advice was to form a perfectly homogeneous cabinet of union men and to satisfy the extremes of the party by a fair distribution of minor offices whereas he formed his cabinet of extreme men on both sides and gave the minor offices to moderate ones but the antislavery people surely had no representative in the cabinet mrfurther observed that he thought the president had a fair chance of renomination for that the south could not in honor desert him to which i replied that the south had been guilty of such things heretofore mrthinks that the next presidential term will be more important and critical both as to our foreign relations and internal affairs than any preceding one which i should judge likely enough to be the case although i heard the sane prophecy often made respecting the present term the ambassador dined with us at rock park a year or two ago and i then felt and always feel as if he were a man of hearty feeling and simplicity and certainly it would be unjust to conclude otherwise merely from the fact very suspicious it is true of his having been a lifelong politician after we had got through a little matter of business respecting a young american who has enlisted at liverpool the minister rang his bell and ordered another visitor to be admitted and so i took my leave in the other room i found the secretary of legation a tall slender man of about forty with a small head and face gentlemanly enough sensible and well informed yet i should judge not quite up to his place there was also a dr bfrom michigan present and i rather fancy the ambassador is quite as much bored with visitors as the consul at liverpool before i left the office mrcame in with miss sarah clarke on his arm she had come thither to get her passport vised and when her business was concluded we went out together she was going farther towards the west end and i into the city so we soon parted and i lost myself among the streets and squares arriving at last at oxford street though even then i did not know whether my face were turned cityward or in the opposite direction crossing regent street however i became sure of my whereabout and went on through holborn and sought hither and thither for grace church street in order to find the american consul general campbell for i needed his aid to get a bank postbill cashed but i could not find the street go where i would so at last i went to no cheapside and introduced myself to mr whom i already knew by letter and by a good many of his poems which he has sent me and by two excellent watches which i bought of him this establishment though it has the ordinary front of dingy brick common to buildings in the city looks like a timelong stand the old shop of a london tradesman with a large figure of a watch over the door a great many watches and yet no gorgeous show of them in the window a low dark front shop and a little room behind where there was a chair or two mris a small slender young man quite unenglish in aspect with black curly hair a thin dark colorless visage very animated and of quick expression with a nervous temperament he dismounted from a desk when my card was handed to him and turned to me with a vivid glad look of recognition we talked in the first place about poetry and such matters about england and america and the nature and depth of their mutual dislike and of course the slavery question came up as it always does in one way or another anon i produced my bank postbill and mrkindly engaged to identify me at the bank being ready to swear to me he said on the strength of my resemblance to my engraved portrait so we set out for the bank of england and arriving there were directed to the proper clerk after much inquiry but he told us that the bill was not yet due having been drawn at seven days and having two still to run which was the fact as i was almost shillingless mrnow offered to cash it for me he is very kind and good arriving at his shop again he went out to procure the money and soon returned with it at my departure he gave me a copy of a new poem of his entitled verdicts somewhat in the manner of lowells satire mrresides now at greenwich whither he hoped i would come and see him on my return to london perhaps i will for i like him it seems strange to see an englishman with so little physical ponderosity and obtuseness of nerve after parting from him it being three oclock or thereabouts i resumed my wanderings about the city of which i never weary as long as i can put one foot before the other seeing that the door of st pauls under one of the semicircular porches was partially open i went in and found that the afternoon service was about to be performed so i remained to hear it and to see what i could of the cathedral what a total and admirable contrast between this and a gothic church the latter so dim and mysterious with its various aisles its intricacy of pointed arches its dark walls and columns and pavement and its painted glass windows bedimming even what daylight might otherwise get into its eternal evening but this cathedral was full of light and light was proper to it there were no painted windows no dim recesses but a wide and airy space beneath the dome and even through the long perspective of the nave there was no obscurity but one lofty and beautifully rounded arch succeeding to another as far as the eye could reach the walls were white the pavement constructed of squares of gray and white marble it is a most grand and stately edifice and its characteristic stems to be to continue forever fresh and new whereas such a church as westminster abbey must have been as venerable as it is now from the first day when it grew to be an edifice at all how wonderful man is in his works how glad i am that there can be two such admirable churches in their opposite styles as st pauls and westminster abbey the organ was played while i was there and there was an anthem beautifully chanted by voices that came from afar off and remotely above as if out of a sunny sky meanwhile i looked at such monuments as were near chiefly those erected to military or naval men picton general ponsonby lord st vincent and others but against one of the pillars stands a statue of dr johnson a noble and thoughtful figure with a development of muscle befitting an athlete i doubt whether sculptors do not err in point of taste by making all their statues models of physical perfection instead of expressing by them the individual character and habits of the man the statue in the marketplace at lichfield has more of the homely truth of johnsons actual personality than this st pauls as yet is by no means crowded with monuments there is indeed plenty of room for a mob of the illustrious yet to come but it seems to me that the character of the edifice would be injured by allowing the monuments to be clustered together so closely as at westminster by incrusting the walls with them or letting the statues throng about the pedestals of columns there must be no confusion in such a cathedral as this and i question whether the effect will ever be better than it is now when each monument has its distinct place and as your eye wanders around you are not distracted from noting each marble man in his niche against the wall or at the base of a marble pillar space distance light regularity are to be preserved even if the result should be a degree of nakedness i saw mr appleton of the legation and dr brown on the floor of the cathedral they were about to go over the whole edifice and had engaged a guide for that purpose but as i intend to go thither again with s i did not accompany them but went away the quicker that one of the gentlemen put on his hat and i was ashamed of being seen in company with a man who could wear his hat in a cathedral not that he meant any irreverence but simply felt that he was in a great public building as big nearly as all out of doors and so forgot that it was a consecrated place of worship the sky is the dome of a greater cathedral than st pauls and built by a greater architect than sir christopher wren and yet we wear our hats unscrupulously beneath it i remember no other event of importance except that i penetrated into a narrow lane or court either in the strand or fleet street where was a tavern calling itself the old thatched house and purporting to have been nell gwyns dairy i met with a great many alleys and obscure archways in the course of the days wanderings september th yesterday in the earlier part of the day it poured with rain and i did not go out till five oclock in the afternoon nor did i then meet with anything interesting i walked through albemarle street for the purpose of looking at murrays shop but missed it entirely at my first inquisition the street is one of hotels principally with only a few tradesmens shops and has a quiet aristocratic aspect on my return down the other sidewalk i did discover the famous publishers locality but merely by the name mr murray engraved on a rather large brass plate such as doctors use on the door there was no sign of a book nor of its being a place of trade in any way and i should have taken the house to be if not a private mansion then a lawyers office at seven oclock s u and i went to dine with mr r sin portland place mr ss house is a very fine one and he gave us a very quiet elegant and enjoyable dinner in much better taste and with less fuss than some others we have attended elsewhere mr sis a friend of thackeray and speaking of the last number of the newcomes so touching that nobody can read it aloud without breaking down he mentioned that thackeray himself had read it to james russell lowell and william story in a cidercellar i read all the preceding numbers of the newcomes to my wife but happened not to have an opportunity to read this last and was glad of it knowing that my eyes would fill and my voice quiver mr slikes thackeray and thinks him a good fellow mr shas a or i dont know but i ought better to say the beautiful fulllength picture of washington by stuart and i was proud to see that noblest face and figure here in england the picture of a man beside whom considered physically any english nobleman whom i have seen would look like common clay speaking of thackeray i cannot but wonder at his coolness in respect to his own pathos and compare it with my emotions when i read the last scene of the scarlet letter to my wife just after writing it tried to read it rather for my voice swelled and heaved as if i were tossed up and down on an ocean as it subsides after a storm but i was in a very nervous state then having gone through a great diversity of emotion while writing it for many months i think i have never overcome my own adamant in any other instance tumblers handorganists puppetshowmen bagpipers and all such vagrant mirthmakers are very numerous in the streets of london the other day passing through fleet street i saw a crowd filling up a narrow court and high above their heads a tumbler standing on his head on the top of a pole that reached as high as the third story of the neighboring houses sliding down the pole head foremost he disappeared out of my sight a multitude of punches go the mounds continually two have passed through hanover street where we reside this morning the first asked two shillings for his performance so we sent him away the second demanded in the first place half a crown but finally consented to take a shilling and gave us the show at that price though much maimed in its proportions besides the spectators in our windows he had a little crowd on the sidewalk to whom he went round for contributions but i did not observe that anybody gave him so much as a halfpenny it is strange to see how many people are aiming at the small change in your pocket in every square a beggarwoman meets you and turns back to follow your steps with her miserable murmur at the streetcrossings there are old men or little girls with their brooms urchins propose to brush your boots and if you get into a cab a man runs to open the door for you and touches his hat for a fee as he closes it again september th it was raining yesterday and i kept within doors till after four oclock when j and i took a walk into the city seeing the entrance to clements inn we went through it and saw the garden with a kneeling bronze figure in it and when just in the midst of the inn i remembered that justice shallow was of old a student there i do not well understand these inns of court or how they differ from other places anybody seems to be free to reside in them and a residence does not seem to involve any obligation to study law or to have any connection therewith clements inn consists of large brick houses accessible by narrow lanes and passages but by some peculiar privilege or enchantment enjoying a certain quiet and repose though in close vicinity to the noisiest part of the city i got bewildered in the neighborhood of st pauls and try how i might to escape from it its huge dusky dome kept showing itself before me through one street and another in my endeavors to escape it i at one time found myself in st johns street and was in hopes to have seen the old st johns gate so familiar for above a century on the cover of the gentlemans magazine but i suppose it is taken down for we went through the entire street i think and saw no trace of it either afterwards or before this we came upon smithfield a large irregular square filled up with pens for cattle of which however there were none in the market at that time i leaned upon a post at the western end of the square and told j how the martyrs had been burnt at smithfield in bloody marys days again we drifted back to st pauls and at last in despair of ever getting out of this enchanted region i took a hansom cab to charing cross whence we easily made our way home liverpool september th i took the tenoclock train yesterday morning from the euston station and arrived at liverpool at about five passing through the valley of trent without touching at birmingham english scenery on the tracks is the tamest of the tame hardly a noticeable hill breaking the ordinary gentle undulation of the landscape but still the verdure and finish of the fields and parks make it worth while to throw out a glance now and then as you rush by few separate houses are seen as in america but sometimes a village with the square gray battlemented tower of its norman church and rows of thatched cottages reminding one of the clustered mudnests of swallows under the eaves of a barn here and there a lazy little river like the trent perhaps if you look sharply where the guidebook indicates the turrets of an old castle in the distance perhaps the great steeple and spires of a cathedral perhaps the tall chimney of a manufactory but on the whole the traveller comes to his journeys end unburdened with a single new idea i observe that the harvest is not all gathered in as yet and this rainy weather must look very gloomy to the farmer i saw gleaners yesterday in the stubblefields there were two gentlemen in the same railwaycarriage with me and we did not exchange half a dozen words the whole day i am here established at mrs blodgetts boardinghouse which i find quite full insomuch that she had to send one of her seacaptains to sleep in another house in order to make room for me it is exclusively american society four shipmasters and a doctor from pennsylvania who has been travelling a year on the continent and who seems to be a man of very active intelligence interested in everything and especially in agriculture he asserted that we are fifty years ahead of england in agricultural science and that he could cultivate english soil to far better advantage than english farmers do and at vastly less expense their tendency to cling to old ideas which retards them in everything else keeps them behindhand in this matter too really i do not know any other place in england where a man can be made so sensible that he lives in a progressive world as here in mrs blodgetts boardinghouse the captains talk together about their voyages and how they manage with their unruly mates and crews and how freights are in america and the prospects of business and of equinoctial gales and the qualities of different ships and their commanders and how crews mates and masters have all deteriorated since their remembrance but these men are alive and talk of real matters and of matters which they know the shipmasters who come to mrs blodgetts are favorable specimens of their class being all respectable men in the employ of good houses and raised by their capacity to the command of firstrate ships in my official intercourse with them i do not generally see their best side as they are seldom before me except as complainants or when summoned to answer to some complaint made by a seaman but hearing their daily talk and listening to what is in their minds and their reminiscences of what they have gone through one becomes sensible that they are men of energy and ability fit to be trusted and retaining a hardy sense of honor and a loyalty to their own country the stronger because they have compared it with many others most of them are gentlemen too to a certain extent some more than others perhaps and none to a very exquisite point or if so it is none the better for them as sailors or as men september th it is singular to feel a sense of my own country returning upon me with the intercourse of the people whom i find here the doctor is much the most talkative of our company and sometimes bores me thereby though he seldom says anything that is not either instructive or amusing he tells a curious story of prince albert and how he avails himself of american sharpshooting during the doctors tour in scotland which he has just finished he became acquainted with one of the princes attaches who invited him very earnestly to join his royal highnesss party promising him a good gun and a keeper to load it for him two good dogs besides as many cigars as he could smoke and as much wine as he could drink on the condition that whatever game he shot should be the princes the prince said the attache is very fond of having americans in his shootingparties on account of their being such excellent shots and there was one with him last year who shot so admirably that his royal highness himself left off shooting in utter astonishment the attache offered to introduce the doctor to the prince who would be certain to receive him very graciously i think perhaps we talk of kings and queens more at our table than people do at other tables in england not of course that we like them better or admire them more but that they are curiosities yet i would not say that the doctor may not be susceptible on the point of royal attentions for he told us with great complacency how emphatically on two or three occasions louis napoleon had returned his bow and the last time had turned and made some remark evidently about the doctor to the empress i ought not to omit mentioning that he has been told in france that he personally resembles the emperor and i suspect he is trying to heighten the resemblance by training his mustache on the pattern of that which adorns the imperial upper lip he is a genuine american character though modified by a good deal of travel a very intelligent man full of various ability with eyes all over him for any object of interest a little of the bore sometimes quick to appreciate character with a good deal of tact gentlemanly in his manners but yet lacking a deep and delicate refinement not but that americans are as capable of this last quality as other people are but what with the circumstances amid which we grow up and the peculiar activity of our minds we certainly do often miss it by the by he advanced a singular proposition the other evening namely that the english people do not so well understand comfort or attain it so perfectly in their domestic arrangements as we do i thought he hardly supported this opinion so satisfactorily as some of his other new ideas i saw in an american paper yesterday that an opera still unfinished had been written on the story of the scarlet letter and that several scenes of it had been performed successfully in new york i should think it might possibly succeed as an opera though it would certainly fail as a play london september th on saturday at half past three oclock i left liverpool by the london and northwest railway for london mrs blodgetts table had been thinned by several departures during the week my mind had been considerably enlivened and my sense of american superiority renewed by intercourse with these people and there is no danger of ones intellect becoming a standing pool in such society i think better of american shipmasters too than i did from merely meeting them in my office they keep up a continual discussion of professional matters and of all things having any reference to their profession the laws of insurance the rights of vessels in foreign ports the authority and customs of vessels of war with regard to merchantmen etc with stories and casual anecdotes of their seaadventures gales shipwrecks icebergs and collisions of vessels and hairbreadth escapes their talk runs very much on the sea and on the land as connected with the sea and their interest does not seem to extend very far beyond the wide field of their professional concerns nothing remarkable occurred on the journey to london the greater part of the way there were only two gentlemen in the same compartment with me and we occupied each our corner with little other conversation than in comparing watches at the various stations i got out of the carriage only once at rugby i think and for the last seventy or eighty miles the train did not stop there was a clear moon the latter part of the journey and the mist lay along the ground looking very much like a surface of water we reached london at about ten and i found s expecting me yesterday the children went with fanny to the zoological gardens and after sending them off s and i walked to piccadilly and there took a cab for kensington gardens it was a delightful day the best of all weather the real english good weather more like an indian summer than anything else within my experience a mellow sunshine with great warmth in it a soft balmy air with a slight haze through it if the sun made us a little too warm we had but to go into the shade to be immediately refreshed the light of these days is very exquisite so gently bright without any glare a veiled glow in short it is the kindliest mood of nature and almost enough to compensate for chill and dreary months moreover there is more of such weather here than the english climate has ever had credit for kensington gardens form an eminently beautiful piece of artificial woodland and park scenery the old palace of kensington now inhabited by the duchess of inverness stands at one extremity an edifice of no great mark built of brick covering much ground and low in proportion to its extent in front of it at a considerable distance there is a sheet of water and in all directions there are vistas of wide paths among noble trees standing in groves or scattered in clumps everything being laid out with free and generous spaces so that you can see long streams of sunshine among the trees and there is a pervading influence of quiet and remoteness tree does not interfere with tree the art of man is seen conspiring with nature as if they had consulted together how to make a beautiful scene and had taken ages of quiet thought and tender care to accomplish it we strolled slowly along these paths and sometimes deviated from them to walk beneath the trees many of the leaves of which lay beneath our feet yellow and brown and with a pleasant smell of vegetable decay these were the leaves of chestnuttrees the other trees unless elms have yet hardly begun to shed their foliage although you can discern a sober change of line in the woodland masses and the trees individualize themselves by assuming each its own tint though in a very modest way if they could have undergone the change of an american autumn it would have been like putting on a regal robe autumn often puts one on in america but it is apt to be very ragged there were a good many welldressed people scattered through the grounds young men and girls husbands with their wives and children nurserymaids and little babes playing about in the grass anybody might have entered the gardens i suppose but only welldressed people were there not of the upper classes but shopkeepers clerks apprentices and respectability of that sort it is pleasant to think that the people have the freedom and therefore the property of parks like this more beautiful and stately than a nobleman can keep to himself the extent of kensington gardens when reckoned together with hyde park from which it is separated only by a fence of iron rods is very great comprising miles of greensward and woodland the large artificial sheet of water called the serpentine river lies chiefly in hyde park but comes partly within the precincts of the gardens it is entitled to honorable mention among the english lakes being larger than some that are worldcelebrated several miles long and perhaps a stonesthrow across in the widest part it forms the paradise of a great many ducks of various breeds which are accustomed to be fed by visitors and come flying from afar touching the water with their wings and quacking loudly when bread or cake is thrown to them i bought a bun of a little hunchbacked man who kept a refreshmentstall near the serpentine and bestowed it piedmeal on these ducks as we loitered along the bank we left the park by another gate and walked homeward till we came to tyburnia and saw the iron memorial which marks where the gallows used to stand thence we turned into park lane then into upper grosvenor street and reached hanover square sooner than we expected in the evening i walked forth to charing cross and thence along the strand and fleet street where i made no new discoveries unless it were the mitre tavern i mean to go into it some day the streets were much thronged and there seemed to be a good many young people lovers it is to be hoped who had spent the day together and were going innocently home perhaps so perhaps not september th yesterday forenoon j and i walked out with no very definite purpose but seeing a narrow passageway from the strand down to the river we went through it and gained access to a steamboat plying thence to london bridge the fare was a halfpenny apiece and the boat almost too much crowded for standingroom this part of the river presents the waterside of london in a rather pleasanter aspect than below london bridge the temple with its garden somerset house and generally a less tumbledown and neglected look about the buildings although after all the metropolis does not see a very stately face in its mirror i saw alsatia betwixt the temple and blackfriars bridge its precincts looked very narrow and not particularly distinguishable at this day from the portions of the city on either side of it at london bridge we got aboard of a woolwich steamer and went farther down the river passing the customhouse and the tower the only prominent objects rising out of the dreary range of shabbiness which stretches along close to the waters edge from this remote part of london we walked towards the heart of the city and as we went matters seemed to civilize themselves by degrees and the streets grew crowded with cabs omnibuses drays and carts we passed i think through whitechapel and reaching st pauls got into an omnibus and drove to regent street whence it was but a step or two home in the afternoon at four oclock s and i went to call on the american ambassador and miss l the lady was not at home but we went in to see mrand were shown into a stately drawingroom the furniture of which was sufficiently splendid but rather the worse for wear being hired furniture no doubt the ambassador shortly appeared looking venerable as usual or rather more so than usual benign and very pale his deportment towards ladies is highly agreeable and prepossessing and he paid very kind attention to s thereby quite confirming her previous good feeling towards him she thinks that he is much changed since she saw him last at dinner at our house more infirm more aged and with a singular depression in his manner i too think that age has latterly come upon him with great rapidity he said that miss lwas going home on the th of october and that he himself had long purposed going but had received despatches which obliged him to put off his departure the president he said had just written requesting him to remain till april but this he was determined not to do i rather think that he does really wish to return and not for any ambitious views concerning the presidency but from an old mans natural desire to be at home and among his own people s spoke to him about an order from the lord chamberlain for admission to view the two houses of parliament and the ambassador drew from his pocket a colored silk handkerchief and made a knot in it in order to remind himself to ask the lord chamberlain the homeliness of this little incident has a sort of propriety and keeping with much of mr s manner but i would rather not have him do so before english people he arranged to send a close carriage for us to come and see him socially this evening after leaving his house we drove round hyde park and thence to portland place where we left cards for mrs russell sturgis thence into regents park thence home u and j accompanied us throughout these drives but remained in the carriage during our call on mr in the evening i strolled out and walked as far as st pauls never getting enough of the bustle of london which may weary but can never satisfy me by night london looks wild and dreamy and fills me with a sort of pleasant dread it was a clear evening with a bright english moon that is to say what we americans should call rather dim september th yesterday at eleven i walked towards westminster abbey and as i drew near the abbey bells were clamorous for joy chiming merrily musically and obstreperously the most rejoicing sound that can be conceived and we ought to have a chime of bells in every american town and village were it only to keep alive the celebration of the fourth of july i conjectured that there might have been another victory over the russians that perhaps the northern side of sebastopol had surrendered but soon i saw the riddle that these merry bells were proclaiming there were a great many private carriages and a large concourse of loungers and spectators near the door of the church that stands close under the eaves of the abbey gentlemen and ladies gayly dressed were issuing forth carriages driving away and others drawing up to the door in their turn and in short a marriage had just been celebrated in the church and this was the weddingparty the last time i was there westminster was flinging out its great voice of joy for a national triumph now for the happy union of two lovers what a mighty sympathizer is this old abbey it is pleasant to recognize the mould and fashion of english features through the marble of many of the statues and busts in the abbey even though they may be clad in roman robes i am inclined to think them in many cases faithful likenesses and it brings them nearer to the mind to see these original sculptures you see the man at but one remove as if you caught his image in a lookingglass the bust of gay seemed to me very good a thoughtful and humorous sweetness in the face goldsmith has as good a position as any poet in the abbey his bust and tablet filling the pointed arch over a door that seems to lead towards the cloisters no doubt he would have liked to be assured of so conspicuous a place there is one monument to a native american charles wragg esq of south carolina the only one i suspect in westminster abbey and he acquired this memorial by the most unamerican of qualities his loyalty to his king he was one of the refugees leaving america in and being shipwrecked on his passage the monument was put up by his sister it is a small tablet with a representation of mr wraggs shipwreck at the base next to it is the large monument of sir cloudesley shovel which i think addison ridicules the admiral in a fullbottomed wig and roman dress but with a broad english face reclining with his head on his hand and looking at you with great placidity i stood at either end of the nave and endeavored to take in the full beauty and majesty of the edifice but apparently was not in a proper state of mind for nothing came of it it is singular how like an avenue of overarching trees are these lofty aisles of a cathedral leaving the abbey about one oclock i walked into the city as far as grace church street and there called on the american consul general who had been warmly introduced to me last year by a letter from the president i like the general a kindly and honorable man of simple manners and large experience of life afterwards i called on mr oakford an american connected in business with mr crosby from whom i wanted some information as to the sailing of steamers from southampton to lisbon mr crosby was not in town at eight oclock mrsent his carriage according to previous arrangement to take us to spend the evening socially miss lreceived us with proper cordiality and looked quite becomingly more sweet and simple in aspect than when i have seen her in full dress shortly the ambassador appeared and made himself highly agreeable not that he is a brilliant conversationist but his excellent sense and goodhumor and all that he has seen and been a part of are sufficient resources to draw upon we talked of the queen whom he spoke of with high respect of the late czar whom he knew intimately while minister to russia and he quite confirms all that has been said about the awful beauty of his person mr s characterization of him was quite favorable he thought better of his heart than most people and adduced his sports with a school of children twenty of whom perhaps he made to stand rigidly in a row like so many bricks then giving one a push would laugh obstreperously to see the whole row tumble down he would lie on his back and allow the little things to scramble over him his majesty admitted mrto great closeness of intercourse and informed him of a conspiracy which was then on foot for the czars murder on the evening when the assassination was to take place the czar did not refrain from going to the public place where it was to be perpetrated although indeed great precautions had been taken to frustrate the schemes of the conspirators mrsaid that in case the plot had succeeded all the foreigners including himself would likewise have been murdered the native russians having a bitter hatred against foreigners he observed that he had been much attached to the czar and had never joined in the english abuse of him his sympathies however are evidently rather english than russian in this war speaking of the present emperor he said that lord heytebury formerly english ambassador in russia lately told him that he complimented the czar nicholas on the good qualities of his son saying that he was acknowledged by all to be one of the most amiable youths in the world too amiable i fear for his position answered the czar he has too much of his mother in him september th yesterday much earlier than english people ever do such things generalmade us a call on his way to the consulate and sat talking a stricken hour or thereabouts scarcely had he gone when mrs oakford and her daughter came after sitting a long while they took u to their house near st johns wood to spend the night i had been writing my journal and official correspondence during such intervals as these calls left me and now concluding these businesses s j and i went out and took a cab for the terminus of the crystal palace railway whither we proceeded over waterloo bridge and reached the palace not far from three oclock it was a beautifully bright day such as we have in wonderful succession this month the crystal palace gleamed in the sunshine but i do not think a very impressive edifice can be built of glass light and airy to be sure but still it will be no other than an overgrown conservatory it is unlike anything else in england uncongenial with the english character without privacy destitute of mass weight and shadow unsusceptible of ivy lichens or any mellowness from age the train of carriages stops within the domain of the palace where there is a long ascending corridor up into the edifice there was a very pleasant odor of heliotrope diffused through the air and indeed the whole atmosphere of the crystal palace is sweet with various flowerscents and mild and balmy though sufficiently fresh and cool it would be a delightful climate for invalids to spend the winter in and if all england could be roofed over with glass it would be a great improvement on its present condition the first thing we did before fairly getting into the palace was to sit down in a large antehall and get some bread and butter and a pint of basss pale ale together with a cup of coffee for s this was the best refreshment we could find at that spot but farther within we found abundance of refreshmentrooms and john bull and his wife and family at fifty little round tables busily engaged with cold fowl cold beef ham tongue and bottles of ale and stout and halfpint decanters of sherry the english probably eat with more simple enjoyment than any other people not ravenously as we often do and not exquisitely and artificially like the french but deliberately and vigorously and with due absorption in the business so that nothing good is lost upon them it is remarkable how large a feature the refreshmentrooms make in the arrangements of the crystal palace the crystal palace is a gigantic toy for the english people to play with the design seems to be to reproduce all past ages by representing the features of their interior architecture costume religion domestic life and everything that can be expressed by paint and plaster and likewise to bring all climates and regions of the earth within these enchanted precincts with their inhabitants and animals in living semblance and their vegetable productions as far as possible alive and real some part of the design is already accomplished to a wonderful degree the indian the egyptian and especially the arabian courts are admirably executed i never saw or conceived anything so gorgeous as the alhambra there are byzantine and mediaeval representations too reproductions of ancient apartments decorations statues from tombs monuments religious and funereal that gave me new ideas of what antiquity has been it takes down ones overweening opinion of the present time to see how many kinds of beauty and magnificence have heretofore existed and are now quite passed away and forgotten and to find that we who suppose that in all matters of taste our age is the very flowerseason of the time that we are poor and meagre as to many things in which they were rich there is nothing gorgeous now we live a very naked life this was the only reflection i remember making as we passed from century to century through the succession of classic oriental and mediaeval courts adown the lapse of time seeing all these ages in as brief a space as the wandering jew might glance along them in his memory i suppose a pompeian house with its courts and interior apartments was as faithfully shown as it was possible to do it i doubt whether i ever should feel at home in such a house in the pool of a fountain of which there are several beautiful ones within the palace besides larger ones in the garden before it we saw tropical plants growing large waterlilies of various colors some white like our concord pondlily only larger and more numerously leafed there were great circular green leaves lying flat on the water with a circumference equal to that of a centretable tropical trees too varieties of palm and others grew in immense pots or tubs but seemed not to enjoy themselves much the atmosphere must after all be far too cool to bring out their native luxuriance and this difficulty can never be got over at a less expense than that of absolutely stewing the visitors and attendants otherwise it would be very practicable to have all the vegetable world at least within these precincts the palace is very large and our time was short it being desirable to get home early so after a stay of little more than two hours we took the rail back again and reached hanover square at about six after tea i wandered forth with some thought of going to the theatre and passing the entrance of one in the strand i went in and found a farce in progress it was one of the minor theatres very minor indeed but the pieces so far as i saw them were sufficiently laughable there were some spanish dances too very graceful and pretty between the plays a girl from the neighboring saloon came to the doors of the boxes offering lemonade and gingerbeer to the occupants a person in my box took a glass of lemonade and shared it with a young lady by his side both sipping out of the same glass the audience seemed rather heavy not briskly responsive to the efforts of the performers but goodnatured and willing to be pleased especially with some patriotic dances in which much waving and intermingling of the french and english flags was introduced theatrical performances soon weary me of late years and i came away before the curtain rose on the concluding piece september th and i walked to charing cross yesterday forenoon and there took a hansom cab to st pauls cathedral it had been a thick foggy morning but had warmed and brightened into one of the balmiest and sunniest of noons as we entered the cathedral the long bars of sunshine were falling from its upper windows through the great interior atmosphere and were made visible by the dust or mist floating about in it it is a grand edifice and i liked it quite as much as on my first view of it although a sense of coldness and nakedness is felt when we compare it with gothic churches it is more an external work than the gothic churches are and is not so made out of the dim awful mysterious grotesque intricate nature of man but it is beautiful and grand i love its remote distances and wide clear spaces its airy massiveness its noble arches its skylike dome which i think should be all over light with groundglass instead of being dark with only diminutive windows we walked round looking at the monuments which are so arranged at the bases of columns and in niches as to coincide with the regularity of the cathedral and be each an additional ornament to the whole however defective individually as works of art we thought that many of these monuments were striking and impressive though there was a pervading sameness of idea a great many victorys and valors and britannias and a great expenditure of wreaths which must have cost victory a considerable sum at any florists whom she patronizes a very great majority of the memorials are to naval and military men slain in bonapartes wars men in whom one feels little or no interest except picton abercrombie moore nelson of course and a few others really historic they having done nothing remarkable save having been shot nor shown any more brains than the cannonballs that killed them all the statues have the dust of years upon then strewn thickly in the folds of their marble garments and on any limb stretched horizontally and on their noses so that the expression is much obscured i think the nation might employ people to brush away the dust from the statues of its heroes but on the whole it is very fine to look through the broad arches of the cathedral and see at the foot of some distant pillar a group of sculptured figures commemorating some man and deed that whether worth remembering or not the nation is so happy as to reverence in westminster abbey the monuments are so crowded and so oddly patched together upon the walls that they are ornamental only in a mural point of view and moreover the quaint and grotesque taste of many of them might well make the spectator laugh an effect not likely to be produced by the monuments in st pauls but after all a man might read the walls of the abbey day after day with everfresh interest whereas the cold propriety of the cathedral would weary him in due time we did not ascend to the galleries and other points of interest aloft nor go down into the vaults where nelsons sarcophagus is shown and many monuments of the old gothic cathedral which stood on this site before the great fire they say that these lower regions are comfortably warm and dry but as we walked round in front within the iron railing of the churchyard we passed an open door giving access to the crypt and it breathed out a chill like death upon us it is pleasant to stand in the centre of the cathedral and hear the noise of london loudest all round this spot how it is calmed into a sound as proper to be heard through the aisles as the tones of its own organ if st pauls were to be burnt again having already been bunt and risen three or four times since the sixth century i wonder whether it would ever be rebuilt in the same spot i doubt whether the city and the nation are so religious as to consecrate their midmost heart for the site of a church where land would be so valuable by the square inch coming from the cathedral we went through paternoster row and saw ave mary lane all this locality appearing to have got its nomenclature from monkish personages we now took a cab for the british museum but found this to be one of the days on which strangers are not admitted so we slowly walked into oxford street and then strolled homeward till coming to a sort of bazaar we went in and found a gallery of pictures this bazaar proved to be the pantheon and the first picture we saw in the gallery was haydons resurrection of lazarus a great height and breadth of canvas right before you as you ascend the stairs the face of lazarus is very awful and not to be forgotten it is as true as if the painter had seen it or had been himself the resurrected man and felt it but the rest of the picture signified nothing and is vulgar and disagreeable besides there are several other pictures by haydon in this collection the banishment of aristides nero with his harp and the conflagration of rome but the last is perfectly ridiculous and all of them are exceedingly unpleasant i should be sorry to live in a house that contained one of them the best thing of haydon was a hasty dash of a sketch for a small fulllength portrait of wordsworth sitting on the crag of a mountain i doubt whether wordsworths likeness has ever been so poetically brought out this gallery is altogether of modern painters and it seems to be a receptacle for pictures by artists who can obtain places nowhere else at least i never heard of their names before they were very uninteresting almost without exception and yet some of the pictures were done cleverly enough there is very little talent in this world and what there is it seems to me is pretty well known and acknowledged we dont often stumble upon geniuses in obscure corners leaving the gallery we wandered through the rest of the bazaar which is devoted to the sale of ladies finery jewels perfumes childrens toys and all manner of small and pretty rubbish in the evening i again sallied forth and lost myself for an hour or two at last recognizing my whereabouts in tottenham court road in such quarters of london it seems to be the habit of people to take their suppers in the open air you see old women at the corners with kettles of hot water for tea or coffee and as i passed a butchers open shop he was just taking out large quantities of boiled beef smoking hot butchers stands are remarkable for their profuse expenditure of gas it belches forth from the pipes in great flaring jets of flame uncovered by any glass and broadly illuminating the neighborhood i have not observed that london ever goes to bed september th yesterday we walked to the british museum a sentinel or two kept guard before the gateway of this extensive edifice in great russell street and there was a porter at the lodge and one or two policemen lounging about but entrance was free and we walked in without question officials and policemen were likewise scattered about the great entrancehall none of whom however interfered with us so we took whatever way we chose and wandered about at will it is a hopeless and to me generally a depressing business to go through an immense multifarious show like this glancing at a thousand things and conscious of some little titillation of mind from them but really taking in nothing and getting no good from anything one need not go beyond the limits of the british museum to be profoundly accomplished in all branches of science art and literature only it would take a lifetime to exhaust it in any one department but to see it as we did and with no prospect of ever seeing it more at leisure only impressed me with the truth of the old apothegm life is short and art is long the fact is the world is accumulating too many materials for knowledge we do not recognize for rubbish what is really rubbish and under this head might be reckoned very many things one sees in the british museum and as each generation leaves its fragments and potsherds behind it such will finally be the desperate conclusion of the learned we went first among some antique marbles busts statues terminal gods with several of the roman emperors among them we saw here the bust whence haydon took his ugly and ridiculous likeness of nero a foolish thing to do julius caesar was there too looking more like a modern old man than any other bust in the series perhaps there may be a universality in his face that gives it this independence of race and epoch we glimpsed along among the old marbles elgin and others which are esteemed such treasures of art the oddest fragments many of them smashed by their fall from high places or by being pounded to pieces by barbarians or gnawed away by time the surface roughened by being rained upon for thousands of years almost always a nose knocked off sometimes a headless form a great deficiency of feet and hands poor maimed veterans in this hospital of incurables the beauty of the most perfect of them must be rather guessed at and seen by faith than with the bodily eye to look at the corroded faces and forms is like trying to see angels through mist and cloud i suppose nine tenths of those who seem to be in raptures about these fragments do not really care about them neither do i and if i were actually moved i should doubt whether it were by the statues or by my own fancy we passed too through assyrian saloons and egyptian saloons all full of monstrosities and horrible uglinesses especially the egyptian and all the innumerable relics that i saw of them in these saloons and among the mummies instead of bringing me closer to them removed me farther and farther there being no common ground of sympathy between them and us their gigantic statues are certainly very curious i saw a hand and arm up to the shoulder fifteen feet in length and made of some stone that seemed harder and heavier than granite not having lost its polish in all the rough usage that it has undergone there was a fist on a still larger scale almost as big as a hogshead hideous blubberlipped faces of giants and human shapes with beasts heads on them the egyptian controverted nature in all things only using it as a groundwork to depict the unnatural upon their mummifying process is a result of this tendency we saw one very perfect mummy a priestess with apparently only one more fold of linen betwixt us and her antique flesh and this fitting closely to her person from head to foot so that we could see the lineaments of her face and the shape of her limbs as perfectly as if quite bare i judge that she may have been very beautiful in her day whenever that was one or two of the poor things toes her feet were wonderfully small and delicate protruded from the linen and perhaps not having been so perfectly embalmed the flesh had fallen away leaving only some little bones i dont think this young woman has gained much by not turning to dust in the time of the pharaohs we also saw some bones of a king that had been taken out of a pyramid a very fragmentary skeleton among the classic marbles i peeped into an urn that once contained the ashes of dead people and the bottom still had an ashy hue i like this mode of disposing of dead bodies but it would be still better to burn them and scatter the ashes instead of hoarding them up to scatter them over wheatfields or flowerbeds besides these antique halls we wandered through saloons of antediluvian animals some set up in skeletons others imprisoned in solid stone also specimens of still extant animals birds reptiles shells minerals the whole circle of human knowledge and guesswork till i wished that the whole past might be swept away and each generation compelled to bury and destroy whatever it had produced before being permitted to leave the stage when we quit a house we are expected to make it clean for the next occupant why ought we not to leave a clean world for the next generation we did not see the library of above half a million of volumes else i suppose i should have found full occasion to wish that burnt and buried likewise in truth a greater part of it is as good as buried so far as any readers are concerned leaving the museum we sauntered home after a little rest i set out for st johns wood and arrived thither by dint of repeated inquiries it is a pretty suburb inhabited by people of the middling class u met me joyfully but seemed to have had a good time with mrs oakford and her daughter and being pressed to stay to tea i could not well help it before tea i sat talking with mrs oakford and a friend of hers miss clinch about the americans and the english especially dwelling on the defects of the latter among which we reckoned a wretched meanness in money transactions a lack of any embroidery of honor and liberality in their dealings so that they require close watching or they will be sure to take you at advantage i hear this character of them from americans on all hands and my own experience confirms it as far as it goes not merely among tradespeople but among persons who call themselves gentlefolks the cause no doubt or one cause lies in the fewer chances of getting money here the closer and sharper regulation of all the modes of life nothing being left to liberal and gentlemanly feelings except fees to servants they are not gamblers in england as we to some extent are and getting their money painfully or living within an accurately known income they are disinclined to give up so much as a sixpence that they can possibly get but the result is they are mean in petty things by and by mr oakford came in well soaked with the heaviest shower that i ever knew in england which had been rattling on the roof of the little side room where we sat and had caught him on the outside of the omnibus at a little before eight oclock i came home with u in a cab the gaslight glittering on the wet streets through which we drove though the sky was clear overhead september th yesterday a little before twelve we took a cab and went to the two houses of parliament the most immense building methinks that ever was built and not yet finished though it has now been occupied for years its exterior lies hugely along the ground and its great unfinished tower is still climbing towards the sky but the result unless it be the riverfront which i have not yet seen seems not very impressive the interior is much more successful nothing can be more magnificent and gravely gorgeous than the chamber of peers a large oblong hall panelled with oak elaborately carved to the height of perhaps twenty feet then the balustrade of the gallery runs around the hall and above the gallery are six arched windows on each side richly painted with historic subjects the roof is ornamented and gilded and everywhere throughout there is embellishment of color and carving on the broadest scale and at the same time most minute and elaborate statues of full size in niches aloft small heads of kings no bigger than a doll and the oak is carved in all parts of the panelling as faithfully as they used to do it in henry viis time as faithfully and with as good workmanship but with nothing like the variety and invention which i saw in the diningroom of smithells hall there the artist wrought with his heart and head but much of this work i suppose was done by machinery be that as it may it is a most noble and splendid apartment and though so fine there is not a touch of finery it glistens and glows with even a sombre magnificence owing to the rich deep lines and the dim light bedimmed with rich colors by coming through the painted windows in arched recesses that serve as frames at each end of the hall there are three pictures by modern artists from english history and though it was not possible to see them well as pictures they adorned and enriched the walls marvellously as architectural embellishments the peers seats are four rows of long sofas on each side covered with red morocco comfortable seats enough but not adapted to any other than a decorously exact position the woolsack is between these two divisions of sofas in the middle passage of the floor a great square seat covered with scarlet and with a scarlet cushion set up perpendicularly for the chancellor to lean against in front of the woolsack there is another still larger ottoman on which he might be at full length for what purpose intended i know not i should take the woolsack to be not a very comfortable seat though i suppose it was originally designed to be the most comfortable one that could be contrived in view of the chancellors much sitting the throne is the first object you see on entering the hall being close to the door a chair of antique form with a high peaked back and a square canopy above the whole richly carved and quite covered with burnished gilding besides being adorned with rows of rock crystals which seemed to me of rather questionable taste it is less elevated above the floor than one imagines it ought to be while we were looking at it i saw two americans western men i should judge one of them with a true american slouch talking to the policeman in attendance and describing our senate chamber in contrast with the house of lords the policeman smiled and ahed and seemed to make as courteous and liberal responses as he could there was quite a mixed company of spectators and i think other americans present besides the above two and ourselves the lord chamberlains tickets appear to be distributed with great impartiality there were two or three women of the lower middle class with children or babies in arms one of whom lifted up its voice loudly in the house of peers we next after long contemplating this rich hall proceeded through passages and corridors to a great central room very beautiful which seems to be used for purposes of refreshment and for electric telegraphs though i should not suppose this could be its primitive and ultimate design thence we went into the house of commons which is larger than the chamber of peers and much less richly ornamented though it would have appeared splendid had it come first in order the speakers chair if i remember rightly is loftier and statelier than the throne itself both in this hall and in that of the lords we were at first surprised by the narrow limits within which the great ideas of the lords and commons of england are physically realized they would seem to require a vaster space when we hear of members rising on opposite sides of the house we think of them as but dimly discernible to their opponents and uplifting their voices so as to be heard afar whereas they sit closely enough to feel each others spheres to note all expression of face and to give the debate the character of a conversation in this view a debate seems a much more earnest and real thing than as we read it in a newspaper think of the debaters meeting each others eyes their faces flushing their looks interpreting their words their speech growing into eloquence without losing the genuineness of talk yet in fact the chamber of peers is ninety feet long and half as broad and high and the chamber of commons is still larger thence we went to westminster hall through a gallery with statues on each side beautiful statues too i thought seven of them of which four were from the times of the civil wars clarendon falkland hampden selden somers mansfield and walpole there is room for more in this corridor and there are niches for hundreds of their marble brotherhood throughout the edifice but i suppose future ages will have to fill the greater part of them yet i cannot help imagining that this rich and noble edifice has more to do with the past than with the future that it is the glory of a declining empire and that the perfect bloom of this great stone flower growing out of the institutions of england forbodes that they have nearly lived out their life it sums up all its beauty and magnificence are made out of ideas that are gone by we entered westminster hall which is incorporated into this new edifice and forms an integral part of it through a lofty archway whence a double flight of broad steps descends to the stone pavement after the elaborate ornament of the rooms we had just been viewing this venerable hall looks extremely simple and bare a gray stone floor gray and naked stone walls but a roof sufficiently elaborate its vault being filled with carved beams and rafters of chestnut very much admired and wondered at for the design and arrangement i think it would have pleased me more to have seen a clear vaulted roof instead of this intricacy of wooden points by which so much skylight space is lost they make be it not irreverently said the vast and lofty apartment look like the ideal of an immense barn but it is a noble space and all without the support of a single pillar it is about eighty of my paces from the foot of the steps to the opposite end of the hall and twentyseven from side to side very high too though not quite proportionately to its other dimensions i love it for its simplicity and antique nakedness and deem it worthy to have been the haunt and home of history through the six centuries since it was built i wonder it does not occur to modern ingenuity to make a scenic representation in this very hall of the ancient trials for life or death pomps feasts coronations and every great historic incident in the lives of kings parliaments protectors and all illustrious men that have occurred here the whole world cannot show another hall such as this so tapestried with recollections of whatever is most striking in human annals westminster abbey being just across the street we went thither from the hall and sought out the cloisters which we had not yet visited they are in excellent preservation broad walks canopied with intermingled arches of gray stone on which some sort of lichen or other growth of ages which seems however to have little or nothing vegetable in it has grown the pavement is entirely made of flat tombstones inscribed with halfeffaced names of the dead people beneath and the wall all round bears the marble tablets which give a fuller record of their virtues i think it was from a meditation in these cloisters that addison wrote one of his most beautiful pieces in the spectator it is a pity that this old fashion of a cloistered walk is not retained in our modern edifices it was so excellent for shelter and for shade during a thoughtful hour this sombre corridor beneath an arched stone roof with the central space of richest grass on which the sun might shine or the shower fall while the monk or student paced through the prolonged archway of his meditations as we came out from the cloisters and walked along by the churchyard of the abbey a woman came begging behind us very earnestly a bit of bread she said and i will give you a thousand blessings hunger is hard to bear o kind gentleman and kind lady a penny for a bit of bread it is a hard thing that gentlemen and ladies should see poor people wanting bread and make no difference whether they are good or bad and so she followed us almost all round the abbey assailing our hearts in most plaintive terms but with no success for she did it far too well to be anything but an impostor and no doubt she had breakfasted better and was likely to have a better dinner than ourselves and yet the natural man cries out against the philosophy that rejects beggars it is a thousand to one that they are impostors but yet we do ourselves a wrong by hardening our hearts against them at last without turning round i told her that i should give her nothing with some asperity doubtless for the effort to refuse creates a bitterer repulse than is necessary she still followed us a little farther but at last gave it up with a deep groan i could not have performed this act of heroism on my first arrival from america whether the beggarwoman had invoked curses on us and heaven saw fit to grant some slight response i know not but it now began to rain on my wifes velvet so i put her and j into a cab and hastened to ensconce myself in westminster abbey while the shower should last poets corner has never seemed like a strange place to me it has been familiar from the very first at all events i cannot now recollect the previous conception of which the reality has taken the place i seem always to have known that somewhat dim corner with the bare brown stonework of the old edifice aloft and a window shedding down its light on the marble busts and tablets yellow with time that cover the three walls of the nook up to a height of about twenty feet priors is the largest and richest monument it is observable that the bust and monument of congreve are in a distant part of the abbey his duchess probably thought it a degradation to bring a gentleman among the beggarly poets i walked round the aisles and paced the nave and came to the conclusion that westminster abbey both in itself and for the variety and interest of its monuments is a thousand times preferable to st pauls there is as much difference as between a snowbank and a chimneycorner in their relation to the human heart by the by the monuments and statues in the abbey seem all to be carefully dusted the shower being over i walked down into the city where i called on mr band left s s watch to be examined and put in order he told me that he and his brother had lately been laying out and letting a piece of land at blackheath that had been left them by their father and that the groundrent would bring them in two thousand pounds per annum with such an independent income i doubt whether any american would consent to be anything but a gentleman certainly not an operative watchmaker how sensible these englishmen are in some things thence i went at a venture and lost myself of course at one part of my walk i came upon st lukes hospital whence i returned to st pauls and thence along fleet street and the strand contiguous to the latter is holywell street a narrow lane filled up with little bookshops and bookstalls at some of which i saw sermons and other works of divinity old editions of classics and all such serious matters while at stalls and windows close beside them and possibly at the same stalls there were books with titlepages displayed indicating them to be of the most indecent kind october d yesterday forenoon i went with j into the city to grace church street to get a bank postnote cashed by mr oakford and afterwards to the offices of two lines of steamers in moorgate street and leadenhall street the city was very much thronged it is a marvel what sets so many people a going at all hours of the day then it is to be considered that these are but a small portion of those who are doing the business of the city much the larger part being occupied in offices at desks in discussions of plans of enterprise out of sight of the public while these earnest hurriers are merely the froth in the pot after seeing the steamofficials we went to london bridge which always swarms with more passengers than any of the streets descending the steps that lead to the level of the thames we took passage in a boat bound up the river to chelsea of which there is one starting every ten minutes the voyage being of forty minutes duration it began to sprinkle a little just as we started but after a slight showeriness lasting till we had passed westminster bridge the day grew rather pleasant at westminster bridge we had a good view of the riverfront of the two houses of parliament which look very noble from this point a long and massive extent with a delightful promenade for the legislative people exactly above the margin of the river this is certainly a magnificent edifice and yet i doubt whether it is so impressive as it might and ought to have been made considering its immensity it makes no more impression than you can well account to yourself for and you rather wonder that it does not make more the reason must be that the architect has not builded better than he knew he felt no power higher and wiser than himself making him its instrument he reckoned upon and contrived all his effects with malice aforethought and therefore missed the crowning glory that being a happiness which god out of his pure grace mixes up with only the simplehearted best efforts of men october d i again went into the city yesterday forenoon to settle about the passages to lisbon taking j with me from hungerford bridge we took the steamer to london bridge that being an easy and speedy mode of accomplishing distances that take many footsteps through the crowded thoroughfares after leaving the steameroffice we went back through the strand and crossing waterloo bridge walked a good way on to the surrey side of the river a coarse dingy disagreeable suburb with shops apparently for country produce for old clothes secondhand furniture for ironware and other things bulky and inelegant how many scenes and sorts of life are comprehended within london there was much in the aspect of these streets that reminded me of a busy country village in america on an immensely magnified scale growing rather weary anon we got into an omnibus which took us as far as the surrey zoological gardens which j wished very much to see they proved to be a rather poor place of suburban amusement poor at least by daylight their chief attraction for the public consisting in outofdoor representations of battles and sieges the storming of sebastopol as likewise at the cremorne gardens was advertised for the evening and we saw the scenery of sebastopol painted on a vast scale in the open air and really looking like miles and miles of hill and water with a space for the actual manoeuvring of ships on a sheet of real water in front of the scene on which some ducks were now swimming about in place of menofwar the climate of england must often interfere with this sort of performance and i can conceive of nothing drearier for spectators or performers than a drizzly evening convenient to this central spot of entertainment there were liquor and refreshment rooms with pies and cakes the menagerie though the ostensible staple of the gardens is rather poor and scanty pretty well provided with lions and lionesses also one or two giraffes some camels a polar bear who plunged into a pool of water for bits of cake and two black bears who sat on their haunches or climbed poles besides a wilderness of monkeys some parrots and macaws an ostrich various ducks and other animal and ornithological trumpery some skins of snakes so well stuffed that i took them for living serpents till j discovered the deception and an aquarium with a good many common fishes swimming among seaweed the garden is shaded with trees and set out with greensward and gravelwalks from which the people were sweeping the withered autumnal leaves which now fall every day plaster statues stand here and there one of them without a head thus disclosing the hollowness of the trunk there were one or two little drizzly fountains with the water dripping over the rockwork of which the english are so fond and the buildings for the animals and other purposes had a flimsy pasteboard aspect of pretension the garden was in its undress few visitors i suppose coming hither at this time of day only here and there a lady and children a young man and girl or a couple of citizens loitering about i take pains to remember these small items because they suggest the daylife or torpidity of what may look very brilliant at night these corkedup fountains slovenly greensward cracked casts of statues pasteboard castles and duckpond bay of balaclava then shining out in magic splendor and the shabby attendants whom we saw sweeping and shovelling probably transformed into the heroes of sebastopol j thought it a delightful place but i soon grew very weary and came away about four oclock and getting into a city omnibus we alighted on the hither side of blackfriars bridge turning into fleet street i looked about for a place to dine at and chose the mitre tavern in memory of johnson and boswell it stands behind a front of modern shops through which is an archway giving admittance into a narrow courtyard which i suppose was formerly open to fleet street the house is of dark brick and comparing it with other london edifices i should take it to have been at least refronted since johnsons time but within the low sombre coffeeroom which we entered might well enough have been of that era or earlier it seems to be a good plain respectable inn and the waiter gave us each a plate of boiled beef and for dessert a damson tart which made up a comfortable dinner after dinner we zigzagged homeward through cliffords link passage holborn drury lane the strand charing cross pall mall and regent street but i remember only an ancient brick gateway as particularly remarkable i think it was the entrance to lincolns inn we reached home at about six there is a woman who has several times passed through this hanover street in which we live stopping occasionally to sing songs under the windows and last evening between nine and ten oclock she came and sang kathleen omoore richly and sweetly her voice rose up out of the dim chill street and made our hearts throb in unison with it as we sat in our comfortable drawingroom i never heard a voice that touched me more deeply somebody told her to go away and she stopped like a nightingale suddenly shot but finding that s wished to know something about her fanny and one of the maids ran after her and brought her into the hall it seems she was educated to sing at the opera and married an italian operasinger who is now dead lodging in a model lodginghouse at threepence a night and being a penny short tonight she tried this method in hope of getting this penny she takes in plain sewing when she can get any and picks up a trifle about the street by means of her voice which she says was once sweet but has now been injured by the poorness of her living she is a pale woman with black eyes fanny says and may have been pretty once but is not so now it seems very strange that with such a gift of heaven so cultivated too as her voice is making even an unsusceptible heart vibrate like a harpstring she should not have had an engagement among the hundred theatres and singingrooms of london that she should throw away her melody in the streets for the mere chance of a penury when sounds not a hundredth part so sweet are worth from other lips purses of gold october th it rained almost all day on wednesday so that i did not go out till late in the afternoon and then only took a stroll along oxford street and holborn and back through fleet street and the strand yesterday at a little after ten i went to the ambassadors to get my wifes passport for lisbon while i was talking with the clerk mrmade his appearance in a dressinggown with a morning cheerfulness and alacrity in his manner he was going to liverpool with his niece who returns to america by the steamer of saturday she has had a good deal of success in society here being pretty enough to be remarked among english women and with cool selfpossessed frank and quiet manners which look very like the highest breeding i next went to westminster abbey where i had long promised myself another quiet visit for i think i never could be weary of it and when i finally leave england it will be this spot which i shall feel most unwilling to quit forever i found a party going through the seven chapels or whatever their number may be and again saw those stately and quaint old tombs ladies and knights stretched out on marble slabs or beneath arches and canopies of stone let into the walls of the abbey reclining on their elbows in ruff and farthingale or riveted armor or in robes of state once painted in rich colors of which only a few patches of scarlet now remain bearded faces of noble knights whose noses in many cases had been smitten off and mary queen of scots had lost two fingers of her beautiful hands which she is clasping in prayer there must formerly have been very free access to these tombs for i observed that all the statues so far as i examined them were scratched with the initials of visitors some of the names being dated above a century ago the old coronationchair too is quite covered over the back and seat with initials cut into it with pocketknives just as yankees would do it only it is not whittled away as would have been its fate in our hands edward the confessors shrine which is chiefly of wood likewise abounds in these inscriptions although this was esteemed the holiest shrine in england so that pilgrims still come to kneel and kiss it our guide a rubicund verger of cheerful demeanor said that this was true in a few instances there is a beautiful statue in memory of horace walpoles mother and i took it to be really a likeness till the verger said that it was a copy of a statue which her son had admired in italy and so had transferred it to his mothers grave there is something characteristic in this mode of filial duty and honor in all these chapels full of the tombs and effigies of kings dukes archprelates and whatever is proud and pompous in mortality there is nothing that strikes me more than the colossal statue of plain mr watt sitting quietly in a chair in st pauls chapel and reading some papers he dwarfs the warriors and statesmen and as to the kings we smile at them telford is in another of the chapels this visit to the chapels was much more satisfactory than my former one although i in vain strove to feel it adequately and to make myself sensible how rich and venerable was what i saw this realization must come at its own time like the other happinesses of life it is unaccountable that i could not now find the seat of sir george downings squire though i examined particularly every seat on that side of henry viis chapel where i before found it i must try again october th yesterday was not an eventful day i took j with me to the city called on mr sturgis at the barings house and got his checks for a bank postnote the house is at bishopsgate street within it has no sign of any kind but stands back from the street behind an irongrated fence the firm appears to occupy the whole edifice which is spacious and fit for princely merchants thence i went and paid for the passages to lisbon pounds at the peninsular steam companys office and thence to call on general i forgot to mention that first of all i went to mr bs whom i found kind and vivacious as usual it now rained heavily and being still showery when we came to cheapside again we first stood under an archway a usual resort for passengers through london streets and then betook ourselves to sanctuary taking refuge in st pauls cathedral the afternoon service was about to begin so after looking at a few of the monuments we sat down in the choir the richest and most ornamented part of the cathedral with screens or partitions of oak cunningly carved small whiterobed choristers were flitting noiselessly about making preparations for the service which by and by began it is a beautiful idea that several times in the course of the day a man can slip out of the thickest throng and bustle of london into this religious atmosphere and hear the organ and the music of young pure voices but after all the rites are lifeless in our day we found on emerging that we had escaped a very heavy shower and it still sprinkled and misted as we went homeward through holborn and oxford street southampton october th we all left london on sunday morning between ten and eleven from the waterloo station and arrived in southampton about two without meeting with anything very remarkable on the way we put up at chapples castle hotel which is one of the class styled commercial and though respectable not such a one as the nobility and gentry usually frequent i saw little difference in the accommodation except that young women attended us instead of men a pleasant change it was a showery day but j and i walked out to see the shore and the town and the docks and if possible the ship in which s was to sail the most noteworthy object was the remains of an old castle near the waterside the square gray weed grown weird keep of which shows some modern chimneypots above its battlements while remaining portions of the fortress are made to seem as one of the walls for coaldepots and perhaps for small dwellings the english characteristically patch new things into old things in this manner materially legally constitutionally and morally walking along the pier we observed some pieces of ordnance one of which was a large brass cannon of henry viiis time about twelve feet long and very finely made the bay of southampton presents a pleasant prospect and i believe it is the great rendezvous of the yachtclub old and young seafaring people were strolling about and lounging at corners just as they do on sunday afternoons in the minor seaports of america from the shore we went up into the town which is handsome and of a cheerful aspect with streets generally wide and well paved a cleanly town not smokebegrimed the houses if not modern are at least with few exceptions new fronted we saw one relic of antiquity a fine mediaeval gateway across the principal street much more elevated than the gates of chester with battlements at the top and a spacious apartment over the great arch for the passage of carriages and the smaller one on each side for footpassengers there were two statues in armor or antique costume on the hither side of the gateway and two old paintings on the other this so far as i know is the only remnant of the old wall of southampton on monday the morning was bright alternating with a little showeriness u j and i went into the town to do some shopping before the steamer should sail and a little after twelve we drove down to the dock the madeira is a pleasantlooking ship enough not very large but accommodating i believe about seventy passengers we looked at my wifes little stateroom with its three berths for herself and the two children and then sat down in the saloon and afterwards on deck to spend the irksome and dreary hour or two before parting many of the passengers seemed to be portuguese undersized dark mustachioed people smoking cigars john bull was fairly represented too u was cheerful and r seemed anxious to get off poor fanny was altogether cast down and shed tears either from regret at leaving her native land or dread of seasickness or general despondency being a person of no spring of spirits i waited till the captain came on board a middleaged or rather elderly man with a sensible expression but methought with a hard cold eye to whom i introduced my wife recommending her to his especial care as she was unattended by any gentleman and then we thought it best to cut short the parting scene so we bade one another farewell and leaving them on the deck of the vessel j and i returned to the hotel and after dining at the table dhote drove down to the railway this is the first great parting that we have ever had it was three oclock when we left southampton in order to get to worcester where we were to spend the night we strode as it were from one line of railway to another two or three times and did not arrive at our journeys end till long after dark at worcester we put ourselves into the hands of a cabman who drove us to the crown hotel one of the oldfashioned hotels with an entrance through an arched passage by which vehicles were admitted into the innyard which has also an exit i believe into another street on one side of the arch was the coffeeroom where after looking at our sleepingchambers on the other side of the arch we had some cold pigeonpie for supper and for myself a pint of ale it should be mentioned that in the morning before embarking s and the children on board the steamer i saw a fragment of a rainbow among the clouds and remembered the old adage bidding sailors take warning in the afternoon as j and i were railing from southampton we saw another fragmentary rainbow which by the same adage should be the sailors delight the weather has rather tended to confirm the first omen but the seacaptains tell me that the steamer must have gone beyond the scope of these winds worcester october th in the morning of tuesday after breakfast in the coffeeroom j and i walked about to see the remarkables of worcester it is not a particularly interesting city compared with other old english cities the general material of the houses being red brick and almost all modernized externally whatever may be the age of their original framework we saw a large brick jail in castellated style with battlements a very barren and drearylooking edifice likewise in the more central part of the town a guildhall with a handsome front ornamented with a statue of queen anne above the entrance and statues of charles i and charles ii on either side of the door with the motto floreat semper civitas fidelis worcester seems to pride itself upon its loyalty we entered the building and in the large interior hall saw some old armor hanging on the wall at one end corselets helmets greaves and a pair of breeches of chain mail an inscription told us that these suits of armor had been left by charles i after the battle of worcester and presented to the city at a much later date by a gentleman of the neighborhood on the stone floor of the hall under the armor were two brass cannon one of which had been taken from the french in a naval battle within the present century the other was a beautiful piece bearing i think the date of and manufactured in brussels for the count de burgh as a latin inscription testified this likewise was a relic of the battle of worcester where it had been lost by charles many gentlemen connected with the city government i suppose were passing through the hall and looking through its interior doors we saw stately staircases and councilrooms panelled with oak or other dark wood there seems to be a good deal of state in the government of these old towns worcester cathedral would have impressed me much had i seen it earlier though its aspect is less venerable than that of chester or lichfield having been faithfully renewed and repaired and stonecutters and masons were even now at work on the exterior at our first visit we found no entrance but coming again at ten oclock when the service was to begin we found the door open and the choristerboys in their white robes standing in the nave and aisles with elder people in the same garb and a few blackrobed ecclesiastics and an old verger the interior of the cathedral has been covered with a lightcolored paint at some recent period there is as i remember very little stained glass to enrich and bedim the light and the effect produced is a naked daylight aspect unlike what i have seen in any other gothic cathedral the plan of the edifice too is simple a nave and side aisles with great clustered pillars from which spring the intersecting arches and somehow or other the venerable mystery which i have found in westminster abbey and elsewhere does not lurk in these arches and behind these pillars the choir no doubt is richer and more beautiful but we did not enter it i remember two tombs with recumbent figures on there between the pillars that divide the nave from the side aisles and there were also mural monuments one well executed to an officer slain in the peninsular war representing him falling from his horse another by a young widow to her husband with an inscription of passionate grief and a record of her purpose finally to sleep beside him he died in i did not see on the monument any record of the consummation of her purpose and so perhaps she sleeps beside a second husband there are more antique memorials than these two on the wall and i should have been interested to examine them but the service was now about to begin in the choir and at the faroff end of the nave the old verger waved his hand to banish us from the cathedral at the same time he moved towards us probably to say that he would show it to us after service but having little time and being so moderately impressed with what i had already seen i took my departure and so disappointed the old man of his expected shilling or halfcrown the tomb of king john is somewhere in this cathedral we renewed our rambles through the town and passing the museum of the worcester natural history society i yielded to j s wish to go in there are three days in the week i believe on which it is open to the public but this being one of the close days we were admitted on payment of a shilling it seemed a very good and wellarranged collection in most departments of natural history and j who takes more interest in these matters than i do was much delighted we were left to examine the hall and galleries quite at our leisure besides the specimens of beasts birds shells fishes minerals fossils insects and all other natural things before the flood and since there was a stone bearing a roman inscription and various antiquities coins and medals and likewise portraits some of which were old and curious leaving the museum we walked down to the stone bridge over the severn which is here the largest river i have seen in england except of course the mersey and the thames a flight of steps leads from the bridge down to a walk along the riverside and this we followed till we reached the spot where an angler was catching chubs and dace under the walls of the bishops palace which here faces the river it seems to be an old building but with modern repairs and improvements the angler had pretty good success while we were looking at him drawing out two or three silvery fish and depositing them in his basket which was already more than half full the severn is not a transparent stream and looks sluggish but has really movement enough to carry the anglers float along pretty fast there were two vessels of considerable size that is as large as small schooners lying at the bridge we now passed under an old stone archway through a lane that led us from the riverside up past the cathedral whence a gentleman and lady were just emerging and the verger was closing the door behind them we returned to our hotel and ordered luncheon some cold chicken cold ham and ale and after paying the bill about fifteen shillings to which i added five shillings for attendance we took our departure in a fly for the railway the waiter a young woman chambermaid and boots all favored us with the most benign and deferential looks at parting whence it was easy to see that i had given them more than they had any claim to receive nevertheless this english system of fees has its good side and i never travel without finding the advantage of it especially on railways where the officials are strictly forbidden to take fees and where in consequence a fee secures twice as much good service as anywhere else be it recorded that i never knew an englishman to refuse a shilling or for that matter a halfpenny from worcester we took tickets to wolverhampton and thence to birkenhead it grew dark before we reached chester and began to rain and when we got to birkenhead it was a pitiless pelting storm under which on the deck of the steamboat we crossed the detestable mersey two years trial of which has made me detest it every day more and more it being the night of rejoicing for the taking of sebastopol and the visit of the duke of cambridge we found it very difficult to get a cab on the liverpool side but after much waiting in the rain and afterwards in one of the refreshmentrooms on the landing stage we took a hansom and drove off the cloudy sky reflected the illuminations and we saw some gaslighted stars and other devices as we passed very pretty but much marred by the wind and rain so we finally arrived at mrs blodgetts and made a good supper of ham and cold chicken like our luncheon after which wet as we were and drizzling as the weather was and though it was two hours beyond his bedtime i took j out to see the illuminations i wonder what his mother would have said but the boy must now begin to see life and to feel it there was a crowd of people in the street such a crowd that we could hardly make a passage through them and so many cabs and omnibuses that it was difficult to cross the ways some of the illuminations were very brilliant but there was a woful lack of variety and invention in the devices the star of the garter which kept flashing out from the continual extinguishment of the wind and rain v and a in capital letters of light were repeated a hundred times as were loyal and patriotic mottoes crowns formed by colored lamps in some instances a sensible tradesman had illuminated his own sign thereby at once advertising his loyalty and his business innumerable flags were suspended before the houses and across the streets and the crowd plodded on silent heavy and without any demonstration of joy unless by the discharge of pistols close at ones ear the rain to be sure was quite sufficient to damp any joyous ebullition of feeling but the next day when the rain had ceased and when the streets were still thronged with people there was the same heavy purposeless strolling from place to place with no more alacrity of spirit than while it rained the english do not know how to rejoice and in their present circumstances to say the truth have not much to rejoice for we soon came home but i believe it was nearly if not quite eleven at mrs blodgetts mr archer surgeon to some prison or house of correction here in liverpool spoke of an attorney who many years ago committed forgery and being apprehended took a dose of prussic acid mr archer came with the stomachpump and asked the patient how much prussic acid he had taken sir he replied attorneylike i decline answering that question he recovered and afterwards arrived at great wealth in new south wales november th at dinner at mr brights a week or two ago mr robertson gladstone spoke of a magistrate of liverpool many years since sir john of a morning sitting on the bench in the police court he would take five shillings out of his pocket and say here mr clerk so much for my fine i was drunk last night mr gladstone witnessed this personally november th i went to the north hospital yesterday to take the deposition of a dying man as to his ill treatment by the second and third mates of the ship assyria on the voyage from new orleans this hospital is a very gloomy place with its wide bleak entries and staircases which may be very good for summer weather but which are most congenial at this bleak november season i found the physicians of the house laughing and talking very cheerfully with mr wilding who had preceded me we went forthwith up two or three pairs of stairs to the ward where the sick man lay and where there were six or eight other beds in almost each of which was a patient narrow beds shabbily furnished the man whom i came to see was the only one who was not perfectly quiet neither was he very restless the doctor informing him of my presence intimated that his disease might be lethal and that i was come to hear what he had to say as to the causes of his death afterwards a testament was sought for in order to swear him and i administered the oath and made him kiss the book he then in response to mr wildings questions told how he had been beaten and illtreated hanged and thwacked from the moment he came on board to which usage he ascribed his death sometimes his senses seemed to sink away so that i almost thought him dead but by and by the questions would appear to reach him and bring him back and he went on with his evidence interspersing it however with dying groans and almost death rattles in the midst of whatever he was saying he often recurred to a sum of four dollars and a half which he said he had put into the hands of the porter of the hospital and which he wanted to get back several times he expressed his wish to return to america of which he was not a native and on the whole i do not think he had any real sense of his precarious condition notwithstanding that he assented to the doctors hint to that effect he sank away so much at one time that they brought him wine in a tin cup with a spout to drink out of and he mustered strength to raise himself in his bed and drink then hemmed with rather a disappointed air as if it did not stimulate and refresh him as drink ought to do when he had finished his evidence which mr wilding took down in writing from his mouth he marked his cross at the foot of the paper and we ceased to torment him with further question his deposition will probably do no good so far as the punishment of the persons implicated is concerned for he appears to have come on board in a sickly state and never to have been well during the passage on a pallet close by his bed lay another seaman of the same ship who had likewise been abused by the same men and bore more ostensible marks of ill usage than this man did about the head and face there is a most dreadful state of things aboard our ships hell itself can be no worse than some of them and i do pray that some newenglander with the rage of reform in him may turn his thoughts this way the first step towards better things the best practicable step for the present is to legalize flogging on shipboard thereby doing away with the miscellaneous assaults and batteries kickings fisticuffings ropesendings marlinespikings which the inferior officers continually perpetrate as the only mode of keeping up anything like discipline as in many other instances philanthropy has overshot itself by the prohibition of flogging causing the captain to avoid the responsibility of solemn punishment and leave his mates to make devils of themselves by habitual and hardly avoidable ill treatment of the seamen after i left the dying sailor his features seemed to contract and grow sharp some young medical students stood about the bed watching death creep upon him and anticipating perhaps that in a day or two they would have the poor fellows body on the dissectingtable dead patients i believe undergo this fate unless somebody chooses to pay their funeral expenses but the captain of the assyria who seems to be respectable and kindhearted though master of a floating hell tells me that he means to bury the man at his own cost this morning there is a note from the surgeon of the hospital announcing his death and likewise the dangerous state of his shipmate whom i saw on the pallet beside him seacaptains call a dresscoat a clawhammer november d i went on board the ship william lapscott lying in the river yesterday to take depositions in reference to a homicide committed in new york i sat on a sofa in the cabin and mr wilding at a table with his writingmaterials before him and the crew were summoned one by one rough piraticallooking fellows contrasting strongly with the gewgaw cabin in which i received them there is no such finery on land as in the cabin of one of these ships in the liverpool trade finished off with a complete panelling of rosewood mahogany and birdseye maple polished and varnished and gilded along the cornices and the edges of the panels it is all a piece of elaborate cabinetwork and one does not altogether see why it should be given to the gales and the saltsea atmosphere to be tossed upon the waves and occupied by a rude shipmaster in his dreadnaught clothes when the fairest lady in the land has no such boudoir a telltale compass hung beneath the skylight and a clock was fastened near it and ticked loudly a stewardess with the aspect of a woman at home went in and out of the cabin about her domestic calls through the cabin door it being a house on deck i could see the arrangement of the ship the first sailor that i examined was a blackhaired powerful fellow in an oilskin jacket with a good face enough though he too might have been taken for a pirate in the affray in which the homicide occurred he had received a cut across the forehead and another slantwise across his nose which had quite cut it in two on a level with the face and had thence gone downward to his lower jaw but neither he nor any one else could give any testimony elucidating the matter into which i had come to inquire a seaman had been stabbed just before the vessel left new york and had been sent on shore and died there most of these men were in the affray and all of then were within a few yards of the spot where it occurred but those actually present all pleaded that they were so drunk that the whole thing was now like a dream with no distinct images and if any had been sober they took care to know nothing that could inculpate any individual perhaps they spoke truth they certainly had a free and honestlike way of giving their evidence as if their only object was to tell all the truth they knew but i rather think in the forecastle and during the nightwatches they have whispered to one another a great deal more than they told me and have come to a pretty accurate conclusion as to the man who gave the stab while the examination proceeded there was a drawing of corks in a side closet and at its conclusion the captain asked us to stay to dinner but we excused ourselves and drank only a glass of wine the captain apologized for not joining us inasmuch as he had drunk no wine for the last seventeen years he appears to be a particularly good and trustworthy man and is the only shipmaster whom i have met with who says that a crew can best be governed by kindness in the inner closet there was a cage containing two landbirds who had come aboard him tired almost to death three or four hundred miles from shore and he had fed them and been tender of them from a sense of what was due to hospitality he means to give them to j november th i have grown wofully aristocratic in my tastes i fear since coming to england at all events i am conscious of a certain disgust at going to dine in a house with a small entrancehall and a narrow staircase parlor with chintz curtains and all other arrangements on a similar scale this is pitiable however i really do not think i should mind these things were it not for the bustle the affectation the intensity of the mistress of the house it is certain that a woman in england is either decidedly a lady or decidedly not a lady there seems to be no respectable medium bill of fare broiled soles half of a roast pig a haricot of mutton stewed oysters a tart pears figs with sherry and port wine both good and the port particularly so i ate some pig and could hardly resist the ladys importunities to eat more though to my fancy it tasted of swill had a flavor of the pigsty on the parlor table were some poor editions of popular books longfellows poems and others the lady affects a literary taste and bothered me about my own productions a beautiful subject for a romance or for a sermon would be the subsequent life of the young man whom jesus bade to sell all he had and give to the poor and he went away sorrowful and is not recorded to have done what he was bid december th this has been a foggy morning and forenoon snowing a little now and then and disagreeably cold the sky is of an inexpressibly dreary dun color it is so dark at times that i have to hold my book close to my eyes and then again it lightens up a little on the whole disgustingly gloomy and thus it has been for a long while past although the disagreeableness seems to be very near the earth and just above the steeples and housetops very probably there may be a bright sunshiny day at about twelve there is a faint glow of sunlight like the gleaming reflection from a not highly polished copper kettle december th on christmas eve and yesterday there were little branches of mistletoe hanging in several parts of the house in the kitchen the entries the parlor and the smokingroom suspended from the gasfittings the maids of the house did their utmost to entrap the gentlemen boarders old and young under the privileged places and there to kiss them after which they were expected to pay a shilling it is very queer being customarily so respectful that they should assume this license now absolutely trying to pull the gentlemen into the kitchen by main force and kissing the harder and more abundantly the more they were resisted a little rosychecked scotch lass at other times very modest was the most active in this business i doubt whether any gentleman but myself escaped i heard old mr sparleying with the maids last evening and pleading his age but he seems to have met with no mercy for there was a sound of prodigious smacking immediately afterwards j was assaulted and fought most vigorously but was outrageously kissed receiving some scratches moreover in the conflict the mistletoe has white waxlooking berries and dull green leaves with a parasitical stem early in the morning of christmas day long before daylight i heard music in the street and a womans voice powerful and melodious singing a christmas hymn before bedtime i presume one half of england at a moderate calculation was the worse for liquor the markethouses at this season show the national taste for heavy feeding carcasses of prize oxen immensely fat and bulky fat sheep with their woolly heads and tails still on and stars and other devices ingeniously wrought on the quarters fat pigs adorned with flowers like corpses of virgins hares wildfowl geese ducks turkeys and green boughs and banners suspended about the stalls and a great deal of dirt and griminess on the stone floor of the markethouse and on the persons of the crowd there are some englishmen whom i like one or two for whom i might say i have an affection but still there is not the same union between us as if they were americans a cold thin medium intervenes betwixt our most intimate approaches it puts me in mind of alnaschar and his princess with the cold steel blade of his scimitar between them perhaps if i were at home i might feel differently but in a foreign land i can never forget the distinction between english and american january st last night at mrs blodgetts we sat up till twelve oclock to open the front door and let the new year in after the coming guest was fairly in the house the back door was to be opened to let the old year out but i was tired and did not wait for the latter ceremony when the new year made its entrance there was a general shaking of hands and one of the shipmasters said that it was customary to kiss the ladies all round but to my great satisfaction we did not proceed to such extremity there was singing in the streets and many voices of people passing and when twelve had struck all the bells of the town i believe rang out together i went up stairs sad and lonely and stepping into j s little room wished him a happy new year as he slept and many of them to a cool observer a country does not show to best advantage during a time of war all its selfconceit is doubly visible and indeed is sedulously kept uppermost by direct appeals to it the country must be humbugged in order to keep its courage up sentiment seems to me more abundant in middleaged ladies in england than in the united states i dont know how it may be with young ladies the shipmasters bear testimony to the singular delicacy of common sailors in their behavior in the presence of women and they say that this good trait is still strongly observable even in the present race of seamen greatly deteriorated as it is on shipboard there is never an indecorous word or unseemly act said or done by sailors when a woman can be cognizant of it and their deportment in this respect differs greatly from that of landsmen of similar position in society this is remarkable considering that a sailors female acquaintances are usually and exclusively of the worst kind and that his intercourse with them has no relation whatever to morality or decency for this very reason i suppose he regards a modest woman as a creature divine and to be reverenced january th i have suffered wofully from low spirits for some time past and this has not often been the case since i grew to be a man even in the least auspicious periods of my life my desolate bachelor condition i suppose is the cause really i have no pleasure in anything and i feel my tread to be heavier and my physical movement more sluggish than in happier times a weight is always upon me my appetite is not good i sleep ill lying awake till late at night to think sad thoughts and to imagine sombre things and awaking before light with the same thoughts and fancies still in my mind my heart sinks always as i ascend the stairs to my office from a dim augury of ill news from lisbon that i may perhaps hear of blacksealed letters or some such horrors nothing gives me any joy i have learned what the bitterness of exile is in these days and i never should have known it but for the absence of remote unfriended melancholy slow i can perfectly appreciate that line of goldsmith for it well expresses my own torpid unenterprising joyless state of mind and heart i am like an uprooted plant wilted and drooping life seems so purposeless as not to be worth the trouble of carrying it on any further i was at a dinner the other evening at mr bs where the entertainment was almost entirely american new york oysters raw stewed and fried soup of american partridges particularly good also terrapin soup rich but not to my taste american pork and beans baked in yankee style a noble american turkey weighing thirtyone pounds and at the other end of the table an american round of beef which the englishmen present allowed to be delicious and worth a guinea an ounce i forget the other american dishes if there were any more o yes canvasback ducks coming on with the sweets in the usual english fashion we ought to have had catawba wine but this was wanting although there was plenty of hock champagne sherry madeira port and claret our host is a very jolly man and the dinner was a merrier and noisier one than any english dinner within my experience february th i read today in the little officebible greasy with perjuries st lukes account of the agony the trial the crucifixion and the resurrection and how christ appeared to the two disciples on their way to emmaus and afterwards to a company of disciples on both these latter occasions he expounded the scriptures to them and showed the application of the old prophecies to himself and it is to be supposed that he made them fully or at least sufficiently aware what his character was whether god or man or both or something between together with all other essential points of doctrine but none of this doctrine or of these expositions is recorded the mere facts being most simply stated and the conclusion to which he led them that whether god himself or the son of god or merely the son of man he was at all events the christ foretold in the jewish scriptures this last therefore must have been the one essential point february th on saturday there called on me an elderly robinsoncrusoe sort of man mr h shipwright i believe of boston who has lately been travelling in the east about a year ago he was here after being shipwrecked on the dutch coast and i assisted him to get home again i have supplied him with five pounds and my credit for an outside garment he is a spare man with closely cropped gray or rather white hair closecropped whiskers fringing round his chin and a closecropped white mustache with his under lip and a portion of his chin bare beneath sunburnt and weatherworn he has been in syria and jerusalem through the desert and at sebastopol and says he means to get ticknor to publish his travels and the story of his whole adventurous life on his return home a freespoken confiding hardy religious unpolished simple yet worldexperienced man very talkative and boring me with longer visits than i like he has brought home among other curiosities a ladys arm as he calls it two thousand years old a piece of a mummy of course also some coins one of which a gold coin of vespasian he showed me and said he bought it of an arab of the desert the bedouins possess a good many of these coins handed down immemorially from father to son and never sell them unless compelled by want he had likewise a hebrew manuscript of the book of ruth on a parchment roll which was put into his care to be given to lord haddo he was at sebastopol during the siege and nearly got his head knocked off by a cannonball his strangest statement is one in reference to lord raglan he says that an english officer told him that his lordship shut himself up desiring not to be disturbed as he needed sleep when fifteen hours had gone by his attendants thought it time to break open the door and lord raglan was found dead with a bottle of strychnine by the bedside the affair so far as the circumstances indicated suicide was hushed up and his death represented as a natural one the english officer seems to have been an unscrupulous fellow jesting thus with the fresh memory of his dead commander for it is impossible to believe a word of the story even if lord raglan had wished for death he would hardly have taken strychnine when there were so many chances of being honorably shot in woods narrative of the campaign it is stated that he died surrounded by the members of his staff after having been for some time ill it appears however by the same statement that no serious apprehensions had been entertained until one afternoon he shut himself in desiring not to be disturbed till evening after two or three hours he called lord burghersh frank frank and was found to be almost in a state of collapse and died that evening mr hs story might very well have been a camp rumor it seems to me that the british ministry in its notion of a lifepeerage shows an entire misunderstanding of what makes people desire the peerage it is not for the immediate personal distinction but because it removes the peer and his consanguinity from the common rank of men and makes a separate order of them as if they should grow angelic a lifepeer is but a mortal amid the angelic throng february th i went yesterday with mrsand another lady and mr m to the west derby workhouse here comes in the visit to the west derby workhouse which was made the subject of a paper in our old home called outside glimpses of english poverty as the purpose in publishing these passages from the private notebooks is to give to those who ask for a memoir of mr hawthorne every possible incident recorded by himself which shows his character and nature the editor thinks it proper to disclose the fact that mr hawthorne was himself the gentleman of that party who took up in his arms the little child so fearfully repulsive in its condition and it seems better to quote his own words in reference to it than merely to say it was he under date february after this we went to the ward where the children were kept and on entering this we saw in the first place two or three unlovely and unwholesome little imps who were lazily playing together one of them a child about six years old but i know not whether girl or boy immediately took the strangest fancy for me it was a wretched pale halftorpid little thing with a humor in its eyes which the governor said was the scurvy i never saw till a few moments afterwards a child that i should feel less inclined to fondle but this little sickly humoreaten fright prowled around me taking hold of my skirts following at my heels and at last held up its hands smiled in my face and standing directly before me insisted on my taking it up not that it said a word for i rather think it was underwitted and could not talk but its face expressed such perfect confidence that it was going to be taken up and made much of that it was impossible not to do it it was as if god had promised the child this favor on my behalf and that i must needs fulfil the contract i held my undesirable burden a little while and after setting the child down it still followed me holding two of my fingers and playing with them just as if it were a child of my own it was a foundling and out of all human kind it chose me to be its father we went up stairs into another ward and on coming down again there was this same child waiting for me with a sickly smile round its defaced mouth and in its dim red eyes i never should have forgiven myself if i had repelled its advances ed after leaving the workhouse we drove to norris green and mrsshowed me round the grounds which are very good and nicely kept o these english homes what delightful places they are i wonder how many people live and die in the workhouse having no other home because other people have a great deal more home than enough we had a very pleasant dinner and mr mand i walked back four miles and a half to liverpool where we arrived just before midnight why did christ curse the figtree it was not in the least to blame and it seems most unreasonable to have expected it to bear figs out of season instead of withering it away it would have been as great a miracle and far more beautiful and one would think of more beneficent influence to have made it suddenly rich with ripe fruit then to be sure it might have died joyfully having answered so good a purpose i have been reminded of this miracle by the story of a man in heywood a town in lancashire who used such horribly profane language that a planetree in front of his cottage is said to have withered away from that hour i can draw no moral from the incident of the figtree unless it be that all things perish from the instant when they cease to answer some divine purpose march th yesterday i lunched on board captain russells ship the princeton these daily lunches on shipboard might answer very well the purposes of a dinner being in fact noontide dinners with soup roast mutton muttonchops and a macaroni pudding brandy port and sherry wines there were three elderly englishmen at table with white heads which i think is oftener the predicament of elderly heads here than in america one of these was a retired customhouse officer and the other two were connected with shipping in some way there is a satisfaction in seeing englishmen eat and drink they do it so heartily and on the whole so wisely trusting so entirely that there is no harm in good beef and mutton and a reasonable quantity of good liquor and these three hale old men who had acted on this wholesome faith for so long were proofs that it is well on earth to live like earthly creatures in america what squeamishness what delicacy what stomachic apprehension would there not be among three stomachs of sixty or seventy years experience i think this failure of american stomachs is partly owing to our ill usage of our digestive powers and partly to our want of faith in them after lunch we all got into an omnibus and went to the mersey iron foundry to see the biggest piece of ordnance in the world which is almost finished the overseer of the works received us and escorted us courteously throughout the establishment which is very extensive giving employment to a thousand men what with nightwork and daywork the big gun is still on the axle or turningmachine by means of which it has been bored it is made entirely of wrought and welded iron fifty tons of which were originally used and the gun in its present state bored out and smoothed away weighs nearly twentythree tons it has as yet no trunnions and does not look much like a cannon but only a huge iron cylinder immensely solid and with a bore so large that a young man of nineteen shoved himself into it the whole length with a light in order to see whether it is duly smooth and regular i suppose it will have a better effect as to the impression of size when it is finished polished mounted aid fully equipped after the fashion of ordinary cannon it is to throw a ball of three hundred pounds weight five miles and woe be to whatever ship or battlement shall bear the brunt after inspecting the gun we went through other portions of the establishment and saw iron in various stages of manufacture i am not usually interested in manufacturing processes being quite unable to understand them at least in cottonmachinery and the like but here there were such exhibitions of mighty strength both of men and machines that i had a satisfaction in looking on we saw lumps of iron intensely whitehot and in all but a melting state passed through rollers of various size and pressure and speedily converted into long bars which came curling and waving out of the rollers like great red ribbons or like fiery serpents wriggling out of tophet and finally being straightened out they were laid to cool in heaps triphammers are very pleasant things to look at working so massively as they do and yet so accurately chewing up the hot iron as it were and fashioning it into shape with a sort of mighty and gigantic gentleness in their mode of action what great things man has contrived and is continually performing what a noble brute he is also i found much delight in looking at the molten iron boiling and bubbling in the furnace and sometimes slopping over when stirred by the attendant there were numberless fires on all sides blinding us with their intense glow and continually the pounding strokes of huge hammers some wielded by machinery and others by human arms i had a respect for these stalwart workmen who seemed to be near kindred of the machines amid which they wrought mighty men smiting stoutly and looking into the fierce eyes of the furnace fearlessly and handling the iron at a temperature which would have taken the skin off from ordinary fingers they looked strong indeed but pale for the hot atmosphere in which they live cannot but be deleterious and i suppose their very strength wears them quickly out but i would rather live ten years as an ironsmith than fifty as a tailor so much heat can be concentrated into a mass of iron that a lump a foot square heats all the atmosphere about it and burns the face at a considerable distance as the triphammer strikes the lump it seems still more to intensify the heat by squeezing it together and the fluid iron oozes out like sap or juice he was ready for the newest fashions this expression was used by mrs blodgett in reference to mron his first arrival in england and it is a very tender way of signifying that a person is rather poorly off as to apparel march th mr our new ambassador arrived on thursday afternoon by the atlantic and i called at the adelphi hotel after dinner to pay him my respects i found him and his family at supper they seem to be plain affable people the ambassador is a venerable old gentleman with a full head of perfectly white hair looking not unlike an oldfashioned wig and this together with his collarless white neckcloth and his brown coat gave him precisely such an aspect as one would expect in a respectable person of prerevolutionary days there was a formal simplicity too in his manners that might have belonged to the same era he must have been a very handsome man in his youthful days and is now comely very erect moderately tall not overburdened with flesh of benign and agreeable address with a pleasant smile but his eyes which are not very large impressed me as sharp and cold he did not at all stamp himself upon me as a man of much intellectual or characteristic vigor i found no such matter in his conversation nor did i feel it in the indefinable way by which strength always makes itself acknowledged b though somehow plain and uncouth yet vindicates himself as a large man of the world able experienced fit to handle difficult circumstances of life dignified too and able to hold his own in any society mrhas a kind of venerable dignity but yet if a person could so little respect himself as to insult him i should say that there was no innate force in mrto prevent it it is very strange that he should have made so considerable a figure in public life filling offices that the strongest men would have thought worthy of their highest ambition there must be something shrewd and sly under his apparent simplicity narrow cold selfish perhaps i fancied these things in his eyes he has risen in life by the lack of too powerful qualities and by a certain tact which enables him to take advantage of circumstances and opportunities and avail himself of his unobjectionableness just at the proper time i suppose he must be pronounced a humbug yet almost or quite an innocent one yet he is a queer representative to be sent from brawling and boisterous america at such a critical period it will be funny if england sends him back again on hearing the news of s dismissal mrgives me the impression of being a very amiable man in his own family he has brought his son with him as secretary of legation a small young man with a little mustache it will be a feeble embassy i called again the next morning and introduced mrs who i believe accompanied the ladies about town this simplicity in mr s manner puzzles and teases me for in spite of it there was a sort of selfconsciousness as if he were being looked at as if he were having his portrait taken london march d yesterday no day before yesterday i left liverpool for london by rail from the lime street station the journey was a dull and monotonous one as usual three passengers were in the same carriage with me at starting but they dropped off and from rugby i was alone we reached london after ten oclock and i took a cab for st jamess place no where i found mr bexpecting me he had secured a bedroom for me at this lodginghouse and i am to be free of his drawingroom during my stay we breakfasted at nine and then walked down to his countingroom in old broad street in the city it being a dim dingy morning london looked very dull the more so as it was good friday and therefore the streets were comparatively thin of people and vehicles and had on their sunday aspect if it were not for the human life and bustle of london it would be a very stupid place with a heavy and drearymonotony of unpicturesque streets we went up bolt court where dr johnson used to live and this was the only interesting site we saw after spending some time in the countingroom while mrread his letters we went to london bridge and took the steamer for waterloo bridge with partly an intent to go to richmond but the day was so damp and dusky that we concluded otherwise so we came home visiting on our way the site of covent garden theatre lately burnt down the exterior walls still remain perfect and look quite solid enough to admit of the interior being renewed but i believe it is determined to take them down after a slight lunch and a glass of wine we walked out along piccadilly and to hyde park which already looks very green and where there were a good many people walking and driving and rosyfaced children at play somehow or other the shine and charm are gone from london since my last visit and i did not very much admire nor feel much interested in anything we returned and i for my part was much wearied in time for dinner at five the evening was spent at home in various talk and i find mra very agreeable companion and a young man of thought and information with a selfrespecting character and i think him a safe person to live with this st jamess place is in close vicinity to st jamess palace the gateway and not very splendid front of which we can see from the corner the clubhouses and the best life of the town are near at hand addison before his marriage used to live in st jamess place and the house where mr rogers recently died is up the court not that this latter residence excites much interest in my mind i remember nothing else very noteworthy in this first days experience except that on sir watkins williams wynns door not far from this house i saw a gold knocker which is said to be unscrewed every night lest it should be stolen i dont know whether it be really gold for it did not look so bright as the generality of brass ones i received a very good letter from j this morning he was to go to mr brights at sandhays yesterday and remain till monday after writing the above i walked along the strand fleet street ludgate hill and cheapside to wood street a very narrow street insomuch that one has to press close against the wall to escape being grazed when a cart is passing at no i found the place of business of mr bennoch who came to see me at rock ferry with mr jerdan not long after my arrival in england i found him in his office but he did not at first recognize me so much stouter have i grown during my residence in england a new man as he says mr bennoch is a kindly frank very good man and was bounteous in his plans for making my time pass pleasantly we talked of from whom he has just received a letter and who says he will fight for england in case of a war i let bennoch know that i at least should take the other side after arranging to go to greenwich fair and afterwards to dine with bennoch i left him and went to mr s office and afterwards strayed forth again and crossed london bridge thence i rambled rather drearily along through several shabby and uninteresting streets on the other side of the thames and the dull streets in london are really the dullest and most disheartening in the world by and by i found my way to southwark bridge and so crossed to upper thames street which was likewise very stupid though i believe clenmans paternal house in little dorrit stands thereabouts next i got into ludgate hill near st pauls and being quite footweary i took a paddington omnibus and rode up into regent street whence i came home march th yesterday being a clear day for england we determined upon an expedition to hampton court so walked out betimes towards the waterloo station but first crossed the thames by westminster bridge and went to lambeth palace it stands immediately on the bank of the river not far above the bridge we merely walked round it and saw only an old stone tower or two partially renewed with brick and a high connecting wall within which appeared gables and other portions of the palace all of an ancient plan and venerable aspect though evidently much patched up and restored in the course of the many ages since its foundation there is likewise a church part of which looks old connected with the palace the streets surrounding it have many gabled houses and a general look of antiquity more than some other parts of london we then walked to the waterloo station on the same side of the river and at twenty minutes past one took the rail for hampton court distant some twelve or fifteen miles on arriving at the terminus we beheld hampton palace on the other side of the thames an extensive structure with a front of red brick long and comparatively low with the great hall which wolsey built rising high above the rest we crossed the river which is here but a narrow stream by a stone bridge the entrance to the palace is about half a quarter of a mile from the railway through arched gates which give a long perspective into the several quadrangles these quadrangles one beyond another are paved with stone and surrounded by the brick walls of the palace the many windows of which look in upon them soldiers were standing sentinel at the exterior gateways and at the various doors of the palace but they admitted everybody without question and without fee policemen or other attendants were in most of the rooms but interfered with no one so that in this respect it was one of the pleasantest places to visit that i have found in england a good many people of all classes were strolling through the apartments we first went into wolseys great hall up a most spacious staircase the walls and ceiling of which were covered with an allegorical fresco by verrio wonderfully bright and well preserved and without caring about the design or execution i greatly liked the brilliancy of the colors the great hall is a most noble and beautiful room above a hundred feet long and sixty high and broad most of the windows are of stained or painted glass with elaborate designs whether modern or ancient i know not but certainly brilliant in effect the walls from the floor to perhaps half their height are covered with antique tapestry which though a good deal faded still retains color enough to be a very effective adornment and to give an idea of how rich a mode of decking a noble apartment this must have been the subjects represented were from scripture and the figures seemed colossal on looking closely at this tapestry you could see that it was thickly interwoven with threads of gold still glistening the windows except one or two that are long do not descend below the top of this tapestry and are therefore twenty or thirty feet above the floor and this manner of lighting a great room seems to add much to the impressiveness of the enclosed space the roof is very magnificent of carved oak intricately and elaborately arched and still as perfect to all appearance as when it was first made there are banners so fresh in their hues and so untattered that i think they must be modern suspended along beneath the cornice of the hall and exhibiting wolseys arms and badges on the whole this is a perfect sight in its way next to the hall there is a withdrawingroom more than seventy feet long and twentyfive feet high the walls of this apartment too are covered with ancient tapestry of allegorical design but more faded than that of the hall there is also a stainedglass window and a marble statue of venus on a couch very lean and not very beautiful and some cartoons of carlo cignani which have left no impression on my memory likewise a large model of a splendid palace of some east indian nabob i am not sure after all that verrios frescoed grand staircase was not in another part of the palace for i remember that we went from it through an immensely long suite of apartments beginning with the guardchamber all these rooms are wainscoted with oak which looks new being i believe of the date of king williams reign over many of the doorways or around the panels there are carvings in wood by gibbons representing wreaths of flowers fruit and foliage the most perfectly beautiful that can be conceived and the wood being of a light hue limewood i believe it has a fine effect on the dark oak panelling the apartments open one beyond another in long long long succession rooms of state and kings and queens bedchambers and royal closets bigger than ordinary drawingrooms so that the whole suite must be half a mile or it may be a mile in extent from the windows you get views of the palacegrounds broad and stately walks and groves of trees and lawns and fountains and the thames and adjacent country beyond the walls of all these rooms are absolutely covered with pictures including works of all the great masters which would require long study before a new eye could enjoy them and seeing so many of them at once and having such a nothing of time to look at them all i did not even try to see any merit in them vandykes picture of charles i on a white horse beneath an arched gateway made more impression on me than any other and as i recall it now it seems as if i could see the kings noble melancholy face and armed form remembered not in picture but in reality all sir peter lelys lewd women and knellers too were in these rooms and the jolly old stupidity of george iii and his family many times repeated and pictures by titian rubens and other famous hands intermixed with many by west which provokingly drew the eye away from their betters it seems to me that a picture of all other things should be by itself whereas people always congregate them in galleries to endeavor really to see them so arranged is like trying to read a hundred poems at once a most absurd attempt of all these pictures i hardly recollect any so well as a ridiculous old travesty of the resurrection and last judgment where the dead people are represented as coming to life at the sound of the trumpet the flesh reestablishing itself on the bones one man picking up his skull and putting it on his shoulders and all appearing greatly startled only half awake and at a loss what to do next some devils are dragging away the damned by the heels and on sledges and above sits the redeemer and some angelic and sainted people looking complacently down upon the scene we saw in one of the rooms the funeral canopy beneath which the duke of wellington lay in state very gorgeous of black velvet embroidered with silver and adorned with escutcheons also the state bed of queen anne broad and of comfortable appearance though it was a queens the materials of the curtains quilt and furniture red velvet still brilliant in hue also king williams bed and his queen marys with enormously tall posts and a good deal the worse for time and wear the last apartment we entered was the gallery containing raphaels cartoons which i shall not pretend to admire nor to understand i can conceive indeed that there is a great deal of expression in them and very probably they may in every respect deserve all their fame but on this point i can give no testimony to my perception they were a series of very much faded pictures dimly seen for this part of the palace was now in shadow and representing figures neither graceful nor beautiful nor as far as i could discern particularly grand but i came to them with a wearied mind and eye and also i had a previous distaste to them through the medium of engravings but what a noble palace nobly enriched is this hampton court the english government does well to keep it up and to admit the people freely into it for it is impossible for even a republican not to feel something like awe at least a profound respect for all this state and for the institutions which are here represented the sovereigns whose moral magnificence demands such a residence and its permanence too enduring from age to age and each royal generation adding new splendors to those accumulated by their predecessors if one views the matter in another way to be sure we may feel indignant that such doltheads rowdies and every way mean people as many of the english sovereigns have been should inhabit these stately halls contrasting its splendors with their littleness but on the whole i readily consented within myself to be impressed for a moment with the feeling that royalty has its glorious side by no possibility can we ever have such a place in america leaving hampton court at about four oclock we walked through bushy park a beautiful tract of ground well wooded with fine old trees green with moss all up their twisted trunks through several villages twickenham among the rest to richmond before entering twickenham we passed a lathandplaster castellated edifice much timeworn and with the plaster peeling off from the laths which i fancied might be horace walpoles toycastle not that it really could have been but it was like the image wretchedly mean and shabby which one forms of such a place in its decay from hampton court to the star and garter on richmond hill is about six miles after glancing cursorily at the prospect which is famous and doubtless very extensive and beautiful if the english mistiness would only let it be seen we took a good dinner in the large and handsome coffeeroom of the hotel and then wended our way to the railstation and reached home between eight and nine oclock we must have walked not far from fifteen miles in the course of the day march th yesterday at one oclock i called by appointment on mr bennoch and lunched with him and his partners and clerks this lunch seems to be a legitimate continuation of the old london custom of the master living at the same table with his apprentices the meal was a dinner for the latter class the table was set in an upper room of the establishment and the dinner was a large joint of roast mutton to which ten people sat down including a german silkmerchant as a guest besides myself mr bennoch was at the head of the table and one of his partners at the foot for the apprentices there was porter to drink and for the partners and guests some sparkling moselle and we had a sufficient dinner with agreeable conversation bennoch said that g gused to be very fond of these lunches while in england after lunch mr bennoch took me round the establishment which is quite extensive occupying i think two or three adjacent houses and requiring more he showed me innumerable packages of ribbons and other silk manufactures and all sorts of silks from the raw thread to the finest fabrics he then offered to show me some of the curiosities of old london and took me first to barbersurgeons hall in monkwell street it was at this place that the first anatomical studies were instituted in england at the time of its foundation the barbers and surgeons were one company but the latter i believe are now the exclusive possessors of the hall the edifice was built by inigo jones and the principal room is a fine one with finely carved woodwork on the ceiling and walls there is a skylight in the roof letting down a sufficient radiance on the long table beneath where no doubt dead people have been dissected and where for many generations it has been the custom of the society to hold its stated feasts in this room hangs the most valuable picture by holbein now in existence representing the company of barbersurgeons kneeling before henry viii and receiving their charter from his hands the picture is about six feet square the king is dressed in scarlet and quite fulfils ones idea of his aspect the barbersurgeons all portraits are an assemblage of gravelooking personages in dark costumes the company has refused five thousand pounds for this unique picture and the keeper of the hall told me that sir robert peel had offered a thousand pounds for liberty to take out only one of the heads that of a person named pen he conditioning to have a perfect facsimile painted in i did not see any merit in this head over the others beside this great picture hung a most exquisite portrait by vandyke an elderly bearded man of noble and refined countenance in a rich grave dress there are many other pictures of distinguished men of the company in long past times and of some of the kings and great people of england all darkened with age and producing a rich and sombre effect in this stately old hall nothing is more curious in london than these ancient localities and customs of the city companies each trade and profession having its own hall and its own institutions the keeper next showed us the plate which is used at the banquets i should like to be present at one of these feasts i saw also an old vellum manuscript in blackletter which appeared to be a record of the proceedings of the company and at the end there were many pages ruled for further entries but none had been made in the volume for the last three or four hundred years i think it was in the neighborhood of barbersurgeons hall which stands amid an intricacy of old streets where i should never have thought of going that i saw a row of ancient almshouses of elizabethan structure they looked wofully dilapidated in front of one of them was an inscription setting forth that some worthy alderman had founded this establishment for the support of six poor men and these six or their successors are still supported but no larger number although the value of the property left for that purpose would now suffice for a much larger number then mr bennoch took me to cripplegate and entering the door of a house which proved to be a sextons residence we passed by a side entrance into the churchporch of st giles of which the sextons house seems to be an indivisible contiguity this is a very ancient church that escaped the great fire of london the galleries are supported by arches the pillars of which are cased high upwards with oak but all this oaken work and the oaken pews are comparatively modern though so solid and dark that they agree well enough with the general effect of the church proceeding to the high altar we found it surrounded with many very curious old monuments and memorials some in carved oak some in marble grim old worthies mostly in the costume of queen elizabeths time here was the bust of speed the historian here was the monument of fox author of the book of martyrs high up on the wall beside the altar there was a black wooden coffin and a lady sitting upright within it with her hands clasped in prayer it being her awakening moment at the resurrection thence we passed down the centre aisle and about midway we stopped before a marble bust fixed against one of the pillars and this was the bust of milton yes and miltons bones lay beneath our feet for he was buried under the pew over the door of which i was leaning the bust i believe is the original of the one in westminster abbey treading over the tombstones of the old citizens of london both in the aisles and the porch and within doors and without we went into the churchyard one side of which is fenced in by a portion of london wall very solid and still high though the accumulation of human dust has covered much of its base this is the most considerable portion now remaining of the ancient wall of london the sexton now asked us to go into the tower of the church that he might show us the oldest part of the structure and we did so and looking down from the organ gallery i saw a woman sitting alone in the church waiting for the rector whose ghostly consolation i suppose she needed this old churchtower was formerly lighted by three large windows one of them of very great size but the thrifty churchwardens of a generation or two ago had built them up with brick to the great disfigurement of the church the sexton called my attention to the organpipe which is of sufficient size i believe to admit three men from cripplegate we went to milton street as it is now called through which we walked for a very excellent reason for this is the veritable grub street where my literary kindred of former times used to congregate it is still a shabbylooking street with oldfashioned houses and inhabited chiefly by people of the poorer classes though not by authors next we went to old broad street and being joined by mr b we set off for london bridge turning out of our direct course to see london stone in watling street this famous stone appears now to be built into the wall of st swithins church and is so encased that you can only see and touch the top of it through a circular hole there are one or two long cuts or indentations in the top which are said to have been made by jack cades sword when he struck it against the stone if so his sword was of a redoubtable temper judging by what i saw london stone was a rudely shaped and unhewn post at the london bridge station we took the rail for greenwich and it being only about five miles off we were not long in reaching the town it was easter monday and during the first three days of easter from time immemorial a fair has been held at greenwich and this was what we had come to see this fair is described in our old home in a loudon suburb reaching mr bennochs house we found it a pretty and comfortable one and adorned with many works of art for he seems to be a patron of art and literature and a warmhearted man of active benevolence and vivid sympathies in many directions his face shows this i have never seen eyes of a warmer glow than his on the walls of one room there were a good many sketches by haydon and several artists proofs of fine engravings presented by persons to whom he had been kind in the drawingroom there was a marble bust of mrs and one i think of himself and one of the queen which mr bennoch said was very good and it is unlike any other i have seen it is intended as a gift from a number of subscribers to miss nightingale likewise a crayon sketch of looking rather morbid and unwholesome as the poor lady really is also a small picture of mr bennoch in a military dress as an officer probably of cityhorse by and by came in a young gentleman son of haydon the painter of high art and one or two ladies staying in the house and anon mrs and so we went in to dinner bennoch is an admirable host and warms his guests like a household fire by the influence of his kindly face and glowing eyes and by such hospitable demeanor as best suits this aspect after the cloth was removed came in mr newton crosland a young man who once called on me in liverpool the husband of a literary lady formerly camilla toulmin the lady herself was coming to spend the evening the husband and i presume the wife is a decided believer in spiritual manifestations we talked of politics and spiritualism and literature and before we rose from table mr bennoch drank the health of the ladies and especially of mrs in terms very kind towards her and me i responded in her behalf as well as i could and left it to mr bowman as a bachelor to respond for the ladies generally which he did briefly toasting mrs b we had heard the sound of the piano in the drawingroom for some time and now adjourning thither i had the pleasure to be introduced to mrs newton crosland a rather tall thin pale and ladylike person looking i thought of a sensitive character she expressed in a low tone and quiet way great delight at seeing my distinguished self for she is a vast admirer of the scarlet letter and especially of the character of hester indeed i remember seeing a most favorable criticism of the book from her pen in one of the london magazines at eleven oclock mrs crosland entered the tiniest ponycarriage and set forth for her own residence with a lad walking at the ponys head and carrying a lantern march th yesterday was not a very eventful day after writing in my journal i went out at twelve and visited for the first time the national gallery it is of no use for me to criticise pictures or to try to describe them but i have an idea that i might acquire a taste with a little attention to the subject for i find i already begin to prefer some pictures to others this is encouraging of those that i saw yesterday i think i liked several by murillo best there were a great many people in the gallery almost entirely of the middle with a few of the lower classes and i should think that the effect of the exhibition must at least tend towards refinement nevertheless the only emotion that i saw displayed was in broad grins on the faces of a man and two women at sight of a small picture of venus with a satyr peeping at her with an expression of gross animal delight and merriment without being aware of it this man and the two women were of that same satyr breed if i lived in london i would endeavor to educate myself in this and other galleries of art but as the case stands it would be of no use i saw two of turners landscapes but did not see so much beauty in them as in some of claudes a view of the grand canal in venice by canaletto seemed to me wonderful absolutely perfect a better reality for i could see the water of the canal moving and dimpling and the palaces and buildings on each side were quite as good in their way leaving the gallery i walked down into the city and passed through smithfield where i glanced at st bartholomews hospital then i went into st pauls and walked all round the great cathedral looking i believe at every monument on the floor there is certainly nothing very wonderful in any of them and i do wish it would not so generally happen that english warriors go into battle almost nude at least we must suppose so from their invariably receiving their deathwounds in that condition i will not believe that a sculptor or a painter is a man of genius unless he can wake the nobleness of his subject illuminate and transfigure any given pattern of coat and breeches nevertheless i never go into st pauls without being impressed anew with the grandeur of the edifice and the general effect of these same groups of statuary ranged in their niches and at the bases of the pillars as adornments of the cathedral coming homeward i went into the enclosure of the temple and near the entrance saw dr johnsons staircase printed over a doorway so i not only looked in but went up the first flight of some broad wellworn stairs passing my hand over a heavy ancient broken balustrade on which no doubt johnsons hand had often rested it was here that boswell used to visit him in their early acquaintance before my lunch i had gone into bolt court where he died this morning there have been letters from mr wilding enclosing an invitation to me to be one of the stewards of the anniversary dinner of the literary fund no i thank you gentlemen march th yesterday i went out at about twelve and visited the british museum an exceedingly tiresome affair it quite crushes a person to see so much at once and i wandered from hall to hall with a weary and heavy heart wishing heaven forgive me that the elgin marbles and the frieze of the parthenon were all burnt into lime and that the granite egyptian statues were hewn and squared into buildingstones and that the mummies had all turned to dust two thousand years ago and in fine that all the material relics of so many successive ages had disappeared with the generations that produced them the present is burdened too much with the past we have not time in our earthly existence to appreciate what is warm with life and immediately around us yet we heap up these old shells out of which human life has long emerged casting them off forever i do not see how future ages are to stagger onward under all this dead weight with the additions that will be continually made to it after leaving the museum i went to see bennoch and arrange with him our expedition of today and he read me a letter from topper very earnestly inviting me to come and spend a night or two with him then i wandered about the city and was lost in the vicinity of holborn so that for a long while i was under a spell of bewilderment and kept returning in the strangest way to the same point in lincolns inn fields mr bowman and i went to the princesss theatre in the evening charles kean performed in louis xi very well indeed a thoughtful and highly skilled actor much improved since i saw him many years ago in america aldershott camp april st after my last date on thursday i visited the national gallery at three oclock having packed a travellingbag i went to bennochs office and lunched with him and at about five we took the rail from the waterloo station for aldershott camp at tamborough we were cordially received by lieutenant shaw of the north cork rifles and were escorted by him in a fly to his quarters the camp is a large city composed of numberless wooden barracks arranged in regular streets on a wide bleak heath with an extensive and dreary prospect on all sides lieutenant shaw assigned me one room in his hut and bennoch another and made us as comfortable as kind hospitality could but the huts are very small and the rooms have no size at all neither are they airtight and the sharp wind whistles in at the crevices and on the whole of all discomfortable places i am inclined to reckon aldershott camp the most so i suppose the government has placed the camp on that windy heath and built such wretched huts for the very purpose of rendering life as little desirable as may be to the soldiers so that they should throw it away the more willingly at seven oclock we dined at the regimental mess with the officers of the north cork the messroom is by far the most endurable place to be found in camp the hut is large and the messroom is capable of receiving between thirty and forty guests besides the officers of the regiment when a great dinnerparty is given as i saw it the whole space was divided into a diningroom and two anterooms by red curtains drawn across and the second anteroom seems to be a general rendezvous for the officers where they meet at all times and talk or look over the newspapers and the armyregister which constitute the chief of their reading the colonel and lieutenantcolonel of the regiment received bennoch and me with great cordiality as did all the other officers and we sat down to a splendid dinner all the officers of the regiment are irishmen and all of them i believe men of fortune and they do what they can towards alleviating their hardships in camp by eating and drinking of the best that can be obtained of all good things the table service and plate were as fine as those in any noblemans establishment the dishes numerous and admirably got up and the wines delectable and genuine as they had need to be for there is a great consumption of them i liked these irish officers exceedingly not that it would be possible to live long among them without finding existence a bore for they have no thought no intellectual movement no ideas that i was aware of beyond horses dogs drill garrisons fielddays whist wine cigars and all that kind of thing yet they were really gentlemen living on the best terms with one another courteous kind most hospitable with a rich irish humor softened down by social refinements not too refined either but a most happy sort of behavior as natural as that of children and with a safe freedom that made one feel entirely at my ease i think well of the irish gentlemen for their sakes and i believe i might fairly attribute to lieutenantcolonel stowell next whom i sat a higher and finer cultivation than the above description indicates indeed many of them may have been capable of much more intellectual intercourse than that of the messtable but i suppose it would not have been in keeping with their camp life nor suggested by it several of the elder officers were men who had been long in the army and the colonel a bluff hearty old soldier with a profile like an eagles head and beak was a veteran of the peninsula and had a medal on his breast with clasps for three famous battles besides that of waterloo the regimental band played during dinner and the lieutenantcolonel apologized to me for its not playing hail columbia the tune not coning within their musical accomplishments it was no great matter however for i should not have distinguished it from any other tune but to do me what honor was possible in the way of national airs the band was ordered to play a series of negro melodies and i was entirely satisfied it is really funny that the woodnotes wild of those poor black slaves should have been played in a foreign laud as an honorable compliment to one of their white countrymen after dinner we played whist and then had some broiled bones for supper and finally went home to our respective huts not much earlier than four oclock but i dont wonder these gentlemen sit up as long as they can keep their eyes open for never was there anything so utterly comfortless as their campbeds they are really worse than the bed of honor no wider no softer no warmer and affording not nearly so sound sleep indeed i got hardly any sleep at all and almost as soon as i did close my eyes the bugles sounded and the drums beat reveille and from that moment the camp was all astir so i pretty soon uprose and went to the messroom for my breakfast feeling wonderfully fresh and well considering what my night had been long before this however this whole regiment and all the other regiments marched off to take part in a general review and bennoch and i followed as soon as we had eaten a few muttonchops it was a bright sunshiny day but with a strong eastwind as piercing and pitiless as ever blew and this wide undulating plain of aldershott seemed just the place where the eastwind was at home still it acted on the whole like an invigorating cordial and whereas in pleasanter circumstances i should have lain down and gone to sleep i now felt as if i could do without sleep for a month in due time we found out the place of the north cork regiment in the general battlearray and were greeted as old comrades by the colonel and other officers soon the soldiers who when we first reached them were strolling about or standing at ease were called into order and anon we saw a group of mounted officers riding along the lines and among them a gentleman in a civilians round hat and plain frock and trousers riding on a white horse this group of riders turned the front of the regiment and then passed along the rear coming close to where we stood and as the plainly dressed gentleman rode by he bent towards me and i tried to raise my hat but did not succeed very well because the fierce wind had compelled me to jam it tightly upon my head the duke of cambridge for this was he is a comelylooking gentlemanly man of bluff english face with a great deal of brown beard about it though a pretty tall man he appears on horseback broad and round in proportion to his height i looked at him with a certain sort of interest and a feeling of kindness for one does feel kindly to whatever human being is anywise marked out from the rest unless it be by his disagreeable qualities the troops from twelve to fifteen thousand now fell into marching order and went to attack a wood where we were to suppose the enemy to be stationed the shamfight seemed to me rather clumsily managed and without any striking incident or result the officers had prophesied the night before that general k commanding in the camp would make a muddle of it and probably he did after the review the duke of cambridge with his attendant officers took their station and all the regiments marched in front of him saluting as they passed as each colonel rode by and as the banner of each regiment was lowered the duke lifted his hat the most splendid effect of this parade was the gleam of the sun upon the long line of bayonets the sheen of all that steel appearing like a wavering fringe of light upon the dark masses of troops below it was very fine but i was glad when all was done and i could go back to the messroom whither i carried an excellent appetite for luncheon after this we walked about the camp looked at some model tents inspected the arrangements and modes of living in the huts of the privates and thus gained more and more adequate ideas of the vile uncomfortableness of a military life finally i went to the anteroom and turned over the regimental literature a peerage and baronetage an army and militia register a number of the sporting magazine and one of the united service while bennoch took another walk before dinner we both tried to catch a little nap by way of compensation for last nights deficiencies but for my part the attempt was fruitless the dinner was as splendid and as agreeable as that of the evening before and i believe it was nearly two oclock when bennoch and i bade farewell to our kind entertainers for my part i fraternized with these military gentlemen in a way that augurs the very best things for the future peace of the two countries they all expressed the warmest sympathies towards america and it was easy to judge from their conversation that there is no real friendliness on the part of the military towards the french the old antipathy is just as strong as ever stronger than ever perhaps on account of the comparatively more brilliant success of the french in this russian war so with most christian sentiments of peace and brotherly love we returned to our hut and lay down each in his narrow bed early in the morning the drums and bugles began the usual bedevilment and shortly after six i dressed and we had breakfast at the messroom shook hands with lieutenant shaw our more especial host and drove off to the railway station at ash i know not whether i have mentioned that the villages neighboring to the camp have suffered terribly as regards morality from the vicinity of the soldiers quiet old english towns that till within a little time ago had kept their antique simplicity and innocence have now no such thing as female virtue in them so far as the lower classes are concerned this is expressing the matter too strongly no doubt but there is too much truth in it nevertheless and one of the officers remarked that even ladies of respectability had grown much more free in manners and conversation than at first i have heard observations similar to this from a novascotian in reference to the moral influence of soldiers when stationed in the provinces wooton wooton stands in a hollow near the summit of one of the long swells that here undulate over the face of the country there is a good deal of wood behind it as should be the case with the residence of the author of the sylva but i believe few if any of these trees are known to have been planted by john evelyn or even to have been coeval with his time the house is of brick partly ancient and consists of a front and two projecting wings with a porch and entrance in the centre it has a desolate meagre aspect and needs something to give it life and stir and jollity the present proprietor is of the old evelyn family and is now one of the two members of parliament for surrey but he is a very shy and retiring man unmarried sees little company and seems either not to know how to make himself comfortable or not to care about it a servant told us that mrhad just gone out but tupper who is apparently on intimate terms with him thought it best that we should go into the house while he went in search of the master so the servant ushered us through a hall where were many family pictures by lely and for aught i know by vandyke and by kneller and other famous painters up a grand staircase and into the library the inner room of which contained the ponderous volumes which john evelyn used to read nevertheless it was a room of most barren aspect without a carpet on the floor with pine bookcases with a common whitewashed ceiling with no luxurious studychairs and without a fire there was an open folio on the table and a sheet of manuscript that appeared to have been recently written i took down a book from the shelves a volume of annals connected with english history and tupper afterwards told us that this one single volume for its rarity was worth either two or three hundred pounds against one of the windows of this library there grows a magnoliatree with a very large stem and at least fifty years old mrs tupper and i waited a good while and then bennoch and tupper came back without having found mr tupper wished very much to show the prayerbook used by king charles at his execution and some curious old manuscript volumes but the servant said that his master always kept these treasures locked up and trusted the key to nobody we therefore had to take our leave without seeing them and i have not often entered a house that one feels to be more forlorn than wooton although we did have a glimpse of a diningroom with a table laid for three or four guests and looking quite brilliant with plate and glass and snowy napery there was a fire too in this one room mris making extensive alterations in the house or has recently done so and this is perhaps one reason of its ungenial meagreness and lack of finish before our departure from wooton tupper had asked me to leave my card for mr but i had no mind to overstep any limit of formal courtesy in dealing with an englishman and therefore declined tupper however on his own responsibility wrote his name bennochs and mine on a piece of paper and told the servant to show them to mr we soon had experience of the good effect of this for we had scarcely got back before somebody drove up to tuppers door and one of the girls looking out exclaimed that there was mrhimself and another gentleman he had set out the instant he heard of our call to bring the three precious volumes for me to see this surely was most kind a kindness which i should never have dreamed of expecting from a shy retiring man like mr so he and his friend were ushered into the diningroom and introduced mris a younglooking man dark with a mustache rather small and though he has the manners of a man who has seen the world it evidently requires an effort in him to speak to anybody and i could see his whole person slightly writhing itself as it were while he addressed me this is strange in a man of his public position member for the county necessarily mixed up with life in many forms the possessor of sixteen thousand pounds a year and the representative of an ancient name nevertheless i liked him and felt as if i could become intimately acquainted with him if circumstances were favorable but at a brief interview like this it was hopeless to break through two great reserves so i talked more with his companion a pleasant young man fresh from college i should imagine than with mrhimself the three books were really of very great interest one was an octavo volume of manuscript in john evelyns own hand the beginning of his published diary written as distinctly as print in a small clear character it can be read just as easily as any printed book another was a church of england prayerbook which king charles used on the scaffold and which was stained with his sacred blood and underneath are two or three lines in john evelyns hand certifying this to be the very book it is an octavo or small folio and seems to have been very little used scarcely opened except in one spot its leaves elsewhere retaining their original freshness and elasticity it opens most readily at the commencement of the common service and there on the lefthand page is a discoloration of a yellowish or brownish hue about two thirds of an inch large which two hundred years ago and a little more was doubtless red for on that page had fallen a drop of king charless blood the other volume was large and contained a great many original letters written by the king during his troubles i had not time to examine them with any minuteness and remember only one document which mrpointed out and which had a strange pathos and pitifulness in it it was a sort of duebill promising to pay a small sum for beer which had been supplied to his majesty so soon as god should enable him or the distracted circumstances of his kingdom make it possible or some touching and helpless expression of that kind prince hal seemed to consider it an unworthy matter that a great prince should think of that poor creature small beer at all but that a great prince should not be able to pay for it is far worse mrexpressed his regret that i was not staying longer in this part of the country as he would gladly have seen me at wooten and he succeeded in saying something about my books and i hope i partly succeeded in showing him that i was very sensible of his kindness in letting me see those relics i cannot say whether or no i expressed it sufficiently it is better with such a man or indeed with any man to say too little than too much and in fact it would have been indecorous in me to take too much of his kindness to my own share bennoch being likewise in question we had a cup of coffee and then took our leave tupper accompanying us part way down the village street and bidding us an affectionate farewell battle abbey bennoch and i recommenced our travels and changing from one railway to another reached tunbridge wells at nine or ten in the evening the next day was spent at tunbridge wells which is famous for a chalybeate spring and is a wateringplace of note most healthily situated on a high breezy hill with many pleasant walks in the neighborhood from tunbridge wells we transported ourselves to battle the village in which is battle abbey it is a large village with many antique houses and some new ones and in its principal street on one side with a wide green space before it you see the gray embattled outer wall and great square battlemented entrance tower with a turret at each corner of the ancient abbey it is the perfect reality of a gothic battlement and gateway just as solid and massive as when it was first built though hoary and venerable with the many intervening centuries there are only two days in the week on which visitors are allowed entrance and this was not one of them nevertheless bennoch was determined to get in and he wished me to send lady webster my card with his own but this i utterly refused for the honor of america and for my own honor because i will not do anything to increase the reputation we already have as a very forward people bennoch however called at a bookshop on the other side of the street near the gateway of the castle and making friends as he has a marvellous tact in doing with the bookseller the latter offered to take in his card to the housekeeper and see if lady webster would not relax her rule in our favor meanwhile we went into the old church of battle which was built in norman times though subsequently to the abbey as we entered the church door the bell rang for joy at the news of peace which had just been announced by the london papers the church has been whitewashed in modern times and does not look so venerable as it ought with its arches and pillared aisles in the chancel stands a marble tomb heavy rich and elaborate on the top of which lie the brokennosed statues of sir anthony browne and his lady who were the lord and lady of battle abbey in henry viiis time the knight is in armor and the lady in stately garb and save for their broken noses they are in excellent preservation the pavement of the chancel and aisles is all laid with tombstones and on two or three of these there were engraved brasses representing knights in armor and churchmen with inscriptions in latin some of them are very old on the walls too there are various monuments principally of dignitaries connected with the abbey two hatchments in honor of persons recently dead were likewise suspended in the chancel the best pew of the church is of course that of the webster family it is curtained round carpeted furnished with chairs and footstools and more resembles a parlor than a pew especially as there is a fireplace in one of the pointed archways which i suppose has been bricked up in order to form it on the opposite side of the aisle is the pew of some other magnate containing a stove the rest of the parishioners have to keep themselves warm with the fervor of their own piety i have forgotten what else was interesting except that we were shown a stone coffin recently dug up in which was hollowed a place for the head of the corpse returning to the bookshop we found that lady webster had sent her compliments and would be very happy to have us see the abbey how thoroughly kind these english people can be when they like and how often they like to be so we lost no time in ringing the bell at the arched entrance under the great tower and were admitted by an old woman who lives i believe in the thickness of the wall she told us her room used to be the prison of the abbey and under the great arch she pointed to a projecting beam where she said criminals used to be hanged at two of the intersecting points of the arches which form the roof of the gateway were carved faces of stone said to represent king harold and william the conqueror the exterior wall of which this tower is the gateway extends far along the village street and encloses a very large space within which stands the mansion quite secluded from unauthorized visitors or even from the sight of those without unless it be at very distant eyeshot we rang at the principal door of the edifice it is under a deep arch in the norman style but of modern date and a footman let its in and then delivered us over to a respectable old lady in black she was a frenchwoman by birth but had been very long in the service of the family and spoke english almost without an accent her french blood being indicated only by her thin and withered aspect and a greater gentility of manner than would have been seen in an englishwoman of similar station she ushered us first into a grand and noble hall the arched and carved oaken roof of which ascended into the gable it was nearly sixty feet long and its height equal to its length as stately a hall i should imagine as is anywhere to be found in a private mansion it was lighted at one end by a great window beneath which occupying the whole breadth of the hall hung a vast picture of the battle of hastings and whether a good picture or no it was a rich adornment of the hall the walls were wainscoted high upward with oak they were almost covered with noble pictures of ancestry and of kings and great men and beautiful women there were trophies of armor hung aloft and two armed figures one in brass mail the other in bright steel stood on a raised dais underneath the great picture at the end of the hall opposite the picture a third of the way up towards the roof was a gallery all these things that i have enumerated were in perfect condition without rust untouched by decay or injury of any kind but yet they seemed to belong to a past age and were mellowed softened in their splendor a little dimmed with time toned down into a venerable magnificence of all domestic things that i have seen in england it satisfied me most then the frenchwoman showed us into various rooms and offices most of which were contrived out of the old abbeycloisters and the vaulted cells and apartments in which the monks used to live if any house be haunted i should suppose this might be if any churchproperty bring a curse with it as people say i do not see how the owners of battle abbey can escape it taking possession of and dwelling in these holy precincts as they have done and laying their kitchen hearth with the stones of overthrown altars the abbey was first granted i believe to sir anthony browne whom i saw asleep with his lady in the church it was his first wife i wish it had been his second for she was surreys geraldine the posterity of sir anthony kept the place till and then sold it to the websters a family of baronets who are still the owners and occupants the present proprietor is sir augustus webster whose mother is the lady that so kindly let us into the abbey mr bennoch gave the nice old french lady half a crown and we next went round among the ruined portions of the abbey under the gardeners guidance we saw two ivied towers insulated from all other ruins and an old refectory open to the sky and a vaulted crypt supported by pillars and we saw too the foundation and scanty remains of a chapel which had been long buried out of sight of man and only dug up within present memory about forty years ago there had always been a tradition that this was the spot where harold had planted his standard and where his body was found after the battle and the discovery of the ruined chapel confirmed the tradition i might have seen a great deal more had there been time and i have forgotten much of what i did see but it is an exceedingly interesting place there is an avenue of old yewtrees which meet above like a cloistered arch and this is called the monks walk i rather think they were ivy though growing unsupported as we were retiring the gardener suddenly stopped as if he were alarmed and motioned to us to do the same saying i believe it is my lady and so it was a tall and stately lady in black trimming shrubs in the garden she bowed to us very graciously we raised our hats and thus we met and parted without more ado as we went through the arch of the entrance tower bennoch gave the old female warder a shilling and the gardener followed us to get half a crown hastings we took a fly and driver from the principal hotel of battle and drove off for hastings about seven miles distant hastings is now a famous watering and seabathing place and seems to be well sheltered from the winds though open to the sea which here stretches off towards france we climbed a high and steep hill terraced round its base with streets of modern lodginghouses and crowned on its summit with the ruins of a castle the foundation of which was anterior to the conquest this castle has no wall towards the sea the precipice being too high and sheer to admit of attack on that side i have quite exhausted my descriptive faculty for the present so shall say nothing of this old castle which indeed the remains being somewhat scanty and scraggling is chiefly picturesque and interesting from its bold position on such a headlong hill clambering down on another side from that of our ascent we entered the town of hastings which seems entirely modern and made up of lodginghouses shops hotels parades and all such makings up of wateringplaces generally we took a delightful warm bath washing off all weariness and naughtiness and coming out new men then we walked to st leonards a part of hastings i believe but a mile or two from the castle and there called at the lodgings of two friends of bennoch these were mr martin the author of bon gaultiers ballads and his wife the celebrated actress helen faucett mr martin is a barrister a gentleman whose face and manners suited me at once a simple refined sincere not too demonstrative person his wife too i liked a tall dark fine and ladylike woman with the simplest manners that give no trouble at all and so must be perfect with these two persons i felt myself almost in a moment on friendly terms and in true accord and so i talked i think more than i have at any time since coming to london we took a pleasant lunch at their house and then they walked with us to the railway station and there they took leave of bennoch affectionately and of me hardly less so for in truth we had grown to be almost friends in this very little while and as we rattled away i said to bennoch earnestly what good people they are and bennoch smiled as if he had known perfectly well that i should think and say so and thus we rushed onward to london and i reached st jamess place between nine and ten oclock after a very interesting tour the record of which i wish i could have kept as we went along writing each days history before another days adventures began end of vol i
