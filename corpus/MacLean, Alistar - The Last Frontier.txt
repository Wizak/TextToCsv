including this condition being imposed on the subsequent purchaser chapter one the wind blew steadily out of the north and the night air was bitterly chill nothing moved across the snow under the high cold stars the frozen plain empty desolate stretched endlessly away on every side until it vanished into the blurred distance of an empty horizon over everything lay the silence of death but the emptiness reynolds knew was illusion so was the desolation and the silence only the snow was real the snow and that bonedeep subzero cold that shrouded him from head to toe in a blanket of ice and continuously shook his entire body in violent uncontrollable spasms of shivering like a man suffering from ague perhaps that feeling of drowsiness that was beginning to creep over him was only an illusion also but he was aware that it too was no illusion it was real and he knew only too well the meaning it carried with it resolutely desperately almost he crushed down all thought of the cold the snow and sleep and concentrated on the problem of survival slowly painstakingly careful to make not the slightest unnecessary sound or movement he slid one frozen hand under the lapels of his trenchcoat fumbled his handkerchief out of his breast pocket rolled it into a crushed ball and stuffed it into his mouth betrayal of his position could come only by sight or sound and the folds of the handkerchief would break up the heavy condensation of his breath in the frosty air and muffle the chattering of his teeth then he twisted round cautiously in the deep snowfilled ditch by the roadside into which he had fallen reached out an exploratory hand now curiously mottled blue and white by the cold for the trilby hat that had been knocked from his head when he had tumbled off the overhanging branch of the tree above him found it and inched it slowly towards him as thoroughly as his numbed now almost useless fingers would permit he covered crown and brim with a thick layer of snow crammed the trilby deep over the give away black thatch of his head and lifted head and shoulders in almost grotesque slow motion until first the hat brim and then the eyes cleared the level of the ditch in spite of its violent shivering his whole body was as taut as a bowstring as he waited in tense sickening expectation for the shout that betokened discovery or the shot or the numbing crash that carried oblivion with it as a bullet found the exposed target of his head but there was no sound no shot and his awareness only heightened with the passing of every momenthis first quick scanning of the circuit of the horizon was now complete and there could be no doubt about it there was no one there at least close at hand either to see or to be seen moving just as carefully just as slowly but with a long drawnout easing of his pentup breath reynolds straightened until he was kneeling upright in the ditch he was cold and shivering still but was no longer aware of it and the sleepiness had vanished as if it had been a dream once again his gaze travelled in a full circle around the horizon but slowly probingly this time the keen brown eyes missing nothing and once more the answer was the same there was nobody to be seen there was nothing to be seen nothing at all but the icy twinkle of the stars in the dark velvet of the sky the level white plain a few small isolated groves of trees and the curving ribbon of road beside him its surface hardpacked by the snowtreads of heavy trucks reynolds lowered himself back down into the deep trench which the impact of his falling body had carved out in the drifted snow in the ditch he had to have time he had to have time to recover his breath to ease his still gasping lungs demands for air and more air a scant ten minutes had passed since the truck in which he had stolen a lift had been stopped by the police block and the brief fierce scuffle clubbed automatic in hand with the two unsuspecting policemen who had investigated the rear of the truck the sprint round the providential bend in the road and then the milelong grinding run till he had reached the grove of trees beside which he now lay had brought him to the point of exhausted collapse he had to have time to figure out why the police had given up the pursuit so easily they must have known that he would be bound to keep to the road leaving the road for the deep virgin snow on either side of it would not only have slowed him to a trudging walk but also by virtue of the fresh tracks so easily visible on that starlit night would have instantly given him away and above all he had to have time to think to plan out what he must do next it was typical of michael reynolds that he spent no time in selfrecrimination or in wondering what might have happened had he chosen some other course of action he had been trained in a hard and bitter school where such idle luxuries as selfblame for what was irrevocably past and done with useless postmortems crying over spilt milk and all negative speculations and emotions which might possibly contribute to a lessening of overall efficiency were rigidly proscribed he spent perhaps five seconds considering the past twelve hours then dismissed the matter completely from his mind he would have done the same thing over again he had had every reason to believe his informant in vienna that air travel to budapest was temporarily out airport security precautions during the fortnight of the forthcoming international scientific conference were reported to be the most stringent ever the same applied to all the main railway stations and all longdistance passenger trains were reported to be heavily patrolled by security police that left only the road first an illegal crossing of the frontier no great feat if one had expert help and reynolds had had the best there was and then a stolen ride on some eastward bound truck a roadblock the same viennese informant had warned him would almost certainly be in operation on the outskirts of budapest and reynolds had been prepared for this what he hadnt been prepared for and what none of his informants had known of was the block east of komarom some forty miles outside the capital just one of those things it could have happened to anyone and it just so chanced that it had happened to him reynolds gave the mental equivalent of a philosophic shrug and the past ceased to exist for him it was equally typical of him more precisely perhaps it was typical of the rigorous mental conditioning he had undergone in his long training that his thoughts about the future were rigidly canalised channelled along one allexclusive particular line of thought towards the achievement of one specific objective again the emotional colourings which would normally accompany the thought of the potentialities of a successful mission or the tragic consequences of failure had no part in his racing mind as he lay there in the freezing snow thinking calculating planning assessing chances with a cold and remote detachment the job the job always the job on hand the colonel had repeated once twice a thousand times success or failure in what you do may be desperately important to others but it must never matter a damn to you for you reynolds consequences do not exist and must never be allowed to exist and for two reasons thinking about them upsets your balance and impairs your judgement and every second you give up to thinking along these negative lines is always a second that should and must be used to working out how youre going to achieve the job on hand the job on hand always the job on hand in spite of himself reynolds grimaced as he lay there waiting for his breathing to return to normal there never had been more than one chance in a hundred and now the odds had lengthened astronomically but the job was still there jennings and all his priceless knowledge must be reached and brought out and that was all that mattered but if he reynolds failed in this then he had failed and that was all there was to it he might even fail tonight on his first day of the assignment after eighteen months of the most rigorous and ruthless specialist training aimed at the accomplishment of this task alone but that made no difference whatsoever reynolds was superbly fit he had to be all the colonels specialist handful of men had to be and his breathing was again as near normal as made no difference as for the police mounting the roadblock there must be half a dozen of them he had caught a glimpse of several others emerging from the hut just as he had rounded the bend he would have to take a chance on them there was nothing else he could do possibly they had only been stopping and searching eastbound trucks for contraband and had no interest in panicstricken passengers who fled away into the night although it seemed likely enough that the two policemen he had left groaning in the snow might take a rather more personal interest in him as for the immediate future he couldnt lie there indefinitely to freeze in the snow or risk discovery by the sharpeyed drivers of passing cars or trucks he would have to make for budapest on foot for the first part of the journey at least three or four miles heavy trudging through the fields and then regain the road that at least he would need to take him well clear of the roadblock before he dared try a lift the road to the east curved left before the block and it would be easier for him to go to the left also to shortcircuit the bend of the road across the base of the triangle but to the left the north that was lay the danube at no great distance and he baulked from finding himself trapped in a narrow strip of land between river and road there was nothing for it but to strike off to the south and round the apex of the triangle at a discreet distance and on a clear night like that a discreet distance meant a very considerable distance indeed the detour would take hours to complete teeth again chattering violently he had removed the handkerchief to draw in the great gasping breaths of air his lungs had demanded chilled to the bone and with his hands and feet useless and empty of all feeling reynolds pushed himself shakily to his feet and began to brush the frozen snow off his clothes glancing down the road in the direction of the police roadblock a second later he was once more flat on his face in the snowfilled ditch his heart thumping heavily in his chest his right hand struggling desperately to free his gun from the pocket in his coat where he had stuck it after his fight with the police he could understand now why the police had taken their time in looking for him they could afford to what he could not understand was his own folly in supposing that discovery could result only from some betraying movement or incautious sound made by himself he had forgotten that there was such a thing as a sense of smell he had forgotten all about the dogs and there had been no mistaking the identity of the leading dog as it nosed eagerly along the road not even in the semidarkness a bloodhound was unmistakable where there was any light at all with the sudden shout from one of the approaching men and the excited jabber of voices he was on his feet again reaching the grove of trees behind him in three short steps it had been too much to hope that he hadnt been spotted against that vast backcloth of white he himself in turn had seen in that last quick glimpse that there were four men each with a dog on leash the other three dogs werent bloodhounds he was sure of that he drew in behind the bole of the tree whose branches had lately given him such brief and treacherous refuge freed the gun from his pocket and looked down at it a specially made beautifully machined version of a belgian automatic it was a precise and deadly little gun and with it he could hit a target smaller than a mans hand at twenty paces ten times out of ten tonight he knew he would have difficulty even in hitting a man at half that distance so unresponsive to the minds demands had his numbed and shaking hands become then some instinct made him lift the gun up before his eyes and his mouth tightened even in the faint starlight he could see that the barrel of the gun was blocked with frozen slush and snow he took off his hat held it by the brim and about shoulder height jutting out from one side of the tree waited a couple of seconds then stooped as low as he could and risked a quick glance round the others fifty paces away now if that the four men were walking along in line abreast the dogs still straining on their leashes reynolds straightened dug out a biro pen from his inside pocket and quickly but without haste began to free the barrel of the automatic of the frozen slush but his numbed hands betrayed him and when the biro slipped from his fumbling fingers and disappeared point downwards in the deep snow he knew it was useless to search for it too late for anything more he could hear the brittlesoft crunch of steelshod boots on the hardpacked snow of the road thirty paces perhaps even less he slid a white pinched forefinger through the trigger guard placed the inside of his wrist against the hard rough bark of the tree ready to slide it round the trunk he would have to press hard against the bole to keep his shaking hand even reasonably steady and with his left hand fumbled at his belt to release the knife with its springloaded blade the gun was for the men the knife for the dogs the chances about even for the policemen were advancing towards him shoulder to shoulder across the width of the road rifles dangling loose in the crooks of their arms unskilled amateurs who knew what neither war nor death was or rather the chances would have been about even but for the gun in his hand the first shot might clear the blocked barrel it might equally well blow his hand off on balance then the chances were heavily against him but then on a mission such as this the chances would always be against him the job on hand was still on hand and its accomplishment justified all risks short of the suicidal the knife spring clicked loudly and released the blade a fiveinch sliver of doubleedged blued steel that gleamed evilly in the starlight as reynolds edged round the bole of the tree and lined up his automatic on the nearest of the advancing policemen his trigger finger tightened held slackened and a moment later he was back behind the tree trunk another and fresh tremor had seized his hand and his mouth had gone suddenly dry for the first time he had recognised the other three dogs for what they were untrained country policemen however armed he could deal with bloodhounds too he could handle and with a fair chance of success but only a madman would try conclusions with three trained dobermann pinschers the most vicious and terrible fighting dogs in the world fast as a wolf powerful as an alsatian and a ruthless killer utterly without fear only death could stop a dobermann reynolds didnt even hesitate the chance he had been about to take was no longer a chance but a certain way to suicide the job on hand was still all that mattered alive though a prisoner there was always hope with his throat torn out by a dobermann pinscher neither jennings nor all the old mans secrets would ever come home again reynolds placed the point of his knife against a tree pushed the springloaded blade home into its leather scabbard placed it on the crown of his head and crammed his trilby on top of it then he tossed his automatic at the feet of the startled policemen and stepped out into the road and the starlight both hands held high above his head twenty minutes later they arrived at the police block hut both the arrest and the long cold walk back had been completely uneventful reynolds had expected at the least a rough handling at the most a severe beatingup from rifle butts and steelshod boots but they had been perfunctory almost polite in their behaviour and had shown no illwill or animosity of any kind not even the man with his jaw blue and red and already badly swelling from the earlier impact of reynolds clubbed automatic beyond a token search of his clothing for further arms they had molested him in no way at all had neither asked any questions nor demanded to see and inspect his papers the restraint the punctiliousness made reynolds feel uneasy this was not what one expected in a police state the truck in which he had stolen a lift was still there its driver vehemently arguing and gesticulating with both hands as he sought to convince two policemen of his innocence almost certainly reynolds guessed he was suspected of having some knowledge of reynolds presence in the back of the truck reynolds stopped made to speak and if possible clear the driver but had no chance two of the policemen all brisk officiousness now that they were once more in the presence of headquarters and immediate authority caught his arms and hustled him in through the doors of the hut the hut was small square and illmade the chinks in its walls closed up with wadded wet newspaper and sparsely furnished a portable wood stove with its chimney sticking through the roof a telephone two chairs and a battered little desk behind the desk sat the officer in charge a small fat man middleaged redfaced and insignificant he would have liked his porcine little eyes to have had a cold penetrating stare but it didnt quite come off his air of spurious authority he wore like a threadbare cloak a nonentity reynolds judged possibly even in given circumstances such as the present a dangerous little nonentity but ready for all that to collapse like a pricked balloon at the first contact with real authority a little bluster could do no harm reynolds broke away from the hands of the men holding him reached the desk in two paces and smashed down his fist so heavily that the telephone on the rickety little desk jumped and gave a tiny chimelike ring are you the officer in charge here he demanded harshly the man behind the desk blinked in alarm hurriedly sat back in his chair and had just begun to raise his hands in instinctive selfdefence when he recovered himself and checked the movement but he knew his men had seen it and the red neck and cheeks turned an even darker hue of course im in charge his voice started off as a high squeak dropped an octave as he came on balance again what do you think then what the devil do you mean by this outrage reynolds cut him short in midsentence drew his pass and identification papers from his wallet and flung them on the table go on examine these check the photograph and thumb print and be quick about it im late already and i havent all night to argue with you go on hurry up if he had failed to be impressed by the display of confidence and righteous indignation the little man behind the desk would have been less than human and he was very human indeed slowly reluctantly he drew the papers towards him and picked them up johann buhl he read out born linz now resident vienna businessman importexport dealer machine parts and here by the express invitation of your economic ministry reynolds added softly the letter he now threw on the table was written on the ministrys official notepaper the envelope datestamped budapest four days previously negligently reynolds reached out a leg hooked a chair towards him sat and lit a cigarette cigarette case lighter all made in austria the easy selfconfidence could not be other than genuine wonder what your superiors in budapest will think of this nights work he murmured it will hardly increase your chances of promotion i should think zeal even misplaced zeal is not a punishable offence in our country the officers voice was controlled enough but the pudgy white hands trembled slightly as he returned the letter to its envelope and pushed the papers back to reynolds he clasped his hands on the desk before him stared at them then looked up at reynolds his forehead creased why did you run away oh my god reynolds shook his head in despair the obvious question had been a long time coming and hed had plenty of time to prepare what would you do if a couple of thugs waving their guns around set on you in the darkness lie down and let them butcher you they were police officers you could certainly theyre police officers reynolds interrupted acidly i can see that now but it was as black as night inside the back of the truck he was stretched out at his ease now calm and relaxed his mind racing he had to end this interview quickly the little man behind the desk was after all a lieutenant in the police or its equivalent he couldnt possibly be as stupid as he looked he might stumble across an awkward question at any moment quickly reynolds decided that his best hope lay in audacity the hostility was gone from his manner and his voice was friendly as he went on look lets forget about this i dont think its your fault you were just doing your duty unfortunate though the consequences of your zeal might be for you lets make a deal you provide me with transport to budapest and ill forget it all no reason why this should ever reach the ears of your superiors thank you you are very kind the police officers reception of the proposal was less enthusiastic than reynolds had expected one might even have imagined a hint of dryness in the tone tell me buhl why were you in that truck hardly a normal method of transport for businessmen as important as yourself and you didnt even let the driver know he would probably have refused me he had a notice forbidding unauthorised passengers far back in reynolds mind a tiny little warning bell was ringing my appointment is urgent but why the truck reynolds smiled ruefully your roads are treacherous a skid on ice a deep ditch and there you were my borgward with a broken front axle you came by car but for businessmen in a hurry i know i know reynolds let a little testiness a little impatience creep into his voice they come by plane but i had kilos of machine samples in the boot and back of my car you cant lug a damned great weight like that aboard a plane angrily now he stubbed out his cigarette this questioning is ridiculous ive established my bonafides and im in a great hurry what about that transport two little more questions and then you shall go the officer promised he was leaning back comfortably in his chair now fingers steepled across his chest and reynolds felt his uneasiness deepen you came direct from vienna the main road of course how else would i come this morning dont be silly vienna was less than miles from where they were this afternoon four oclock five oclock later ten past six exactly i remember looking at my watch as i passed through your customs post you could swear to that if necessary yes the police officers nod the quick shifting of his eyes took reynolds by surprise and before he could move three pairs of hands had pinioned his from behind dragged him to his feet twisted his arms in front of him and snapped on a pair of shiny steel handcuffs what the devil does this mean in spite of the shock the cold fury in reynolds tone could hardly have been bettered it just means that a successful liar can never afford to be unsure of his facts the policeman tried to speak equably but the triumph in his voice and eyes was unmistakable i have news for you buhl if that is your name which i dont for a moment believe the austrian frontier has been closed to all traffic for twentyfour hours a normal security check i believe as from three oclock this afternoon ten past six by your watch indeed grinning openly now he stretched out a hand for the telephone youll get your transport to budapest all right you insolent impostor in the back of a guarded police car we havent had a western spy on our hands for a long time now im sure theyll be delighted to send transport for you just especially for you all the way from budapest he broke off suddenly frowned jiggled the receiver up and down listened again muttered something under his breath and replaced the receiver with an angry gesture out of order again that damned thing is always out of order he was unable to conceal his disappointment to have made the important announcement personally would have been one of the highlights of his life he beckoned the nearest of the men where is the nearest telephone in the village three kilometres go there as fast as you can he scribbled furiously on a sheet of paper here is the number and the message dont forget to say it comes from me hurry now the man folded the message stuffed it into his pocket buttoned his coat to the neck and left through the momentarily opened door reynolds could see that even in the short time that had elapsed since his capture clouds had moved across the stars and slow heavy snowflakes were beginning to swirl across the silhouetted oblong of darkening sky he shivered involuntarily then looked back at the police officer im afraid that youll pay heavily for this he said quietly youre making a very grave mistake persistence is an admirable thing in itself but the wise man knows when to stop trying the little fat man was enjoying himself the only mistake i made was ever to believe a word you said he glanced at his watch an hour and a half perhaps two on these snowy roads before your ah transport arrives we can fill in that time very profitably information if you please well start off with your name your real one this time if you dont mind youve already had it youve seen my papers unasked reynolds resumed his seat unobtrusively testing his handcuffs strong closefitting over the wrist and no hope there even so even with bound hands he could have disposed of the little man the springknife was still under his trilby but it was hopeless to think of it not with three armed policemen behind him that information those papers are accurate and true i can tell lies to oblige you no one is asking you to tell lies just to shall we say refresh your memory alas it probably needs some jogging he pushed back from the desk levered himself heavily to his feet he was even shorter and fatter standing upright than he had seemed sitting down and walked round his desk your name if you please i told you reynolds broke off with a grunt of pain as a heavily ringed hand caught him twice across the face backhanded and forehanded he shook his head to clear it lifted his bound arms and wiped some blood from the comer of his mouth with the back of his hand his face was expressionless second thoughts are always wiser thoughts the little man beamed think i detect the beginning of wisdom come now let us have no more of this disagreeable foolishness reynolds called him an unprintable name the heavilyjowled face darkened with blood almost as if at the touch of a switch he stepped forward ringed hand clubbing down viciously then collapsed backwards across his desk gasping and retching with agony propelled by the scythelike sweep of reynolds upward swinging leg for seconds the police officer remained where he had fallen moaning and fighting for breath halflying halfkneeling across his own desk while his own men still stood motionless the suddenness the unbelievable shock of it holding them in thrall it was just at this moment that the door crashed open and a gust of icy air swept into the hut reynolds twisted round in his chair the man who had flung open the door stood framed in the opening his intensely cold blue eyes a very pale blue indeed taking in every detail of the scene a lean broadshouldered man so tall that the uncovered thick brown hair almost touched the lintel of the doorway he was dressed in a military highcollared trenchcoat belted and epauleted vaguely greenish under a dusting of snow so longskirted that it hid the top of his high gleaming jackboots the face matched the eyes the bushy eyebrows the flaring nostrils above the clipped moustache the thin chiselled mouth all lent to the hard handsome face that indefinable air of cold authority of one long accustomed to immediate and unquestioning obedience two seconds were enough to complete his survey two seconds would always be enough for this man reynolds guessed no astonished looks no whats going on here or what the devil does all this mean he strode into the room unhooked one of his thumbs from the leather belt that secured his revolver butt forward to his left waist bent down and hauled the police officer to his feet indifferent to his white face his whooping gasps of pain as he fought for breath idiot the voice was in keeping with the appearance cold dispassionate all but devoid of inflection next time you ah interrogate a man stand clear of his feet he nodded curtly in reynolds direction who is this man what were you asking him and why the police officer glared malevolently at reynolds sucked some air down into his tortured lungs and whimpered huskily through a strangled throat his name is johann buhl a viennese businessman but i dont believe it hes a spy a filthy fascist spy he spat out viciously a filthy fascist spy naturally the tall man smiled coldly all spies are filthy fascists but i dont want your opinions i want facts first how did you find out his name he said so and he had papers forgeries of course give them to me the police officer gestured towards the table he could stand almost upright now there they are give them to me the request in tone inflection in every way was a carbon copy of the first the policeman reached out hastily wincing with the pain of the sudden movement and handed him the paper excellent yes excellent the newcomer rifled expertly through the pages might even be genuine but theyre not hes our man all right reynolds had to make a conscious effort to relax his clenching fists this man was infinitely dangerous more dangerous than a division of stupid bunglers like the little policeman even trying to fool this man would be a waste of time your man your man the policeman was groping completely out of his depth what do you mean i ask the questions little man you say he is a spy why he says he crossed the frontier this evening the little man was learning lessons in brevity the frontier was closed it was indeed the stranger leaned against the wall selected a russian cigarette from a thin gold case no brass or chromium for the top boys reynolds thought bleakly lit a cigarette and looked thoughtfully at reynolds it was the policeman who finally broke the silence twenty or thirty seconds had given him time to recover his thoughts and a shred of his courage why should i take orders from you he blustered ive never seen you in my life before i am in charge here who the devil are you perhaps ten seconds ten seconds spent minutely examining reynolds clothes and face elapsed before the newcomer turned lazily away and looked down at the little policeman the eyes were glacial dispassionate but the expression on the face showed no change the policeman seemed to shrink curiously inside his clothes and he pressed back hard against the edge of the desk i have my rare moments of generosity we will forget for the present what you said and how you said it he plodded towards reynolds and his tone hardened almost imperceptibly this man is bleeding from the mouth he tried perhaps to resist arrest he wouldnt answer my questions and who gave you authority either to question or injure prisoners the tone of the voice cut like a whip you stupid bungling idiot you might have done irreparable harm overstep your authority once again and i personally will see to it that you have a rest from your exacting duties the seaside perhaps constanta for a start the policeman tried to lick his dry lips and his eyes were sick with fear constanta the area of the danubeblack sea canal slave labour camps was notorious throughout central europe many had gone there but no one ever returned i i only thought leave thinking to those capable of such difficult feats he jerked a thumb at reynolds have this man taken out to my car he has been searched of course but of course the policeman was almost trembling in his eagerness thoroughly i assure you that statement coming from such as you makes a further search imperative the tall man said dryly he looked at reynolds one heavy eyebrow lifting slightly must we be reduced to this mutual indignity my having to search you personally i mean theres a knife under my hat thank you the tall man lifted the hat removed the knife courteously replaced the hat pressed the release catch thoughtfully inspected the blade closed the knife slid it into his coat pocket and looked at the whitefaced policeman there is no conceivable reason why you should not rise to the topmost heights of your profession he glanced at his watch as unmistakably gold as the cigarette case come i must be on my way i see you have the telephone here get me the andrassy ut and be quick about it the andrassy ut even though he had been becoming surer of the identity of the man with the passing of every moment confirmation of his suspicions still came to reynolds with a sense of shock and he could feel his face tightening in spite of himself under the speculative gaze of the tall stranger headquarters of the dreaded avo the hungarian secret police currently reckoned the most ruthless and implacably efficient behind the iron curtain the andressy ut was the one place on earth he wanted at all costs to avoid ah i see the name is not new to you the stranger smiled that bodes no good for you mr buhl or for your bonafides the andrassy ut is hardly a name on every western businessmans lips he turned to the policeman well what are you stuttering about now the the telephone the voice was high and squeaking again and faltering badly he was afraid now to the point of terror its out of action inevitably matchless efficiency on every hand may the gods help our unfortunate country he produced a wallet from his pocket opened it briefly for inspection sufficiently good authority for the removal of your prisoner of course colonel of course the words tripped over one another whatever you say colonel good the wallet snapped shut and the stranger turned to reynolds and bowed with ironic courtesy colonel szendro headquarters hungarian political police i am at your service mr buhl and my car at your disposal we leave for budapest immediately my colleagues and i have been expecting you for some weeks now and are most anxious to discuss certain matters with you chapter two it was pitch dark outside now but light streaming from the open door and uncovered window of the hut gave them enough visibility to see by colonel szendros car was parked on the other side of the road a black lefthand drive mercedes saloon already covered with a deep layer of snow all except the front part of the bonnet where the engine heat melted the snow as it fell there was a minutes delay while the colonel told them to release the truck driver and search the inside of the truck for any personal luggage buhl might have been forced to abandon there they found his overnight bag almost immediately and stuffed his gun into it then szendro opened the front righthand door of the car and gestured reynolds to his seat reynolds would have sworn that no one man driving a car could have held him captive for fifty miles only to find out how wrong he was even before the car started while a soldier with a rifle covered reynolds from the lefthand side szendro stooped inside the other door opened the glove compartment in front of reynolds fetched out two lengths of thin chain and left the glove box open a somewhat unusual car my dear buhl the colonel said apologetically but you understand from time to time i feel that i must give certain of my passengers a feeling of ah security rapidly he unlocked one of the handcuffs passed the end link of one of the chains through it locked it passed the chain through a ring or eye bolt in the back of the glove box and secured it to the other handcuff then he looped the second chain round reynolds legs just above the knees and closing the door and leaning in through the opened window secured it with a small padlock to the armrest he stood back to survey his work satisfactory i think you should be perfectly comfortable and have ample freedom of movement but not enough i assure you to reach me at the same time you will find it difficult to throw yourself out of the door which you would find far from easy to push open anyway you will observe that the pullout handle is missing from your door the tone was light even bantering but reynolds knew better than to be deceived also kindly refrain from damaging yourself by surreptitiously testing the strength of the chains and their anchors the chains have a breaking load of just over a ton the armrest is specially reinforced and that ring in the glove box bolted through on to the chassis well what on earth do you want now i forgot to tell you colonel the policemans voice was quick nervous i sent a message to our budapest office asking to send a car for this man you did szendros voice was sharp when ten perhaps fifteen minutes ago tool you should have told me immediately however its too late now no harm done possibly some good if they are as thick in the head as you are a circumstance of which it is admittedly difficult to conceive a long drive in the cold night air should clear their minds admirably colonel szendro banged the door shut switched on the roof light above the windscreen so that he should have no difficulty in seeing his prisoner and drove off for budapest the mercedes was equipped with snow tyres on all four wheels and in spite of the hardpacked snow on the road szendro made good time he drove with the casual easy precision of an expert his cold blue eyes for ever shifting to his right very frequently and at varying intervals reynolds sat very still staring right ahead he had already in spite of the colonels admonitions tested the chains the colonel hadnt exaggerated now he was forcing his mind to think coldly clearly and as constructively as possible his position was almost hopeless it would be completely so when they reached budapest miracles happened but only a certain kind of miracle no one had ever escaped from the avo headquarters from the torture chambers in stalin street once there he was lost if he was ever to escape it would have to be from this car inside the next hour there was no window winding handle on the door the colonel had thoughtfully removed all such temptations even if the window had been open he couldnt have reached the handle on the outside his hands couldnt reach the wheel he had already measured the arc of radius of the chain and his straining fingers would have been at least two inches away he could move his legs to a certain extent but couldnt raise them high enough to kick in the windscreen shatter the toughened glass throughout its length and perhaps cause a crash at fairly high speed he could have placed his feet against the dashboard and he knew of some cars where he could have heaved the front seat backwards off the rails but everything in this car spelt solidity and if he tried and failed as he almost certainly would all hed probably get for his pains would be a tap on the head that would keep him h quiet till they got to the andrassy ut all the time he deliberately compelled himself to keep his mind off what was going to happen to him when he got there that way lay only weakness and ultimate destruction his pockets had he anything in his pockets he could use anything solid enough to throw at szendros head shock him for a length of time necessary to lose control and crash the car reynolds was aware that he himself might be hurt as seriously as the colonel even though he had the advantage of preparation but a fiftyfifty chance was better than the one in a million he had without it he knew exactly where szendro had put the key to the handcuffs but a rapid mental inventory dismissed that hope he had nothing heavier in his pocket than a handful of forints his shoes then could he remove a shoe and get szendro in the face with it before the colonel knew what he was doing but that thought came only a second ahead of the realisation of its futility with his wrists handcuffed the only way he could reach his shoes in any way unobtrusively was between his legs and his knees were lashed tightly together another idea desperate but with a chance of success had just occurred to him when the colonel spoke for the first time in the fifteen minutes since they had left the police block you are a dangerous man mr buhl he remarked conversationally you think too much cassius you know your shakespeare of course reynolds said nothing every word this man said was a potential trap the most dangerous man ive ever had in this car i should say and a few desperate characters have sat from time to time where youre sitting now szendro went on ruminatively you know where youre going and you dont appear to care but you must of course again reynolds kept silent the plan might work the chance of success was enough to justify the risk the silence is uncompanionable to say the least colonel szendro observed he lit a cigarette sent the match spinning through the ventilation window reynolds stiffened slightly the very opening he wanted szendro went on you are quite comfortable i trust quite reynolds conversational tone matched szendros own but id appreciate a cigarette too if you dont mind by all means szendro was hospitality itself one must cater for ones guests youll find half a dozen lying loose inside the glove compartment a cheap and undistinguished brand i fear but ive always found that people in your ah position do not tend to be overcritical about these things a cigarette any cigarette is a great help in times of stress thank you reynolds nodded at the projection on top of the dashboard at his own side cigar lighter is it not it is use it by all means reynolds stretched forward with his handcuffed wrists pressed it down for a few seconds then lifted it out its spiral tip glowing red in the faint light from above then just as it cleared the fascia his hands fumbled and he dropped it on the floor he reached down to get it but the chain brought his hands up with a sharp jerk inches from the floor he swore softly to himself szendro laughed and reynolds straightening looked at him there was no malice in the colonels face just a mixture of amusement and admiration the admiration predominating very very clever mr buhl i said you were a dangerous man and now im surer than ever he drew deeply on his cigarette we are now presented with a choice of three possible lines of action are we not none of them i may say has any marked appeal for me i dont know what you are talking about magnificent again szendro was smiling broadly the puzzlement in your voice couldnt be improved upon three courses are open i say first i could courteously bend over and down to retrieve it whereupon you would do your best to crush in the back of my head with your handcuffs you would certainly knock me senseless and you observed very keenly without in any way appearing to do so exactly where i put the key to these handcuffs reynolds looked at him uncomprehendingly but already he could taste defeat in his mouth secondly i could toss you a box of matches you would strike one ignite the heads of all the other matches in the box throw it in my face crash the car and who knows what might happen then or you could just hope that id give you a light either from the lighter or cigarette then the finger judo lock a couple of broken fingers a transfer to a wrist lock and then the key at your leisure mr buhl you will bear watching youre talking nonsense reynolds said roughly perhaps perhaps i have a suspicious mind but i survive he tossed something on to the lap of reynolds coat herewith one single match you can light it on the metal hinge of the glove box reynolds sat and smoked in silence he couldnt give up he wouldnt give up although he knew in his heart that the man at the wheel knew all the answers and the answers to many questions which he reynolds probably didnt know ever existed half a dozen separate plans occurred to him each one more fantastic and with less chance of success than the previous one and he was just coming to the end of his second cigarette he had lit it off the butt end of the first when the colonel changed down into third gear peered at the near side of the road braked suddenly and swung off into a small lane half a minute later on a stretch of the lane parallel to and barely twenty yards from the highway but almost entirely screened from it by thick snowcovered bushes szendro stopped the car and switched off the ignition then he turned off his head and side lights wound his window right down in spite of the bitter cold and turned to face reynolds the roof light above the windscreen still burned in the darkness here it comes reynolds thought bleakly thirty miles yet to budapest but szendro just cant bear to wait any longer reynolds had no illusions no hope he had had access to secret files concerning the activities of the hungarian political police in the year that had elapsed since the bloody october rising of and they had made ghastly reading it was difficult to think of the avo the avh as they were more lately known as people belonging to the human race wherever they went they carried with them terror and destruction a living death and death itself the slow death of the aged in deportee camps and the young in the slave labour camps the quick death of the summary executions and the ghastly insane screaming deaths of those who succumbed to the most abominable tortures ever conceived of the evil that lay buried deep in the hearts of the satanic perverts who find their way into the political police of dictatorships the world over and no secret police in modern times excelled or even matched hungarys avo in the nameless barbarities the inhuman cruelties and allpervading terror with which they held hopeless people in fearridden thrall they had learnt much from hitlers gestapo during the second world war and had that knowledge refined by their current nominal masters the nkvd of russia but now the pupils had outdistanced their mentors and they had developed fleshcrawling refinements and more terribly effective methods of terrorisation such as the others had not dreamed of but colonel szendro was still at the talking stage he turned round in his seat lifted reynolds bag from the back set it on his lap and tried to open it it was locked the key szendro said and dont tell me there isnt one or that its lost both you and i i suspect mr buhl are long past that kindergarten stage they were indeed reynolds thought grimly inside ticket pocket of my jacket get it and your papers at the same time i cant get at these allow me reynolds winced as szendros pistol barrel pushed hard against lips and teeth felt the colonel slip the papers from his breast pocket with a professional ease that would have done credit to a skilled pickpocket and then szendro was back on his own side of the car the bag open almost it seemed without pausing to think he had slit open the canvas lining and extracted a slim fold of papers and was now comparing them with those he had taken from reynolds pockets well well well mr buhl interesting most interesting chameleonlike you change your identity in a moment of time name birthplace occupation even your nationality all altered in an instant a remarkable transformation he studied the two sets of documents one in either hand which if any are we to believe the austrian papers are fakes reynolds growled for the first time he stopped speaking in german and switched to fluent idiomatic hungarian i had word that my mother who has lived in vienna for many years was dying i had to have them ah of course and your mother no more reynolds crossed himself you can find her obituary in tuesdays paper maria rakosi im at the stage now where i would be astonished if i didnt szendro spoke also in hungarian but his accent was not that of budapest reynolds was sure of that he had spent too many agonising months learning every last budapest inflection and idiom from an exprofessor of central european languages of budapest university szendro was speaking again a tragic interlude i am sure i bare my head in silent sympathy metaphorically you understand so you claim your real name is lajos rakosi a very wellknown name indeed and a common one and genuine youll find my name date of birth address date of marriage all in the records also my spare me szendro held up a protesting hand i dont doubt it i dont doubt you could show me the very school desk on which your initials are carved and produce the oncelittle girl whose books you once carried home from school none of which would impress me in the slightest what does impress me is the extraordinary thoroughness and care of not only yourself but the superiors who have so magnificently trained you for whatever purpose they have in mind i do not think i have ever met anything quite like it you talk in riddles colonel szendro im just an ordinary budapest citizen i can prove it all right i did have fake austrian papers but my mother was dying and i was prepared to risk indiscretion but ive committed no crime against our country surely you can see that if i wished i could have gone over to the west but i did not so wish my country is my country and budapest is my home so i came back a slight correction szendro murmured youre not coming back to budapest youre going and probably for the first time in your life he was looking reynolds straight in the eyes when his expression changed behind you reynolds twisted round a split second before he realised szendro had shouted in english and there had been nothing in szendros eyes or tone to betray his meaning reynolds turned back slowly an expression almost of boredom on his face a school boyish trick i speak english he was using english now why should i deny it my dear colonel if you belonged to budapest which you dont you would know that there are at least fifty thousand of us who speak english why should so common an accomplishment be regarded with suspicion by all the gods szendro slapped his hand on his thigh its magnificent its really magnificent my professional jealousy is aroused to have a britisher or an american british i think the american intonation is almost impossible to conceal talk hungarian with a budapest accent as perfectly as you do is no small feat but to have an englishman talk english with a budapest accent that is superb for heavens sake theres nothing superb about it reynolds almost shouted in exasperation i am hungarian i fear not szendro shook his head your masters taught you and taught you magnificently you mr buhl are worth a fortune to any espionage system in the world but one thing they didnt teach you one thing they couldnt teach you because they dont know what it is is the mentality of the people i think we may speak openly as two intelligent men and dispense with the fancy patriotic phrases employed for the benefit of the ah proletariat it is in brief the mentality of the vanquished of the fearridden the cowed shoulder that never knows when the long hand of death is going to reach out and touch it reynolds was looking at him in astonishment this man must be tremendously sure of himself but szendro ignored him i have seen too many of our countrymen mr buhl going as you are to excruciating torture and death most of them are just paralysed some of them are plainly terrorstricken and weeping and a handful are consumed by fury you could not possibly fit in any of these categories you should but as i say there are things your masters cannot know you are cold and without emotion planning calculating all the time supremely confident of your own ability to extract the maximum advantage from the slightest opportunity that arises and never tired of watching for that opportunity to come had you been a lesser man mr buhl selfbetrayal would not have come so easily he broke off suddenly reached and switched off the roof light just as reynolds ears caught the hum of an approaching car engine wound up his window deftly removed a cigarette from reynolds hand and crushed it beneath his shoe he said nothing and made no move until the approaching car a barely perceptible blur behind the sweep of its blazing headlights its tyres silent on the snowpacked road had passed by and vanished to the west as soon as it was lost to sight and sound szendro had reversed out on the highway again and was on his way pushing the big car almost to the limit of safety along the treacherous road and through the gently falling snow over an hour and a half elapsed before they reached budapest a long slow journey that could normally have been done in half the time but the snow a curtain of great feathery flakes that swirled whitely suddenly into the flattopped beams of the headlights had become steadily heavier and slowed them up at times almost to walking pace as the labouring wipers pushing the clogging snow into corrugated ridges on the middle and at the sides of the windscreen swept through narrower and narrower arcs until finally they had stopped altogether a dozen times at least szendro had had to stop to clear the mass of snow off the screen and then a few miles short of the city limits szendro had left the highway again and plunged into a mass of narrow twisting roads on many stretches where the snow lay smooth and deep and treacherously masking the border between road and ditch theirs was obviously the first car that had passed since the snow had begun to fall but despite the care and concentrated attention szendro gave the roads his flickering eyes found reynolds every few seconds the mans unflagging vigilance was almost inhuman why the colonel had left the main road reynolds couldnt guess any more than he could guess why he had stopped and drawn off the road earlier on that he wanted in the earlier instance to avoid the big police car racing west to komarom and now to bypass the police block on the city limits of which reynolds had been warned at vienna was obvious enough but the reason for these actions was a different thing altogether reynolds wasted no time on the problem he had problems enough of his own he had perhaps ten minutes left they were passing now through the winding villalined streets and steeplycobbled residential avenues of buda the western half of the city and dropping down to the danube the snow was easing again and twisting round in his seat reynolds could just vaguely see the rockbound promontory of the gellert hill its grey sharp granite jutting through the windblown snow the vast bulk of the st gellert hotel and as they approached the ferenc jozsef bridge the st gellert mount where some oldtime bishop who had incurred the wrath of his fellowman had been shoved into a spiked barrel and heaved into the danube bungling amateurs in those days reynolds thought grimly the old bishop couldnt have lasted a couple of minutes down in the andrassy ut things would doubtless be much better arranged already they were across the danube and turning left into the corso the onetime fashionable embankment of open air cafes on the pest side of the river but it was black and desolate now as deserted as were nearly all the streets and it seemed dated anachronistic a nostalgic and pathetic survival from an earlier and happier age it was difficult it was impossible to conjure up the ghosts of those who had promenaded there only two decades ago carefree and gay and knowing that another tomorrow would never come that all the other tomorrows could only be the same as today it was impossible to visualise however dimly the budapest of yesterday the loveliest and happiest of cities all that vienna never was the city to which so many westerners of so many nations came to visit briefly for a day for two days and never went home again but allthat was gone even the memory was almost gone reynolds had never been in the city before but he knew it as few of the citizens of budapest would ever know it over beyond the west bank of the danube the royal palace the gothicmoorish fishers bastion and the coronation church were halfimagined blurs in the snowfilled darkness but he knew where they were and what they were as if he had lived in the city all his life and now on their right was the magnificent parliament of the magyars the parliament and its tragic bloodstained square where a thousand hungarians had been massacred in the october rising mown down by tanks and the murderous fire of the heavy avo machineguns mounted on the roof of the parliament itself everything was real every building every street was exactly where it should be precisely where he had been told it would be but reynolds could not shake off the growing feeling of unreality of illusion as if he were spectator of a play and all this was happening to someone else a normally unimaginative man ruthlessly trained to be abnormally so to subject all emotion and feeling to the demands of reason and the intellect he was aware of the strangeness in his mind and at a loss to account for it perhaps it was the certain foreknowledge of defeat the knowledge that old jennings would never come home again or it could have been the cold or tiredness or hopelessness or the ghostly veil of drifting snow that hung over everything but he knew it was none of these things it was something else again and now they had left the embankment and were turning into the long broad treelined boulevard of the andrassy ut itself the andrassy ut that street of wellloved memories leading past the royal opera house to the zoo the fun fair and the city park had been an inseparable part of a thousand days and nights of pleasure and enjoyment of freedom and escape to tens of thousands of citizens in days gone by and no place on earth had lain nearer to the hearts of the hungarians and now all that was gone it could never be the same again no matter what befell not even if peace and independence and freedom were to come again for now the andrassy ut meant only repression and terror the hammering on the door in the middle of the night and the brown lorries that came to take you away the prison camps and deportation the torture chambers and the benison of death andrassy ut meant only the headquarters of the avo and still the feeling of remoteness of detached unreality remained with michael reynolds he knew where he was he knew his time had run out he was beginning to know what szendro had meant by the mentality of a people who had lived too long with terror and the everpresent spectre of death and he knew too that no one who ever made a journey such as he was making now could feel exactly the same again indifferently almost with a kind of detached academic interest he wondered how long he would last in the torture chambers what latest diabolical variations of destroying a man lay in wait for him and then the mercedes was slowing down its heavy tyres crunching through the frozen slush of the street and reynolds in spite of himself in spite of the unemotional stoicism of years and the shell of protective indifference in which he had armoured himself felt fear touch him for the first time a fear that touched his mouth and left it parched and dry his heart and left it pounding heavily painfully in his chest and his stomach as if something heavy and solid and sharp lay there constricting it upon itself but no trace of any of this touched the expression on his face he knew colonel szendro was watching him closely he knew that if he were what he claimed to be an innocent citizen of budapest he should be afraid and fear should show in his face but he could not bring himself to it not because he was unable to do so but because he knew of the reciprocal relationship between facial expression and the mind to show fear did not necessarily mean that one was afraid but to show fear when one was afraid and fighting desperately not to be afraid would be fatal it was as if colonel szendro had been reading his mind i have no suspicion left mr buhl only certainties you know where you are of course naturally reynolds voice was steady ive walked along here a thousand times youve never walked here in your life but i doubt whether even the city surveyor could draw as accurate a map of budapest as you could szendro said equably he stopped the car recognise any place your hq reynolds nodded at a building fifty yards away on the other side of the street exactly mr buhl this is where you should faint go into hysterics or just sit there moaning with terror all the others do but you dont perhaps you are completely devoid of fear an enviable if not admirable characteristic but one which i assure you no longer exists in this country or perhaps an enviable and admirable characteristic you are afraid but ruthless training has eliminated all its outward manifestations in either case my friend you are condemned you dont belong perhaps not as our police friend said a filthy fascist spy but assuredly a spy he glanced at his watch then stared at reynolds with a peculiar intentness just after midnight the time we operate best and for you the best treatment and the best quarters a little soundproof room deep below the streets of budapest only three avo officers in all hungary know of its existence he stared at reynolds for several seconds longer then started the car instead of stopping at the avo building he swung the car sharp left off the andrassy ut drove a hundred yards down an unlighted street and stopped again long enough to tie a silk handkerchief securely over reynolds eyes ten minutes later after much turning and twisting which completely lost reynolds as he knew it was designed to do all sense of place and direction the car bumped heavily once or twice dropped steeply down a long ramp and drew up inside an enclosed space reynolds could hear the deep exhaust note of the car beating back off the walls and then as the motor died he heard heavy iron doors clanging shut behind them seconds later the door on reynolds side of the car opened and a pair of hands busied themselves with freeing him of the restraining chains and then resecuring the handcuffs then the same hands were urging him out of the car and removing the blindfold reynolds screwed up his eyes and blinked they were in a big windowless garage with heavy doors already locked behind them and the brightness of the overhead light reflecting off whitewashed walls and ceiling was momentarily dazzling after the darkness of the blindfold and the night at the other end of the garage close to him was another door halfopen leading into a brightlylit whitewashed corridor whitewash he reflected grimly appeared to be an inseparable concomitant of all modern torture chambers between reynolds and the door still holding him by the arm was the man who had removed the chains reynolds looked at him for a long moment with this man available the avo had no need to rely on instruments of torture those enormous hands could just tear prisoners apart slowly piece by piece about reynolds own height the man looked squat almost deformed in comparison and the shoulders above that great barrel of chest were the widest reynolds had ever seen he must have weighed at least ibs the face was brokennosed and ugly but curiously innocent of any trace of depravity or bestiality just pleasantly ugly reynolds wasnt deceived in his line of business faces meant nothing the most ruthless man he had ever known a german espionage agent who had lost count of the number of men he had killed had the face of a choirboy colonel szendro slammed the car door and walked round to where reynolds was standing he looked at the other man and nodded at reynolds a guest sandor a little canary who is going to sing us a song before the night is through has the chief gone to bed he is waiting for you in the office the mans voice was what one would have expected a low deep rumble in the throat excellent ill be back in a few minutes watch our friend here watch him closely i suspect hes very dangerous ill watch him sandor promised comfortably he waited till szendro with reynolds bag and papers in his hand had gone then propped himself lazily against a whitewashed wall massive arms folded across his chest hardly had he done so when he had pushed himself off the wall and taken a step towards reynolds you do not look well im all right reynolds voice was husky his breathing quick and shallow and he was swaying slightly on his feet he lifted his shackled hands over his right shoulder and massaged the back of his neck wincing its my head the back of my head sandor took another step forward then moved swiftly as he saw reynolds eyes turning up till only the whites showed beginning to topple forward his body twisting slightly to the left as he fell he could injure himself badly even kill himself if his unprotected head struck the concrete floor and sandor had to reach forward quickly arms outstretched to cushion the fall reynolds hit sandor harder than he had ever hit anyone in his life thrusting forward off the ball of his foot and pivoting his body with whiplash speed from left to right he brought his manacled hands scything down in a violent vicious chopping blow that carried with it every last ounce of power of his sinewy arms and shoulders the flat edges of his two hands pressed hard together caught sandor across the exposed neck just below the line of jawbone and ear it was like striking the trunk of a tree and reynolds gasped with pain it felt as if both his little fingers were broken it was a judo blow a killing judo blow and it would have killed many men all others it would have paralysed left unconscious for hours all others that is that reynolds had ever known sandor just grunted momentarily shook his head to clear it and kept on coming turning sideways to neutralise any attempt reynolds might make to use feet or knees pressing him back remorselessly against the side of the mercedes reynolds was powerless he couldnt have resisted even had he been of a mind to and his utter astonishment that any man could not only survive such a blow but virtually ignore it left no room for any thought of resistance sandor leaned against him with all his great weight crushing him against the car reached down with both hands caught reynolds by the forearms and squeezed there was no animosity no expression at all in the giants eyes as they stared unblinkingly into reynolds from a distance of three or four inches he just stood there and squeezed reynolds clenched teeth and lips together till his jaws ached forcing back the scream of agony it seemed as if his forearms had been caught in two giant inexorably tightening vices he could feel the blood draining from his face the cold sweat starting on his forehead and the bones and sinews of his arms felt as if they were being mangled and crushed beyond recovery the blood was pounding in his head the garage walls were becoming dim and swimming before his eyes when sandor released his grip and stepped back gently massaging the lefthand side of his neck next time i squeeze it will be a little higher up he said mildly just where you hit me please stop this foolishness both of us have been hurt and for nothing five minutes passed five minutes during which the sharp agony in reynolds arms faded to a dull pounding ache five minutes in which sandors unblinking eyes never strayed from him then the door opened wide and a young man he was hardly more than a boy stood there looking at reynolds he was thin and sallow with an unruly mop of black hair and quick nervous darting eyes almost as dark as his hair he jerked a thumb over his shoulder the chief wants to see him sandor bring him along will you sandor escorted reynolds along the narrow corridor down a shallow flight of stairs at the end into another corridor then pushed him through the first of several doors that lined both sides of the second passageway reynolds stumbled recovered then looked around him it was a large room wood panelled the worn linoleum on the floor relieved only by a stretch of threadbare carpet in front of the desk at the far end of the room the room was brightly lit with a lamp of moderate power in the ceiling and a powerful walllight on a flexible extension arm behind the desk at the moment the latter was pointing downward on to the surface of the desk harshly highlighting his gun the jumble of clothes and the other articles that had recently been so neatly folded in reynolds bag beside the clothes were the torn remnants of the bag itself the lining was in tatters the zip had been torn off the leather handle had been slit open and even the four studs of the base of the bag had been torn out by the pair of pliers lying beside them reynolds silently acknowledged the handiwork of an expert colonel szendro was standing beside the table leaning over towards the man seated behind it the face of the latter was hidden in deep shadow but both hands holding some of reynolds papers were exposed to the pitiless glare of the lamp they were terrible hands reynolds had never seen anything remotely like them had never imagined that any human beings hands could be so scarred crushed and savagely mutilated and still serve as hands both thumbs were crushed and flattened and twisted fingertips and nails were blurred into a shapeless mass the little finger and half of the fourth finger of the left hand were missing and the backs of both hands were covered with ugly scars surrounding bluishpurple weals in the middle between the tendons of the middle and fourth fingers reynolds stared at these weals fascinated and shivered involuntarily he had seen these marks once before on a dead man the marks of crucifixion had these been his hands reynolds thought in revulsion he would have had them amputated he wondered what manner of man could bear to live with these hands not only live with them but have them uncovered he was suddenly possessed of an almost obsessive desire to see the face of the man behind these hands but sandor had halted several paces from the desk and the blackness of the shadow by the lamp defeated him the hands moved gesturing with reynolds papers and the man at the desk spoke the voice was quiet controlled almost friendly these papers are interesting enough in their own way masterpiece of the forgers art you will be good enough to tell us your real name he broke off and looked at sandor who was still tenderly massaging his neck what is wrong sandor he hit me sandor explained apologetically he knows how to hit and where to hit and he hits hard a dangerous man szendro said i warned you you know yes but hes a cunning devil sandor complained he pretended to faint a major achievement to hurt you an act of desperation to hit you at all the man behind the desk said dryly but you mustnt complain sandor he who expects that death comes with the next breath but one is not given to counting the cost well mr buhl your name please ive already told colonel szendro reynolds replied rakosi lajos rakosi i could invent a dozen names all different in the hope of saving myself unnecessary suffering but i couldnt prove my right to any of them i can prove flay right to my own name rakosi you are a brave man mr buhl the seated man shook his head but in this house you will find courage a useless prop lean on it and it will only crumble to dust under your weight the truth alone will serve your name please reynolds paused before replying he was fascinated and puzzled and hardly afraid any more the hands fascinated him he could scarcely take his eyes off them and he could see now some tattooing on the inside of the mans wrist at that distance it looked like a figure but he couldnt be certain he was puzzled because there were too many offbeat angles to all that was happening to him too much that didnt fit in with his conception of the avo and all that he had been told about them there was a curious restraint almost a cold courtesy in their attitude to him but he was aware that the cat could just be playing with the mouse perhaps they were just subtly sapping his determination to resist conditioning him to be least prepared for the impact of the blow when it came and why his fear was lessening he would have found it impossible to say it must have arisen from some subtle promptings of his subconscious mind for he was at a conscious loss to account for it we are waiting mr buhl reynolds couldnt detect the slightest trace of an edge through the studied patience of the voice i can only tell you thetruth ive already done that very well take your clothes off all of them no reynolds glanced swiftly round but sandor stood between him and the door he looked back and colonel szendro had his pistol out ill be damned if i do it dont be silly szendros voice was weary i have a gun in my hand and sandor will do it by force if necessary sandor has a spectacular if untidy method of undressing people he rips coats and shirts in half down the back youll find it far easier to do the job yourself reynolds did it himself the handcuffs were unlocked and inside a minute all his clothes were crumpled heaps about his feet and he was standing there shivering his forearms angry masses of red and blue weals where sanders vicelike fingers had dug into his flesh bring the clothes over here sandor the man at the desk ordered he looked at reynolds theres a blanket on the bench behind you reynolds looked at him in sudden wonder that it was his clothes they wanted looking for giveaway tags probably instead of himself was surprising enough that the courtesy and on that cold night the kindness of a covering blanket should be offered was astonishing and then he caught his breath and utterly forgot about both of those things because the man behind the desk had risen and walked round with a peculiarly stifflegged gait to examine the clothes reynolds was a trained judge very highly trained of faces and expressions and character he made mistakes and made them often but he never made major mistakes and he knew that it was impossible that he was making a major one now the face was fully in the light now and it was a face that made these terrible hands a blasphemous contradiction an act of impiety in themselves a lined tired face a middleaged face that belied the thick snowwhite hair above a face deeply splendidly etched by experience by a sorrowing and suffering such as reynolds could not even begin to imagine it held more goodness more wisdom and tolerance and understanding than reynolds had ever seen in the face of any man before it was the face of a man who had seen everything known everything and experienced everything and still had the heart of a child reynolds sank slowly down on to the bench mechanically wrapping the faded blanket around him desperately almost forcing himself to think with detachment and clarity he tried to reduce to order the kaleidoscopic whirling of confused and contradictory thoughts that raced through his mind but he had got no farther than the first insoluble problem the presence of a man like that in a diabolical organisation like the avo when he received his fourth and final shock and almost immediately afterwards the answer to all his problems the door beside reynolds swung open towards him and a girl walked into the room the avo reynolds knew not only had its complement of females but ranked among them skilled exponents of the most fiendish tortures imaginable but not even by the wildest leap of the imagination could reynolds include her in that category a little below middle height with one hand tightly clasping the wrap about her slender waist her face was young and fresh and innocent untouched by any depravity the yellow hair the colour of ripening corn was awry about her shoulders and with the knuckles of one hand she was still rubbing the sleep from eyes of a deep cornflower blue when she spoke her voice was still a little blurred from sleep but soft and musical if perhaps touched with a little asperity why are you still up and talking its one oclock in the morning its after one and id like to get some sleep suddenly her eyes caught sight of the pile of clothing on the table and she swung round to catch sight of reynolds sitting on the bench and clad only in the old blanket her eyes widened and she took an involuntary step backwards clutching her wrap even more tightly around her who who on earth is this jansci chapter three jansci michael reynolds was on his feet without any volition on hiown part for the first time since he had fallen into hungarian hands the studied calmness the mask of emotional indifference vanished and his eyes were alight with excitement and a hope that he had thought had vanished for ever he took two quick steps towards the girl grabbing at his blanket as it slipped and almost fell to the floor did you say jansci he demanded whats wrong what do you want the girl had retreated as reynolds had advanced then stopped as she bumped into the reassuring bulk of sandor and clutched his arm the apprehension in her face faded and she looked at reynolds thoughtfully and nodded yes i said that jansci jansci reynolds repeated the word slowly incredulously like a man savouring each syllable to the full wanting desperately to believe in the truth of something but unable to bring himself to that belief he walked across the room the hope and the conflicting doubt still mirrored in his eyes and stopped before the man with the scarred hands your name is jansci reynolds spoke slowly the unbelief the inability to believe still registering in his eyes i am called jansci the older man nodded his eyes speculative and quiet one four one four one eight two reynolds looked unblinkingly at the other searching for the faintest trace of response of admission is that it is that what mr buhl if you are jansci the number is one four one four one eight two reynolds repeated gently meeting no resistance he reached out for the scarred left hand pushed the cuff back from the wrist and stared down at the violet tattoo the number was as clear as unblemished as if it had been made only that day reynolds sat down on the edge of the desk caught sight of a packet of cigarettes and shook one loose szendro struck and held a match for him and reynolds nodded gratefully he doubted whether he could have done it for himself his hands were trembling uncontrollably the fizzling of the igniting match seemed strangely loud in the sudden silence of the room jansci it was who finally broke the silence you seem to know something about me he prompted gently i know a lot more the tremor was dying out of reynolds hands and he was coming back on balance again outwardly at least he looked round the room at szendro sandor the girl and the youth with the quick nervous eyes all with expressions of bewilderment or anticipation on their faces these are your friends you can trust them absolutely they all know who you are who you really are i mean they do you may speak freely jansci is a pseudonym for illyurin reynolds might have been repeating something by rote something he knew off by heart as indeed he did majorgeneral alexis illyurin born kalinovka ukraine october th married june th wifes name catherine daughters name julia reynolds glanced at the girl this must be julia she seems about the right age colonel mackintosh says hed like to have his boots back i dont know what he means just an old joke jansci walked round the desk to his seat and leant back smiling well well my old friend peter mackintosh still lives indestructible he always was indestructible you must work for him of course mr ah reynolds michael reynolds i work for him describe him the subtle change could hardly be called a hardening but it was unmistakable face physique clothes history family everything reynolds did so he talked for five minutes without stopping then jansci held up his hand enough you must know him must work for him and be the person you claim to be but he took a risk a great risk it is not like my old friend i might be caught and made to talk and you too would be lost you are very quick young man colonel mackintosh took no chance reynolds said quietly your name and number that was all i knew where you lived what you looked like i had no idea he didnt even tell me about the scars on your hands these would have given me instant identification and how then did you hope to contact me had the address of a cafe reynolds named it the haunt colonel mackintosh said of disaffected elements i was to be there every night same seat same table till i was picked up no identification szendros query lay more in the lift of an eyebrow than the inflection of the voice naturally my tie colonel szendro looked at the vivid magenta of the tie lying on the table winced nodded and looked away without speaking reynolds felt the first faint stirrings of anger why ask if you already know the edged voice betrayed the irritation in his mind no offence jansci answered for szendro endless suspicion mr reynolds is our sole guarantee of survival we suspect everyone everyone who lives everyone who moves we suspect them every minute of every hour but as you see we survive we had been asked to contact you in that cafe imre has practically lived there for the past three days but the request had come from an anonymous source in vienna there was no mention of colonel mackintosh he is an old fox that one and when you had been met in the cafe i was told that i would be led to you or to one of two others hridas and the white mouse this has been a happy shortcut jansci murmured but i am afraid you would have found neither hridas nor the white mouse they are no longer in budapest the white mouse is in siberia we shall never see him again hridas died three weeks ago not two kilometres from here in the torture chambers of the avo they were careless for a moment and he snatched a gun he put it in his mouth he was glad to die how but how do you know these things colonel szendro the man you know as colonel szendro was there he saw him die it was szendros gun he took reynolds carefully crushed his cigarette stub in an ashtray he looked up at jansci across to szendro and back at jansci again his face was empty of all expression szendro has been a member of the avo for eighteen months jansci said quietly one of their most efficient and respected officers and when things mysteriously go wrong and wanted men escape at the last moment there is no one more terrible in his anger than szendro no one who drives his men so cruelly till they literally collapse with exhaustion the speeches he makes to newly indoctrinated recruits and cadets to the avo have already been compiled in book form he is known as the scourge his chief furmint is at a loss to understand szendros pathological hatred for his own countrymen but declares he is the only indispensable member of the political police in budapest a hundred two hundred hungarians alive today still here or in the west owe their lives to colonel szendro reynolds stared at szendro examining every line of that face as if he were seeing it for the first time wondering what manner of man might pass his life in such incredibly difficult and dangerous circumstances never knowing whether he was being watched or suspected or betrayed never knowing whether or not the next shoulder for the tap of the executioner might be his own and all at once without at all knowing why reynolds knew that this was indeed such a man as jansci claimed all other considerations apart he had to be or he reynolds might even then have been screaming on the torture racks deep down below the basement of stalin street it must indeed be as you say general illyurin reynolds murmured he runs incredible risks jansci if you please always jansci majorgeneral illyurin is dead im sorry and tonight how about tonight your ah arrest by our friend here yes it is simple he has access to all but a few secret master files also he is privy to all proposed plans and operations in budapest and western hungary he knew of the roadblock the closing of the frontier and he knew you were on the way but surely surely they werent after me how could dont flatter yourself my dear reynolds szendro carefully fitted another brown and black russian cigarette into his holder reynolds was to discover that he chainsmoked a hundred of these every day and struck a match the arm of coincidence is not all that long they werent looking for you they werent looking for anyone they were stopping only trucks searching for large quantities of ferrowolfram that are being smuggled into the country i should have thought they would have been damned glad to get all the ferrowolfram they could lay their hands on reynolds murmured and so they are my dear boy and so they are however there are proper channels to be gone through certain customs to be observed not to put too fine a point on it several of our top party officials and highlyrespected members of the government were being deprived of their usual cut an intolerable state of affairs unthinkable reynolds agreed action was imperative exactly szendro grinned the first time reynolds had seen him smile and the sudden flash of white even teeth and the crinkling of the eyes quite transformed the cold aloofness of the man unfortunately on such occasions as these some fish other than the ones we are trawling for get caught in the net such as myself such as yourself so i have made it my practice to be in the vicinity of certain police blocks at such times a fruitless vigil i fear on all but very few occasions you are only the fifth person ive taken away from the police inside a year unfortunately you will also be the last on the previous occasions i warned the country bumpkins who man these posts that they were to forget that i or the prisoner i had taken from them ever existed tonight as you know their headquarters had been informed and the word will be out to all block posts to beware of a man posing as an avo officer reynolds stared at him but good god man they saw you five of them at least your description will be in budapest before pah szendro flicked off some ash with a careless forefinger much good it will do the fools besides im no impostor i am an avo officer did you doubt it i did not reynolds said feelingly szendro hitched an immaculately trousered leg and sat on the desk smiling there you are then incidentally mr reynolds my apologies for my rather intimidating conduct on the way here tonight as far as budapest i was concerned only with finding out whether you really were a foreign agent and the man we were looking for or whether i should throw you out at a street corner and tell you to lose yourself but by the time i had reached the middle of the town another and most disquieting possibility had struck me when you stopped in the andrassy ut reynolds nodded you looked at me in a rather peculiar fashion to say the least i know the thought had just occurred that you might have been an avo member deliberately planted on me and therefore had no cause to fear a visit to the andrassy ut i confess i should have thought of it earlier however when i said i was going to take you to a secret cellar you would have known at once what i suspected known i could not now afford to let you live and screamed your head off but you said nothing so i knew you were at least no plant jansci could i be excused for a few minutes you know why certainly but be quick mr reynolds hasnt come all the way from england just to lean over the margit bridge and drop pebbles into the danube he has much to tell us it is for your ear alone reynolds said colonel mackintosh said so colonel szendro is my right hand mr reynolds very well but only the two of you szendro bowed and walked out of the room jansci turned to his daughter a bottle of wine julia we have some villdnyi furmint left ill go and see she turned to leave but jansci calledher one moment my dear mr reynolds when did you eat last ten oclock this morning so you must be starving julia ill see what i can get jansci thank you but first the wine imre he addressed the youngster who was pacing restlessly up and down the roof a walk around see if everything is clear sandor the car number plates burn them and fix new ones burn them reynolds asked as the man left the room how is that possible we have a large supply of number plates jansci smiled all of threeply wood they burn magnificently ah you found some villdnyi the last bottle her hair was combed now and she was smiling appraisal and frank curiosity in her blue eyes as she looked at reynolds you can wait twenty minutes mr reynolds if i have to he smiled it will be difficult ill be as quick as i can she promised as the door closed behind her jansci broke open the seal of the bottle and poured the cool white wine into a couple of glasses your health mr reynolds and to success thank you reynolds drank slowly deeply gratefully of the wine he could not recall when his throat and mouth had been so parched before and nodded at the one ornament in that rather bleak and forbidding room a silverframed photograph on janscis desk an extraordinarily fine likeness of your daughter you have skilled photographers in hungary i took it myself jansci smiled it does her justice you think come your honest opinion i am always interested in the extent and depth of a mans percipience reynolds glanced at him in faint surprise then sipped his wine and studied the picture in silence studied the fair waving hair the broad smooth brow above the longlashed eyes the rather high slavonic cheekbones curving down to a wide laughing mouth the rounded chin above the slender column of the throat a remarkable face he thought a face full of character of eagerness and gaiety and a splendid zest for living a face to remember well mr reynolds jansci prompted him gently it does her justice reynolds admitted he hesitated fearing presumption looked at jansci knew instinctively how hopeless it would be to try to deceive the wisdom in these tired eyes then went on you might almost say it does her more than justice yes yes the bone structure the shape of all the features even the smile is exactly the same but this picture has something more something more of wisdom of maturity in two years perhaps in three then it will be your daughter really your daughter here somehow you have caught a foreshadowing of these things i dont know how it is done its quite simple that photograph is not of julia but of my wife your wife good lord what a quite extraordinary resemblance reynolds broke off hurriedly searched his past sentences for any unfortunate gaffes decided he had made none she is here just now no not here jansci put his glass down and turned it round and round between his fingers im afraid we do not know where she is im sorry it was all reynolds could think of to say do not misunderstand me jansci said gently we know what happened to her im afraid the brown lorries you know what i mean the secret police yes jansci nodded heavily the same lorries that took away a million in poland the same in romania and half a million in bulgaria all to slavery and death the same lorries that wiped out the middle classes of the baltic states that have taken a hundred thousand hungarians they came also for catherine what is one person among so many million who have suffered and died that was in the summer of it was all reynolds could think to say it was then he knew that the mass deportations from budapest had taken place we were not living here then it was just two and a half years ago less than a month after we had come julia thank god was staying with friends in the country i was away that night i had left about midnight and when she went to make herself coffee after i had gone the gas had been turned off and she did not know what that meant so they took her away the gas im afraid you dont understand a chink in your armour the avo would soon have prised open mr reynolds everybody else in budapest understands it is the practice of the avo to turn off the gas supply to a block of houses or flats before serving deportation notices there a pillow on the bottom shelf of a gas oven is comfortable enough and there is no pain they stopped the sale of poisons in all chemists they even tried to ban the sale of razor blades they found it difficult however to prevent people from jumping from top story flats she had no warning no warning a blue slip of paper thrust in her hand a small suitcase the brown lorry and then the locked cattle trucks of the railway but she may yet be alive you have heard nothing nothing nothing at all we can only hope she lives but so many died in these trucks stifling or freezing to death and the work in the fields the factories or mines is brutal killing even for one fit and well she had just been discharged from hospital after a serious operation chestsurgery she had tuberculosis her convalescence had not even begun reynolds swore softly how often one read one heard about this sort of thing how easily how casually almost callously one dismissed it and how different when one was confronted with reality you have looked for her for your wife reynolds asked harshly he hadnt meant to speak that way it was just the way the words came out i have looked for her i cannot find her reynolds felt the stirring of anger jansci seemed to take it all so easily he was to calm too unaffected the avo must know where she is reynolds persisted they have lists files colonel szendro he has no access to top secret files jansci interrupted he smiled and his rank is only equivalent to that of major the promotion was selfawarded and for tonight only so was the name i think i heard him coming now but it was the youngster with the dark hair who entered or partially entered he poked his head round the door reported that everything was clear and vanished but even in that brief moment reynolds had had time to notice the pronounced nervous tic on the left cheek just below the darting black eyes jansci must have seen the expression on reynolds face and when he spoke his voice was apologetic poor imre he was not always like this mr reynolds not always so restless so disturbed restless i shouldnt say it but because my safety and plans are involved too i must hes a neurotic of the first order reynolds looked hard at jansci but jansci was his usual mild and gentle self a man like that in a setup like this to say hes a potential danger is the understatement of the month i know dont think i dont know jansci sighed you should have seen him just over two years ago mr reynolds fighting the russian tanks on castle hill just north of gellert he hadnt a nerve in his entire body when it came to spreading liquid soap at the corners and the steep dangerous slopes of the hill saw to the rest as far as the tanks were concerned or prising up loose cobbles filling the holes with petrol and touching it off as a tank passed across imre had no equal but he became too rash and one night one of the big t tanks slipping backwards down a hill with all the crew dead inside pinned him kneeling on all fours against the wall of a house he was there for thirtysix hours before anyone noticed him and twice during that time the tank had been hit by highexplosive rockets from russian fighter planes they didnt want their own tanks used against them thirtysix hours reynolds stared at jansci and he lived he he didnt a mark on him he still hasnt it was sandor who got him out that was how they met for the first time he got a crowbar and broke down the wall of the house from the inside i saw him do it and he was flinging pound blocks of masonry around as if they were pebbles we took him into a nearby house left him and when we returned the house was a huge pile of rubble some resistance fighters had taken up position there and a mongolian tank commander had pulverised the bottom story until the whole house fell down but we got him out again still without a scratch he was very ill for a long time for months but hes much better now sandor and yourself both fought in the rising sandor did he was foreman electrician in the dunapentele steel works and he put his knowledge to good use to see him handling hightension wires with nothing but a couple of wooden battens held in his bare hands would make your blood freeze mr reynolds against the tanks electrocution jansci nodded the crews of three tanks and ive been told he destroyed even more down in csepel he killed an infantryman stole his flamethrower sprayed through the drivers visor then dropped a molotov cocktail just bottles of ordinary petrol with bits of burning cotton stuffed into the necks through the hatch when they opened it to get some air then he would shut the hatch and when sandor shuts a hatch and sits on it the hatch stays shut i can imagine reynolds said dryly unconsciously almost he rubbed his still aching arms then a sudden thought occurred to him sandor took part you said and yourself nothing jansci spread his scarred misshapen hands palms upwards and now reynolds could see that the crucifixion marks indeed went right through i took no part in it i tried all i could to stop it reynolds looked at him in silence trying to read the expression of the faded grey eyes enmeshed in those spider webs of wrinkles finally he said im afraid i dont believe you im afraid you must silence fell on the room a long cold silence reynolds could hear the faroff tinkle of dishes in a distant kitchen as the girl prepared the meal finally he looked directly at jansci you let the others fight fight for you he made no attempt to conceal his disappointment the nearhostility in his tone but why why did you not help not do something why ill tell you why jansci smiled faintly and reached up and touched his white hair i am not as old as the snow on my head would have you think my boy but i am still far too old for the suicidal the futile act of the grand but empty gesture i leave that for the children of this world the reckless and the unthinking the romanticists who do not stop to count the cost i leave it to the righteous indignation that cannot see beyond the justice of its cause to the splendid anger that is blinded by its own shining splendour i leave it to the poets and the dreamers to those who look back to the glorious gallantry the imperishable chivalry of a bygone world to those whose vision carries them forward to the golden age that lies beyond tomorrow but i can only see today he shrugged the charge of the light brigade my fathers father fought in that you remember the charge of the light brigade and the famous commentary on that charge its magnificent but its not war so it was with our october revolution fine words reynolds said coldly these are fine words im sure a hungarian boy with a russian bayonet in his stomach would have taken great comfort from them i am also too old to take offence jansci said sadly i am also too old to believe in violence except as a last resort the final fling of desperation when every hope is gone and even then it is only a resort to hopelessness besides mr reynolds besides the uselessness of violence of killing what right have i to take the life of any man we are all our fathers children and i cannot but think that fratricide must be repugnant to our god you talk like a pacifist reynolds said roughly like a pacifist before he lies down and lets the jackboot tramp him into the mud him and his wife and his children not quite mr reynolds not quite jansci said softly i am not what i would like to be not all the man who lays a finger on my julia dies even as he does it for a moment reynolds caught a glimpse a glimpse that might almost have been imagination of the fire smouldering in the depths of those faded eyes remembered all that colonel mackintosh had told of this fantastic man before him and felt more confused than ever but you said you told me that i was only telling you why i didnt take part in the rising jansci was his gentle self again i dont believe in violence if any other way will serve again the time could not have been more badly chosenand i do not hate the russians i even like them do not forget mr reynolds that i am a russian myself a ukranian but still a russian despite what many of my countrymen would say you like the russians even the russian is your brother mask it as he tried with politeness reynolds could not quite conceal the incredulity in his question after what they have done to you and your family a monster and i stand condemned love for our enemies should be confined to where it belongs between the covers of the bible and only the insane would have the courage or the arrogance or the stupidity to open the pages and turn the principles into practice madmen only madmen would do it but without these madmen our armageddon will surely come janscis tone changed i like the russian people mr reynolds theyre likeable cheerful and gay when you get to know them and there are no more friendly people on earth but they are young they are very young like children and like children they are full of whims theyre arbitrary and primitive and a little cruel as are all little children forgetful and not greatly moved by suffering but for all their youth do not forget that they have a great love of poetry of music and dancing and singing and folktales of ballet and the opera that would make the average westerner in comparison seem culturally dead theyre also brutal and barbarous and human life doesnt matter a damn to them reynolds interjected who can deny it but do not forget so also was the western world when it was politically as young as the peoples of russia are now theyre backward primitive and easily swayed they hate and fear the west because theyre told to hate and fear the west but your democracies too can act the same way for heavens sake reynolds crushed out his cigarette in a gesture of irritation are you trying to say dont be so naive young man and listen to me janscis smile robbed his words of any offence all im trying to say is that unreasoning emotionallyconditioned attitudes are as possible in the west as in the east look for instance at your countrys attitude to russia in the past twenty years at the beginning of the last war russias popularity ran high then came the moscowberlin pact and you were actually ready remember to send an army of to fight the russians in finland then came hitlers assault in the east your national press full of paeans of praise for good old joe and all the world loved a moujik now the wheel has come full circle again and the holocaust only awaits the one rash or panicstricken move who knows in five years time all will be smiles again you are weathercocks just as the russians are weathercocks but i blame neither people it is not the weathercock that turns it is the wind that turns the weathercock our governments your governments jansci nodded and of course the national press that always conditions the thinking of a people but primarily the governments we in the west have bad governments often very bad governments reynolds said slowly they stumble they miscalculate they make foolish decisions they even have their quota of opportunists careerists and plain downright powerseekers but all these things are only because they are human they mean well they try hard for the good and not even a child fears them he looked speculatively at the older man you yourself said recently that the russian leaders have sent literally millions in the past few years to imprisonment and slavery and death if as you say the peoples are the same why are the governments so utterly different communism is the only answer jansci shook his head communism is gone and gone for ever today it remains only as a myth an empty lipservice catchword in the name of which the cynical ruthless realists of the kremlin find sufficient excuse and justification for whatever barbarities their policies demand a few of the old guard still in power may cherish the dream of world communism but just a few only a global war could now achieve their aims and these same hardheaded realists in the kremlin can see no point or sense or future in pursuing a policy that carries with it the seed of their own destruction they are essentially businessmen mr reynolds and letting off a timebomb under your own factory is no way to run a business their barbarities their enslavements and their massacres dont stem from world conquest the fractional lift of reynolds eyebrows was its own sceptical comment you tell me that i do then from what in the world from fear mr reynolds jansci interrupted from an almost terrorstricken fear that has no parallel among governments of modern times they are afraid because the ground lost in leadership is almost irrecoverable malenkovs concessions of kruschevs famous destalinisation speech of and his forced decentralisation of all industry were contrary to all the cherished ideas of communist infallibility and centralised control but they had to be done in the interest of efficiency and production and the people have smelled freedom and they are afraid because their secret police has slipped and slipped badly beria is dead the nkvd in russia are not nearly so feared as the avo in this country so the belief in the power of authority of the inevitability of punishment has slipped also these fears are of their own people but these fears are nothing compared to their fears of the outside world just before he died stalin said what will happen without me you are blind as young kittens are blind and russia will be destroyed because you do not know how to recognise her enemies even stalin couldnt have known how true his words would prove to be they cannot recognise enemies and they can only be safe only feel safe if all the peoples of the outside world are regarded as enemies especially the west they fear the west and from their own point of view they fear with every reason they are afraid of a western world that they think is unfriendly and hostile and just waiting its chance how terrified would you be mr reynolds if you were ringed as russia is ringed with nuclear bomb bases in england and europe and north africa and the middle east and japan how much more terrified would you be if every time the world tensions increase fleets of foreign bombers appear mysteriously on the far edge of your longdistance radar screens if you know beyond any reasonable doubt that whenever such tensions arise there are at any given moment of the day or night anywhere between and bombers of the american strategic air command each with its hydrogen bomb cruising high in the stratosphere just waiting the signal to converge on russia and destroy it you have to have an awful lot of missiles mr reynolds and an almost supernatural confidence in them to forget those thousand hydrogen bombers already airborne and it only requires five per cent of them to get through as they inevitably would or how would you in britain feel if russia were pouring arms into southern ireland or the americans if a russian aircraft carrier fleet armed with hydrogen bombs cruised indefinitely in the gulf of mexico try to imagine all that mr reynolds and you can perhaps begin to imagine only begin for the imagination can be only a shadow of the reality how the russians feel nor does their fear stop there they are afraid of people who try to interpret everything in the limited light of their own particular culture who believe that all people the world over are basically the same a common assumption and a stupid and dangerous one the cleavage between western and slavonic minds and ways of thinking the differences between their culture patterns are immense and alas unrealised finally but perhaps above all they are afraid of the penetration of western ideas into their own country and that is why the satellite countries are so invaluable to them as a cordon sanitaire an insulation against dangerous capitalist influences and thats why revolt in one of their satellites as in this country two years last october brings out all that is worst in the russian leaders they reacted with such incredible violence because they saw in this budapest rising the culmination the fulfilment at one and the same time of their three nightmare fears that their entire satellite empire might go up in smoke and the cordon sanitaire vanish for ever that even a degree of success could have touched off a similar revolt in russia and most terrible of all that a largescale conflagration from the baltic to the black sea would have given the americans all the excuse or reason they ever needed to give the green light to the strategic air command and the carriers of the sixth fleet i know you know that ideas fantastic but we are not dealing with facts only with what the russian leaders believe to be facts jansci drained his glass and looked quizzically at reynolds you begin to see now i hope why i was neither advocate of nor participant in the october rising you begin to see perhaps why the revolt just had to be crushed and the bigger and more serious the revolt the more terrible would have to be the repression to preserve the cordon to discourage other satellites or any of their own people who might be having similar ideas you begin to see the hopelessness the foredoomed hopelessness of it the disastrously illjudged futility of it all the only effect it had was to strengthen russias position among the other satellites kill and maim countless thousands of hungarians destroy and damage over houses bring inflation a serious shortage of food and an almost mortal blow to the countrys economy it should never have happened only as i say the anger of despair is always blind noble anger can be a magnificent thing but annihilation has its ah drawbacks reynolds said nothing for the moment he could think of nothing to say a long silence fell on the room long but not cold any more the only sound was the scuffling of reynolds shoes as he tied his laces he had been dressing as jansci talked finally jansci rose switched out the light drew back the curtain of the solitary window peered out then switched on the light again it meant nothing reynolds could see it was purely an automatic gesture the routine precaution of a man who had lived as long as he had by never neglecting the slightest precaution reynolds replaced his papers in his wallet and the gun in its shoulder holster a tap came on the door and julia came in her face was flushed from the warmth of a stove and she carried a tray holding a bowl of soup a steaming plate of diced meat and diced vegetables and a bottle of wine she laid this on the desk here you are mr reynolds two of our national dishes gulyds soup and tokdny im afraid there may be too much paprika in the soup and garlic in the tokdny for your taste but thats how we like it she smiled apologetically leftovers all i could produce in a hurry at this time of night smells wonderful reynolds assured her im only sorry to be such a bother to you in the middle of the night im used to it she said dryly usually theres half a dozen to be fed generally about four oclock in the morning fathers guests keep irregular hours they do indeed jansci smiled now off to bed with you my dear its very late id like to stay a little jansci i dont doubt it janscis faded grey eyes twinkled compared to our average guest mr reynolds is positively handsome with a wash brushup and shave he might be almost presentable you know thats not fair father she stood her ground well reynolds thought but the colour had deepened in her cheeks you shouldnt say that its not fair and i shouldnt jansci said he looked at reynolds julias dream world lies west of the austrian frontier and shed listen for hours to anyone talking about it but there are some things she must not know things that it would be dangerous for her even to guess about off you go my dear very well she rose obediently if reluctantly kissed jansci on the cheek smiled at reynolds and left reynolds looked over at jansci as the older man reached for the second bottle of wine and broke open the seal arent you worried to death about her all the time god knows it jansci said simply this is no life for her or for any girl and if i get caught she goes too almost for a certainty cant you get her away you want to try it i could get her across the frontier tomorrow without the slightest difficulty or danger you know that that is my speciality but she wont go an obedient respectful daughter as you have seen but only up to a selfdrawn line after that she is as stubborn as a mule she knows the risks but she stays she says shell never leave till we find her mother and they go together but even then he broke off suddenly as the door opened and a stranger walked in reynolds twisting round and out of his seat like a cat had his automatic out and lined up on the man before he had taken a step into the room the snick of the safety catch plain above the scraping of the chair legs on the linoleum he stared at the man unwinkingly taking in every detail of the face the smooth dark hair brushed straight back the lean eagle face with the thin pinched nostrils and high forehead of a type he knew well the unmistakable polish aristocrat then he started as jansci reached out gently and pressed down the barrel of the automatic szendro was right about you he murmured thoughtfully dangerous very dangerous you move like a snake when it strikes but this man is a friend a good friend mr reynolds meet the count reynolds put the gun away crossed the room and extended his hand delighted he murmured count who just the count the newcomer said and reynolds stared at him again the voice was unmistakable colonel szendro no other the count admitted and with these words his voice had changed as subtly but as completely as his appearance i say modestly but with truth i have few equals in the matter of disguise and mimicry what you now see before you mr reynolds is me more or less then a scar here a scar there and that is how the avo see me you will understand perhaps why i was not unduly worried about being recognised tonight reynolds nodded slowly i do indeed and and you live here with jansci isnt that rather dangerous i live in the second best hotel in all budapest the count assured him as befits a man of my rank naturally but as a bachelor i must of course have my ah diversions shall we say my occasional absences call for no comment sorry to have been so long jansci not at all jansci assured him mr reynolds and i have had the most interesting discussion about the russians inevitably inevitably and mr reynolds was all for conversion by annihilation more or less jansci smiled its not so long since you felt the same way yourself age comes to us all the count crossed to a wallcabinet drew out a dark bottle poured himself a halftumblerful of liquid and looked at reynolds barack apricot brandy you would call it deadly avoid it like the plague homemade as reynolds watched in astonishment he drank the contents without stopping then refilled the glass you have not yet come to the business of the day im coming to it now reynolds pushed back his plate drank some more wine you gentlemen have heard perhaps of dr harold jennings janscis eyes narrowed we have indeed who hasnt exactly then you know what hes like an elderly dodderer well over seventy shortsighted amiable a typically absentminded professor in every respect but one he has a brain like an electronic computer and is the worlds greatest expert and authority on the higher mathematics of ballistics and ballistic missiles which was why he was induced to defect to the russians the count murmured he didnt reynolds said flatly the world thinks he did but the world is wrong you are sure of this jansci was leaning far forward in his seat certainly listen at the time of the defection of other british scientists old jennings spoke out strongly if unwisely in their defence he bitterly condemned what he called outworn nationalism and said that any man had the right to act according to the dictates of his mind conscience and ideals almost immediately as we expected he was contacted by the russians he rebuffed them told them to get the hell back to moscow and said he fancied their brand of nationalism a damn sight less than his own he had only been talking generally he said how can you be sure of this we are sure we had a tape recording of the entire conversation we had the whole house wired but we never made public the recording and after he had gone over to the russians it would have been too late nobody would have believed us obviously jansci murmured and then also obviously you called off the watchdogs we did reynolds admitted it would have made no difference anyway we were watching the wrong party less than two months after the old boys interview with the russian agents mrs jennings and her sixteenyearold schoolboy son brian the professor married late in life went to switzerland for a holiday jennings was to have gone with them but was held up by some important business at the last minute so he let them go on alone intending to rejoin them in two or three days in their zurich hotel he found his wife and son gone abducted of course jansci said slowly and the swissaustrian frontier is no barrier to determined men but more likely perhaps by boat at night thats what we thought reynolds nodded lake constance anyway whats certain is that jennings was contacted within minutes of arriving at the hotel told what had happened and left in no doubt as to what lay in store for his wife and son if he didnt immediately follow them behind the iron curtain jennings may be an old dodderer but hes not an old fool he knew these people werent kidding so he went at once and now of course you want him bade we want him back thats why im here jansci smiled faintly it will be interesting to learn just how you propose to rescue him mr reynolds and of course his wife and son for without them you achieve nothing three people mr reynolds an old man a woman and a boy a thousand miles to moscow and the snow lies deep upon the steppes not three people jansci just one the professor and i dont have to go to moscow for him hes not two miles from where were sitting now right here in budapest jansci made no effort to conceal his astonishment here youre sure of that mr reynolds colonel mackintosh was then jennings must be here he must be jansci twisted in his seat and looked at the count had you heard of this not a word nobody in our office knows of it swear to that all the world will know next week reynolds voice was quiet but positive when the international scientific conference opens here on monday the first paper will be read by professor jennings he is being groomed to be the star of the show it will be the communists biggest propaganda triumph for years i see i see jansci drummed his fingers thoughtfully on the table then looked up sharply professor jennings you said you only wanted the professor reynolds nodded only the professor jansci stared at him god above man arent you aware what will happen to his wife and son i assure you mr reynolds if you expect our assistance mrs jennings is already in london reynolds held up his hand to forestall the questions she fell seriously ill about ten weeks ago and jennings insisted that she go to the london clinic for treatment and he forced the communists to accede to his demands you cant coerce torture or brainwash a man of the professors calibre without destroying his capacity for work and he flatly refused to carry on working till they had granted his demands he must be quite a man the count shook his head in admiration hes a holy terror when something gets his back up reynolds smiled but it wasnt all that much of an achievement the russians had everything to gain the continued services of the greatest ballistic expert alive today and nothing to lose they held the two trump cards jennings and his son in russia and knew that mrs jennings would return and they insisted that everything be done in the utmost secrecy not half a dozen people in britain know that mrs jennings is in britain not even the surgeon who carried out the two major operations on her she recovered it was touch and go but she recovered and shes recuperating very well the old man will be pleased jansci murmured his wife returns to russia soon his wife will never return to russia again reynolds said bluntly and jennings has no reason to be pleased he thinks his wife is critically ill and that what little hope there is is going fast he thinks that because that is what we have told him what whats that jansci was on his feet now the faded grey eyes cold and hard as stone god in heaven reynolds what kind of inhuman conduct is that you actually told the old man his wife was dying our people at home need him and need him desperately bur scientists have been held up completely blocked on their latest project for ten weeks now and theyre convinced that jennings is the only man that can give them the breakthrough they must have so they would use this despicable trick its life or death jansci reynolds interrupted flatly it may literally be life or death for millions jennings must be moved and we will use every lever we can to that end you think this is ethical reynolds you think anything can justify whether i think these things or not doesnt matter a damn reynolds said indifferently the pros and cons are not for me to decide the only things that concern me are that ive been given a job to do if it is possible in any way at all ill get that job done a ruthless and dangerous man the count murmured i told you a killer but he happens to be on the side of the law yes reynolds was unmoved and theres another point like many other brilliant men jennings is rather naive and shortsighted when it comes to matters outside his own speciality mrs jennings tells us that the russians have assured her husband that the project he is working on will be used for exclusively peaceful purposes jennings believes this hes a pacifist at heart and so all the best scientists are pacifists at heart jansci was sitting down now but his eyes were still hostile all the best men everywhere are pacifists at heart im not arguing all im saying is that jennings is now at the stage where he would sooner work for the russians if he thinks he is working for peace than for his own people if he knows he is working for war which makes him all the more difficult to move and which in turn makes necessary the use of every lever that comes to hand the fate of his young son is of course a matter of indifference the count waved an airy hand where such tremendous stakes are at issue brian his son was in poznan all day yesterday reynolds interrupted some exposition or other mainly for youth organisations two men shadowed him from the moment he got up by noon tomorrow today that is hell be in stettin twentyfour hours later hell be in sweden ah so but you are too confident reynolds you underestimate russian vigilance the count was regarding him thoughtfully over the rim of his brandy glass agents have been known to fail these two agents have never failed they are the best in europe brian jennings will be in sweden tomorrow the callsign comes from london on a regular european transmission then and not till then we approach jennings so the count nodded perhaps you have some humanity after all humanity janscis voice was cold still almost contemptuous just another lever to use against the poor old man and reynolds people know very well that if they left the boy to die in russia jennings would never work for them again the count lit another of his interminable chain of brown cigarettes perhaps we are being too harsh perhaps here selfinterest and humanity go hand in hand perhaps i saidand what if jennings still refuses to go then hell just have to go whether he wants to or not wonderful just wonderful the count smiled wryly what a picture for pravda our friends here lugging jennings by the heels across the border and the caption british secret agent liberates western scientist cant you just see it mr reynolds reynolds shrugged and said nothing he was only too keenly aware of the change of atmosphere in the past five minutes the undercurrent of hostility that now ran strongly towards himself but he had had to tell jansci everything colonel mackintosh had been insistent on that point and it had been inevitable if they were to have janscis help the offer of help if it were to be made at all now hung in the balance and without it reynolds knew he might as well have saved himself the trouble of coming at all two minutes passed in silence then jansci and the count looked at one another and exchanged an almost imperceptible nod jansci looked squarely at reynolds if all your countrymen were like you mr reynolds i wouldnt lift a finger to help you coldblooded emotionless people to whom right and wrong justice and injustice and suffering are matters of academic disinterest are as guilty by silence of consent as the barbarous murderers of whom you so recently spoke but i know they are not all like you neither would i help if it were only to enable your scientists to make machines of war but colonel mackintosh was is my friend and i think it inhuman no matter what the cause that an old man should die in a foreign land among uncaring strangers far from his family and those he loves if it lies in our power in any way at all we will see to it with gods help that the old man comes safely home again chapter four the inevitable cigarette holder clipped between his teeth the inevitable russian cigarette well alight the count leaned a heavy elbow on the buzzer and kept on leaning until a shirtsleeved little man unshaven and still rubbing the sleep from his eyes came scurrying out from the little cubicle behind the hotels reception desk the count eyed him with disfavour nightporters should sleep in the daytime he said coldly the manager little man and at once the manager at this hour of the night the nightporter stared with illconcealed insolence at the clock above his head transferred his stare to the count now innocuously dressed in a grey suit and grey raglan raincoat and made no effort at all to conceal the truculence in his voice the manager is asleep come back in the morning there came a sudden sound of ripping linen a gasp of pain and the count his right hand gripping the bunched folds of the porters shirt had him halfway across the desk the bloodshot sleepfilmed eyes widened first with surprise and then with fear were only inches away from the wallet that had magically appeared in the counts free hand a moment of stillness a contemptuous shove and the porter was scrabbling frantically at the pigeonholed mail racks behind him in an attempt to keep his balance im sorry comrade im terribly sorry the porter licked his lips suddenly dry and stiff i i didnt know who else do you expect to come calling at this hour of night the count demanded softly no one comrade no one no no one at all its just that well you were here only twenty minutes ago i was here it was the raised eyebrow as much as the inflection of the voice that cut short the frightened stammering no no of course not not you your people i mean they came i know little man i sent them the count waved a weary hand in bored dismissal and the porter hurried off across the hall reynolds rose from the wallbench where he had been sitting and crossed the room quite a performance he murmured you even had me scared just practice the count said modestly sustains my reputation and doesnt do them any permanent harm distressing though it is to be addressed as comrade by such a moron you heard what he said yes they dont waste much time do they efficient enough in their own unimaginative way the count conceded theyll have checked most of the hotels in town by morning only a slim chance of course but one that they cant afford to neglect your position is now doubly safe three times as safe as it was at janscis house reynolds nodded and said nothing only half an hour had elapsed since jansci had agreed to help him both jansci and the count had decided that he must leave there at once it was too inconvenient too dangerous it was inconvenient not so much because of the cramped accommodation but because it was in a lonely and out of the way place movements of a stranger at any hour of the day or night such as reynolds might be compelled to make would be sure to draw unfavourable attention it was too remote from the centre of the town from the big hotels of pest where jennings might be expected to be staying and biggest drawback of all it had no telephone for instant communications and it was dangerous because jansci was becoming increasingly convinced that the house was being watched in the past day or two both sandor and imre had seen two people singly and on several different occasions walking slowly by the house on the other side of the street it was unlikely that they were innocent passersby like every city under a police state rule budapest had its hundreds of paid informers and probably they were just confirming their suspicions and gathering their facts before going to the police and collecting their bloodmoney reynolds had been surprised by the casual almost indifferent way jansci had treated this danger but the count had explained as he had driven the mercedes through the snowfilled street to this hotel on the banks of the danube the changing of their hideouts because of suspicious neighbours had become so frequent as to be almost routine and jansci had a sixth sense which so far had always led them to pull out in good time annoying the count said but no serious inconvenience they knew of half a dozen boltholes just as good and their permanent headquarters a place known to jansci julia and himself was in the country reynolds thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the door across the hall opening he looked up to see a man hurrying across the parquet floor the taptap of his metalled heels urgent and almost comically hurried he was shrugging a jacket over a crumpled shirt and the thin bespectacled face was alive with fear and anxiety a thousand apologies comrade a thousand apologies he wrung whiteknuckled hands in his distress then glared at the porter following more slowly behind him this oaf here you are the manager the count interrupted curtly yes yes of course then dismiss the oaf i wish to talk to you privately he waited till the porter had gone drew out his gold cigarette case selected a cigarette with due care examined it minutely inserted it with much deliberation in his holder took his time about finding his matchbox and removing a match finally lit the cigarette a beautiful performance reynolds thought dispassionately the manager already on the tenterhooks of fright was now almost in hysterics what is it comrade what has gone wrong in his attempt to keep his voice steady it had been louder than intended and it now dropped to almost a whisper if i can help the avo in any way i assure you when you speak you will do so only to answer my questions the count hadnt even raised his voice but the manager seemed to shrink visibly and his mouth closed tightly in a white line of fear you spoke to my men some little time ago yes yes a short time ago i wasnt even asleep just now only to answer my questions the count repeated softly i trust i do not have to say that again they asked if you had any new arrival staying here any fresh bookings checked the register and searched the rooms they left of course a typed description of the man they were looking for i have it here comrade the manager tapped his breast pocket and orders to phone immediately if anyone resembling chat description appeared here the manager nodded forget all that the count ordered things are moving quickly we have every reason to believe that the man is either coming here or that his contact is already living here or will be coming here in the course of the next twentyfour hours the count exhaled a long thin streamer of smoke and looked speculatively at the manager to our certain knowledge this is the fourth time in three months that you have harboured enemies of the state in your hotel here in this hotel the manager had paled visibly swear to god comrade god the count creased his forehead what god whose god the managers face was no longer pale it was ashen grey good communists never made fatal blunders of this kind reynolds could almost feel sorry for him but he knew what the count was after a state of terror instant compliance blind unreasoning obedience and already he had it a a slip of the tongue comrade the manager was now stuttering in his panic and his legs and hands were trembling i assure you comrade no no let me assure you comrade the counts voice was almost a purr one more slipup and we must see to a tittle reeducation an elimination of these distressing bourgeois sentiments of your readiness to give refuge to people who would stab our mother country in the back the manager opened his mouth to protest but his lips moved soundlessly and the count went on his every word now a cold and deadly menace my instructions will be obeyed and obeyed implicitly and you will be held directly responsible for any failure however unavoidable that failure that my friend or the black sea canal ill do anything anything the manager was begging now in a state of piteous terror and he had to clutch the desk to steady himself anything comrade i swear it you will have your last chance the count nodded towards reynolds one of my men sufficiently like the spy we are after in build and appearance to pass muster and we have disguised him a little a shadowed corner of your lounge say an incautious approach and the contact is ours the contact will sing to us as all men sing to the avo and then the spy himself will be ours also reynolds stared at the count only the years of professional training keeping his face expressionless and wondered if there was any limit to this mans effrontery but in that same insolent audacity reynolds knew the best hope of safety lay however all that is no concern of yours the count continued these are your instructions a room for my friend here let us call him for the sake of convenience say mr rakosi the best you have with a private bathroom fireescape shortwave radio receiver telephone alarm clock duplicates of all masterkeys in the hotel and absolute privacy no switchboard operator eavesdropping on mr rakosis room telephone as you are probably aware my dear manager we have devices that tell us instantly when a line is being monitored no chambermaid no floor waiters no electricians plumbers or any other tradesmen to go near his room all meals will be taken up by yourself unless mr rakosi chooses to show himself he doesnt exist no one knows he exists even you have never seen him you havent even seen me all that is clearly understood yes of course of course the manager was grasping franticallyat this straw of a last chance everything will be exactly as you say comrade exactly you have my word you may yet live to mulct a few thousand more guests the count said contemptuously warn that oaf of a porter not to talk and show us this room immediately five minutes later they were alone reynolds room was not large but comfortably furnished complete with radio and telephone and a fireescape conveniently placed outside the adjoining bathroom the count glanced round approvingly youll be comfortable here for a few days two or three anyway not more its too dangerous the manager wont talk but youll always find some frightened fool or mercenary informer who will and then youll have to become somebody else a few hours sleep then i go to see a friend of mine who specialises in such things the count thoughtfully rubbed a blue and bristly chin a german i think will be best for you preferably from the ruhr dortmund essen or thereabouts much more convincing than your austrian i assure you eastwest contraband trade is becoming so big that the deals are now being handled by the principals themselves and the swiss and austrian middlemen who used to handle these transactions are having a thin time of it very rare birds now and hence an object of suspicion you can be a supplier of let us say aluminium and copper goods ill get you a book on it these of course are banned goods naturally my dear fellow there are hundreds of banned goods absolutely proscribed by the governments of the west but a niagara of the stuff flows across the iron curtain every year ј worth ј no one knows good lord reynolds was astonished but recovered quickly and contribute my quota to the flow easiest thing imaginable my boy your stuff is sent to hamburg or some other free port under false stencils and manifest these are changed inside the factory and the stuff embarked on a russian ship or easier still just send them across the border to france break up repack and send to czechoslovakia by the in transit agreement goods can be shipped from countries a to c clear across b without benefit of any customs examinations beautifully simple is it not it is reynolds admitted the governments concerned must be at their wits end the governments the count laughed my dear reynolds when a nations economy booms governments become afflicted with an irremediable myopia some time ago an outraged german citizen a socialist leader by the name of i think wehner thats it herbert wehner sent to the bonn government a list of six hundred firms six hundred my dear fellow actively engaged in contraband trade and the result six hundred informants in six hundred factories sacked the count said succinctly or so wehner said and no doubt he knew business is business and profits are profits the world over the communists will welcome you with open arms provided you have what they want ill see to that you will become a representative a partner of some big metal firm in the ruhr an existing firm but of course no chances and what that firm doesnt know wont hurt them the count pulled a stainless steel hip flask from his pocket you will join me thank you no to reynolds certain knowledge the count had drunk threequarters of a bottle of brandy that night already but its effects outwardly at least were negligible the mans tolerance to alcohol was phenomenal in fact reynolds reflected a phenomenal character in many ways an enigma if ever he had known one normally a coldly humorous man with a quick sardonic wit the counts face in its rare moments of repose held a withdrawn remoteness almost a sadness that was in sharp baffling contrast to his normal self or maybe his remote self was his normal self just as well the count fetched a glass from the bathroom poured a drink and swallowed it in one gulp a purely medicinal precaution you understand and the less you have the more i have and thus the more adequately is my health safeguarded as i say first thing this morning i fix your identity then go to the andrassy ut and find out where the russian delegates to this conference are staying the three crowns probably staffed by our people but it may be elsewhere he brought out paper and pencil and scribbled on it for a minute here are the names and the addresses of seven or eight hotels its bound to be one of these listed ah you observe when i call you on the phone first of all address you by the wrong name the first letter of that name will correspond to the hotel you understand reynolds nodded ill also try to get you jennings room number that will be more difficult ill reverse it on the phone in the form of some financial quotations in connection with your export business the count put away his brandy flask and stood up and that im afraid is about all i can do for you mr reynolds the rest is up to you i cant possibly go near any hotel where jennings is staying because our own men will be there watching them and besides i expect to be on duty this coming afternoon and evening until ten oclock at least even if i could approach him it would be useless jennings would know me for a foreigner right away and be instantly suspicious and apart from that you are the only person who has seen his wife and can bring all the facts and necessary arguments to bear youve already done more than enough reynolds assured him im alive arent i and i wont leave this room till i hear from you not a step well a little sleep then on with the uniform and my daily stint of terrorising all and sundry the count smiled wryly you cannot imagine mr reynolds what it feels like to be universally beloved au revoir reynolds wasted no time after the count had gone he felt desperately tired he locked his room door securing the key so that it could not be pushed clear from the outside placed a chairback under the handle as additional security locked his room and bathroom windows placed an assortment of glasses and other breakable articles on the windowsills a most efficient burglar alarm he had found from past experience slipped his automatic under his pillow undressed and climbed thankfully into bed for a minute or two only his thoughts wandered over the past few hours he thought of the patient and gentle jansci a jansci whose appearance and philosophies were at such wild variance with the almost incredible violence of his past of the equally enigmatic count of janscis daughter so far only a pair of blue eyes and golden hair without any personality to go with them of sandor as gentle in his own way as his master and of imre with the nervous shifting eyes he tried too to think of tomorrow today it was now of his chances of meeting the old professor of the best method of handling the interview but he was far too tired really his thoughts were no more than a kaleidoscope pattern without either form or coherence and even that pattern blurred and faded swiftly into nothingness as he sank into the sleep of exhaustion the harsh jangling of the alarm clock roused him only four hours later he woke with that dry stale feeling of one who is only halfslept but none the less he woke instantly cutting off the alarm before it had rung for more than a couple of seconds he rang down for coffee put on his dressinggown lit a cigarette collected the coffee pot at the door locked it again and clamped the radios headphones to his ears the password announcing brians safe arrival in sweden was to consist of a planned mistake on the announcers part it had been agreed that he would say tonight i beg your pardon that should read tomorrow night but the bbcs shortwave european news transmission that morning was innocent of any such deliberate slip and reynolds took off the headphones without any feeling of disappointment he hadnt really expected it as early as this but even so remote a chance was not to be neglected he finished the rest of the coffee and was asleep again within minutes when he woke again he did so naturally feeling completely rested and refreshed it was just after one oclock he washed shaved rang down for lunch dressed and then pulled apart his window curtains it was so cold outside that his windows were still heavily frosted and he had to open them to see what the weather was like the wind was light but it struck through his thin shirt like a knife and it had all the makings he thought grimly of an ideal night for a secret agent at large provided that was that the secret agent didnt freeze to death the snowflakes big lazy feathery snowflakes were swirling down gently out of a dark and leaden sky reynolds shivered and hastily closed the window just as the knock came on the door he unlocked the door and the manager carried in a tray with reynolds lunch under covers if the manager resented what he must have regarded as menial work he showed no signs of it on the contrary he was obsequiousness itself and the presence on the tray of a bottle of imperial aszu a mellow and golden tokay with reynolds rightly judged the scarcity value of gold itself was proof enough of the managers almost fanatical desire to please the avo in every conceivable way reynolds refrained from thanking him the avo he fancied were not given to such little courtesies and waved a hand in dismissal but the manager dug into his pocket and brought out an envelope blank on both sides i was told to deliver this to you mr rakosi to me reynolds voice was sharp but not with anxiety only the count and his friends knew his new assumed name when did it arrive only five minutes ago five minutes ago reynolds stared coldly at the manager and his voice dropped a theatrical octave melodramatic tones and gestures that would have led only to ridicule back home were he was beginning to discover all too readily accepted as genuine in this terrorridden country then why wasnt it brought to me five minutes ago im sorry comrade the quaver was back in the voice once more your your lunch was almost ready and thought youre not required to think next time a message arrives for me deliver it immediately who brought this a girl a young woman describe her it is difficult i am not good at this he hesitated you see she wore a belted raincoat with a big hood attached she wasnt tall short almost but well built her boots her face idiot her hair the hood covered her hair she had blue eyes very blue eyes the manager seized eagerly on this point but then his voice trailed away im afraid comrade reynolds cut him off and dismissed him he had heard enough and the description tallied sufficiently well with janscis daughter his first reaction surprising even to himself was a faint stirring of anger that she could be risked in this fashion but on the heels of the thought came the awareness of its injustice it would have been highly dangerous for jansci himself with a face that must have been known to hundreds to move abroad in the streets and sandor and imre conspicuous figures as they must have been in the october rising would be remembered by many but a young girl would rouse neither suspicion nor comment and even if inquiries were made later the managers description would have fitted a thousand others he slit open the envelope the message was brief printed in block capitals do not come to the house tonight meet me in the white angel cafe between eight and nine it was signed j julia of course not jansci if jansci wouldnt take the chance of walking through the streets he certainly wouldnt go near a crowded cafe the reason for the change in plan he had been supposed to report to janscis house after his meeting with jennings he couldnt guess police or informer surveillance probably but there could be half a dozen other reasons typically reynolds wasted no time in worrying about it guessing would get nowhere and he would find out from the girl in due time he burnt letter and envelope in the bathroom washbasin flushed away the ashes and sat down to an excellent dinner the hours came and went two oclock three oclock four oclock and still no word from the count either he was having difficulty in getting the information or more likely he could find no opportunity of passing it on reynolds interrupting his pacing of the room only for an occasional glance through the window at the snow sifting down soundlessly more heavily than ever on the houses and streets of the darkening city was beginning to grow anxious if he was to find out where the professor was staying interview him persuade him to make the break for the austrian frontier and himself be at the white angel cafe he had found its address in the directory by nine oclock time was growing very short indeed five oclock came and passed halfpast then at twenty minutes to six the telephone bell jangled shrilly in the silence of the room reynolds reached the phone in two strides and picked up the receiver mr buhl mr johann buhl the counts voice was low and hurried but it was unmistakably the counts voice buhl speaking good excellent news for you mr buhl ive been to the ministry this afternoon and theyre very interested in your firms offer especially in the rolled aluminium theyd like to discuss it with you right away provided youre willing to accept their top price ninetyfive i think my firm would find that acceptable then they will do business we can talk over dinner sixthirty too early for you not at all ill be there third floor isnt it second until sixthirty then goodbye the receiver clicked and reynolds replaced his own phone the count had sounded pushed for time and in danger of being overheard but he had got all the information through b for buhl that was indeed the three crowns hotel the one exclusively staffed by the avo and its creatures a pity it made everything trebly dangerous but at least he would know where he stood there every mans hand would be against him room second floor and the professor dined at sixthirty when his room would be presumably empty reynolds looked at his watch and wasted no more time he belted on his trenchcoat pulled his trilby well down screwed the special silencer on to his belgian automatic and stuck the gun in his righthand pocket a rubberised torch in the other and two spare clips for the gun in an inside jacket pocket then he rang the switchboard told the manager that he was on no account to be disturbed by visitors telephone calls messages or meals during the next four hours secured the key in the lock left the light burning to mislead any person inquisitive enough to peep through the keyhole unlocked the bathroom window and left by the fireescape the night was bitterly cold the thick soft snow more than ankle deep and before he had covered two hundred yards reynolds coat and hat were as white almost as the ground beneath his feet but he was grateful for both the cold and the snow the cold would discourage even the most conscientious of the police and secret police from prowling the streets with their usual vigilance and the snow apart from shrouding him in the protective anonymity of its white cocoon also muffled every noise reducing even the sound of his footfalls to the merest whisper a night for a hunter reynolds thought grimly he arrived at the three crowns in less than ten minutes even in the snowfilled gloom he had found his way there as unerringly as if he had lived in budapest all his days and made his first circumspect inspection of the place keeping to the far side of the street it was a big hotel occupying a city block to itself the entrance the big double glass doors open to the night with a revolving door behind the vestibule was bathed in a harsh fluorescent light two uniformed doormen occasionally stamping their feet and beating their arms against the cold guarded the entrance both men reynolds could see were armed with revolvers in buttoneddown holsters and carried a baton or nightstick apiece they were no more doormen than he was himself reynolds guessed but almost certainly regular members of the avo one thing was certain no matter how he was going to effect an entry it wasnt going to be through that front door all this reynolds saw out of the corner of his eyes as he hurried along the other side of the street head bent against the snow to all appearances a man homeward bound with all speed to the comforts of his own fireside as soon as he was out of their sight he doubled in his tracks and made a quick examination of the sides of the three crowns there was no more hope here than there had been at the front all the groundfloor windows were heavily barred and the windows of the story above might as well have been on the moon as far as accessibility was concerned that left only the back the trade and staff entrance to the hotel lay through a deep archway in the middle of the wall wide enough and high enough to take a big delivery truck through the archway reynolds caught a glimpse of the snowcovered courtyard beyond the hotel was built in the form of a hollow square an entrance door at the far side opposite the main doors and one or two parked cars above the entrance door to the main block a hooded electric lantern burned brightly and light shone from several of the ground and firstfloor windows the total illumination was not much but enough to let him see the angular shapes of three fireescapes zigzagging upwards before being lost in the snow and the darkness reynolds walked to the corner glanced quickly round him crossed the street at a fast walk and made his way back towards the entrance hugging the hotel wall as closely as he could approaching the opening of the archway he slowed down stopped pulled the brim of his hat farther over his eyes and peered cautiously round the corner for the first moment he could see nothing for his eyes so long accustomed and adjusted to the darkness were momentarily dazzled blinded by the beam from a powerful torch and in that sickening instant he was certain he had been discovered his hand was just coming out of his pocket the butt of the automatic cradled in his hand when the beam left him and went round the inside of the courtyard the pupils of his eyes slowly widening again reynolds could see now what had happened a man a soldier armed with a shoulderslung carbine was making his rounds of the perimeter of the courtyard and the carelessly swinging torch light had illuminated reynolds face for an instant but the guard his eyes obviously not following the beam had missed it reynolds turned into the archway took three silent paces forward and stopped again the guard was going away from him now approaching the main block and reynolds could clearly see what he was doing he was making a round of the fireescapes shining his light on the bottom snowcovered flight of steps of each reynolds wondered ironically whether he was guarding against the possibility of outsiders going in or insiders going out probably the latter from what the count had told him he knew that quite a few of the guests at this forthcoming conference would willingly have passed it up in exchange for an exit visa to the west a rather stupid precaution reynolds thought especially when it was made so obvious any reasonably fit person forewarned by the probing torch could go up or down the first flight of a fireescape without his feet making any telltale tracks on the steps now reynolds decided nows my chance the guard passing under the electric storm lantern at the far entrance was at his maximum distance and there was no point in waiting until he had made another circuit soundlessly a shadowy ghost in the white gloom of the night reynolds flitted across the cobble stones of the archway barely checked an exclamation halted abruptly in midstep and shrank into the wall beside him legs body arms and widespread stifffingered hands pressing hard against the cold clammy stone of the wall behind the brim of his hat crushed flat between the side of his head and the archway his heart was thumping slowly painfully in his chest you fool reynolds he told himself savagely you bloody kindergarten idiot you almost fell for it but for the grace of god and the red arc of that carelessly flung cigarette now sizzling to extinction in the snow not two feet from where you stood rockstill not even daring to breath you would have fallen for it he should have known he should have done the intelligence of the avo the elementary courtesy of guessing that they wouldnt make things so childishly simple for anyone hoping to break in or out the sentrybox just inside the courtyard stood only a few inches back from the archway and the sentry himself half in half out of the box his shoulders leaning against the corners both of the box and the archway was less than thirty inches from where reynolds stood reynolds could hear him breathing slowly distinctly and the occasional shuffling of his feet on the wooden floor of the box was almost thunderous in his ears he had barely seconds left reynolds knew half a dozen at the most the sentry had only to stir to turn his head a couple of lazy inches to the left and he was lost even if he didnt so stir his companion now only yards away would be bound to catch him in the sweep of his torch as he came by the entrance three courses reynolds racing mind calculated three courses only lay open to him he could turn and run and stood a good chance of escape in the snow and the darkness but the guard would be then so strengthened that his last chance of seeing old jennings would have gone for ever he could kill both men he never questioned his own ability to do this and would have destroyed them ruthlessly if the necessity were there but the problem of the disposal of the bodies would be insuperable and if the hue and cry over their discovery were raised while he was still inside the three crowns he knew he would never come out alive there was only the third way that offered any chanceof success and there was time neither for further thought nor delay the automatic was out now the butt firmly clasped in both hands the back of his right wrist pressed hard against the archway wall for maximum steadiness the bulk of the silencer made sighting difficult the swirling snow made it doubly so but the chance had to be taken the soldier with the torch was perhaps ten feet away the guard in the box clearing his throat to make some remark to his companion when reynolds slowly squeezed the trigger the soft plop of the silencer muffling the escaping gases was lost in the sudden crash as the storm lantern above the entrance door shattered into a hundred pieces the broken fragments tinkling against the wall behind before falling into the cushioning silence of the snow to the ears of the man at the sentrybox the dull report of the silencer must have come a fraction of a second before the smashing of the glass but the human ear is incapable of making such fine distinctions in time and only the vastly louder sound could have registered already he was pounding across the courtyard towards the far entrance the man with the torch close by his side reynolds wasnt far behind them he passed the sentrybox turned sharply right ran lightly along the track the circling sentry had beaten in the virgin snow passed the first fireescape turned launched himself sideways and upwards and caught the stanchion supporting the handrail on the first platform at the full extent of his arms for one bad moment he felt his fingers slipping on the cold smooth steel tightened his grip desperately held then overhanded himself upwards till he caught the rail a moment later he was standing securely on the first platform and neither the snow round the three outer edges of the platform nor that on any of the steps leading up to it showed any signs of having been disturbed five seconds later taking two steps at a time with his feet each time placed sideways in the middle of each step so as to leave no visible trace from below he had reached the second platform on a level now with the first floor here he crouched kneeling so as to reduce his bulk to the smallest dimensions possible for the two soldiers were returning to the archway in no great hurry talking to one another they were convinced reynolds could hear that the hot glass had shattered because of the extreme cold and not disposed to worry unduly about it reynolds felt no surprise the spent bullet deflected by these granitehard walls would leave scarcely a mark and it might lie undisturbed undiscovered for days under the thick carpet of snow in their position he would probably have come to the same conclusion himself for forms sake the two men walked round the parked cars and shone their torches over the lower flights of the fireescapes and by the time their cursory inspection was over reynolds was on the platform level with the second floor standing outside a set of double glass doors he tried them cautiously firmly they were locked he had expected nothing else slowly with the utmost care for his hands were now almost numbed with the cold and the slightest fumble could be his undoing he had brought out his knife eased the blade open without a click slid it into the crack between the doors and pressed upwards seconds later he was inside looking the glass doors behind him the room was pitch dark but his outstretched inquiring hands soon told him where he was the hard smoothness all around the glazed feel of wall tiles marble washbasins and chromed rails could belong only to a bathroom he pulled the door curtains carelessly together as far as the men below were concerned there was no reason why a light should not appear in that room more than in any other room fumbled his way across to the door and switched on the light it was a large room with an oldfashioned bath three of the wails tiled and the other given up to a couple of big linen cupboards but reynolds wasted no time in examining it he crossed to the washbasin ran the water till the basin was almost full of hot water and plunged his hands in a drastic method of restoring circulation to numbed and frozen hands and an exquisitely painful one but what it lacked in finesse it more than compensated for in speed and reynolds was interested in that alone he dried his tingling fingers took his automatic out switched off the light cautiously opened the door and eased an eye round the corner of the jamb he was standing he found at the end of a long corridor luxuriously carpeted as he would have expected of any hotel run by the avo both sides of the corridor were lined with doors the one opposite him bearing the number and the next but one luck was beginning to break his way and chance had brought him directly into the wing where jennings and probably a handful of other top scientists were quartered but as his glance reached the end of the corridor his mouth tightened and he drew back swiftly noiselessly inside the door shutting it softly behind him selfcongratulations were a trifle premature he thought grimly there had been no mistaking the identity of that uniformed figure standing at the far end of the corridor hands clasped behind his back and staring out through a frostrimed window there was no mistaking an avo guard anywhere reynolds sat on the edge of the bath lit a cigarette and tried to figure out his next move the need for haste was urgent but not desperate enough for rashness at this stage rashness could ruin everything the guard obviously was there to stay he had that curiously settled look about him equally obviously he reynolds could not hope to break his way into no as long as the guard remained there problem remove the guard no good trying to rush him or even stalk him down the brightly lit length of the foot corridor there were other ways of committing suicide but few more foolish the guard would have to come to mm and he would have to come unsuspectingly suddenly reynolds grinned crushed out his cigarette and rose quickly to his feet the count he thought would have appreciated this he stripped off hat jacket tie and shirt tossing them into the bath ran hot water into the basin took a bar of soap and lathered his face vigorously till it was covered in a deep white film up to his eyes for all he knew his description had been issued to every policeman and avo man in budapest then he dried his hands thoroughly took the gun in his left hand draped a towel over it and opened the door his voice when he called was lowpitched enough but it carried down the length of the corridor with remarkable clarity the guard whirled round at once his hand automatically reaching down for his gun but he checked the movement as he saw the harmless appearance of the singletclad gesticulating figure at the other end of the corridor he opened his mouth to speak but reynolds urgently gestured him to silence with the universal dumbshow of a forefinger raised to pursed lips for a second the guard hesitated saw reynolds beckoning him frantically then came running down the corridor his rubber soles silent on the deep pile of the carpet he had his gun in his hand as he drew up alongside reynolds theres a man on the fireescape outside reynolds whispered his nervous fumbling with the towel concealed the transfer of the gun barrel foremost to his right hand hes trying to force the doors open you are sure of this the mans voice was no more than a hoarse guttural murmur you saw him i saw him reynolds whisper was shaking with nervous excitement he cant see in though the curtains are drawn the guards eyes narrowed and the thick lips drew back in a smile of almost wolfish anticipation heaven only knew what wild dreams of glory and promotion were whirling through his mind whatever his thoughts none was of suspicion or caution roughly he pushed reynolds to one side and pushed open the bathroom door and reynolds his right hand coming clear of the towel followed on his heels he caught the guard as he crumpled and lowered him gently to the floor to open up the linen cupboard rip up a couple of sheets bind and gag the unconscious guard lift him into the cupboard and lock the door on him took reynolds trained hands only two minutes two minutes later hat in hand and overcoat over his arm very much in the manner of an hotel guest returning to his room reynolds was outside the door of no he had half a dozen skeleton keys together with four masters the manager of his own hotel had given him and not one of them fitted reynolds stood quite still this was the last thinghe had expected he would have guaranteed the entry to any hotel door with these keys and he couldnt risk forcing the door breaking it open was out of the question and a lock tripped by force cant be closed again if a guard accompanied the professor back to his room as might well happen and found unlocked a door he had left locked suspicion and immediate search would follow reynolds moved on to the next door on both sides of this corridor only every other door bore a number and it was a safe assumption that the numberless doors were the corridor entrances to the private bathrooms adjoining each room the russians accorded to their top scientists facilities and accommodation commonly reserved in other and less realistic countries for film stars aristocracy and the leading lights of society inevitably this door too was locked so long a corridor in so busy a hotel couldnt remain empty indefinitely and reynolds was sliding the keys in and out of the lock with the speed and precision of a sleightofhand artist luck was against him again he pulled out his torch dropped to his knees and peered into the crack between the door and the jamb this time luck was with him most continental doors fit over a jamb leaving the lock bolt inaccessible but this one fitted into the jamb reynolds quickly took from his wallet a three by two oblong of fairly stiff celluloid in some countries the discovery of such an article on a known thief would be sufficient to bring him before a judge on a charge of being in possession of a burglarious implement and slipped it between door and jamb he caught the door handle pulling towards himself and in the direction of the hinges worked the celluloid in behind the bolt eased the door and jerked it back again the bolt slid back with a loud click and a moment later reynolds was inside the bathroom for such it was resembled in every detail the one he had just left except for the position of the doors the double cupboard was to his right as he entered between the two doors he opened the cupboards saw that one side was given over to shelves and the other with a fulllength mirror to its door empty then closed them again a convenient bolthole but one he hoped he would have no occasion to use he crossed to the bedroom connecting door and peered in through the keyhole the room beyond was in darkness the door yielded to his touch on the handle and he stepped inside the pencil beam of his torch swiftly circling the room empty he crossed to the window saw that no chink of light could possibly escape through the shutters and heavy curtains crossed over to the door switched on the light and hung his hat over the handle to block off the keyhole reynolds was a trained searcher it took only a minutes meticulous examination of walls pictures and ceilings to convince him that there was no spyhole into the room and less than twenty seconds thereafter to find the inevitable microphone concealed behind the ventilation grill above the window he transferred his attention to this bathroom and the examination there took only seconds the bath was built in so there could be nothing there there was nothing behind the washbasin or the water closet and behind the shower curtains were only the brass handgrip and the oldfashioned spray nozzle fixed to the ceiling he was just pulling back the curtains when he heard footsteps approaching in the corridor outside only feet away the deep carpet had muffled their approach he ran through the connecting door into the bedroom switched off the light there were two people coming he could hear them talking and could only hope that their voices drowned the click of the switch picked up his hat moved swiftly back into the bathroom had the door three parts shut and was peering through the crack between jamb and door when the key turned in the lock and professor jennings walked into the room and hard on his heels a tall bulky man in a brown suit followed him through the doorway whether he was some avo appointed guard or just a colleague of jennings it was impossible to say but one thing was clear enough he carried with him a bottle and two glasses and he intended to stay chapter five reynolds gun was in his hand almost without his being aware of it if jennings companion chose to make an inspection of the bathroom there was no time for him reynolds to move into the shelter of the big cupboard and if he was discovered then reynolds would be left without any option and with the guard and for safetys sake he had to assume that it was a guard unconscious or dead his boats would have been burnt behind him there would never then be another chance of contacting jennings the old professor would have to come with him that night whether he liked it or not and reynolds rated as almost nonexistent his chances of escaping unobserved from the three crowns with an unwilling prisoner at the point of a gun and getting any distance at all through the hostile dark of budapest but the man with jennings made no move to enter the bathroom and it soon became apparent that he was no guard jennings appeared to be on friendly enough terms with the man called him jozef and discussed with him in english some highly technical subjects that reynolds couldnt even begin to understand a scientific colleague beyond doubt for a moment reynolds was conscious of astonishment that the russians should allow two scientists one a foreigner to discuss so freely then he remembered the microphone and he wasnt astonished any more it was the man in the brown suit who was doing most of the talking and this was at first surprising for harold jennings had the reputation of being talkative to the point of garrulousness forthright to the point of indiscretion but reynolds peering through the jamb of the door could see that jennings was a vastly changed jennings from the person whose figure and face he had memorised from a hundred photographs two years in exile had added more than ten in age to his appearance he seemed smaller somehow curiously shrunken and in place of a once splendid mane of white hair were now only a few straggling locks across a balding head his face was unhealthily pale and only his eyes dark sunken pools in a deeply lined and etched face had lost none of their fire and authority reynolds smiled to himself in the darkness whatever the russians had done to the old man they hadnt broken his spirit that would have been altogether too much to expect reynolds glanced down at the face of his luminous watch and his smile vanished time was running out he must see jennings see him alone and soon half a dozen different ideas occurred to him within the space of a minute but he dismissed them all as unpractical or too dangerous he must take no chances for all the apparent friendliness of the man in the brown suit he was a russian and must be treated as an enemy finally he came up with an idea that carried with it at least a fair chance it was far from foolproof it could fail as easily as it could suceed but the chance had to be taken he crossed the bathroom on noiseless feet picked up a piece of soap made his silent way back to the big cupboard opened the door with the long mirror inside and started to write on the glass it was no good the dry soap slid smoothly over the smooth surface and made scarcely a mark reynolds swore softly as softly recrossed to the washbasin turned the tap with infinite care till a little trickle of water came out then wet the soap thoroughly this time the writing on the glass was all he could have wished for and he wrote in clear block letters i am from england get rid of your friend at once then gently careful to guard against even the smallest metallic sound or creak of hinges he eased open the bathroom corridor door and peered out the corridor was deserted two long paces took him outside jennings bedroom door a very soft quick taptap on the wood and he was back inside the bathroom as noiselessly as he had gone picking his torch up from the floor the man in the brown suit was already on his feet walking towards the door when reynolds stuck his head through the partly open bathroom door one finger in urgent warning at his lips another pressing down on the morse button of his torch the beam striking jennings eyes a fraction of a second only but long enough jennings glanced up startled saw the face at the door and not even reynolds warning forefinger could stifle the exclamation that leapt to his lips the man in the brown suit with the door open now and glancing uncomprehendingly along the length of the corridor swung round something is wrong professor jennings nodded this damned head of mine you know how it troubles me no one there no one no one at all i could have sworn you do not look well professor jennings no excuse me jennings smiled wanly and rose to his feet a little water i think and some of my migraine tablets reynolds was standing inside the big cupboard the door just ajar as soon as he saw jennings come into the bathroom he pushed the door wide open jennings couldnt fail to see the mirror with its message he nodded almost imperceptibly glanced warningly at reynolds and continued towards the washbasin without breaking his stride for an old man unaccustomed to this sort of thing it was a remarkable performance reynolds interpreted the warning glance correctly and the cupboard door had hardly closed before the professors companion was in the room perhaps i should get the hotel doctor he said worriedly he would be only too willing no no jennings swallowed a tablet and washed it down with a gulp of water i know these damned migraines of mine better than any doctor three of these tablets three hours lying down in absolute darkness im really terribly sorry jozef our discussion was just beginning to become really interesting but if you would excuse me but of course of course the other was cordiality and understanding itself whatever else happens we must have you fit and well for the opening speech on monday a few platitudes of sympathy a word of farewell and the man in the brown suit was gone the bedroom door clicked shut and the soft sound of his footfalls faded in the distance jennings his face a nice mixture of indignation apprehension and expectation made to speak but reynolds held up his hand for silence went to the bedroom door locked it withdrew the key tried it in the bathroom corridor door found to his relief that it fitted locked it and closed the communicating door leading to the bedroom he produced his cigarette case and offered it to the professor only to have it waved aside who are you what are you doing in my room the professors voice was low but the asperity in it an asperity just touched with fear was unmistakable my name is michael reynolds reynolds puffed a cigarette alight he felt he needed it i left london only fortyeight hours ago and i would like to talk to you sir then dammit why cant we talk in the comfort of my bedroom jennings swung round then brought up abruptly as reynolds caught him by the shoulder not in the bedroom sir reynolds shook his head gently theres a concealed microphone in the ventilation grill above your window theres a what how did you know young man the professor walked slowly back towards reynolds i had a look around before you came reynolds said apologetically i arrived only a minute before you and you found a microphone in that time jennings was incredulous and not even politely so i found it right away its my job to know where to look for such things of course of course what else could you be an espionage agent counterespionage damned things mean the same to me anyway the british secret service a popular if erroneous bah a rose by any other name whatever of fear there was in the little man reynolds thought dryly it certainly wasnt for himself the fire of which he had heard so much burned as brightly as ever what do you want sir what do you want you reynolds said quietly rather the british government wants you i am asked by the government to extend to you a most cordial invitation uncommonly civil of the british government i must say ah i expected this ive been expecting it for a long time now if jennings had been a dragon reynolds mused everything within ten feet of him would have been incinerated my compliments to the british government mr reynolds and tell them from me to go to hell maybe when they get there theyll find someone wholl help them build their infernal machines but it isnt going to be me the country needs you sir and needs you desperately the last appeal and the most pathetic of all the old man was openly contemptuous now the shibboleths of outworn nationalism the catch penny phrase words of the emptyheaded flag wavers of your bogus patriotism are only for the children of this world mr reynolds the morons the selfseekers and those who live entirely for war i care only to work for the peace of the world very good sir the people at home reynolds thought wryly had badly underestimated either jennings credulity or the subtlety of russian indoctrination even so his words had seemed a faroff echo of something jansci had said he looked at jennings the decision of course must rest entirely with you what jennings was astonished and could not conceal his astonishment you accept it you accept it as easily as that and you have come so far reynolds shrugged i am only a messenger dr jennings a messenger and what if i had agreed to your ridiculous suggestion then of course i would have accompanied you back to britain you would have mr reynolds do you realise what you are saying do you realise what you you would have taken me out of budapest through hungary and across the frontier jennings voice slowly trailed away into nothingness and when he looked up at reynolds again the fear was back in his eyes you are no ordinary messenger mr reynolds he whispered people like you are never messengers all of a sudden certainty struck home at the old man and a thin white line touched the edges of his mouth you were never told to invite me back to britain you were told to bring me back there were to be no ifs or maybes were there mr reynolds isnt that rather silly sir reynolds said quietly even if i were in a position to use compulsion and im not i wouldnt be such a fool as to use it supposing you were to be dragged back to britain tied hand and foot theres still no way of keeping you there or making you work against your own will lets not confuse flag wavers with the secret police of a satellite state i dont for a moment think youd use direct force to get me home the fear was still in the old mans eyes fear and sickness of heart mr reynolds is is my wife still alive i saw her two hours before i left london airport there was a quiet sincerity in every word that reynolds spoke and he had never seen mrs jennings in his life she was holding her own i think would you say would you say she is still critically ill reynolds shrugged that is for the doctors to say for gods sake man dont try to torture me what do the doctors say suspended animation hardly a medical term dr jennings but thats what mr bathurst he was her surgeon calls it shes conscious all the time and in little pain but very weak to be brutally frank she could go at any moment mr bathurst says shes just lost the will to live my god my god jennings turned away and stared unseeingly through the frosted window after a moment he swung round his face contorted his dark eyes blurred with tears i cant believe it mr reynolds i just cant its not possible my catherine was always a fighter she was always you dont want to believe it reynolds interrupted his voice was cold to the point of cruelty doesnt matter what the selfdeception is does it as long as it satisfies your conscience this precious conscience that would let you sell your own people down the river in exchange for all this claptrap about coexistence you know damned well your wife has nothing to live for not with her husband and son lost for ever to her beyond the iron curtain how dare you talk you make me sick reynolds felt a momentary flash of distaste for what he was doing to this defenceless old man but crushed it down you stand there making noble speeches and standing upon all these wonderful principles of yours and all the time your wife is in a london hospital dying shes dying dr jennings and you are killing her as surely as if you were standing by her side and throttling stop stop for gods sake stop jennings had his hands to his ears and was shaking his head like a man in agony he drew back his hands across his forehead youre right reynolds heaven only knows youre right td go to her tomorrow but theres more to it than that he shook his head in despair how can you ask any man to choose between the lives of his wife who may be already beyond hope and his only son my situation is impossible i have a son we know all about your son dr jennings we are not inhuman altogether reynolds voice had dropped to a gentle persuasive murmur yesterday brian was in poznan this afternoon he will be in stettin and tomorrow morning he will be in sweden i have only to receive radio confirmation from london and then we can be on our way certainly inside twentyfour hours i dont believe it i dont believe it hope and disbelief struggled pitifully for supremacy in the old lined face how can you say cant prove a thing i dont have to prove a thing reynolds said wearily with all respect sir what the hells happened to this mighty intellect surely you know that all the government wants of you is that you should work for them again and you also know they know what youre like they know damned well if you returned home and found your son still a prisoner in russia that youd never work for them as long as you lived and thats the last thing in the world theyd ever want conviction had come slowly to jennings but now that it had come it had come for keeps reynolds seeing the new life come into the professors face the determination gradually replacing the worry and the sorrow and the fear could have laughed aloud from sheer relief even on himself the strain had been greater than he had realised another five minutes a score of questions tumbling out one after the other and the professor afire now with the hope of seeing his wife and son in the course of the next few days was all for leaving that very night at that very instant and had to be restrained plans had to be made reynolds explained gently and much more important they had first to get news of brians escape and this had brought jennings to earth immediately he agreed to await further instructions repeated aloud several times the address of janscis house until he had completely memorised it but agreed never to use it except in extreme emergency the police might have already moved in as far as reynolds knew and promised in the meantime to carry on working and behaving exactly as he had been doing so completely had his attitude towards reynolds changed that he tried to persuade him to share a drink but reynolds declined it was only half past seven he had plenty of time before his appointment in the white angel but he had already pushed his luck to the limit at any moment now the imprisoned guard might recover consciousness and start to kick the door down or a supervisor might make his rounds and find him missing he left immediately by way of the professors bedroom window and by means of a couple of sheets which let him climb down far enough to catch the barred grills of a window on the ground story even before jennings had had time to reel in the sheets and close his windows reynolds had dropped silently to the ground and vanished wraithlike into the darkness and the snow the white angel cafe lay just back from the east bank of the danube on the pest side opposite st margit island and reynolds passed through its frosted swing doors just as a nearby church bell muffled and faint through the curtaining snow struck the hour of eight oclock the contrast between the world outside these swing doors and the one inside was as abrupt as it was complete one step across the threshold and the snow the cold the chill dark silent loneliness of the lifeless streets of budapest were magically transformed into warmth and brightness and the gaiety of laughing babbling voices as men and women found an outlet for their natural gregariousness in the cramped and smoky confines of the little cafe and sought to make their escape however artificial and ephemeral such escape might be from the iron realities of the world outside reynolds first and immediate reaction was that of surprise shock almost to find such an oasis of colour and light in the grim drab greyness of a police state but that reaction was brief it was inevitable that the communists no mean psychologists should not only permit such places but positively encourage them if people were to gather in the company of one another as people would no matter what the prohibitions how much better that they should do it in the open and drink their coffee and wine and porter under the watchfully benevolent eye of some trusted servants of the state rather than gather in dark and huddled corners and plot against the regime excellent safety valves reynolds thought dryly he had broken step and paused just inside the door then moved on again almost at once but without haste two tables near the doors were crowded with russian soldiers laughing singing and banging their glasses on the table in high good humour harmless enough reynolds judged and doubtless that was why the cafe had been chosen as a rendezvous no one was going to look for a western spy in the drinking haunt of russian soldiers but these were reynolds first russians and he preferred not to linger he moved in to the back of the cafe and saw her almost at once sitting alone at a tiny table for two she was dressed in the belted hooded coat the manager had described to reynolds earlier in the day but now the hood was down and the coat open at the throat her eyes caught his without a flicker of recognition and reynolds took his cue at once there were half a dozen tables nearby with one or two vacant places and he stood there hesitating over which seat to choose long enough for several people to notice his presence then he moved across to julias table do you mind if i share your table he asked she stared at him turned her head to look pointedly at a small empty table in the corner glanced at him again then pointedly shifted her body until her shoulder was turned to him she said nothing and reynolds could hear the stifled sniggers behind him as he sat down he edged his chair closer to hers and his voice was only a murmur trouble im being followed she had turned towards him again her face hostile and aloof shes no fool reynolds thought and by heavens she knew how to act hes here a millimetric nod but nod nevertheless where bench by the door near the soldiers reynolds made no move to turn his head describe him medium height brown raincoat no hat thin face and black moustache the disdain still registering on her face was in almost comical contrast with the words we must get rid of him outside you first me last he stretched out his hand squeezed her forearm bent forward and leered at her ive been trying to pick you up in fact ive just made a most improper suggestion how do you react like this she swung back her free hand and caught reynolds across the face with a slap so loud that it momentarily stopped all the hubbub and conversation and turned every eye in their direction then julia was on her feet gathering up her handbag and gloves and walking haughtily towards the door looking neither to her left nor right as if by a signal the talk and the laughter broke out again and most of the laughter reynolds knew was directed against himself he lifted a hand and gingerly caressed a tingling cheek the young lady he thought ruefully carried realism to quite unnecessary lengths a scowl on his face he swivelled in his seat in time to see the glass doors swinging to behind her and to see a man in a brown raincoat rise unobtrusively from his seat by the door throw some money on his table and follow close behind her even before the door had stopped swinging reynolds was on his feet a man obviously bent on leaving the scene of his discomfiture and mortification with all possible speed everybody he knew was looking at him and when he pulled his coat collar up and his hat brim down a renewed chorus of sniggers broke out just as he approached the door a burly russian soldier his face red with laughter and drink heaved himself to his feet said something to reynolds thumped him on the back hard enough to send him staggering against the counter then doubled up convulsed with laughter over his own wit a stranger to russians and russian ways reynolds had no idea whether anger or fear would be the safer reaction in the circumstances he contented himself with a grimace that was compounded of a sullen scowl and sheepish grin sidestepped nimbly and was gone before the humorist could renew the assault the snow was very light now and he had little difficulty in locating both the girl and the man they were walking slowly up the street to the left and he followed keeping the man at the very limit of observation two hundred yards four hundred a couple of corners and julia had halted in a tram shelter outside a row of shops her shadow slid silently into a doorway behind the shelter and reynolds went past him joining the girl in the glassfronted shelter hes behind us in a doorway reynolds murmured do you think you could put up a desperate fight for your honour could i she broke off and glanced nervously over her shoulder we must be careful hes avo im certain and all avo men are dangerous dangerous fiddlesticks reynolds said roughly we havent all night he looked at her speculatively then lifted his hands and caught her by the coat lapels strangulation i think must account for the fact that youre not screaming for help we have enough company as it is the shadow fell for it he would have been less than human not to fall for it he saw the man and woman come staggering out of the tram shelter the woman fighting desperately to tear away the hands encircling her throat and didnt hesitate his feet silent on the hardpacked snow he came running lightly across the pavement the weapon raised high in his right hand ready to strike then collapsed soundlessly as reynolds at a warning exclamation from the girl swung round elbowed him viciously in the solar plexus and chopped him with the edge of his open hand across the side of the neck it took only seconds thereafter for reynolds to stuff the mans blackjack a canvas tube filled with lead shot in his pocket bundle the man himself into the tram shelter take the girls arm and hurry away along the street the girl shivered violently and reynolds peered at her in surprise in the almost total darkness of the watchmans box confined as they were in a narrow space and sheltered from the snow and the bitter wind they were relatively comfortable and even through his coat he could feel the warmth of the girls shoulder against his own he reached for her hand she had taken off her gloves to rub the circulation into life when they had arrived ten minutes previously but she snatched it away as from the touch of flame whats the matter reynolds voice was puzzled still feeling frozen i dont know i yes i do know im not cold she shivered again its its you youre too inhuman im afraid of people who are inhuman afraid of me reynolds sounded incredulous and felt that way my dear child i wouldnt harm a hair of your head dont you child me a sudden flash of spirit then a quiet small voice i know you wouldnt then what the devil am i supposed to have done nothing thats the whole point its not what you do its what you dont do its what you dont show you show no feelings no emotions no interest or concern in anything oh yes youre interested enough in the job to be done but the method the how of it is a matter of absolute indifference just so long as the job is done the count says youre only a machine a mechanism designed to carry out a certain piece of work but without any life or existence as an individual he says youre about the only person he knows who cannot be afraid and he is afraid of people who cannot be afraid imagine the count afraid imagine reynolds murmured politely jansci says the same he says youre neither moral nor immoral just amoral with certain conditioned probritish anticommunist reactions that are valueless in themselves he says whether you kill or not is decided not on a basis of wrong or right but simply of expediency he says that you are the same as hundreds of young men he has met in the nkvd the waffen ss and other such organisations men who obey blindly and kill blindly without ever asking themselves whether it is right or wrong the only difference my father says is that you would never kill wantonly but that is the only difference i make friends wherever i go reynolds murmured there you see what i mean one cannot touch you and now tonight you bundle a man into a hotel cupboard bound and gagged and let him suffocate he probably did you hit another and leave him to freeze to death in the snow he wont last twenty minutes in this you i could have shot the first man reynolds said quietly i have a silencer you know and do you think that lad with the blackjack wouldnt have left me to freeze to death if hed got in first youre just quibbling and worst of all that poor old man you dont care what you do as long as he goes back to britain do you he thinks his wife is dying and yet youd torture him till he must be almost insane with worry and grief you encourage him to believe you make him believe that if she goes hell be her murderer why mr reynolds why you know why because im a nasty amoral emotionless machine of a chicago gangster just doing what im told you just said so didnt you im just wasting my breath am i not mr reynolds the tone was flat and dull by no means reynolds grinned in the darkness i could listen all night to your voice and im sure you wouldnt preach so earnestly unless you thought there was some hope of conversion youre laughing at me arent you a nasty superior sort of smirk reynolds admitted suddenly he caught her hand and lowered his voice keep quiet and keep still what only the one word had escaped before reynolds clamped a hand tightly over her mouth she started to struggle then relaxed almost immediately she too had heard it the crunch of footsteps in the snow they sat without moving hardly daring to breathe while three policemen walked slowly past them past the abandoned cafe terraces farther on and disappeared along a winding path beneath the bare snowladen beeches planes and oaks that lined the perimeter of a great lawn i thought you told me this part of margit island was always deserted his voice was a savage whisper that no one ever came here in the winter it always has been before she murmured i knew the policemen made a round but i didnt know they came that way but they wont be back for another hour im sure of that the margitsziget is big and they will take time to go round it had been julia teeth chattering with the cold and desperate for a place where they could talk in privacy the white angel had been the only cafe in the area which was open who after a fruitless search elsewhere had suggested margit island parts of it she had said were banned and under curfew i after a certain hour but the curfew wasnt treated too seriously the patrolling guards were members of the ordinary police forces not the secret police and were as different from the avo as chalk from cheese reynolds himself almost as cold as the girl had readily agreed and the watchmans hut surrounded by the granite setts chips and tar barrels of road repairers who had vanished with the onset of the cold weather had seemed an ideal place there julia had told of the latest happenings at janscis house the two men who had been watching the house so assiduously had made an error only one admittedly but their last they had grown overconfident and had taken to walking past on the same side of the street as the garage instead of the opposite side and on one occasion finding the garage door open had gone so far as to let their curiosity get the better of them and peer in which was a mistake as sandor had been waiting for them whether they had been informers or avo men was not known as sandor had cracked their heads together rather harder than was necessary all that mattered was that they were under lock and key and that it would now be safe for reynolds to visit the house to make final plans for the abduction of the professor but not before midnight jansci had insisted on that reynolds in his turn had told her of what had happened to him and now just afterthe departure of the three policemen he looked at her in the gloom of the shelter her hand was still in his she was quite unaware of it and her hand was tense and rigid and unyielding youre not really cut out for this sort of thing miss hlyurin he said quietly very few people are you dont stay here and lead this life because you like it like it dear god how could anyone ever like this life nothing but fear and hunger and repression and for us always moving from place to place always looking over our shoulders to see if someone is there afraid to look over our shoulder in case someone is there to speak in the wrong place to smile at the wrong time youd go over to the west tomorrow wouldnt you yes no no i cant i cant you see your mother isnt that it my mother he could feel her shift against him as she turned to stare in the darkness my mother is dead mr reynolds dead his voice inflected in surprise thats not what your father says know its not her voice softened poor dear jansci hell never believe that mother is dead she was dying when they took her away one lung was almost gone she couldnt have lived a couple of days but jansci will never believe it hell stop hoping when he stops breathing but you tell him you believe it too yes i wait here because i am all jansci has left in the world and cannot leave him but if i told him that he would have me across the austrian frontier tomorrow he would never have me risk my life for him and so i tell him i wait for mother i see reynolds could think of nothing else to say wondered if he himself could have done what this girl was doing if he felt as she did he remembered something his impression that jansci had seemed indifferent to the fate of his wife your father he has looked for your mother searched for her i mean you dont think so do you he always gives that impression i dont know why she paused for a moment then went on you will not believe this no one believes this but it is true there are nine concentration camps in hungary and in the past eighteen months jansci has been inside five of them just looking for mother inside and as you see out again its just not possible is it its just not possible reynolds echoed slowly and hes combed a thousand over a thousand collective farms or what used to be collective farms before the october rising he has not found her he never will find her but always he looks always he will keep on looking and he will never find her something in her voice caught reynolds attention he reached up a gentle hand and touched her face her cheeks were wet but she did not turn away she didnt resent the touch i told you this wasnt for you miss illyurin julia always julia you mustnt say that name you mustnt even think that name why am i telling you all these things who knows but tell me more tell me about jansci i have heard a little but only a little what can i tell you a little you say but thats all i too know about my father he will never talk about what is gone he will not even say why he will not talk i think it is because he lives now only for peace and the making of peace to help all those who cannot help themselves that is what i heard him say once i think his memory tortures him he has lost so much and he has killed so many reynolds said nothing and after a time the girl went on janscis father was a communist leader in the ukraine he was a good communist and he was also a good man you can be both at the same time mr reynolds in he and practically every leading communist in the ukraine died in the secret police torture cellars in kiev that was when it all started jansci executed the executioners and some of the judges but too many hands were against him he was taken to siberia and spent six months in an underground cell in the vladivostock transit camp waiting for ice to melt and the steamer to come to take them away he saw no daylight for six months he didnt see another human being for six months his crusts andthe slops that passed for food were lowered through a batch they all knew who he was and he was to take a long time dying he had no blankets no bed and the temperature was far below zero for the last month they stopped all supplies of water also but jansci survived by licking tine hoar frost off the door of his cell they were beginning to learn that jansci was indestructible go on go on reynolds still held the girls hand tightly in his own but neither of them was aware of it and after that after that the freighter came and took him away to the kolyma mountains no one ever comes back from the kolyma mountains but jansci came back he could hear the awe in the girls voice even as she spoke even as she repeated something she must have said or thought a thousand times these were the worst months of his life i dont know what happened in those days i dont think there is anyone still alive who knows what happened then all i know is that he sometimes still wakes up from his sleep his face grey whispering davai davai get going get going and bystrey bystrey faster faster its something to do with driving or pulling sledges i dont know what i know too that even to this day he cannot bear to hear the sound of sleigh bells youve seen the missing fingers on his hands it was a favourite sport t drag prisoners along behind the nkvds or ogpus as it was then propellerdriven sledges and see how close they could be brought to the propeller sometimes they were jerked too close and their faces she was silent for a moment then went on her voice unsteady i suppose you could say jansci was lucky his fingers only his fingers and his hands these scars on his hands do you know how he came by these mr reynolds he shook his head in the darkness and she seemed to sense the movement wolves mr reynolds wolves mad with hunger the guards trapped them starved them and then flung a man and a wolf into the same pit the man would have only his hands jansci had only his hands his arms his entire body is a mass of these scars lt not possible all this is not possible reynolds lowpitched mutter was that of a man trying to convince himself of something which must be true in the kolyma mountains all things are possible that wasnt the worst that was nothing other things happened to him there degrading horrible bestial things but he has never spoken of them to me and the palms of his hands the crucifixion marks on his hands these arent crucifixion marks all the biblical pictures are wrong you cant crucify a man by the palms of his hands jansci had done something terrible i dont know what it was so they took him out to the taiga the deep forest in the middle of winter stripped him of all his clothes nailed him to two trees that grew close together and left him they knew it would be only a few minutes the fearful cold or the wolves he escaped god knows how he escaped jansci doesnt but he escaped found his clothes where they had thrown them away and left the kolyma mountains that was when all his fingers his fingertips and nails went thats when he lost all his toes you have seen the way he walks yes reynolds remembered the strange stifflegged gait he thought of janscis face its kindness and its infinite gentleness and tried to see that face against the background of its history but the gap was too great his imagination baulked at the attempt i would not have believed this of any man julia to survive so much he must be indestructible think so too it took him four months to arrive at the transsiberian railway where it crosses the lena and when he stopped a train he was quite insane he was out of his mind for a long time but he finally recovered and made his way back to the ukraine that was in he joined the army and became a major inside a year jansci joined for the reason that most ukranians joined to wait his chance as they are stillbaiting their chance to turn their regiments against the red army and the chance came soon when germany attacked there was a long pause then she went on quietly we know now but we didnt know then what the russians told the world we know what they told of the long bloody battle as we fell back on the dnieper the scorched earth the desperate defence of kiev lies lies all lies and still most of the world doesnt know it he could hear her voice softening in memory we welcomed the germans with open arms we gave them the most wonderful welcome any army has ever had we gave them food and wine we decorated our streets we garlanded the stormtroopers with flowers not one shot was fired in defence of kiev ukranian regiments ukranian divisions deserted en masse to the germans jansci said theres never been anything like it in history and soon the germans had an army of a million russians fighting for them under the command of the soviet general andrei vlassov jansci was with this army he rose to be majorgeneral and one of vlassovs righthand men and fought with this army until the germans fell back on his home town of vinnitsa in her voice tailed away came again after a long silence it was after vinnitsa that jansci changed he swore he would never fight again he swore he would never kill again he has kept his promise vinnitsa reynolds curiosity was roused what happened at vinnitsa you youve never heard of vinnitsa never dear god she whispered i thought the whole world had heard of vinnitsa sorry no what happened there dont ask me dont ask me reynolds heard the long quivering sigh someone else but please dont ask me okay okay reynolds voice was quick surprised he could feel her whole body shaking with silent sobs and he patted her shoulder awkwardly skip it it doesnt matter thank you her voice was muffled thats just about all mr reynolds jansci went to visit his old home in vinnitsa and the russians were waiting for him they had been waiting a long time he was put in command of a ukranian regiment all deserters who had been recaptured given obsolete weapons and no uniforms at all and forced into a suicide position against the germans that happened to tens of thousands of ukranians he was captured by the germans he had thrown away his weapons and walked across to their lines was recognised and spent the rest of the war with general vlassov after the war the ukrainian liberation army broke up into sections some of them believe it or not are still operating and it was there that he met the count they have never parted since he is a pole isnt he the count i mean yes thats where they met in poland and who is he really do you know he sensed rather than saw the shake of the head in the darkness jansci knows but only jansci i only know that next only to my father he is the most wonderful person i have ever known and theres some strange bond between them i think its because they both have so much blood on their hands and because neither of them has killed for years they are dedicated men mr reynolds is he really a count he is indeed so much i know he owned huge estates lakes and forests and great pastures at a place called augustow up near the borders of east prussia and lithuania or what used to be the borders he fought the germans in then took to the underground after a long time he was captured and the germans thought that it would be very amusing to make a polish aristocrat earn his living by forced labour you know the kind of labour mr reynolds clearing the thousands of corpses out of the warsaw ghetto after the stukas and the tanks had finished with it he and a band of others killed their gaolers and joined general bors polish resistance army you will remember what happened marshal rossokovsky halted his russian armies outside warsaw and let the germans and the polish resistance fight it out to the death in the sewers of warsaw i remember people speak of it as the bitterest battle of the war the poles were massacred of course nearly all the remnants the count among them were taken off to the auschwitz gas chambers the german guards let them nearly all go no one yet knows why but not before they branded them the count has his number inside his forearm running from wrist to elbow all scarred raised lumps she shivered its horrible and then he met your father yes they were both with vlassovs men but they didnt stay long the endless senseless killings sickened them both these bands used to disguise themselves as russians stop and board the polish trains make the passengers get out and shoot all who held communist party cards and many of the holders had no option but to have these cards if they and their families were to survive or they would move into towns ferret out the stakhanovites or wouldbe stakhanovites and throw them among the ice blocks of the vistula so they left for czechoslovakia and joined the slovak partisans in the high tatra ive heard of them even in england reynolds acknowledged the fiercest and most independent fighters in central europe i think jansci and the count would agree she said feelingly but they left very soon the slovaks werent really interested in fighting for something they were just interested in fighting and when things were dull they were just as happy to fight among themselves so jansci and the count came to hungary theyve been here over seven years now most of the time outside budapest and how long have you been here the same time one of the first things jansci and the count did was to come to the ukraine for us and they took my mother and me here by way of the carpathians and the high tatra i know what it must sound like but it was a wonderful journey it was high summer the sun shone they knew everybody they had friends everywhere i never saw my mother so happy yes reynolds steered her away from the topic the rest i know the count tips off whos next for the axe and jansci gets them out ive talked to dozens in england alone who were taken out by jansci the strange thing is that none of them hated the russians they all want peace jansci has talked them all into preaching for peace he even tried to talk to me i told you she said softly hes a wonderful man a minute passed in silence two minutes then she said suddenly surprisingly youre not married are you mr reynolds whats that again reynolds was startled at the sudden switch you havent a wife have you or a sweetheart or any girls at all and please dont say no and dont bother applying for the vacancy for that would be harsh and cruel and just a little cheap and i dont really think you are any of these things i never opened my mouth reynolds protested as to the question you guessed the answer anybody could women and my kind of life are mutually exclusive surely you can see that i know it she murmured i also know that two or three times this evening you have turned me away from from unpleasant subjects inhuman monsters just dont bother about that kind of thing im sorry i called you that but im glad i did for i found out i was wrong before jansci and the count did you dont know what its like for me these two theyre always right and im always wrong but this time im right before them ive no doubt you know what youre talking about reynolds began politely and cant you just see their expressions when i tell them that i sat for ten minutes tonight with mr reynolds arm around me the voice was demure with bubbling undertones of laughter you put it round me when you thought i was crying and so i was crying she admitted your wolfs clothing is getting a little threadbare mr reynolds good lord reynolds was genuinely astonished for the first time he realised that his arm lay along her shoulders he could just feel the touch of her hair on the back of his almost numbed hand he muttered some discomfited apology and was just starting to lift his arm when he froze into perfect stillness then his arm fell back slowly and tightened round her shoulder as he put his lips to her ear we have company julia he murmured he looked out of the corner of his eye and his eye confirmed what his abnormally keen ear had already told him the snow had stopped and he could clearly see three people advancing softly towards them he would have seen them a hundred feet away if his vigilance hadnt slipped for the second time that night julia had been wrong about the policemen and this time there was no escaping them that softfooted advance was her lips lightly across his cheek and hurried away into the darkness for a full minute reynolds stood looking after her long seconds after she had vanished thoughtfully rubbing his cheek then he swore softly to himself and made off in the opposite direction head bent forward and hatbrim pulled far down against the snow in his eyes when reynolds reached his room in the hotel unobserved and by way of the fireescape it was twenty minutes to ten and he was very cold and very hungry he switched on the central heating satisfied himself that no one had been in the room during his absence then called the manager on the phone there had been no message for him no callers yes he would be delighted to provide dinner even at this late hour the chef was just going to bed but would consider it an honour to show mr rakosi just what he could do in the way of an impromptu meal reynolds rather ungraciously said that speed was of the essence and that the culinary masterpieces could wait till another day he finished an excellent meal and the best part of a bottle of soproni just after eleven oclock and prepared to depart almost an hour yet to his appointment but what had taken only six or seven minutes in the counts mercedes would take far longer by foot the more so as his route would be wandering and devious he changed a damp shirt tie and socks and folded them neatly away for he did not then know that he was never to see either that room or its contents again jammed the key in the door dressed against the winter night and left once more by the fireescape as he reached the street he could hear a telephone ringing faintly insistently but he ignored it the sound could have come from a hundred rooms other than his own by the time he had arrived at the street of janscis house it was a few minutes after twelve despite the brisk pace he had kept up throughout he was halffrozen but satisfied enough for all that he was certain that he had neither been followed nor observed since he had left the hotel now if only the count still had some of that barack left the street was deserted and the garage door when he came to it was as by arrangement open he turned into the darkness of its interior without breaking step angled confidently across to the corridor door at the other end and had taken perhaps four paces when the garage was flooded with light at the touch of a switch and the iron doors clanged shut behind him reynolds stood perfectly still keeping both hands well clear of his clothes then looked slowly around him in each corner of the garage a submachinegun cradled under his arm stood a watchful smiling avo man each in his high peaked cap and long sweeping belted trenchcoat there was no mistaking these men reynolds thought dully there was no mistaking the real thing when you saw it the coarsened brutality the leering expectant sadism of the lowermost dregs of society which automatically find their ways into the secret police of communist countries the world over but it was the fifth man the little man by the corridor door with the dark thin intelligent jews face that caught and held his attention even as reynolds looked at him he put away and buttoned up his pistol took two steps forward smiled and bowed ironically captain michael reynolds of the british secret service i believe you are very punctual and we sincerely appreciate it we of the avo do not like to be kept waiting chapter six without moving without speaking reynolds stood in the middle of the floor he stood there it seemed to him for an eternity of time while his mind first of all absorbed the shock then the bitter realisation then hunted frantically for the reason for this for the presence of the avo and the absence of his friends but it was no eternity it was probably no more than fifteen seconds altogether and even as the seconds passed reynolds let his jaw fall lower and lower in shock while his eyes slowly widened in fear reynolds he whispered the word coming awkwardly with difficulty as they would to a hungarian michael reynolds i i do not know what you mean comrade what what is wrong why are these guns i swear i have done nothing comrade nothing i swear it his hands were clasped together now wringing each other till the knuckles stood white and the tremor in his voice was the quaver of fear the two guards that reynolds could see wrinkled their heavy brows and stared at each other in slow puzzled wonder but not even a shadow of doubt touched the dark amused eyes of the little jew amnesia he said kindly the shock my friend that is why you forget your own name a remarkable effort none the less and had i not known your identity beyond any doubt i too like my men here who do not yet know who you are would have been more than halfway towards belief the british espionage service do us a great compliment they send us only their best but then i would have expected nothing else but the best where the ah recovery shall we say of professor harold jennings is concerned reynolds could feel the sickness deep down in his stomach the bitter taste of despair in his mouth god this was even worse than he had feared if they knew this they knew everything it was the end of everything but the stupid fearful expression remained on his face it might have been pinned there then he shook himself a person throwing off the dark terror of a nightmare and looked wildly around him let me go let me go his voice was highpitched now almost a scream ive done nothing i tell you nothing nothing i am a good communist i am a member of the party his mouth was working uncontrollably in a strained face i am a citizen of budapest comrade i have my papers my membership cards i will show you i will show you his hand was reaching up to go inside his coat when he froze at a single word from the avo officer a softpitched word but cold and dry and cutting like the lash of a whip stop reynolds arrested his hand just at the lapels of his coat then let it fail slowly to his side the little jew smiled a pity you will not live to retire from your countrys secret service captain reynolds a pity indeed that you ever joined it i feel convinced that a notable thespian has been thereby lost to the boards and the silver screen he looked over reynolds shoulder at a man standing by the garage door coco captain reynolds was about to produce a pistol or some such offensive weapon relieve him of the temptation reynolds heard the tread of heavy boots on the concrete floor behind him then grunted in agony as a rifle butt smashed into the small of his back just above the kidney he swayed dizzily on his feet and through the red haze of pain he could feel trained hands searching his clothes could hear the little jews apologetic murmur you must excuse coco captain reynolds a singularly direct fellow in his approach to these matters always the same however experience has taught him that a sample of what misbehaviour will inevitably bring when he is searching a prisoner is much more effective than even the direst threats his voice changed subtly ah exhibit a and most interesting a belgian automatic and a silencer neither of which is obtainable in this country no doubt you found them lying in the streets and does anyone recognise this reynolds focused his eyes with difficulty the avo officer was tossing in his hand the blackjack reynolds had taken from his assailant earlier in the evening i think so i think i do colonel hidas the avo man whom his superior called coco moved into reynolds line of sight a mountain of a man reynolds could now see six foot four if an inch and built accordingly with a brokennosed seamed and brutalised face and took the blackjack almost engulfing it in his huge blackhaired paw this is herpeds colonel without a doubt see it has his initials on the base my friend herped where did you get this he snarled at reynolds i found it along with the gun reynolds said sullenly in a parcel at the corner of brody sador street and he saw the blackjack whipping across but too late to duck it smashed him back against the wall and he slipped down to the floor and pushed himself groggily to his feet in the silence he could hear the blood from his smashed lips dripping on the floor could feel teeth loose in the front of his mouth now now coco hidas spoke soothingly reprovingly give that back to me coco thank you captain reynolds you have only yourself to blame we do not know yet whether herped is cocos friend or was cocos friend he was at deaths door when he was found in that tram shelter where you left him he reached up and patted the shoulder of the scowling giant by his side do not misjudge our friend here mr reynolds he is not always thus as you can judge from his name not his own but that of a famous clown and comic of whom you have doubtless heard coco can be most amusing i assure you and i have seen him convulsing his colleagues down in the stalin street cellars with the interesting variations in his ah techniques reynolds said nothing the reference to the avo torturechambers the free hand colonel hidas was allowing this sadistic brute were neither unconnected nor accidental hidas was feeling his way shrewdly assessing reynolds reaction and resistance to this line of approach hidas was interested only in certain results to be achieved by the swiftest means and if he became convinced that brutality and violence were a waste of time with a man like reynolds he would desist and seek out more subtle methods hidas looked a dangerous man cunning and embittered but there was no sadism that reynolds could see in the dark thin features hidas beckoned to one of his men go to the bottom of the street theres a telephone there have a van come round here right away they know where we are he smiled at reynolds we could not unfortunately park it outside the front door might have aroused your suspicions eh captain reynolds he glanced at his watch the van should be here in ten minutes no more but that ten minutes can be passed profitably captain reynolds might be interested in writing and signing an account of his recent activities nonfiction of course bring him inside they brought him inside and stood him facing the desk while hidas sat behind it and adjusted the lamp so that it shone strongly into reynolds face from a distance of less than two feet we will sing captain reynolds then we will record the words of the song for a grateful posterity or at least for the peoples court a fair trial awaits you equivocation outright lies or even delay will serve you nothing a speedy confirmation of what we already know may yet spare your life we would prefer to dispense with what would inevitably become an international incident and we know everything captain reynolds everything he shook his head a man remembering and wondering who would have thought that your friend he snapped his fingers i forget his name the squat fellow with the shoulders like a barn door would have had such a beautiful singing voice he pulled a paper out from a drawer in front of him and reynolds could see that it was covered with writing a somewhat unsteady hand understandable perhaps in the circumstances but it will serve i think the judge will have little difficulty in deciphering it in spite of the deepseated tearing pain in his side and puffing agony of his smashed mouth reynolds felt a wave of elation wash over him and spat blood on the floor to conceal the expression on his face he knew now that no one had talked because the avo had caught none of them the nearest they had come to jansci and his men probably was a glimpse some informer had had of sandor working about the garage there were far too many things wrong with what hidas had said sandor reynolds was sure did not know enough to tell hidas everything he wanted to know they wouldnt have started on sandor anyway not with the girl and imre around nor was hidas the man to forget the name of any person especially a name that he had only that evening learned besides the whole idea of sandor talking under physical torture there had been time for nothing else was incomprehensible hidas reynolds reflected grimly had never been crushed in sandors grip and gazed into those gentle implacable eyes from a range of six inches reynolds stared at the document on the table then looked slowly around him if they had tried to torture sandor in that room he doubted very much whether even the walls would be still standing suppose you begin by telling us how you entered the country hidas suggested were the canals frozen mr reynolds entered the country canals reynolds voice came thick and blurred through his swollen lips and he shook his head slowly im afraid i dont know he broke off jumped sideways and twisted round in one convulsive movement a movement that sliced fresh agony through his side and back even in the relative gloom where hidas was sitting he had caught the sudden shift of eyes the tiny nod to coco and it was not until afterwards that reynolds realised that he had probably been meant to catch both cocos downward clubbing fist missed him almost completely the burred edge of a signet ring burning a thin line from temple to jaw but reynolds with the giant guard completely off balance made no mistake hidas was on his feet now his pistol showing his eyes over the tableau the other two guards moving in with carbines ready reynolds leaning heavily on one foot the other felt as if it were broken and coco rolling about the floor writhing in a silent agony then he smiled thinly you condemn yourself captain reynolds a harmless citizen of budapest would have been where the unfortunate coco now lies the savate is not taught in the schools hereabouts reynolds realised with a chill wonder that hidas had deliberately provoked the incident indifferent to the consequences to his subordinate i know all i want and i do you the compliment of realising that breaking your bones is just a waste of time stalin street for us captain reynolds and some gentler forms of persuasion three minutes later they were all inside the lorry that had just drawn up outside the garage the giant coco greyfaced and still breathing stertorously was stretched his length on one foreandaft bench seat while colonel hidas and two of the guards sat on the opposite bench with reynolds sitting on the floor between with his back to the cab the fourth avo man was in the cab with the driver the smash the grinding crash that flung all the men in the back of the lorry off their seats and catapulted one of the guards on top of reynolds came within twenty seconds of starting off just as they were rounding the first corner there was no warning not even a split second in which to prepare themselves just a squealing of brakes and tearing of metal as the trucks tyres slithered across the hardpacked snow of the street and bumped softly into the opposite kerb they were still sprawled anyhow across the floor of the truck still recovering their wits to make the first move when the doors at the back of the truck were flung open the light switched off and the suddenly darkened interior illuminated a moment afterwards by the white blinding light from a pair of powerful torches the long slender snouts of two gunbarrels gleaming evilly slid forward into the narrow arcs of the torch beams and a deep hoarsesounding voice ordered them to clasp their hands above their heads then at some low murmur from the road outside the two torches and guns moved farther apart and a man reynolds recognised him as the fourth avo man came stumbling into the pool of light followed almost at once by an unconscious form that was bundled unceremoniously on the floor then the doors slammed shut the truck engine revved furiously in reverse there came a thin screeching sound as if the truck were freeing itself from some metal obstruction and a moment later they were on their way again the whole operation hadnt taken twenty seconds from first to last and reynolds mentally saluted the highspeed smoothly functioning efficiency of a group of experts the identity of the experts he did not for a moment doubt but even so it was not until he had caught a momentary glimpse of the hand that held one of the guns a gnarled scarred hand with a curious bluishpurple mark in the middle a hand that no sooner appeared than it was snatched back again that the relief of certainty swept over him like a warm and releasing wave only then and not till then could he appreciate how tense and how keyedup he had been how steeled his every nerve and thought against the nameless horrors that awaited all the luckless beings who were ever interrogated in the cellars of stalin street the agony of his side and mouth was back again redoubled in its acuteness now that the dread of the future was removed and he could think again of the present waves of nausea swept over him he could feel the blood pounding in his dizzily swimming head and he knew that it required only the slightest deliberate relaxation of his will for the grateful oblivion of unconsciousness to sweep over him but there would come a time for that later greyfaced with the pain setting his teeth against the groan that came to his mouth he pushed away the guard who was leaning against and on top of him bent over and took his carbine away this he placed on the bench by his left and sent sliding down to the rear where an unseen hand drew it into the darkness another two carbines went the same way followed by hidas pistol his own gun reynolds retrieved from hidas tunic thrust under his coat and sat up on the bench opposite coco after a few minutes they heard the truck engine changing down and felt the truck itself braking to a stop the guns at the back of the truck poked forward a few suggestive inches and a hoarse voice warned them to keep absolute silence reynolds took out his automatic screwed on the silencer and pressed the barrel none too softly into the base of hidas neck the faint appreciative murmur from the rear reached him just as the truck ground to a halt the halt was brief a question from some unknown person a quick harsh authoritative reply tones only could be distinguished inside the back of the lorry the words were quite undistinguishable an acknowledgment the hiss of releasing air brakes and they were on their way once more reynolds leaning back in his seat with a long soundless sigh and pocketing his gun again the mark gouged out on hidas neck by his silencer was deep and red and angry it had been a tense nerveracking moment once again they came to a halt and once again reynolds automatic found the selfsame spot in the avo officers neck but the halt was this time if anything even briefer after that there were no more stops and from the gently undulating and curving nature of the road together with the lack of exhaust echo beating back from encompassing walls and buildings reynolds realised that they were clear of budapests suburbs and running into the country he forced himself to stay awake to cling grimly to the thread of consciousness and he did so by constantly shifting his gaze round the interior of the truck his eyes were now accustomed to the gloom in the rear and in the faint backwash of light he could just make out two figures with hats pulled low over their eyes sitting hunched and motionless over guns and torches that never wavered there was something almost inhuman in the intensity of that vigilance in its unflagging concentration and reynolds began to have his first inkling of how jansci and his friends had come to survive so long now and again reynolds eyes would come back to the men at his feet and he could see the uncomprehending fearful play of expression on their faces the trembling of their arms as their shoulder muscles ached from the long strain of holding their arms clasped above their heads only hidas remained immobile throughout his features composed and empty of all expression for all the mans coldblooded indifference to the suffering of others reynolds had to admit to himself that there was something admirable about him with no hint of either fear or selfpity ho accepted defeat with the same detached remoteness that characterised him in the moment of victory one of the men at the back of the truck flashed a light at his wrist a watch probably though reynolds couldnt see it at that distance then spoke a deep gruff voice muffled by the swathes of a handkerchief it could have belonged to anyone boots and shoes off all of you but one at a time place them on the right hand bench for a moment it seemed that colonel hidas was going to refuse and there was no doubt that the man had sufficient courage to do just that but the urgent jab from reynolds gun made all too apparent the uselessness of any resistance even coco now sufficiently recovered to lean on an elbow and bc himself had his boots off within thirty seconds excellent came the dry voice from the rear now the overcoats gentlemen and that will be all a pause thank you now listen carefully we are at present driving along a very quiet and deserted road and will stop soon at a tiny hut by the wayside the nearest house in any direction and im not telling you which direction is over three miles away if you try to find it tonight in the darkness in your stockinged feet you will probably be frozen before you find it and you will almost certainly have to have both feet amputated that is not a melodramatic threat but a warning if you want to find out the hard way do so by all means on the other hand the voice went on the hut is dry windproof and with a good stock of wood you can keep warm arid a passing farmers cart or truck will doubtless come your way in the morning why are you doing all this hidas voice was quiet almost bored leaving you in the middle of nowhere you mean or just sparing your worthless lives both you should guess easily enough no one knows we have an avo truck and provided youre not let loose near a telephone box no one will know until we reach the austrian frontier and this truck in itself should grant us a safe passport all the way as to your lives the question is natural enough from you those who live by the sword must expect to die by it but we are no murderers almost as the man behind the torch finished speaking the truck drew up a few seconds passed in complete silence then the crunch of feet in the snow was heard and the rear doors were flung wide reynolds caught a glimpse of two figures standing in the road outlined against the snowcovered walls of a tiny hut just behind them then at a gruff order hidas and his men filed out one of them helping a stillcrippled coco reynolds heard a faint click as the inspection hatch behind the drivers cab was opened but the face of the man peering through was only a grey blur in the gloom he looked out again through the rear of the truck saw the last of the avo men being bundled into the hut and the door shut behind them again heard a click this time as the hatch was closed and almost at once three figures piled into the back of the truck the doors slammed and the truck was under way again the light clicked on fumbling hands were busily undoing handkerchiefs that concealed their faces then reynolds heard a girls gasp of horror understandable enough reynolds thought wryly if his face looked anything like it felt but it was the count who spoke first you would appear to have fallen under a bus mr reynolds either that or spent an entertaining halfhour with our good friend coco you know him reynolds voice was hoarse and indistinct everybody in the avo knows him and half of budapest to their cost makes friends wherever he goes what happened to our vast friend incidentally he did not seem to be in his usual high spirits i hit him you hit him the count raised an eyebrow a gesture equivalent to blank astonishment in any other man even to lay a finger on coco is itself a feat but to render him hors de combat oh will you stop talking julias voice held a mixture of exasperation and distress look at his face we must do something it isnt pretty the count admitted he reached for his hip flask the universal specific tell imre to stop it was jansci speaking his voice deep and low and authorative he looked closely at reynolds who was coughing and spluttering as the fiery liquid burnt his mouth and throat and screwing tight his eyes with every cough you are badly hurt mr reynolds where reynolds told him and the count swore my apologies my boy i should have realised that damned coco come some more barack it hurts but it helps the truck stopped jansci jumped out and returned a minute later with one of the avos overcoats packed with snow womans work my dear he handed julia the coat and a handkerchief see if you cant make our friend look a bit more presentable she took the handkerchief from jansci and turned towards reynolds her touch was as gentle as her face was concerned but even so the freezing snow stung cruelly at the open cuts on cheek and lips as she washed the matted blood away and reynolds winced in spite of himself the count cleared his throat perhaps you should try the more direct method julia he suggested like when the policeman was watching you tonight in the margitsziget for almost three minutes mr reynolds she told us a lying minx reynolds tried to smile but it hurt too much thirty seconds and in selfdefence only he looked at jansci what happened tonight what went wrong you may well ask jansci said quietly what went wrong everything my boy just everything blunders everywhere by everyone by you by us by the avo the first mistake was ours you know that the house was being watched and that we had assumed that the watchers were just common informers a bad mistake on my part they were nothing of the sort they were avo and the count here recognised the two men sandor had caught as soon as he came off duty tonight and came to the house but by that time julia had gone to meet you we couldnt get word to you by her and later we decided not to bother anyway the count knows the ways of the avo as well as any man and was certain that if they were going to move in on us they wouldnt do it until the early hours of the morning thats how they invariably work we were going to leave in the middle of the night so the man who had followed julia to the white angel had probably trailed her from the house yes an efficient job of disposal on your part by the way but no more than i have come to expect but the worst mistake of the night had come earlier when you were talking to dr jennings when i was i don t understand it was as much my fault as his the count said heavily i knew i should have warned him what are you talking about reynolds demanded this jansci looked down on his hands then raised his eyes slowly did you look for microphones in his room yes i did it was behind the ventilation grille and the bathroom nothing there there was im afraid built into the shower the count says theres one in the shower in every bathroom in the three crowns none of the showers work you should have tried it in the shower oblivious of the shooting pain in his back reynolds jerked upright brushing the startled girl to one side a microphone oh my god exactly jansci said heavily then every word everything i said to the professor reynolds broke off and leaned back against the side of the truck overcome for the moment by the enormity of the implications the surely fatal blunder he had made no wonder hidas had known who he was and why he was there hidas knew everything now as far as any hope that now remained of rescuing the professor was concerned he might as well have remained in london he had suspected as much had almost known as much from what hidas had said to him in janscis garage but the confirmation that hidas knew why he knew and how he came to have proof seemed to set the final seal of inevitability and defeat on everything it is a bitter blow jansci said gently you did all you could julia murmured she brought his head forward to be sponged again and he made no resistance you are not to blame yourself a minute passed in silence while the truck bumped and jounced along the snowrutted road the pain in reynolds side and head was lessening now dulling down to a nagging throbbing ache and he was beginning to think clearly for the first time since coco had hit him the security guard will have been clamped on jennings hemay already be on his way back to russia he said to jansci i spoke to jennings of brian so the word will have already gone to stettin to try to stop him the game is lost he stopped probed two loose teeth in his lower jaw with an exploring tongue the game is lost but otherwise i dont think any great harm has been done i didnt mention the name or the activities of any person in your house although i did give the professor the address not that that makes them any the wiser they knew anyway but so far as you people personally are concerned the avo dont know you exist a couple of points trouble me yes yes first why if they were listening in the hotel didnt they nail me there and then simple almost every microphone in the place is wired to tape recorders the count grinned id have given a fortune to see their faces when they ran off that reel why didnt you phone to stop me you must have known from what julia said that the avo would come round to your place right away they did almost we got out only ten minutes before them and we did phone you but there was no reply i had left my room early reynolds remembered the ringing of the telephone bell as he had reached the bottom of the fireescape you could still have stopped me on the street we could it was jansci speaking youd better tell him count very well for a moment the count looked almost uncomfortable so unexpected an expression to find on his face that reynolds for a moment doubted he had read it correctly but he had you met my friend colonel hidas tonight the count began obliquely secondincommand of the avo a dangerous and clever man no more dangerous and clever man in all budapest a dedicated man mr reynolds who has achieved more and more remarkable success than any police officer in hungary i said he was clever hes more hes brilliant an ingenious resourceful man entirely without emotion who never gives up a man obviously for whom i have the highest respect you will observe that i was at considerable pains not to let him see me tonight even although i was disguised and that jansci was at even more pains to direct his line of thinking towards the austrian border where i assure you we have no intention of going get to the point reynolds said impatiently i have arrived for several years past our activities have been far the greatest thorn in his flesh and lately i have had just the tiniest suspicion that hidas was taking just a little too much interest in me he waved a deprecatory hand of course we officers at the avo expect to be ourselves checked and shadowed from time to time but perhaps i have become just a trifle hypersensitive about these things i thought perhaps that my trips to police blocks had not been so unobserved as i would have wished and that hidas had deliberately planted you on me to break us up he smiled slightly ignoring the astonishment on the faces of both reynolds and julia we survive by never taking a chance mr reynolds it was really too opportune a western spy so ready to hand we thought as i say you were a plant the fact that you knew or said colonel mackintosh knew that jennings was in budapest while we didnt was another point against you all the questions you asked julia tonight about us and our organisation might have been friendly interest but it might equally well have been from a more sinister reason and the policemen might have left you alone because they knew who you were not because of your ah activities in the watchmans box you never told any of this to me julias face was flushed the blue eyes cold and angry we seek said the count gallantly to shelter you from the harsher realities of this life then mr reynolds when there was no reply to our telephone call we suspected you might be elsewhere the andrassy ut for example we werent sure not by a long way but suspicious enough to take no chances so we let you walk into the spiders web i regret to say that we actually saw you walking we werent a hundred yards away lying low in the car not mine im glad to say which imre later crashed into the truck he looked regretfully at reynolds face we did not expect you to get the full treatment right away just so long as you dont expect me to go through it all again reynolds pulled at a loose tooth winced as it came out and threw it on the floor i trust youre satisfied now is that all youve got to say julia demanded her eyes hostile as they looked both at the count and jansci softened as she looked at the battered mouth after all thats been done to you what do you expect me to do reynolds asked mildly try to knock out a few of the counts teeth id have done the same in his position professional understanding my dear jansci murmured nevertheless we are extremely sorry for what has happened and the next move mr reynolds now that that tape recording will have started off the biggest manhunt for months the austrian frontier i take it with all speed the austrian frontier yes with all speed i dont know reynolds looked at the two men sitting there thought of their fantastic histories as julia had recounted them and knew there was only one possible answer to janscis question he gave another tentative wrench sighed with relief as a second tooth came clear and looked at jansci it all depends how long i take to find professor jennings ten seconds twenty half a minute passed and the only sounds were the whirr of the snow tyres on the road the low murmur from the cab of sandors and imres voices above the steady roar of the engine then the girl reached out and turned reynolds face towards her her fingertips gentle against the cut and swollen face youre mad she stared at him her eyes empty of belief you must be mad beyond all question the count unstopped his flask gulped and replaced the stopper he has been through a great deal tonight insanity jansci agreed he gazed down at his scarred hands and his voice was very soft there is no disease half so contagious and very sudden in its onset the count gazed down sadly at his hip flask the universal specific but this time i left it too late for a long moment the girl stared at the three men her face a study of bewildered incomprehension then understanding came and with it some certainty of foreknowledge some evil vision that drained all the colour from her cheeks darkened the cornflower blue of her eyes and left them filled with tears she made no protest no slightest gesture of dissent it was as if the same foreknowledge had warned her of the uselessness of dissent and as the first tears brimmed over the edge of her eyes turned away so that they could not see her face reynolds reached out a hand to comfort her hesitated caught janscis troubled eye and the slow shake of the white head nodded and withdrew his hand he drew out a pack of cigarettes placed one between his smashed lips and lit it it tasted like burnt paper chapter seven it was still dark when reynolds awoke but the first grey tinges of dawn were beginning to steal through the tiny window facing the east reynolds had known that the room had a window but until then he hadnt known where it was when they had arrived in the abandoned farmhouse last night or early that morning it had been almost two oclock after a milelong freezing trudge in the snow jansci had forbidden lights in all rooms without shutters and reynolds had been one of these he could see the whole of the room from where he lay without even moving his head it wasnt difficult the entire floor area was no more than twice that of the bed and the bed only a narrow canvas cot a chair a washbasin and a mildewed mirror and the furnishings of the room were complete there would have been no room for more the light was beginning to filter in more strongly now through the single pane of glass above the washbasin and reynolds could see in the distance perhaps a quarter of a mile away the heavily snowweighted branches of pine trees the trees must have been well downhill the feathery white tops appeared to be almost on level with his eyes the air was so clear that he could make out every tiny detail of the branches the greying sky was changing to a very pale blue hue empty of all snow and clouds the first cloudless sky indeed the first patch of blue sky he had seen at all since he had come to hungary perhaps it was a good omen he needed all the good omens he could get the wind had dropped not the slightest zephyr stirring across the great plains and the silence everywhere was profound with that frozen stillness that comes only with a subzero dawn and the snow lying deeply across the land the silence was interrupted one could not say ended for afterwards it seemed even deeper than before by a thin whiplike crack like a distant rifle shot and now that reynolds searched back through his memory he knew that was what had waked him in the first place he waited listening then after a minute or so he heard it again perhaps closer this time after even a shorter interval he heard it a third time and decided to investigate he flung back the bedclothes and swung his legs out of bed only seconds afterwards he decided not to investigate and that flinging his legs over the side of the cot without due forethought was not to be recommended with the sudden movement his back felt as if somebody had stuck in a giant hook and pulled with vicious force gently carefully he pulled his legs back into the cot and lay down with a sigh most of the trouble he thought came from the large area of stiffness that extended even up past his shoulder blades but the sudden jerking of stiffened muscles could be as agonising as any other pain the noise outside could wait no one else appeared unduly worried and even his brief contact with the outer air all he wore was a pair of borrowed pyjama trousers had convinced him that a further acquaintance should be postponed as long as possible there was no heating of any kind and the little room was bitterly cold he lay back staring at the ceiling and wondered if the count and imre had made it safely back to budapest last night after they had dropped the others it had been essential that the truck be abandoned in the anonymity of the big city just to park it in some empty lane near at hand would have invited disaster as jansci had said the hunt would be up for that truck this morning over all western hungary and no better place could be found for it than some deserted alley in a large town further it had been essential that the count return also the count was now as near certain as he could be that no suspicion had fallen on him and if they were ever to find out where dr jennings had been taken it was unlikely that the russians would risk keeping him in a hotel no matter how heavy a guard they mounted he would have to return to the avo offices where he was due on duty anyway after lunchtime there was no other way they could find out there was always an element of risk in his going there but then there always had been reynolds did not deceive himself with the finest help in the world and with jansci and the count he believed that he had just that the chances of ultimate success were still pretty poor forewarned was forearmed and the communists he thought of the tape recorder with a deep chagrin that would long remain with him had been well and truly forewarned they could block all the roads they could stop all traffic in and out of budapest they could remove the professor to the security of the remote and impregnable fortified prison or concentration camp in the country they might even ship him back to russia and over and above all that there was the keystone to the whole conjectural edifice the overriding question of what had happened to young brian jennings in stettin the baltic port reynolds was grimly aware would be combed that day as it had seldom been combed before and it required only one tiny miscalculation the slightest relaxation of vigilance by the two agents responsible for the boys safety and they had no means of knowing that the alarmcall was out that hundreds of the polish ub would be searching every hole and corner in the city for everything to be lost it was frustrating maddening to have to lie there to wait helplessly while the net closed a thousand miles away the fire in his back gradually ceased the sharp stabbing pains finally stopping altogether not so however the whiplike cracks from just outside the window they were becoming clearer and more frequent with the passing of every minute finally reynolds could restrain his curiosity no longer and moreover a wash was urgently needed on arrival that night he had just tumbled exhausted into bed and been asleep in a moment with infinite care he slowly levered his legs over the side of the bed sat on its edge pulled on the trousers of his grey suit now considerably less immaculate than when he had left london three days previously pushed himself gingerly to his feet and hirpled across to the tiny window above the washbasin an astonishing spectacle met his eyes not so much the spectacle perhaps as its central figure the man below his window no more than a youngster really looked as if he had stepped directly from the stage of some ruritanian musical comedy with his highplumed velvet hat long flowing cloak of yellow blanket cloth and magnificently embroidered high boots fitted with gleaming silver spurs all so sharply limned against and emphasised by the dazzling white background of snow he was a colourful figure indeed in that drab grey communist country colourful even to the point of the bizarre his pastime was no less singular than his appearance in his gauntleted hand he held the greyhorned stock of a long thin whip and even as reynolds watched he flicked his wrist with casual ease and a cork lying on the snow fifteen feet away jumped ten feet to one side with the next flick it jumped back to exactly where it had lain before a dozen times this was repeated and not once did reynolds see the whip touch the cork or go anywhere near the cork the lash was too fast for his eyes to follow the youngsters accuracy was fantastic his concentration absolute reynolds too became absorbed in the performance so absorbed that he failed to hear the door behind him open softly but he heard the startled oh and swung round away from the window the sudden jerk screwing up his face as the pain knifed sharply across his back im sorry julia was confused i didnt know reynolds cut her off with a grin come in its all right im quite respectable besides you ought to know that we agents are accustomed to entertaining all sorts of feminine company in our bedrooms he glanced at the tray she had laid on his bed sustenance for the invalid very kind of you more of an invalid than hell admit she was dressed in a belted blue woollen dress with white at the wrists and throat her golden hair had been brushed till it gleamed and her face and eyes looked as if they had just been washed in the snow her fingertips as they touched the tender swelling on his back were as fresh and cool as her appearance he heard the quick indrawn breath we must get a doctor mr reynolds red blue purple every colour you could think of you cant leave this as it is it looks terrible she turned him round gently and looked up at his unshaven face you should go back to bed it hurts badly doesnt it only when i laugh as the bloke said with the harpoon through his middle he moved back from the washbasin and nodded through the window whos the circus artist i dont have to look she laughed li can hear him thats the cossack one of my fathers men the cossack thats what he calls himself his real name is alexander moritz he thinks we dont know that but my father knows everything about him the same way he knows everything about nearly everybody he thinks alexander is a sissys name so he calls himself the cossack hes only eighteen whats the comic opera getup for insular ignorance she reproved nothing comic about it our cossack is a genuine csikos a cowboy you would say from the puszta the prairie land to the east round debrecen and thats exactly how they dress even to the whip the cossack represents another side to janscis activities that you havent heard of yet feeding starving people her voice was quiet now when winter comes mr reynolds many people of hungary starve the government takes away far too much meat and potatoes from the farms they have to meet terribly high surrender quotas and its worst of all in the wheat areas where the government takes all it was so bad at one time that the people of budapest were actually sending bread to the country and jansci feeds these hungry people he decides from which government farm the cattle shall be taken and where theyll be taken the cossack takes them there he was across the border only last night just as simple as that it is for the cossack he has a strange gift for handling cattle most of them come from czechoslovakia the border is only twenty kilometres from here the cossack just diloroforms them or gives them a good drink of bran mash laced with cheap brandy when hes got them halfdrunk or halfanaesthetised he just walks across the border with them with as little trouble as you or i would cross a street pity you cant handle humans the same way reynolds said dryly thats what the cossack wants to help jansci and the count with people i mean not chloroform them he will soon she lost interest in the cossack gazed unseeingly out of the window for some moments then looked up at reynolds the remarkable blue eyes grave and still she said tentatively mr reynolds i reynolds knew what was coming and hastened to forestall her it had needed no perspicuity last night to see that her acceptance of their decision not to give up the search for jennings was a token one and only for the moment he had been waiting for this for the inevitable appeal had known it was in her mind from the moment she had entered the room try michael he suggested i find it difficult to be formal and stand on my dignity with my shirt off michael she said the name slowly pronouncing it meeehail mike ill murder you he threatened very well michael meechail he mimicked and smiled down at her you were going to say something for a moment the darkeyes and the blue ones met and held mute understanding the girl knew the answer to her question without ever having to ask it and the slender shoulders drooped fractionally in defeat as she turned away nething the life had gone out of her voice ill see about a doctor jansci says to be down in twenty minutes good lord yes reynolds exclaimed the broadcast id forgotten all about it thats something anyway she smiled faintly and closed the door behind her jansci rose slowly to his feet turned off the radio and looked down at reynolds it is bad you think its bad enough reynolds stirred in his chair to try to ease his aching back even the effort of washing dressing and coming downstairs had taken more out of him than he cared to admit and the pain was constant now the callout word was definitely promised for today perhaps they have arrived in sweden and havent yet been able to get word through to your people jansci suggested im afraid not reynolds had banked heavily on the callword coming through that morning and the disappointment ran deep everything was laid on for that a contact from the consuls office at halsingborg is waiting all the time ah so but if these agents are as good as you said they were they may have become suspicious and are lying low in stettin for a day or two till how do you say the heat is off what else can we hope for my god to think i should have fallen for that mike in the shower he said bitterly whats to be done now nothing except possess our souls in patience jansci counselled us that is for you bed and no arguments ive seen too much sickness not to know a sick man when i see one the doctor has been sent for a friend of mine for years he smiled seeing the question in reynolds face we can trust him completely the doctor came up to reynolds room with jansci twenty minutes later a big burly redfaced man with a clipped moustache he had the professionally cheerful voice that invariably made patients suspect the worst and radiated a magnificent selfconfidence in fact reynolds thought dryly he was very much like doctors the world over like many doctors also he was a man of strong opinions and not unduly backward about expressing them he roundly cursed those damned communists half a dozen times within the first minute of entering the room how have you managed to survive so long reynolds smiled i mean if you express your opinions tchah everybody knows what i think of these damned communists darent touch us quacks my boy indispensable especially the good ones he clamped a stethoscope to his ears not that im any damned good the whole trick lies in making them think you are the doctor did himself considerably less than justice the examination was skilled thorough and swift youll live he announced probably some internal haemorrhaging but very slight considerable inflammation and really magnificent bruising a pillowcase jansci if you please the effectiveness of this remedy he continued is in direct proportion to the pain it inflicts youll probably go through the roof but youll be better tomorrow he spooned a liberal amount of greyish paste on to the pillowcase and spread it evenly a form of horse liniment he explained centuries old recipe use it everywhere not only do patients have trust in the doctor that sticks to the good oldfashioned remedies but it also enables me to dispense with the tedious and laborious necessity of keeping abreast of all the latest developments besides its just about all these damned communists have left us reynolds winced as the liniment burnt in through his skin and he could feel the sweat coming to his brow the doctor seemed pleased what did i tell you fit as a fiddle tomorrow just swallow a couple of these white tablets my boy theyll ease the pain internally and the blue one make you sleep if you dont youll have that poultice off in ten minutes quickacting i assure you they were indeed and reynolds last conscious recollection was of hearing the doctor loudly declaiming against those damned communists as he went down the stairs after that he remembered nothing more for almost twelve hours when he awoke night had come again but this time his window had been curtained and a small oil lamp was burning he awoke quickly and completely as he had long trained himself to do without movement or change in his rate of breathing and his eyes were on julias face a face with an expression he had not seen on it before for a full second she was aware he was awake and looking at her he could see the dull colour touching throat and face as she slowly withdrew from his shoulder the hand that had been shaking him awake but he twisted his wrist and glanced at his watch a man who had observed nothing unusual eight oclock he sat up abruptly in bed and it was only after he had done so that he remembered the agony that had followed the last precipitate move he had made the surprise on his face was obvious how does it feel she smiled better isnt it better its miraculous his back felt almost as if it were on fire but the pain was quite gone eight oclock he repeated incredulously ive been asleep for twelve hours you have indeed even your face looks better her composure was back again the evening meal is ready shall i bring it up ill be down in a couple of minutes reynolds promised he was as good as his word a cheerful wood fire was burning in the small kitchen and the table set for five was over against the fire sandor and jansci greeted him were pleased to hear of the progress made in his recovery and introduced him to the cossack the cossack shook hands briefly nodded scowled sat down to his bread soup and said nothing not a word throughout the course of the meal he kept his head lowered all the time so that though reynolds had an excellent view of his thick black magyar hair brushed straight back from the forehead it was not until the cossack rose with his last mouthful and left with a muttered word to jansci that reynolds caught his first sight of the open goodlooking boyish face with its illconcealed expression of truculence that the expression was meant for him reynolds was left in no doubt seconds after the door was slammed they heard the roar of what seemed to be a powerful motorcycle that swept past the house and faded swiftly away in the distance soon to be lost in silence reynolds looked round the others at table will somebody please tell me what im supposed to have done your young friend just tried to incinerate me by will power alone he looked at jansci but jansci was having trouble in getting his pipe to light sandor was staring into the fire lost apparently in his own thoughts when the explanation finally came it came from julia her voice edged with an irritation and annoyance so foreign to her that reynolds glanced at her in surprise very well if these two cowards wont tell you it seems i must the only thing about you that annoys the cossack is the fact that youre here at all you see he well he fancies hes in love with me me six years older than he is whats six years after all reynolds began judicially if you oh do be quiet then one night he got hold of the remains of a bottle of szilvorium the count had left lying around and he told me i was surprised and confused but hes such a nice boy and i was wanting to be kind so like a fool i said something about waiting until he was grown up he was furious reynolds wrinkled his brow what has all this dont be so dense he thinks you are a well a rival for my affections may the best man win reynolds said solemnly jansci choked on his pipe sandor covered his face with one massive hand and the stony silence from the head of the table made reynolds think that he himself had better look elsewhere but the silence stretched out he felt compelled to look eventually and when he did so he found neither the anger nor the blushing confusion he had expected but a composed julia chin on hand regarding him with a thoughtfulness and just possibly the faintest trace of mockery that he found vaguely disquieting not for the first time he had to remind himself that underestimating the daughter of such a man as jansci might be foolish in the extreme finally she rose to clear away the dishes and reynolds turned to jansci i take it that was the cossack we heard departing where has he gone budapest he has a rendezvous with the count on the outskirts of the town what on a big powerful motorbike you can hear miles away and in those clothes that can be seen from about the same distance a small motorbike only the cossack removed the silencer some time ago because not enough people could hear him coming he has the vanity of extreme youth but the loudness of both machine and clothes is his surest safeguard he is so conspicuous that no one would ever dream of suspecting him how long on good roads hed be there and back in just over half an hour were only about kilometres from the town but tonight jansci thought perhaps an hour and a half it took in fact two hours two of the most unforgettable hours reynolds had ever spent jansci talked nearly all the time and reynolds listened with the intentness of a man aware that he was being accorded a rare privilege which might never come his way again the mood of expansiveness reynolds divined came seldom to this man so much the most remarkable the most extraordinary man reynolds had ever met in a chequered and dangerous lifetime that all others with the possible exception of janscis alter ego the count seemed to fade away into insignificance and for two unbroken hours julia sat on a cushion by his side the mischief and laughter that were never long absent from her eyes were gone as if they had never been and she was grave and unsmiling as reynolds had imagined she could never be during these hours her eyes left her fathers face hardly at all and even then only to gaze at the scarred and shattered ruins that were janscis hands before seeking his face again it was as if she too shared reynolds irrational presentiment that this privilege would never come her way again as if she were seeking to memorise every detail of her fathers face and bands so that she would never forget them and reynolds remembering the strange fey look in her eyes in the truck the previous night felt queerly unaccountably cold it cost him almost physical effort to shake off this abnormal feeling to dismiss from his mind what he knew could only be the first tentative stirrings of superstitious nonsense jansci spoke of himself not at all and of his organisation and its method of operation only where necessary the only concrete fact that reynolds gathered in the course of the evening was that his hq was not here but in a farmhouse that lay in the low hills between szombathely and the neusiedler see not far from the austrian frontier the only frontier of any interest to the great majority of those escaping to the west he talked instead of people hundreds of people whom he and the count and sandor had helped to safety of their hopes and fears and terrors of this world he talked of peace of his hope for the world of his conviction that that peace would ultimately come for the world if only one good man in a thousand worked for it of the folly of imagining that there was anything else in the world worth working for not even the ultimate peace for that could only come from this he spoke of communists and noncommunists and of the distinctions between them that existed only in the tiny minds of men of the intolerance and the infinite littleness of minds that knew beyond question that all men were inescapably different by virtue of their birtihs and beliefs their creeds and religions and that the god who said that every man was the brother of the next man was really a pretty poor judge of these things he spoke of the tragedies of the various creeds that knew beyond doubt that theirs was the only way that was the right way of the religious sects that usurped the gates of heaven against all comers of the tragedy of his own russian people who were perfectly willing to let others do this for there were no gates anyway jansci was wandering not arguing and he drifted from his own people to his youth amongst them the transition seemed pointless inconsequential at first but jansci was not an aimless wanderer almost everything he did or said or thought was concerned with reinforcing and consolidating both in himself and all his listeners his almost obsessive faith in the oneness of humanity when he spoke of his boyhood and young manhood in his own country it could have been any person of any creed remembering with a fond nostalgia the happiest hours of a happy land the picture he painted of the ukraine was one touched perhaps with the sentimentality felt for that which is irrecoverably lost but none the less reynolds felt it to be a true picture for the sadly remembered gladness in those tired and gentle eyes could never have arisen from selfdeception however unaware jansci did not deny the hardships of the life the long hours in the fields the occasional famines the burning heat of summer and the bitter cold when the siberian wind blew across the steppes but it was essentially a picture of a happy land a golden land untouched by fear or repression a picture of far horizons with the golden wheat waving into the blurred and purpling distance a picture of laughter and singing and dancing of jingling horsedrawn furcollared troika rides under the frozen stars of a steamboat drifting gently down the dnieper in the warmth of a summers night and the soft music dying away across the water and it was then when jansci was talking wistfully of the nighttime scents of honeysuckle and wheat of jasmine and newmown hay drifting across the river that julia rose quickly to her feet murmuring something about coffee and hurried from the room reynolds caught only a glimpse of her face as she went but he saw her eyes were dimmed with tears the spell was broken but somehow a trace of its magic lingered on reynolds was under no illusion for all his apparently aimless generalisations jansci had been talking directly to him trying to undermine beliefs and prejudices trying to make him see the glaringly tragic contrasts between the happy people whose portrait he had just drawn and the sinister apostles of world revolution making him question whether so complete reversal lay within the bounds of credulity or even possibility and it had been no accident reynolds thought wryly that the first part of janscis rambling had been devoted to the intolerance and wilful blindness of humanity at large jansci had deliberately intended that reynolds should see in himself a microcosm of that humanity and reynolds was uncomfortably aware that he had not entirely failed he did not like the unsettling questioning halfdoubts that were beginning to trouble him and pushed them deliberately aside for all his old friendship with jansci colonel mackintosh reynolds thought grimly would not have approved of tonights performance colonel mackintosh did not like to have his agents unsettled they were to keep their thoughts on the ultimate objective the job on hand and only the job on hand and not concern themselves with side issues side issues reynolds thought incredulously then pushed the matter from his mind jansci and sandor were talking now in low friendly tones and as he listened reynolds realised that he had misjudged the relationship between these two men there was nothing of the master and the man the employer and the employed about it the atmosphere was too easy too informal for that and jansci listened as carefully and considerately to what sandor had to say as sandor did to him there was a bond between them reynolds realised unseen but no less powerful for that the bond of a devotion to a common ideal a devotion which on sandors side made no distinction between the ideal and the man who was the inspiration of it jansci reynolds was slowly beginning to discover had the unconscious gift of inspiring a loyalty which barely stopped this side of idolatry and even reynolds himself uncompromising individualist that nature and training had inescapably made him could feel the magnetism of its subtle pull it was exactly eleven oclock when the door was flung open and the cossack strode in bringing with him a snowladen flurry of freezing air dropped a large paper parcel in one corner and clapped his gauntlets vigorously together his face and hands were blue with cold but he affected to be unaware of it not even seeking the warmth of the fire instead he sat at the table lit a cigarette rolled it into the corner of his mouth and let it stay there reynolds noted with amusement that though the smoke laced upward and brought tears to one eye the cossack made no attempt to remove it there he had placed it and there it would stay his report was brief and to the point he had met the count as arranged jennings was no longer in his hotel and already a precautionary rumour was circulating to the effect that he was unwell the count did not know where he was he certainly had not been removed to the avo hq or any of their known centres in budapest he had either been taken directly back to russia the count thought or to some place of safety outside the city he would try to find out where but he had little hope the count the cossack said was almost certain that they would not be taking him directly home he was much too important a figure at the conference they were probably hiding him in a place of absolute security until they heard from stettin and if brian was still there the russians would still let him participate in the conference after letting him hear his son on the phone but if jennings son had escaped then jennings himself would almost certainly be immediately removed to russia budapest was too near the frontier and the russians couldnt afford the incalculable prestige loss of having him escape and there was one other extremely disquieting bit of information imre had disappeared and the count could not find him anywhere the day that followed an interminable wonderful sunday with an azure cloudless windless sky and a dazzling white sun turning the undulating plains and heavyladen pines into an impossibly lovely christmas card was never afterwards clear in reynolds mind it was as if everything that day had been seen through a haze or in a dimly remembered dream it was almost as if it had been a day lived by someone else so remote it was so detached from all reality whenever he later tried to recall it and it wasnt because of his health the injuries he had received that all this was so the doctor had claimed no more than the truth for the effectiveness of his liniment and though reynolds back was still stiff the pain had gone his mouth and jaw too were healing fast with only an occasional throb to remind him of where his teeth had been before he had ran foul of the giant coco he knew himself and admitted to himself that it all stemmed from the tearing anxiety in his mind a savage restlessness that would not let him be still a moment but led him to pacing through the house and over the hard frozen snow outside the house until even the phlegmatic sandor begged him to take a rest once again that morning they had listened to the bbc oclock broadcast and once again the message had failed to come through brian jennings had failed to arrive in sweden and reynolds knew that there could be little hope left but he had been on missions before that had ended in failure and the failure had never troubled him what troubled him was jansci for he knew that that gentle man having given his promise of help meant to carry it out at all costs even although he must have known more clearly even than reynolds himself just what the cost of trying to rescue the mostheavily guarded man in communist hungary must almost inevitably be and then beyond that again he knew that his worry wasnt solely on janscis behalf deep as was his admiration and respect for the man it wasnt even mainly on his behalf it was on account of his daughter who worshipped her father and would be brokenhearted and inconsolable at the loss of the last member of her family left alive and worst still she would regard him as the sole instrument of her fathers death the barrier between them would for ever remain and reynolds looking for the hundredth time at the smiling curve of the mouth and the grave troubled eyes above that belied the smile realised with a slow wonder and a profound sense of shock that was what he feared above all they were together much of the day and reynolds came to love the slow smile and the outlandish way she pronounced his name but once when she said meechail and smiled with her eyes as well as her lips he had been brusque to her even rude and he had seen the uncomprehending hurt in her eyes as the smile faded and vanished and he himself had felt sick to his heart and more confused than he had been all day reynolds could only feel profoundly thankful that colonel mackintosh could not see just then the man whom he regarded as the person most likely to succeed himself some day but the colonel probably wouldnt have believed it anyway the interminable day wheeled slowly to its close the sun setting over the distant hills to the west burnished the snow capped pine tops with a brush of flame and gold and darkness fell swiftly over the land as the stars stood white in the frozen sky the evening meal came and went almost in complete silence then jansci and reynolds tried on and altered with julias help the contents of the parcel the cossack had brought home the previous night a couple of avo uniforms there had been no question of the counts gambling that these might prove useful when he had sent them no matter where old jennings was they would be essential they were the open sesame to every door in hungary and they could only be for jansci and reynolds no uniform reynolds had ever seen could have stretched across sandors shoulders the cossack departed on his motorbicycle shortly after nine oclock he departed dressed in his usual flamboyant clothes a cigarette over each ear and another unlit in the corner of his mouth and in high good humour he could not have failed to observe the strain between reynolds and julia during the course of the evening and had reason for his cheerful smile he should have been back by eleven oclock by midnight at the latest midnight came and went but there was no sign of the cossack one oclock struck half past one anxiety had changed to tension and almost despair when he made his appearance a few moments before two oclock he arrived not on his motorbike but at the wheel of a big grey opel kapitan braked stopped the engine and climbed out with the unconcerned indifference of one who was accustomed to this sort of thing to the point of boredom it was not until later that they discovered that this was the first time in his life that the cossack had ever driven a car a fact which wholly accounted for his delay in arrival the cossack brought with him good news bad news papers and instructions the good news was that the count had discovered jennings whereabouts with almost ridiculous ease furmint the chief of the avo had told him personally in the course of conversation the bad news was twofold the place where the professor had been taken was the notorious szarhaza prison about kilometres south of budapest considered the most impregnable fortress in hungary and generally reserved for such enemies of the state as were destined never to be seen again but the count himself unfortunately could not help them colonel hidas himself had personally put him in charge of a loyalty investigation in the town of godollo where disaffected elements had been giving trouble for some time also on the debit account was the fact that imre was still missing the count feared that his nerve had gone altogether and that he had run out on them the count the cossack said regretted that he could provide them with practically no detail at all of the szarhaza as he himself had never been there his sphere of operations being limited to budapest and northwest hungary the internal geography and routine of the prison the count had added were unimportant anyway only complete and brazen bluff could hope to serve their purposes hence the papers the papers were for jansci and reynolds and masterpieces of their kind complete avo identity cards for both and a document on the allam vedelmi hatosags own headed unreproduceable notepaper signed by fermint and countersigned by a cabinet minister with the appropriate and correct stamps for each office authorising the commandant of the szarhaza prison to hand over professor harold jennings to the bearers of the document it was the counts suggestion that should the rescue of the professor still be on the cards they stood a fair chance no higher authority could be produced for the release of a prisoner than the document he had provided and the idea of anyone willingly penetrating the walls of the dreaded szarhaza was so fantastic as to be beyond sane contemplation it was the counts further suggestion that the cossack and sandor should accompany them as far as the inn of petoli a small village about five miles north of the prison and wait there by the telephone that way all members of the organisation could keep in touch with each other and to complete a magnificent days work the count had provided the essential transport he had omitted to say where he had obtained it reynolds shook his head in wonder the mans a marvel heaven only knows how he managed to do all this in one day youd think theyd given him a holiday just to concentrate on our business he gazed at jansci his face carefully empty of expression what do you think we will go in jansci said quietly he was looking at reynolds but reynolds knew he was talking to julia if there is any hope left of good news from sweden we will go in he is an old man and its inhuman that he should die so far from his wife and from his homeland if we did not go in he broke off and smiled you know what the good lord or maybe i would only get the length of st peter do you know what st peter would say to me hed say jansci we have no place for you here you cannot expect kindness and mercy from us what kindness and mercy had you in your heart for harold jennings reynolds looked at him and thought of the man he had revealed himself to be last night a man to whom compassion in and for his fellow man and a belief in an allembracing supernatural compassion were the keystones of existence and knew that he lied he glanced at julia and saw the smile of understanding on her face then he saw below the shadowing hand and knew that she too had not been deceived for her eyes were dark and stricken and numb the conference in paris ends this evening when an official statement will be issued it is expected that the foreign minister will fly home tonight i beg your pardon that should read tomorrow night and report to the cabinet it is not yet known the announcers voice trailed away into silence and died away altogether as the radio switch clicked off and for a long moment no one looked at each other it was julia who finally broke the silence her voice unnaturally calm and matteroffact well thats it isnt it thats the password thats been so long in coming tonight tomorrow night the boy is free hes safe in sweden you had better go at once yes reynolds rose to his feet he felt none of the relief none of the elation that he had expected now that the green light had been given them at last just a numbness such as he had seen in julias eyes that night and a strange heaviness of heart if we know the communists are bound to know by this time also he may be leaving for russia at any hour we have no time to waste indeed we havent jansci pulled on his greatcoat like reynolds he was already dressed in his borrowed uniform and pulled his military gauntlets on please dont worry about us my dear just be at our hq twentyfour hours from now and dont go through budapest he kissed her and went out into the dark bitter morning reynolds hesitated halfturned towards her saw her avert her head and stare into the fire and left without a word as he climbed into the back seat of the opel he caught a glimpse of the cossacks face following him into the car he was beaming from ear to ear three hours later under a dark and lowering sky heavy with its burden of unshed snow sandor and the cossack were dropped at the roadside not far from the poteli inn the journey had been completely uneventful and although they had been prepared for roadblocks there had been none the communists were very sure of themselves they had no reason to be anything else ten minutes later the great grey forbidding mass of the szarhaza came into sight an old impregnably walled building surrounded now by three concentric rings of barbed wire with ploughed earth between the wire no doubt electrified and the earth heavily sown with fragmentation mines the inner and outer rings were dotted with manned machinegun towers raised high on wooden stilts and gazing at it for the first time reynolds felt the first touch of fear the realisation of the madness of what they were doing jansci might well have divined his feelings for he made no comment increased speed over the last halfmile and skidded to a stop outside the great arched gateway one of the guards came rushing forward gun in hand demanding to know their identity and see their papers but stepped back respectfully as jansci emerged in his avo uniform froze him with a single contemptuous glance and demanded to see the commandant it spoke well for the terror inspired by that uniform even among those who had no reasonable cause to fear it that jansci and reynolds were inside the commandants office in five minutes time the commandant was the last kind of person reynolds would have expected to see in that position he was a tall slightly stooped man in a wellcut dark suit with a highdomed thin intellectual face he wore a pincenez had lean capable hands and looked to reynolds more like an outstanding surgeon or scientist in point of fact he was both and reckoned the greatest expert on psychological and physiological breakdown procedures outside the soviet union he had no suspicions as to their genuineness reynolds could see he offered them a drink smiled when they refused it gestured them to a seat and took the release paper that jansci handed him hm no doubt about the validity of this document is there gentlemen gentlemen reynolds noted a man had to be very sure of himself before he used that word in place of the ubiquitous comrade i have been expecting this from my good friend furmint after all the conference opens today does it not we cannot afford to have professor jennings absent the brightest jewel in our crown if one may use a somewhat ah outmoded expression you have your own papers gentlemen naturally jansci produced his reynolds did the same and the commandant nodded apparently satisfied he looked at jansci then nodded at his phone you know of course that i have a direct line into the andrassy ut i can take no chances with a prisoner of jennings ah magnitude you will not be offended if i phone for confirmation of this release and of your identity papers reynolds felt his heart miss a beat felt the skin on his face tighten till it seemed like waxed paper god how could they possibly have overlooked so obvious a precaution their pistols there was only the one chance their pistols the commandant as hostage his hand was actually beginning to move when jansci spoke his voice magnificent in its assured confidence his face unclouded by the slightest trace of worry but of course commandant a prisoner of jennings importance we should have expected nothing else in that case there is no need the commandant smiled pushing the papers across the desk and reynolds could feel every stiffened muscle in his body relax as relief poured over him flooded him like a great wave he was beginning to realise just vaguely realise what manner of man jansci really was in comparison he himself had not yet started to learn the commandant reached for a sheet of paper scribbled on it and stamped it with an official seal he rang a bell handed it to a warder and dismissed the man with a wave of his hand three minutes gentlemen no more he is not far from here but the commandant overestimated it was not three minutes it was less than thirty seconds before the door opened and it opened to admit not jennings but half a dozen armed swiftmoving guards who had jansci and reynolds pinned helplessly to their seats before they had recovered from their state of lulled security and could properly begin to realise what was happening the commandant shook his head and smiled sadly forgive me gentlemen a subterfuge i fear unpleasant as are all subterfuges but essential that document i signed was not for the professors release but your arrest he took off his pincenez polished them and sighed captain reynolds you are an uncommonly persistent young man chapter eight reynolds in those first few minutes of shock was conscious of nothing but the entire absence of all emotion of all feeling as if the touch of the metal fetters on his wrists and ankles had somehow deprived him of all capacity to react but then came the first slow wave of numbed disbelief then the shocked disbelief and chagrin that this should have happened to him again then the bitter intolerable realisation that they had been effortlessly and absolutely trapped that the commandant had been toying with them and had deceived them completely that they were prisoners now within the dreaded szarhaza and that if they ever emerged they would do so only as unrecognisable zombies as the broken empty husks of the men they had once been he looked across at jansci to see how the older man was taking this crushing blow the final defeat of all their plans the virtual sentence of death on themselves to see what his reaction was as far as he could judge jansci wasnt reacting at all his face was quiet and he was looking at the commandant with a thoughtful measuring gaze a gaze reynolds thought curiously like the one with which the commandant was regarding jansci as the last metal shackle clipped home around a chair leg the leader of the guards looked questioningly at the commandant the latter waved a hand in dismissal they are secure completely very well then you may go the guard hesitated they are dangerous men i am aware of that the commandant said patiently why else do you think i deemed it necessary to summon so many to secure them but they are shackled to chairs that are bolted to the floor it is unlikely that they will merely evaporate he waited until the door had closed steepled his thin fingers and went on in his quiet precise voice this gentlemen is the moment if ever there was a moment for gloating a selfconfessed british spy that recording mr reynolds will create an international sensation in the peoples court and the redoubtable leader of the best organised escape group and anticommunist ring in hungary both in one fell swoop we shall however dispense with the gloating it is useless and timewasting a fit pastime only for morons and imbeciles he smiled faintly speaking of such it is incidentally a pleasure to deal with intelligent men who accept the inevitable and who are sufficiently realistic to dispense with the customary breastbeating lamentations denials and outraged expostulations of innocence nor do theatricalism prolonged climaxes the creation of suspense or unnecessary secrecy interest me he continued time is the most valuable gift we have and its waste an unforgivable crime your first thoughts naturally mr reynolds be so good as to follow your friends example and refrain from doing yourself an unnecessary injury in testing these shackles your first thought i say is how has it come about that you find yourself in this melancholy position there is no reason why you should not know and at once he looked at jansci regret to inform you that your brilliantly gifted and quite incredibly courageous friend who has been masquerading so long and with such fantastic success as a major in the allam vedelmi hatosag has finally betrayed you there was a long moments silence reynolds looked expressionlessly at the commandant then at jansci janscis face was quite composed that is always possible he paused inadvertently of course completely so it was the commandant nodded colonel josef hidas whose acquaintance captain reynolds here has already made has had a feeling he could call it no more than that it was not even a suspicion about major howarth for some little time it was the first time reynolds heard the name by which the count was known to the avo yesterday the feeling became suspicion and certainty and he and my good friend furmint prepared a trap baited with the name of this prison and convenient access to furmints room for a length of time sufficient to secure certain documents and stamps these now on the table before me for all his undoubted genius your friend walked into the trap we are all human he is dead alive in the best of health and as yet in blissful ignorance of what is known he was despatched on a wild goose chase to keep him out of the way during the course of today i believe that colonel hidas wishes to make the arrest personally i expect him here this morning later in the day howarth will be seized given a midnight courtmartial at the andrassy ut and executed but not i fear summarily of course jansci nodded heavily with every avo officer and man in the city present he will die only a little at a time so that no one else will be tempted to emulate him the fools the blind imbecilic fools do they not know that there can never be another im afraid i agree with you but it is no direct concern of mine your name my friend jansci will serve for the moment he removed his pincenez and tapped them thoughtfully on the table tell me jansci what do you know of us members of the political police of our composition i mean you tell me it is obvious that you wish to yes ill tell you though i think you must already know of our members all but a negligible fraction are composed of powerseekers morons who find our service intellectually undemanding the inevitable sadists whose very nature bans them from all normal civilian employment the longtime professionals the very people who dragged screaming citizens from their beds in the service of the gestapo are still doing precisely the same thing for us and those with a corroding grievance against society of the last category colonel hidas a jew whose people have suffered in central europe agonies beyond all imagining is the prime example in the avo today there are also of course those who believe in communism a tiny minority only but nevertheless certainly the most feared and dangerous of all inasmuch as they are automatons pervaded by the whole idea of the state with their own moral judgements either in a state of permanent suspension or completely atrophied furmiat is one such so also strangely enough is hidas you must be terribly sure of yourself reynolds was speaking for the first time slowly he is the commandant of the szarhaza prison janscis words were answer enough why do you tell us this did you not say waste of time was abhorrent to you it still is i assure you let me continue when it comes to the delicate question of gaining anothers confidence all the various categories in the list i have given you have one thing in common with the exception of hidas they are all victims of the idee fixe of the hidebound conservatism and somewhat biased dogmatism of their unshakable convictions that the way to a mans heart spare us the fancy phrases reynolds growled what you mean is if they want the truth from a man they batter it out of him crude but admirably brief the commandant murmured a valuable lesson in timesaving to continue in the same curt fashion i have been entrusted with the task of gaining your confidence gentlemen to be precise a confession from captain reynolds and from jansci his true name and the extent and modus operandi of his organisation you know yourselves the almost invariable methods as practised by the ah colleagues i have mentioned the whitewashed walls the brilliant lights the endless repetitive triphammering questions all judiciously interspersed with kidneybeatings teeth and nail extractions thumbscrews and all the other revolting appurtenances and techniques of the medieval torture chamber revolting jansci murmured to me yes as an exprofessor of nerve surgery in budapests university and leading hospitals the whole medieval conception of interrogation is intensely distasteful to be honest interrogation of any kind is distasteful but i have found in this prison unsurpassed opportunities for observation of nervous disorders and for probing more deeply than ever before possible into the intensely complicated workings of the human nervous system for the moment i may be reviled future generations may differ in their appraisal i am not the only medical man in charge of prisons or prison camps i assure you we are extremely useful to the authorities they are no less so to us he paused then smiled almost diffidently forgive me gentlemen my enthusiasm for my work at times quite carries me away to the point you have information to give and it will not be extracted by medieval methods from colonel hidas i have already learnt that captain reynolds reacts violently to suffering and is likely to prove difficult to a degree as for you he looked slowly at jansci i do not think i have ever seen in any human face the shadows of so many sufferings suffering for you can now itself be only a shadow i have no wish to flatter when i say that i cannot conceive of a physical torture which could even begin to break you he sat back lit a long thin cigarette and looked at them speculatively after the lapse of over two minutes he leaned forward again well gentlemen shall i call a stenographer whatever you wish jansci said courteously but it would grieve us to think of wasting any more of your time than we have already done i expected no other answer he pressed a switch talked rapidly into a boxed microphone then leant back you will of course have heard of pavlov the russian medical psychologist the patron saint of the avo i believe jansci murmured alas there are no saints in our marxist philosophy one to which i regret to say pavlov did not subscribe but you are right insofar as your meaning goes a bungler a crude pioneer in many ways but nevertheless one to whom the more advanced of us ah interrogators owe a considerable debt and we know all about pavlov and his dogs and his conditioning and breakdown processes reynolds said roughly this is the szarhaza prison not the university of budapest spare us the lecture on the history of brainwashing for the first time the commandants studied calm cracked a flush touched the high cheekbones but he was immediately under control again you are right of course captain reynolds one requires a certain shall we say philosophical detachment to appreciate but there i go again i merely wished to say that with the combination of the very advanced developments we have made of pavlovs physiological techniques and certain ah psychological processes that will become apparent to you in the course of time we can achieve quite incredible results there was something about the mans detached enthusiasm that was chilling frightening we can break any human being who ever lived and break him so that never a scar shows with the exception of the incurably insane who are already broken there are no exceptions your stiffupperlipped englishman of fiction and for all i know fact will break eventually like everyone else the efforts of the americans to train their servicemen to resist what the western world so crudely calls brainwashing let us call it rather a reintegration of personality are as pathetic as they are hopeless we broke cardinal mindszenty in eightyfour hours we can break anyone he stopped speaking as three men whitecoated and carrying a flask cups and a small metal box entered the room and waited until they had poured out two cups of what was indubitably coffee my assistants gentlemen excuse the white coats a crude psychological touch which we find effective with a large majority of our ah patients coffee gentlemen drink it ill be damned if i will reynolds said coldly you will have to undergo the indignity of noseclips and a forcible tube feed if you dont the commandant said wearily do not be childish reynolds drank and so did jansci it tasted like any other coffee but perhaps stronger and more bitter genuine coffee the commandant smiled but it also contains a chemical commonly known as actedron do not be deceived by its effects gentlemen for the first minutes you will feel yourself stimulated more determined than ever to resist but then will come somewhat severe headaches dizziness nausea inability to relax and a state of some mental confusion the dose of course will be repeated he looked at an assistant with a syringe in his hands gestured at it and went on to explain mescaline produces a mental state very akin to schizophrenia and is becoming increasingly popular i believe among writers and other artists of the western world for their own sakes i trust they do not take it with actedron reynolds stared at him and had to force himself not to shiver there was something evil something abnormally wrong and inhuman about the quiettalking commandant with the gently humorous professorial talk all the more evil all the more inhuman because it was deliberately neither just the chillingly massive indifference of one whose utter and allexclusive absorption in an insatiable desire for the furthering of his own particular lifes work left no possible room for any mere consideration of humanity the commandant was speaking again later i shall inject a new substance my own invention but so recently discovered that i have not yet named it szarhazazine perhaps gentlemen or would that be too whimsical i can assure you that if we had had it some years ago the good cardinal would not have lasted twentyfour hours much less than eightyfour the combined efforts of the three after perhaps two doses of each will be to reduce you to a state of absolute mental exhaustion and collapse then the truth will come inevitably and we will add what we will to your minds and that for you will be the truth you tell us all this jansci said slowly why not forewarned in this case is not forearmed the process is irreversible the quiet certainty in his voice left no room for any doubt he waved away the whitecoated attendants and pressed a button on his desk corns gentlemen it is time that you were shown your quarters almost at once the guards were in the room again releasing legs and arms one at a time from chair arms and legs then reshackling wrists and ankles together all with a swift and trained efficiency that precluded all idea of escape much less escape itself when jansci and reynolds were on their feet the commandant led the way from the room two guards walked on either side and a third with a pistol ready behind each of the two men the precautions were absolute the commandant led the way across the hardpacked snow of the courtyard through the guarded entrance to a massivelywalled windowbarred block of buildings and along a narrow dimlit corridor halfway along at the head of a flight of stone steps leading down into the gloom below he paused at a door gestured to one of the guards and turned to the two prisoners a last thought gentlemen a last sight to take with you down into the dungeons below while you spend your last few hours on earth as the men you have always known yourselves to be the key clicked in the lock and the commandant pushed it open with his foot after you gentlemen hobbled by the shackles reynolds and jansci stumbled into the room saving themselves from falling by catching at the footrail of an oldfashioned iron bedstead a man was lying on the bed dozing and reynolds saw almost with no sensation of surprise he had been expecting it from the moment the commandant had stopped outside the door that it was dr jennings haggard and wasted and years older than when reynolds had seen him three days previously he had been dozing on a dirty straw mattress but he was almost instantly awake and reynolds could not resist a slow stirring of satisfaction when he saw that whatever else the old man had lost it certainly wasnt his intransigence the fire was back in the faded eyes even as he struggled upright well what the devil does this latest intrusion mean he spoke english the only language he knew but reynolds could see that the commandant understood havent you damned ruffians pushed me about enough for a weekend without he broke off when he recognised reynolds for the first time and stared at him so the fiends got you too inevitably the commandant said in precise english he turned to reynolds you came all the way from england to see the professor you have seen him now you can say goodbye he leaves this afternoon in three hours time to be precise for russia he turned to jennings road conditions are extremely bad we have arranged for a special coach to be attached to the pecs train you will find it comfortable enough pecs jennings glared at him where the devil is pecs one hundred kilometres south of here my dear jennings the budapest airport is temporarily closed by snow and ice but the latest word is that pecs airport is still open a special plane for yourself and a ah a few other special cases is being diverted there jennings ignored him turned and stared at reynolds i understand that my son brian has arrived in england reynolds nodded in silence and im still here eh youve done splendidly young man just splendidly what the devil is going to happen now god only knows i cant tell you how sorry i am sir reynolds hesitated then made up his mind theres one thing you should know i have no authority for telling you this but for this once only to hell with authority your wife your wifes operation was one hundred per cent successful and her recovery is already almost complete what whats that youre saying jennings had reynolds by the lapels and though forty pounds lighter than the younger man was actually shaking him youre lying i know youre lying the surgeon said the surgeon said what we told him to say reynolds interrupted flatly i know it was unforgivable but it was essential to bring you home and every possible lever was to be brought to bear but it doesnt matter a damn any more so you might as well know my god my god the reaction reynolds had expected especially from a man of the professors reputation that of an almost berserker anger over having been duped so long and so cruelly completely failed to materialise instead he collapsed on his bed as if the weight of his body had grown too much for his old legs to bear and blinked happily through his tears this is wonderful i cant tell you how wonderful and only a few hours ago i knew i could never be happy again most interesting all most interesting the commandant murmured and to think that the west has the effrontery to accuse us of inhumanity true true jansci murmured but at least the west doesnt pump its victims full of actedron and mescaline what whats that jennings looked up whos been pumped full of we have jansci interrupted mildly were to be given a fair trial and then shot in the morning but first comes the modern equivalent of being broken on the wheel jennings stared at jansci and reynolds the incredulity on his face slowly changing to horror he rose and looked at the commandant is this true what this man says i mean the commandant shrugged he exaggerates of course but so it is true jennings voice was quiet mr reynolds it is as well you told me of my wife the use of that lever would now be quite superfluous but its too late now i can see that just as i begin to see many other things and begin to know the things i shall never see again your wife janscis words were statement not question my wife jennings nodded and my boy you shall see them again jansci said quietly such was the quiet certainty the unshakable conviction in his tone that the others stared at him halfconvinced that he had some knowledge that was denied them halfconvinced that he was mad i promise you dr jennings the old man stared at him then the hope slowly faded from his eyes you are kind my friend religious faith is the prop in this world jansci interrupted and soon take him away the commandant ordered curtly the man goes mad already michael reynolds was going insane slowly but inevitably insane and the most terrible part of it was that he knew he was going insane but since the last forced injection shortly after they had been strapped in their chairs in that underground cellar there had been nothing he could do about the relentless onset of this madness and the more he fought against it the more resolutely he struggled to ignore the symptoms the pains the agonising stresses that were being set up in mind and body then the more acutely he became aware of the symptoms the deeper into his mind dug these fiendish claws chemical claws claws that were tearing his mind apart he was secured to his highbacked chair hand and foot by a thigh belt and by a waistbelt and he would have given all he ever had or would have for the blessed release of throwing off these bonds of flinging himself to the floor or against a wall or of contorting convulsing his body in every fashion conceivable of flexing and stretching flexing and stretching every muscle he had anything in a desperate attempt to ease that intolerable itch and frightening tension set up by ten thousand jumping jangling nerveends all over his body it was the old chinese torture of tickling the soles of the feet magnified a hundredfold only here there were no feathers only the countless insidious probing needles of actedron jabbing every screaming nerveend into a frantic frenzy an undreamed of pitch of frenetic excitability waves of nausea swept over him his inside felt as if a wasps nest had been broken there and a thousand buzzing wings were beating against the walls of his stomach he was having difficulty with his breathing and more and more frequently now his throat would constrict in a terrifying fashion he could feel himself choke for want of air while waves of panic surged through him then at the last instant release would come and the air surge gaspingly into his starving lungs but his head his mind that was the worst of all the inside of his head seemed dark and confused the edges of his mind ragged and woolly and increasingly losing contact with reality for all his conscious desperate attempts to cling on to what shreds of reason the actedron and mescaline had left him the back of his head felt as if it were being crushed between a vice and his eyes ached abominably he could hear voices now voices calling from afar and as the last vestiges of his reason slipped away from his powerless grasp and down into the darkness he knew even as his power of knowing left him that the dark shroud of madness had completely enveloped him in its thick and choking folds but still the voices came even down in the black depths still the voices came not voices something seemed to tell him not voices but just a voice and it wasnt speaking to him or whispering insanely in the dark corners of his mind as all the other voices had been it was shouting at him calling him with a strength that penetrated even through the folds of madness with a desperate compelling urgency that no man with life at all left in him could possibly ignore again and again it came endlessly insistent seeming to grow louder and louder with every moment that passed until at last something reached deep down into reynolds darkness lifted a tiny corner of the shroud and let him recognise the voice for a passing moment of time it was a voice he knew well but a voice he had never heard like this before it was he just dimly managed to realise janscis voice and jansci was shouting at him over and over again keep your head up for gods sake keep your head up keep it up keep it up over and over again like some insane litany slowly ponderously inch by agonising inch as if he were lifting some tremendous weight reynolds lifted his head off his chest his eyes still clamped shut until he felt the back of his head press against the high chairback for a long moment he stayed in that position fighting for breath like a long distance runner at the end of a gruelling race then his head started to droop again keep it up i told you to keep it up janscis voice was vibrant with command and reynolds was suddenly aware clearly and unmistakably aware that jansci was projecting towards himself making a part of himself some of that fantastic willpower that had taken him from the kolyma mountains and brought him back alive across the uncharted subzero wastes of the siberian deserts keep it up i tell you thats better thats better now your eyes open your eyes and look at me reynolds opened his eyes and looked at him it was as if someone had covered his eyes with thick sheaths of lead the effort was so great but open them he finally did and peered with unfocused gaze across the gloom of the cellar at first he could see nothing he thought his eyes were gone there was only a misty vapour swimming across his eyes and then suddenly he knew it was a misty vapour and he remembered that the stone floor was covered in six inches of water and the entire cellar festooned with steam pipes the steaming humid heat worse by far than any turkish bath he had ever known was part of the treatment and now he could see jansci he could see him as if he were seeing through a misted frosted glass but he could see him perhaps eight feet away in a chair the duplicate of his own he could see the head continually shaking from side to side the jaws working constantly the hands at the end of the pinioned arms opening and closing convulsively as jansci sought to release some of the accumulated tension the exquisitely agonising titillation of his overstimulated nervous system dont let your head go again michael he said urgently even in his distress the use of his christian name struck reynolds the first time jansci had ever used it pronouncing it exactly as his daughter had done and for heavens sake keep your eyes open dont let yourself go whatever you do dont let yourself go theres a peak a crisis of some kind to the effects of these damned chemicals and if you get over that dont let go he shouted suddenly again reynolds opened his eyes this time the effort was fractionally less thats it thats it janscis voice came more clearly now i felt just the same a moment ago but if you let go yield to the effects theres no recovery just hang on boy just hang on i can feel it going already and reynolds also could feel the grip of the chemicals easing he had still the same mad urge to tear loose to convulse every muscle in his body but his head was clearing and the ache behind his eyes beginning to dwindle jansci was talking to him all the while encouraging him distracting him and gradually all his limbs and body began to quieten he grew cold even in the fierce tropical heat of the cellar and bouts of uncontrollable shivering shook him from head to foot then the shivering faded and died away and he began to sweat and grow faint as the humidity and the heat pouring from the steam pipes increased with every moment that passed he was again on the threshold of collapse a clearheaded sane collapse this time when the door opened and gumbooted warders came splashing through the water within seconds the warders had them free and were urging them through the open door into the clear icy air and reynolds for the first time in his life knew exactly what the taste of water must seem like to a man who had been dying of thirst in the desert ahead of him he could see jansci shrugging off the supporting hands of the warders on either side of him and reynolds though he felt like a man after a long and wasting bout of fever did the same he staggered all but fell when the support of the arms was withdrawn recovered and steeled himself to follow jansci out into the snow and bitter cold of the courtyard with his body erect and his head held high the commandant was waiting for them and his eyes narrowed in swift disbelief as he saw them come out for a few moments he was at a loss and the words so ready on his lips remained unsaid but he recovered quickly and the professorial mask slipped effortlessly into place candidly gentlemen had one of my medical colleagues reported this to me i should have called him a liar i would not i could not have believed it as a matter of clinical interest how do you feel cold and my feet are freezing maybe you hadnt noticed it but our feet are soaking wet weve been sitting with them in water for the past two hours reynolds leaned negligently against a wall as he spoke not because his attitude reflected his feelings but because without the walls support he would have collapsed on to the snow but not even the wall lent him the support and encouragement that the approving gleam in janscis eye did all in good time periodic alternations of temperature is part of the ah treatment i congratulate you gentlemen this promises to be a case of unusual interest he turned to one of the guards a clock in their cellar and where they can both see it the next injection of actedron will be let me see its now midday will be at pjn precisely we must not keep them in undue suspense ten minutes later gasping in the sudden stifling heat of the cellar after the zero cold of the yard outside reynolds looked at the ticking clock then at jansci he doesnt miss out even the smallest refinement of torture does he he would be horrified genuinely horrified if he heard you mention the word torture jansci said thoughtfully to himself the commandant is just a scientist carrying out an experiment and all he wants is to achieve the maximum efficiency from the point of view of results he is of course quite mad with the blind insanity of all zealots he would be shocked to hear you say that too mad reynolds swore hes an inhuman fiend tell me jansci is that the sort of man you call your brother you still believe in the oneness of humanity an inhuman fiend jansci murmured very well let us admit it but at the same time let us not forget that inhumanity knows no frontiers no frontiers in either time or space its hardly the exclusive perquisite of the russians you know god only knows how many thousands of hungarians have been executed or tortured till death came as a welcome release by their fellow hungarians the czech ssb their secret police were on a par with the nkvd and the polish ub composed almost entirely of poles were responsible for worse atrocities than the russians had ever dreamed of worse even than vinnitsa jansci looked at him in long slow speculation then raised the back of his hand to his forehead he could have been wiping the sweat away vinnitsa he lowered his hand and stared sightlessly into the gloom of a far corner why do you ask about vinnitsa my boy i dont know julia mentioned it perhaps i shouldnt have asked im sorry jansci forget it no need to be sorry i can never forget it he broke off for a long moment then went on slowly i can never forget it i was with the germans in when we dug up a highfenced orchard near the nkvd headquarters we found dead in a mass grave in that orchard we found my mother my sister my daughter julias elder sister and my only son my daughter and my son had been buried alive it is not difficult to tell these things in the minutes that followed that dark furnacehot dungeon deep under the frozen earth of sarhaza did not exist for reynolds he forgot their ghastly predicament he forgot the haunting thought of the international scandal his trial would bring about he forgot the man who was bent on destroying them he could not even hear the ticking of the clock he could think only of the man who sat quietly opposite him of the dreadfully stark simplicity of his story of the shattering traumatic shock that must have followed his discovery of the miracle that he should not only have kept his sanity but grown into the kind and wise and gentle man he was with hatred in his heart towards none that lived to have lost so many that he loved to have lost the most of what he lived for and then to call their murderers his brothers reynolds looked at him and knew that he did not even begin to know this man and knew that he would never know him it is not difficult to read your thoughts jansci said gently i lost so many i loved and for a time almost my reason the count i will tell you his story some day has lost even more i at least have still julia and i believe in my heart my wife also he has lost everything in the world but we both know this we know that it was bloodshed and violence that took our loved ones away from us but we also know that all the blood spilt between here and eternity will never bring them back again revenge is for the madmen of the world and for the creatures of the field revenge will never create a world in which bloodshed and violence can never take our loved ones away from us there may be a better kind of world worth living for worth striving for and devoting our lives to but i am a simple man and i just cannot conceive of it he paused then smiled well we are talking of inhumanity in general let us not forget this specific instance no no reynolds shook his head violently let us forget it lets forget all about it and that is what the world says let us forget let us not think of it the contemplation is too awful to bear let us not burden our hearts and our minds and our consciences for then the good that is in us the good that is in every man might drive us to do something about it and we cant do anything about it the world will say because we do not even know where to begin or how to begin but with all humility i can suggest where we can begin by not thinking that inhumanity is endemic to any particular part of this suffering world i have mentioned the hungarians the poles and the czechs i might also mention bulgaria and rumania where nameless atrocities have taken place of which the world has never yet heard and may never hear i could mention the homeless refugees in korea and to all of that you might say it is all one it is all communism and you would be right my boy but what would you say if i reminded you of the cruelties of falangist spain of buchenwald and belsen of the gas chambers of auschwitz of the japanese prison camps the death railways of not so long ago again you would have the ready answer all these things flourish under a totalitarian regime but i said also that inhumanity has no frontiers in time go back a century or two go back to the days when the two great upholders of democracy were not quite as mature as they are today go back to the days when the british were building up their empire to some of the most ruthless colonisation the world has ever seen go back to the days when they were shipping slaves packed like sardines in a tin across to america and the americans themselves were driving the indian off the face of their continent and what then my boy you gave the answer yourself we were young then and so are the russians young today but even today even in this twentieth century things happen which any respecting people in the world should be ashamed of you remember yalta michael you remember the agreements between stalin and roosevelt you remember the great repatriation of the people of the east who had fled to the west i remember you remember but what you do not remember is what you have never seen but what both the count and i have seen and will never forget thousand upon countless thousands of russians and estonians and latvians and lithuanians being forcibly repatriated to their own homelands where they knew that one thing and one thing only awaited them death you have not seen as we have seen thousands mad with fear hanging themselves from every projection that offered falling on their pocket knives flinging themselves under the moving wheels of a railway wagon and cutting their throats with rusty razor blades anything in the world any form of painful screaming selfending rather than go back to the concentration camps and torture and death but we have seen and we have seen how the thousands unlucky enough not to commit suicide were embarked they were driven aboard their transports and their cattle cars they were driven like cattle themselves and they were driven by british and american bayonets never forget that michael by british and american bayonets let him who is without sin jansci shook his head to remove the beads of sweat which spilled out in the climbing humidity both of them were beginning to gasp with the heat to have to fight consciously for each breath they took but jansci was not yet finished i could go on indefinitely my boy about your own country and the country that now regards itself as the true custodian of democracy america if your people and the americans are not the worlds greatest champions of democracy you are certainly the loudest i could speak of the intolerance and cruelties that accompany integration in america of the springing up of ku klux klan in england which once firmly but erroneously regarded itself as being vastly superior to america in the matters of racial tolerance but it is pointless and your countries are big enough and secure enough to take care of their own intolerant minorities and free enough to publicise them to the world the point i make is simply that cruelty and hate and intolerance are the monopoly of no particular race or creed or time they have been with us since the world began and are still with us in every country in the world there are as many evil and wicked and sadistic men in london or new york as there are in moscow but the democracies of the west guard their liberties as an eagle does its young and the scum of society can never rise to the top but here with a political system that in the last analysis can exist only by repression it is essential to have a police force absolute in its power legally constituted but innately lawless arbitrary and utterly despotic such a force is a lodestone for the dregs of our society which first join it and then dominate it and then dominate the country the police force is not intended to be a monster but inevitably by virtue of the elements attracted to it it becomes a monster and the frankenstein that built it becomes its slave one cannot destroy the monster it is hydraheaded and selfpropagating one cannot destroy it nor can one destroy the frankenstein that created it in the first place it is the system the creed by which the frankenstein lives that we must destroy and the surest way to its destruction is to remove the necessity for its existence it cannot exist in a vacuum and i have already told you why it exists jansci smiled ruefully was it three nights or three years ago im afraid my remembering and my thinking are not at their best at the present moment reynolds apologised he stared at the sweat dripping continuously from his forehead and splashing into the water that covered the floor do you think our friend intends to melt us it would seem like it as to what i was saying i fear i talk too much and at the wrong time you dont feel even a little more kindly disposed towards our worthy commandant no ah well jansci sighed philosophically understanding the reasons for an avalanche does not i suppose make one any the more grateful for being pinned beneath it he broke off and twisted to face the door i fear he murmured that our privacy is about to be invaded yet again the guards entered released them pulled them to their feet and hustled them out of the door upstairs and across the yard in their usual efficient and uncommunicative fashion the leader knocked on the commandants door waited for the command then pushed the door wide pushing the two men in in front of him the commandant had company and reynolds recognised him at once colonel joseph hidas the deputy chief of the avo hidas rose to his feet as they entered and walked over to where reynolds stood trying to stop his teeth chattering and his whole body from shaking even without the drugs the instantaneous one hundred degrees alternations in temperature were beginning to have a strangely weakening and debilitating effect hidas smiled at him well captain reynolds so we meet again to coin a phrase the circumstances i fear are even more unfortunate this time than the last which reminds me you will be pleased to hear that your friend coco has recovered and returned to duty although still limping somewhat badly im distressed to hear it reynolds said briefly didnt hit him hard enough hidas raised an eyebrow and turned his head to have a look at the commandant they have had full treatment this morning they have colonel a singularly high degree of resistance but a clinical challenge after my own heart they will talk before midnight quite im sure they will hidas turned back to reynolds your trials will take place on thursday in the peoples court the announcement will be made tomorrow and we are offering immediate visas and superb hotel accommodation to every western journalist who cares to attend there will be no room for anyone else reynolds murmured which will suit us admirably however that is of little interest to me compared to another and somewhat less public trial that will take place even earlier in the week hidas walked across the room and stood before jansci at this moment i achieve what i must frankly admit has become the consuming desire the overriding ambition of my life to meet under the proper circumstances the man who has caused me more trouble more positive distress and more sleepless nights than the combined efforts of all other ah enemies of the state i have ever known yes i admit it for seven years now you have crossed my path almost continually shielded and spirited away hundreds of traitors and foes of communism and interfered with and broken the laws of justice in the past eighteen months your activities aided by those of the luckless but brilliant major howarth have become quite intolerable but the end of the road has come as it must come for everyone i can hardly wait to hear you talk your name my friend jansci that is the only name i have of course i would have expected nothing hidas broke off in midsentence his eyes widened and colour ebbed from his face he took a step backwards then another what did you say your name was his voice this time was only a husky whisper reynolds looked at him in astonishment jansci just jansci perhaps ten seconds passed in utter silence while everyone stared at the avo colonel then hidas licked his lips and said hoarsely turn round jansci turned and hidas stared down at the manacled hands they heard the quick indrawing of his breath then jansci turned round of his own accord youre dead hidas voice was still the same hoarse whisper his face lined with shock you died two years ago when we took your wife away i didnt die my dear hidas jansci interrupted another man did there were scores of suicides when your brown lorries were so busy that week wejust took one the nearest to me in appearance and build we took him to our flat disguised him and painted his hands well enough to pass any but medical examination major howarth as you are probably aware by this time is a genius with disguise jansci shrugged it was an unpleasant thing to do but the man was already dead my wife was alive and we thought she might remain alive if i were thought to be dead i see i see indeed colonel hidas had had time to recover his balance and he could not keep the excitement out of his voice no wonder you defied us for so long no wonder we could never break your organisation had i known had i but known i am privileged indeed to have had you for adversary colonel hidas the commandants voice was imploring who is this man a man who alas will never stand trial in budapest kiev possibly moscow but never budapest commandant let me introduce you majorgeneral alexis illyurin second only to general vlassov in command of the ukranian national army illyurin the commandant stared illyurin here in my room it is impossible it is i know it is but there is only one man in the world with hands like that he hasnt talked yet no but he will we must have a complete confession ready when he goes to russia hidas glanced at his watch so much to do my commandant so little time to do it in my car and at once guard my friend well against my return i will be back in two hours three at the most illyurin by all the gods illyurin back once more in the stonewalled room jansci and reynolds had little to say to one another even janscis usual optimism seemed to have failed him but his face was as untroubled as ever but reynolds knew that everything was over for jansci even more than himself and that the last card had been played there was he thought something tragic beyond words about the man sitting quietly opposite him a giant toppling into the dust but quiet and unafraid and looking at him reynolds was almost glad that he himself would die also and he could not but be conscious of the bitter irony of his courage as the thought sprang not from courage but from cowardice with jansci dead and because of him he could not have faced janscis daughter again worse even worse than that was the thought of what must inevitably happen to her with the count and jansci and himself all gone but the thought had no sooner come than he had thrust it violently ruthlessly away from him if ever there was a time that no weakness must touch his mind that time was now and dwelling on the laughter and the sadness of that mobile delicate face that was all too easily evoked in his minds eye was the highroad to despair the steam hissed out of the pipes the humidity spilled over the room the temperature climbed steadily upwards and their bodies were drenched with sweat their eyes blinded by it and their breathing was the breathing of fire twice three times reynolds lost consciousness and would have fallen and drowned in a few inches of water but for the restraining body belt it was as he was emerging from the last of these periods of unconsciousness that he felt hands fumbling at his fastenings and before he properly realised what was happening the guards had himself and jansci once more out of the cell and into the bitter air of the courtyard for the third time that morning reynolds mind was reeling as his body was reeling and jansci too he could see was being halfcarried across but even through the fog in his mind reynolds remembered something and looked at his watch it was exactly two oclock he saw jansci looking at him saw the grim nod of acquiescence two oclock and the commandant would be waiting for them he would be as punctual and precise about this as he was about everything else two oclock and the commandant would be waiting for them and so too would the syringes and the coffee the mescaline and the actedron waiting to drive them over the edge of madness the commandant was waiting for them but he was not waiting alone the first person reynolds saw was an avo guard then two more then the giant coco leering at him with a wide anticipatory grin on his seamed and brutalised face then last of all he saw the back of a man leaning negligently against the windowframe and smoking a black russian cigarette in a tapered holder and when the man turned round reynolds saw that it was the count chapter nine reynolds was certain that his eyes and his mind were deceiving him he knew that the count was safely out of the way and that his avo superiors would not let him move an inch without guarding him like a hawk he knew too that that last hour and a half in that steam oven of a dungeon had had an enormously debilitating effect and that his mind dark and woolly and still confused was playing curious tricks on him then the man at the window pushed himself leisurely off the wall and was sauntering easily across the room cigarette holder in one hand a pair of heavy leather gloves swinging in the other and suddenly there could be doubt no more it was the count alive completely unharmed the old mocking self that he had always been reynolds lips parted in to the first conclusive moment of shock his eyes widened then the beginning of a smile began to limn its lines on his pale and haggard face where on earth he began then staggered back against the wall behind him as the count slashed him across the face and mouth with his heavy gauntlets he could feel the blood springing from one of the recently healed cute on his upper lip and with all he had already suffered this latest pain and shock left him weak and dizzy and he could see the count only dimly as through a haze lesson number one little man the count said casually he eyed a tiny spot of blood on his glove with evident distaste in future you will speak only when you have been spoken to the look of distaste transferred itself from his gloves to the two prisoners have these men fallen into a river commandant not at all not at all the commandant was looking very upset just undergoing a course of treatment in one of our steam rooms this is most unfortunate captain zsolt really most unfortunate it has destroyed the entire sequence i wouldnt worry commandant the count said soothingly this is unofficial and please dont quote me but i understand that they are being brought back here either late tonight or early in the morning i believe comrade furmint has the greatest of faith in you as a shall we say psychologist youre sure of that captain the commandant was anxious youre quite sure certain the count glanced at his watch we must not delay commandant you know how essential haste is besides he smiled the sooner theyre away the sooner theyre back again let me not delay you then the commandant was now affability itself i am quite reconciled to their departure i am looking forward to completing my experiment especially on so illustrious a personage as majorgeneral illyurin its not a chance which will come your way again the count agreed he turned to the four avo men right out into the truck with them at once coco my infant i fear you are losing your grip they are made of glass you think coco grinned and took his cue his shove massive palm flathanded against reynolds face sent him staggering against the wall with wicked force and two others grabbed jansci and hustled him brutally out of the room the commandant raised horrified hands captain zsolt is it necessary i mean i want them back in good condition so that dont be afraid commandant the count grinned we too in our own crude way are specialists you will explain to colonel hidas when he returns and ask him to phone the chief you will tell him perhaps how sorry i am to have missed him but i cannot wait good thank you again commandant and goodbye shivering violently in their sodden clothes jansci and reynolds were hustled across the courtyard into the back of a waiting avo lorry a guard accompanied the driver into the cab and the count coco and another guard climbed into the back of the lorry placed their guns on their knees and kept a watchful eye on the two prisoners a moment later the engine turned over the truck got under way and within seconds had passed by the saluting sentry at the gate almost at once the count pulled a map from his pocket consulted it briefly then replaced it five minutes later he passed by jansci and reynolds slid back the inspection hatch and spoke to the driver half a kilometre from here a side road branches off to the left take it and drive until i order you to stop within a minute the truck slowed then turned off the road and went bouncing and jolting along a narrow rough track so potholed was the road so deep the frozen snow that the truck constantly skidded from one side to the other and the driver had the greatest difficulty in keeping it on the road at all but the progress if slow was steady after ten minutes the count moved to the rear of the truck stood up and leaned out the door as if looking for a familiar landmark and after several minutes there he seemed to find it he gave an order the truck stopped and he jumped out on to the snow followed by coco and the other guard obeying the implicit orders of the silently gesturing gun muzzles jansci and reynolds jumped out after them the count had stopped the truck in the middle of a thick wood with a clearing to one side he gave another order and the driver used the space provided by the clearing for reversing the truck it skidded and slipped on the snow slicked grass but heaving shoulders and a few broken branches under the back wheels soon had it back on the road again facing the direction it had come the driver stopped the engine and climbed out but the count made him restart it and leave it idling he wasnt he said going to take the chance of the engine freezing up in that zero weather and it was indeed bitterly cold jansci and reynolds still in their same wet clothes were shivering like men with the ague the icy air turned chins and ears and nosetips red and blue and white and the condensation of breath was heavy and almost like smoke evaporating slowly like smoke in the still frozen air speed everyone the count commanded you dont all want to freeze to death here do you coco you will guard these men i can trust you to the death coco grinned evilly one slightest move and i will kill i dont doubt it the count looked at him thoughtfully how many men have you killed coco i lost count many years ago comrade coco said simply reynolds looking at him knew with certainty that he was speaking the truth your reward will come one of these fine days the count said cryptically the rest of you a shovel apiece we have some work to do that will get your blood moving one of the guards blinked stupidly at him spades comrade for the prisoners you thought perhaps i was planning a garden allotment the count asked coldly no no it was just that you said to the commandant i mean i thought we were going to budapest his voice trailed away into silence exactly comrade the count said dryly you have seen the error of your ways in time in time and no more whatever else is required of you comrade heaven knows it is not thought come or we all freeze and do not be afraid there will be no need to dig the ground impossible anyway its like iron a little vale in the woods where the snow has drifted deep a trench in the snow and well at least coco understands i do indeed the grinning coco licked his lips perhaps the comrade will permit me to put an end to their sufferings the count suggested he shrugged indifferently you may as well whats only another two after youve lost count of all the ones that have gone before he disappeared into the woods behind the clearing with the other three guards and even in that crystal clear soundcarrying air the men left behind could hear their voices growing fainter and fainter until they were only distant murmurs the count must have been leading them deep into the very heart of the wood coco meanwhile watched them with unblinking venomous little eyes and jansci and reynolds were both all too clearly aware that he was awaiting only the slightest excuse to pull the trigger of the carbine that his great hands cradled as if it were a toy but they gave him no such excuse excepting only their uncontrollable shivering they stood like statues five minutes elapsed and the count emerged from the woods slapping a gauntlet against his polished high boots and the skirts of his long coat to free them of snow the work proceeds apace he announced two more minutes and we will rejoin our comrades they have behaved coco they have behaved the disappointment in cocos voice was all too clear never mind comrade the count consoled him he was marching up and down behind coco beating his arms to keep warm you havent much longer to wait dont take your eyes off them for a moment how is how is the pain today he inquired delicately it still hurts coco glared at reynolds and swore i am black and blue all over my poor coco youre having an uncommonly rough time of it these days the count said gently and the sound of his viciously clubbing revolver was a pistol shot in the silence of the woods as the butt struck home accurately and with tremendous force just above cocos ear the carbine dropped from cocos hands he swayed eyes turned up in his head then crashed to the ground like a stricken tree as the count stepped respectfully to one side to give a clear path to the giants fall twenty seconds later the truck was oh its way and the clearing in the woods already lost to sight round a curve in the road for the first three or four minutes there was no sound ho word spoken in the cab of the truck only the low steady roar of the diesel engine a hundred questions a hundred comments framed themselves on the lips of jansci and reynolds but they didnt know where to start and the shadow of the nightmare from which they had just escaped was still too vivid in their minds and then the count was slowing down and stopping one of his rare smiles illuminating his thin aristocratic face as he dipped into his capacious hip pocket and drew out his metal flask plum brandy my friends his voice wasnt quite steady plum brandy and god only knows that no one needs it more than we three do today me for i have died a thousand deaths today especially when our friend here nearly ended everything when he first saw me in the commandants office and you because you are soaking and freezing and prime candidates for pneumonia and also i suspect because they did not treat you too well i am right right jansci had to answer for reynolds was coughing and choking as the grateful lifegiving warmth of the strong spirit burnt its way down his throat the usual breakdown chemicals plus a special one hes just developed and as you know the steam treatment it was not difficult to guess the count nodded you did not look at all happy in fact you had no right to be on your feet at all but doubtless you were sustained by the sure knowledge that it was only a matter of time before i appeared on the scene doubtless jansci said dryly he drank deep of the brandy his eyes flooded with tears and he gasped for air poison sheer poison but i have never tasted anything half as good there are times when ones critical judgements are better suspended the count admitted he tilted the bottle to his mouth swallowed as another man might swallow water for all the apparent effect it had on him and pushed the flask back in his pocket a most essential stop but we must press on time is not on our side he engaged the clutch and the truck moved forward reynolds had to shout his protest over the highpitched roar of its first gear but surely you are going to tell us try to stop me the count said but as we drive along if you dont mind i will explain why later however to the happenings of today first of all i must tell you that i have resigned from the avo reluctantly of course of course jansci murmured does anyone know yet furmint does i should think the counts eyes never left the road as he wrestled the skidding truck along between the narrow banks i didnt actually give notice in writing but as i left him gagged and bound hand and foot in his own office i dont think he could have been in much doubt about my intentions neither reynolds nor jansci said anything there seemed no remark to meet the occasion and as the silence stretched out they could see the grin spreading over the counts thin lips furmint it was jansci who broke the silence his voice sounding strained furmint you mean your chief exchief the count corrected none other but let me begin from the morning you will remember that i had sent a message out with the cossack incidentally did he and his opel arrive intact both of them a miracle you should have seen his take off as i say i told him that i was being sent out to godollo some security checkup a big one i should have expected hidas to handle it himself but he told me he had some important business elsewhere in gyor well we went to godollo eight men myself and a captain kalman zsolt an able man with a rubber truncheon but singularly ungifted otherwise and as we went i was worried in a mirror i had caught the chief giving me a very curious look indeed just before i left the andrassy ut not mind you that there is anything remarkable about the chief giving anybody curious looks he doesnt even trust his own wife but it was curious coming from the man who had only last week complimented me on being the ablest avo officer in budapest you are irreplaceable jansci murmured thank you then just as we were arriving in godollo zsolt dropped a bomb in my lap he mentioned casually that he had been speaking to hidas chauffeur that morning and that he understood that the colonel was going to the szarhaza prison and wondered what the devil the colonel was going to that hellhole for he kept on rambling about something or other i dont know what which was just as well as im sure my face at that moment must have been a very interesting sight for anyone who cared to look at it everything fell together in my mind with such loud clicks that its a wonder that zsolt didnt hear it shoving me out of the way to godollo the chiefs strange look the lie hidas had told me the ease with which i had found out that the professor was in szarfaaza the still greater ease with which i got the papers and stamps from furmints office my god i could have kicked myself when i remembered that furmint had actually gone out of his way quite unnecessarily to tell me that he was going to hold a meeting with some officers thereby letting me know that his office would be empty for some time to come it was during the dinner hour when there was no one in his outer office how they got on to me i will never know ill swear that only fortyeight hours ago i was the most trusted officer in budapest however that is by the way i had to act i had to act once for all and i knew that my bridges were already burnt and that i had nothing to lose i had to act on the assumption that only furmint and hidas knew about me obviously zsolt knew nothing but i wasnt banking on that hes too stupid to be entrusted with anything its just that both furmint and hidas are naturally so distrustful that they wouldnt risk telling anyone the count smiled broadly after all if their best man had defected how were they to know how far the rot had spread how indeed jansci said precisely immediately we arrived in godollo we went to the mayors office not our local branch there they were being investigated among others threw the mayor out and took over i left zsolt there went downstairs collected the men told them that their duty until five oclock this evening was to consist of going round cafes and bars posing as disaffected avo men to see what they could turn up in the way of seditious talk a job after their own hearts i provided them with plenty of money for local colour theyll be drinking away steadily for hours yet then went dashing back to the mayors place in a state of great excitement and told zsolt that i had found something of utmost importance he didnt even stop to ask what it was he came tearing out of the office with me dreams of promotion shining in his eyes the count coughed we will miss out the unpleasant part of it suffice to say that he is now incarcerated in an abandoned cellar not fifty yards from the mayors office not bound or hurt in any way but it will take an oxyacetylene torch to free him the count stopped speaking braked the truck and got out to clear his windscreen it had been snowing quite heavily now for two or three minutes but neither of the other two had noticed it i took my unfortunate colleagues identity papers the count was on his way again both with truck and story fortyfive minutes later stopping only en route to buy a clothes rope i was at the door of our hq and a minute later i was in furmints office the very fact that i got as far as that showed that furmint and hidas had indeed been as closemouthed about my defection as i had suspected they might be the whole thing was ridiculously simple throughout i had nothing to lose i was still officially in the clear and nothing succeeds like effrontery especially on a massive scale furmint was so staggered to see me that i had the barrel of my pistol between his teeth before his jaw had time to close again he is surrounded by fancy knobs and bellpushes all designed to save his life in an emergency but they were not you understand designed to protect him against such as myself i gagged him then informed him to write a letter in his own hand to my dictation furmint is a brave man and he was most reluctant but nothing overcomes high moral principles like the muzzle of a pistol grinding into your ear the letter was to the commandant of the szarhaza prison who knows furmints writing as well as he knows his own authorising him to release you two to myself one captain zsolt then he signed it covered it with practically every stamp we could find in his office put it in an envelope and sealed it with his own private seal a seal not known to a score of people in all hungary i fortunately was one of them although furmint didnt know it i had twenty metres of clothes rope and when i was finished furmint was trussed like a fowl all he could move were his eyes and his eyebrows and he used these to great effect when i picked up the direct phone to the szarhaza and spoke to the commandant in what i pride myself was a perfect imitation of furmints voice i think furmint began to understand a great many things that had puzzled him over the last year or so anyway i told the commandant that i was sending captain zsolt to pick up these prisoners and that i was also sending a written authorisation in my own personal writing with my own personal seal with him there were to be no slip ups what if hidas had still been there reynolds asked curiously he must have left only very shortly before you phoned nothing could have been better and easier the count gestured with an airy hand then grabbed the wheel quickly as the truck slewed towards a ditch id just have ordered hidas to bring you back immediately and waylaid him en route when i was speaking to the commandant i coughed and sneezed from time to time and let my voice seem a little husky i told the commandant i had a devil of a cold coming on i had my reasons for that then i spoke on the table microphone to his outer office and said that i wasnt to be disturbed on any account whatsoever for the next three hours not even if a minister wanted to speak to me i left them in no doubt as to what would happen if my orders were disobeyed i thought furmint was going to have an apoplectic stroke then still in furmints voice i rang up the transport pool ordered a truck to be brought round for major howarth at once and ordered four men to be standing by in readiness to accompany him i didnt want them but i had to have them for local colour then i bundled furmint into a cupboard locked it left his office locked that too and took the key with me then we set off for szarhaza i wonder what furmints thoughts are at this very moment or zsolts or if any of the avo men i left in godollo are still sober and cant you just see hidas and the commandants face as the truth dawns on them the count smiled dreamily i could spend all day just thinking of these things for the next few minutes they drove along in silence the snow although not yet blinding was thickening steadily and the count had to give his exclusive attention to the road beside him jansci and reynolds helped as much by the heat generated in the cab by the engine as by the second drink they had had from the counts bottle could feel the warmth gradually returning to their frozen bodies as the continuous shivering eased and gradually stopped and a thousand pins and needles jabbed their numbed legs and arms in the exquisite agony of returning circulation they had listened to the counts story in an almost complete silence and still sat in silence reynolds could think of no suitable comment on either this fantastic man or his story and to know how even to begin to thank him was quite beyond his imagination besides he had more than a shrewd suspicion that thanks would receive very short shrift indeed did either of you see the car hidas arrived in the count asked suddenly i saw it reynolds answered a black russian zis big as a house i know it solid steel body and bulletproof windows the count was slowing down now edging their truck close in to the shelter of some trees that crowded down on the roadside i think it unlikely that hidas would fail to recognise one of his own trucks and pass by without comment let us see how the land lies he stopped jumped out into the swirling snow and the others followed him fifty yards took them to the junction of the main road smooth and unbroken now under its fresh covering of snow obviously nothings passed by here since the snow started falling jansci observed exactly the count agreed he glanced at his watch three hours almost to the minute since hidas left szarhaza and he said he would return within the three hours he shouldnt be long couldnt we just run the truck across the road and stop him reynolds suggested that would delay the alarm another couple of hours the count shook his head regretfully impossible id thought of it but its no good in the first place the men we left behind in the woods should make it back to szarhaza in an hour an hour and a half at the most then youd require a crowbar or a stick of dynamite to break into a car armoured like the zis but even thats not the point in this weather the driver almost certainly wouldnt see the truck until it was too late and that zis weighs about three tons it would wreck the truck and if we are to survive at all we want to keep that truck intact he could have passed by in the first minutes after we left the road before the snow started falling jansci put in its possible the count conceded but i think we should give him a few minutes he broke off suddenly listened and reynolds heard it at the same time the subdued hum of a powerful motor closing rapidly they were off the road and into the shelter of a few trees just in time the approaching car hidas black zis without a doubt swept by in the swirling snow with a hissing crunch of wide snow tyres and was lost to sight and sound almost immediately reynolds caught a glimpse of a chauffeur in the front and of hidas in the back with what looked like another small figure huddled beside him but it was impossible to be sure and then they were racing back to the truck and the count was swinging it out on the main road the hunt would be up in minutes now and time was running out the count had barely changed up to top gear when he changed down again and brought the truck to a halt by the side of a small wood through which telephone poles and wires were strung to cut off the approaching corner almost at once two men halffrozen with the bitter cold and their clothes so matted with snow that they looked more like a couple of walking snowmen than human beings came stumbling out of the wood and running towards the truck each carrying a box under his arm as they saw through the windscreen jansci and reynolds sitting in the cab they waved their arms in delight md grinned broadly and there was no mistaking them now sandor and the cossack and their expressions were those of men welcoming friends back from the dead they piled into he back of the truck with as much speed as their frozen limbs would allow and the count was on his way again within fifteen seconds of coming to rest the inspection door behind the cab pushed open and sandor and the cossack plied them with excited questions and congratulations after a minute or two the count passed back his brandy flask and jansci took advantage of the sudden lull in talk to ask a question what boxes were they carrying the small one was a telephone linesmans kit for tapping wires the count explained every avo truck carries one of these on the way here i stopped at the inn in petoli gave it to sandor and told him to follow us to near the szarhaza climb a telephone pole and tap the private line from the prison to budapest if the commandant was still suspicious and wanted confirmation sandor would have answered i told him to talk through a handkerchief as if furmints cold which i had already let the commandant know was developing had become much worse good lord reynolds found it impossible to hide his admiration is there anything you did not think of very little the count admitted modestly anyway the precaution was not needed the commandant as you saw had never a suspicion the only thing i was really afraid of was that these dolts of avo men i had with me might call me major howarth in front of the commandant instead of captain zsolt as i had coached them to call me for reasons i said which furmint would personally explain to them if any of them blundered the other box contains your ordinary clothes which sandor also brought on from petoli in the opel ill stop in a moment and you can nip into the back and change out of these uniforms where did you leave the opel sandor back there deep in the wood no one can see it no loss the count dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand it wasnt ours in the first place well gentlemen the hunt is up or will be any moment now and it will be up with a vengeance every escape route to the west from trunk roads down to bicycle tracks will be blocked as they have never been blocked before with all due respects to yourself mr reynolds general illyurin is the biggest fish that has ever threatened to escape their net we will do very well indeed to escape with our lives i do not rate our chances very highly so what now i wonder no one had immediate suggestions to make jansci sat looking straight ahead the lined face beneath the thick white hair calm and unworried and reynolds could almost have sworn that a slight smile was touching the corners of his mouth he himself had never felt less like smiling and as the truck roared steadily on from the whitely opaque world of snow behind to the whitely opaque world of snow ahead he made a mental catalogue of his own successes and failures since he had entered hungary only four days previously the catalogue was not one that he could contemplate with either pleasure or pride on the credit side there could only be reckoned the contacts he had made with jansci and his men in the first place and then with the professor and he could derive no real satisfaction from these without the count and jansci even these would have been impossible on the debit side he winced as he realised the length of the list on the debit side being captured immediately after arriving in the country making the avo a gratis presentation of a tape recording that had ruined everything walking into hidas trap and having to be rescued by jansci and his men having to be saved by jansci from succumbing to the effects of the drug in the szarhaza almost betraying his friends and himself when his astonishment had overcome him at the sight of the count in the commandants room he writhed in his seat as he thought of it in short he had lost the professor split up the professors family beyond recovery been responsible for the count losing the position that alone enabled janscis organisation to work smoothly and as bitter as anything he had lost any hope he might have had that janscis daughter might look kindly on him again it was the first time that reynolds had admitted even to himself that he ever had any such hope and he was lost for a long long moment at the wonder of it with physical effort almost he shook off all thought of it and when he spoke he knew there was only one thing he could say theres something i want to do and i want to do it alone he said slowly i want to find a train i want to find the train thats dont we all the count shouted he smashed a gloved hand down on the steeringwheel with a force that nearly broke it and his thin face was alive with a grin of sheer delight dont we all my boy look at jansci there hes been thinking of nothing else for the past ten minutes reynolds looked sharply at the count then more slowly at jansci it had been the beginnings of a smile that he had seen on janscis face he realised now and even as he watched the smile widened as jansci turned towards him know this country like the back of my hand the tone was almost apologetic it was about five kilometres back that i noticed that the count was headed due south i do not imagine jansci added dryly that very much of a welcome awaits us across the border of yugoslavia its no good reynolds shook his head stubbornly just me only me everything ive touched yet has gone wrong just one more step towards the concentration camps next time therell be no count turning up with an avo truck what train is the professor on you will do this alone jansci asked yes i must the mans mad the count announced i cant jansci shook his white head i cant let you do it put yourself in my position and admit that you may be selfish i have unfortunately a conscience to live with and i would not care to face it every waking night for the rest of my life he stared forward through the windscreen even worse i would not care to face my daughter for the rest of my life i dont understand of course you dont it was the count interrupting and he sounded almost jovial your allexclusive devotion to your job may be admirable to be frank i dont think it is but it also tends to blind you to things that are dazzlingly clear to your elders however we argue and uselessly colonel hidas is even now having a fit in our worthy commandants office jansci he was asking for a decision and reynolds knew it you know all we need to know jansci asked the count naturally the count was hurt i had four minutes to wait while the ah prisoners were being produced i did not waste those minutes very well then there it is meechail the information in exchange for our help i dont appear to have much option reynolds said bitterly the sign of an intelligent man he knows when he has lost an argument the count was almost purring he jammed on the brakes pulled a map from his pocket made sure that sandor and the cossack could see it from the observation hatch behind and jabbed at it with his finger here is cece this is where the professor is being put aboard the train today or rather has already been put aboard the train special wagon tacked on to the end the commandant mentioned something like that jansci said a number of highranking scientists pah scientists highranking criminals bound for the siberian taiga and its where they deserve to go nor is dr jennings getting any special treatment its a convict coach pure and simple a frontloading cattle truck the commandant made no bones about it his finger traced the railway line down to the point where it intersected with the main road due south from budapest at the town of szekszard sixty kilometres north of the yugoslavian border the train will stop here then it follows the main road due south to bataszek it goes straight through there then turns west for pecs leaving the main road completely it will have to be somewhere between szekszard and pecs gentlemen and it presents quite a problem there are plenty of trains i would derail but not one carrying hundreds of my adopted countrymen this is just a regular service train may i see that map please reynolds asked it was a very large scale map a road map but also a physical map showing rivers and hills and as he studied it his excitement mounted and his mind went back fourteen years to the days when he had been the youngest subaltern in the soe it was a crazy idea now but it had been a crazy idea then he pointed to a spot on the map not far north of pecs where the roads from szekszard after cutting for almost forty kilometres across country again paralleled the railway line then looked across at the count can you get the truck there before the train arrives with luck with the roads not being blocked and above all with sandor to lift me out of a ditch if i go into one yes i think i can very well here is what i propose quickly succinctly reynolds outlined his plan and at the end of it he looked at the others well jansci shook his head slowly but it was the count who spoke impossible he was very definite it cannot be done its been done before in the vosges mountains an ammunition dump went up as a result i know because i was there what alternative do you propose there was a short period of silence then reynolds spoke again exactly as the count said it is an intelligent man who knows when he has lost an argument were wasting time we are jansci had already made up his mind and the count nodded agreement we can but try into the back and change the count had made up his mind im on my way the train is due in szekszard in twenty minutes be there in fifteen just so long as the avo arent there in ten reynolds said sombrely involuntarily almost the count glanced over his shoulder impossible no signs of hidas yet there are such things as telephones there were it was sandor speaking for the first time for minutes and he showed reynolds the pair of pliers in his huge hand six cables six snips the szarhaza is completely cut off from the outside world i said the count modestly think of everything chapter ten the ancient train rocked and swayed alarmingly along the illmaintained track shuddering and straining whenever a snowladen gust of wind from the southeast caught it broadside on along its entire length and threatened for a heartstopping moment that was only one of a neverending series of such moments to topple it off the track the carriage wheels transmitting a teethrattling vibration through a suspension that had long since given up an unequal battle with die years screeched and grated in a shrilly metallic cacophony as they jarred and leapt across the uneven intersection of the rails the wind and the snow whistled icily through a hundred cracks in illmade doors and windows the wooden coachwork and seats creaked and protested like a ship working in a heavy seaway but the ancient train battered on steadily through the white blindness of that late afternoon in midwinter sometimes slowing down unexpectedly on a straight stretch of track at other times increasing speed round seemingly dangerous curves the driver one hand almost constantly on the steam whistle that whispered and died to a muffled extinction only a hundred yards away in the driving snow was a man obviously with complete confidence in himself the capacities of his train and his knowledge of the track ahead reynolds lurching and staggering down the wildly swaying length of a coach corridor shared none of the engine drivers obvious confidence not in the safety of the train which was the least of reynolds worries but in his own capacity to carry out the task that lay ahead of him when he had broached the plan first of all to the others it had been with the memory in his mind of a soft starlit summers night and a train puffing gently along between the wooded hills of the vosges now just ten minutes after he and jansci had bought their tickets and boarded the train at szekszard without let or hindrance what he had to do what he must do assumed the proportions of a nightmare impossibility what he had to do was simply enough stated he had to free the professor and to free the professor he had to separate the convict coach from the rest of the train and this could only be done by stopping the train and easing the tension on the coupling securing the convicts coach to the guards van one way or another he had to reach the locomotive which at the moment seemed impossibility enough and then prevail upon the footplate crew to bring their engine to a halt when and where he told them prevail was right reynolds thought grimly perhaps he could persuade them if they were halfway friendly perhaps he could frighten them but what was certain enough was that he couldnt force them all they would have to do was to refuse to obey and he would have been helpless the control cabin of a locomotive was a complete mystery to him and not even for the professor could he shoot or knock out engineer and fireman and place hundreds of innocent passengers in danger of death or disfigurement even as he thought of these things reynolds could almost feel the physical sensation of cold dull despair flooding into his mind and he thrust these thoughts ruthlessly aside one evil at a time first of all he had to get there he was rounding the corner of the coach supported only by the one hand that clung to the windowbar his other was deep in his coat pocket supporting the weight of and concealing the suspicious bulge by the heavy hammer and torch there when he bumped into jansci the older man muttered an apology glanced at him briefly and without recognition stepped forward till he could see the entire length of the corridor from which reynolds had just emerged stepped back opened the door of the adjacent toilet to check that it was empty then spoke softly well not so well theyre on to me already they two men civilian clothes belted trenchcoats no hats they followed me up front and back again discreetly if i hadnt been looking for it i wouldnt have noticed it stand out in the corridor let me know theyre coming now reynolds murmured he glanced briefly at the two men lurching towards him as jansci slid quietly inside the toilet pulling the door till only a tiny crack was left the man in the lead a tall man with a deadwhite face and black eyes looked at reynolds incuriously as he passed but the other ignored him completely theyre on to you all right jansci had waited till they were out of sight worse still they know youre on to them we should have remembered that every train in and out of budapest is being watched for the duration of this conference know them im afraid so that man with the pale face is avo one of hidas hatchetmen as dangerous as a snake i dont know the other but its an obvious assumption that hes avo also surely the szarhaza they dont know about that yet they cant but your description has been out for a couple of days to every avo man in hungary thats it reynolds nodded slowly of course how are things with you three soldiers in the guards van therell be no one in the wagon behind they never travel in the same wagons as the prisoners theyre sitting with the guard round a redhot wood stove and theres a wine bottle circulating will you manage i think so but how get back reynolds hissed he was leaning against the window both hands in his pockets and gazing down at the ground when the same two men returned he glanced up indifferently raised an eyebrow fractionally as he saw who it was glanced down again and then sideways as he watched them stagger up the length of the corridor and then out of sight psychological warfare jansci murmured a problem and not the only one i cant get into the first three coaches jansci glanced sharply at him but said nothing the military reynolds explained the third carriage from the front is a midaisle coach and full of troops an officer turned me back anyway its no good i tried an outside door handle when i turned my back to him and it was locked from the outside jansci nodded conscripts and the army is trying to discourage a premature return to civilian life any hope at all meechail communication cords not one in the whole length of the train ill manage ive damn well got to you have a seat second last carriage ill give you the tip off ten minutes beforehand id better go theyll be back any second right bataszek in five minutes remember if the train stops there it means that hidas has guessed and got through to them jump out of the blind side and run for it theyre coming reynolds murmured he levered himself off the window and walked forward passing the two men this time both men looked at him with expressionless eyes and reynolds wondered how much more time they would allow to elapse before making their pounce he lurched forward the length of another two coaches went into the toilet at the end of the fourth coach hid his hammer and torch in the tiny triangular cupboard that supported the cracked tin washbasin transferred his gun to his right pocket and closed his hand round it before moving out to the corridor it wasnt his own belgian pistol which had been taken from him it was the counts it had no silencer on it and it was the last thing he wanted to use but to live he might be compelled to use it it all depended on the two men who were shadowing his every movement they were running through the outskirts of bataszek now and reynolds realised all at once that their speed had slackened perceptibly and even as the realisation came he had to brace himself from sliding forwards as the air brakes came on he could feel the curious tingling in the fingertips of the hand that held the gun he left the toilet moved into the middle of the passage between the two opposite doors he had no idea on which side the station platform was going to be made sure that the safetycatch was off his gun and waited tensely his heart hammering heavily slowly in his chest they were still slowing down he had to steady himself as the train battered violently across a set of points then so suddenly that the change of motion caught him off balance the air brakes hissed off the locomotives whistle shrilled once briefly as the train started to accelerate again and bataszek station was only a confused memory of a flickering row of palelyblurred lights lost in the moment of seeing in this greyishwhite curtain of driving snow reynolds grip on his gun eased despite the bitter cold of that coach corridor he could feel the neckband of his collar wet with sweat so too he realised was his gunhand and as he moved across to the lefthand door he withdrew it and wiped it up and down the outside of his coat he pulled the door window down a few inches jammed it up a second later and stepped back gasping to clear his eyes of the whistling blizzard that had lashed whiplike across his forehead and blinded him just in an instant of time he leant back against the wood behind him lit a cigarette and his hands were unsteady it was hopeless he told himself worse than hopeless with a steadily increasing wind gusting up to forty perhaps even fifty miles per hour and the train doing the same speed diagonally into it the combined total strength of that now howling wind outside was that of a whole gale maybe a little more and a whole gale that was no gale at all just a screaming white wall of almost horizontally driving snow and ice even a split second of it on a tiny part of his body while standing in the relative warmth and security of the train had been too much god only knew what it would be like outside for minutes on end with his whole life depending just relentlessly he pushed the thought to one side he moved swiftly through the concertina coupling leading to the next carriage and glanced quickly down the corridor no sign yet of the two men returning he went back to where he had been across to the door on the leeward side opened it cautiously so as not to be dragged out of the train by the vacuum suction on that side gauged the size of the bolthole in the jamb that engaged the door catch closed the door checked that the window worked easily then returned to the toilet here he used his knife to cut a small piece of wood off the small door below the basin and in a couple of minutes he had it trimmed to a shape and size just a fraction larger than that of the bolthole then as soon as he was finished he moved out into the corridor again it was essential that he be seen and keep on being seen by his two shadows if they missed him the hunt would be up the length of the train and there were a hundred maybe two hundred soldiers in the leading coaphes that could be called upon to help them and this time he almost bumped into them as he closed the toilet door behind him they had been hurrying he could see and the relief on the face of the shorter man showed clearly as he saw reynolds emerging the tall pale mans expressionless face did not change but his reaction showed in so sudden a shortening of step that the other bumped into him both men slowed down then stopped a couple of feet away from reynolds reynolds himself made no move he just leaned into a corner to brace his body against the violent shaking of the train and to leave both his hands free for use should the need arise the pale man saw this and his dark flat eyes narrowed fractionally before he brought a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and smiled with a smile that never got any farther than the corner of his lips have you a match comrade certainly help yourself reynolds fished out a book of matches with his left hand and held them out at arms length at the same time his other hand moved slightly in his pocket and the mouth of his gun sharply limned its circular outline through the thin gabardine of his trenchcoat the pale man caught the slight movement and looked down but reynolds eyes never left his face after a moment the pale man looked up regarded reynolds unwinkingly over the flame of the cigarette slowly handed back the matches nodded his thanks and continued on his way unfortunate reynolds thought looking after them but quite unavoidable it had just been a silent challenge a kite flown to see whether or not he had been armed and if he hadnt convinced them reynolds felt sure they would have nailed him there and then he looked at his watch for the tenth time three minutes to go four at the most he could feel the trains speed perceptibly easing as it started its gentle climb and he could have sworn that he had just had his first glimpse of a road outside almost paralleling the railway track he wondered what the chances were of the count and the others having made it there in time he wondered what chances there were that they could make it at all he could hear the wind now clearly hear its highpitched ululation above the rattle and the roar of the train could see the almost solid wall of driving whiteness that limited visibility to only a few feet and unconsciously shook his head in this almost arctic weather a train on rails and a truck on tyres were two vastly different propositions altogether and it was all too easy to visualise the strained face of the count peering through the evernarrowing arcs before him as the wipers struggled vainly to clear the snow battering against the windscreen but he had to depend on it reynolds knew that he had to treat a remote possibility as a certainty he took a last glance at his watch let himself into the toilet once more filled a big earthenware jug with water put it in the cupboard picked up the piece of shaped wood he had left there took it outside opened the leeward door again and jammed the wood into the bolthole knocking it in firmly with the butt of his gun he closed the door again letting the latch gently into the wooden plug and tested it carefully the latch was clear of the bolt but held firmly enough by the wood thirty pounds pressure maybe forty would be required to tear the wood away he walked towards the rear of the train quickly and softly one carriage away two men appeared from a dark corner and followed silently after him but he ignored them he knew they would try nothing while they were opposite the compartments with people in them and when he came to the end of a coach reynolds ran as quickly as possible through the concertina connection into the next and then he was in the second last carriage walking slowly head straight on his shoulders so as to deceive the men behind but his eyes to one side and searching the compartments jansci was in the third compartment reynolds stopped abruptly catching his shadows on the wrong foot stood stiffly to one side to let them pass waited till they were about ten feet away nodded to jansci then ran back the way he had come praying that he would not bump into anyone a portly man blocking the corridors just then could have been the end of everything he could hear the footsteps pounding behind him increased his speed and that was almost his undoing he slipped on a wet corner struck his head against a window bar fell but forced himself to his feet ignoring the sharp almost stunning pain and the bright lights that flashed in front of his eyes and ran on again two carriages three carriages four and this was his he rounded a corner sharply dodged into the toilet banged the door shut behind him as loudly as possible he didnt want his pursuers to be in a moments doubt as to where he had gone and locked it once inside he wasted no time he picked up the big earthenware jar of water stuffed a dirty towel into the top to retain as much of the water as possible took a step backwards and flung the jar with all his strength through the window the crash was all that he had hoped for and more the noise almost deafening in that confined space and the sound of the shattering glass was still in his ears when he took the gun from his pocket caught it by the barrel switched off the light softly eased the lock and stepped into the corridor the shadows had the window down and were peering out leaning as far as possible crowding each other in their eagerness to see what had happened where reynolds had gone they would have been less than human to have done anything else reynolds didnt even break step as he came through the door one long stride a leap propelled by all the strength of his legs his feet stiffly in front of him smashing into the back of the nearest man and the door burst open one of the men catapulting out into the driving snow and the gloom before he had even time to cry out the other the palefaced man twisted impossibly in midair caught the inside edge of the door with one hand his face contorted with venom and fear as he fought like a wildcat to pull himself inside but the whole struggle lasted perhaps only two seconds and reynolds was merciless his downward clubbing pistol aimed at the snarling face changing direction in the last moment as the mans free hand came up in instinctive protection the butt struck the fingers clinging to the doorway with a force that jarred reynolds arm to the elbow and then there was no man in the doorway only the gathering darkness of the night and a thin high scream lost in the thunder of the wheels and the high threnody of the wind it took reynolds seconds only to work the already loosened piece of wood free of the bolthole and shut the door securely then he stuffed his gun into his pocket retrieved the hammer and the torch from the toilet and moved across to the opposite door of the coach on the windward side it was here that he had his first setback and one that all but defeated him before he had even started the train was now angling due southwest towards pecs the gale of wind and snow out of the southeast was blowing directly on the beam and it seemed as if an even stronger man than himself were pushing against him on the other side twice three times he heaved with all his strength but the door gave no more than an inch little enough time was left seven minutes perhaps eight at the most he reached up caught the metal grip at the top of the window brought it right down in one convulsive jerk and had he not dropped to the floor the blast of wind and snow that shrieked in through the open window would have blown him clear across to the other side of the coach it was even worse than he had imagined it would be he could understand now that the driver was slowing up not because of the incline but because he wanted to keep his train on the rails and for one bad moment reynolds was tempted to give up the whole suicidal project then he thought of the professor sitting alone in the last wagon among a pack of hardened criminals of jansci and all the others who were depending on him of the girl who had turned her back on him when he had made to say goodbye and the next moment he was on his feet gasping as the bulleting snow lashed cruelly across his exposed face and sucked the breath from his lungs he heaved with all his strength once twice three times unmindful of the fact that a sudden lull in the wind would have pitched him helplessly out into the snow and on the fourth attempt managed to get the sole of his shoe stuck in the opening he got his forearm into the crack then his shoulder and finally half his body pressed outwards with all the strength of his arms reached down with a groping right foot until he found the snowencrusted runningboard and brought his left foot into the gap of the door it was then that the hammer and torch in his inside pocket caught on the inside jamb of the door and he stood there for almost a minute a minute that seemed an eternity jammed between door and side of the coach struggling frantically to free himself fearing that at any moment someone might come along the corridor to investigate the source of the snowladen gale that was whistling the length of the carriage and then suddenly with a ripping of buttons and tearing of cloth he was free freed with a jerk that caused his right foot to slip off the runningboard and he hung there for a moment supported only by his left hand and the left foot still jammed in the doorway then he hauled himself slowly painfully upright he could get no purchase anywhere for his right hand regained his footing on the board stood there for a moment until he had regained control of himself got his left hand out hooked it round the inside of the open window and jerked his left sole free the door shut with a crash and he was now completely outside supported only by the already numbing fingers of his left hand and the pressure of the wind pinning him against the carriage side it was dusk now but though there was still enough light to see by he could not see for with the driving snow he was a blind man groping in a blind world he was he knew at the very end of the coach and the corner was only a foot from where he stood but though he could reach his right arm almost two feet round the comer he could find not the smallest projection to give him purchase of any kind at the fullest stretch of his left arm he tried with his right foot and found the narrow lateral steel member that housed the bumpers but it was at far too acute an angle to serve his purpose he tried to find the bumper but it eluded him his left forearm was beginning to ache with the strain of supporting his weight and his fingers were now so numbed that he had no means of knowing whether they were slipping or not he hauled himself upright outside the carriage door window again changed arms cursed himself for his stupidity as he suddenly thought of his torch changed hands again and once more leaned back and as far round the corner as he could this time with the beam of the powerful torch probing through the gloom and the snow it took him only two seconds to see all he wanted to see and memorise the relative positions of the lateral steel member at the back of the coach the concertina coupling and the steel bumper that seemed to leap uncontrollably from side to side as every jolting sway of the train caused a violent change in position relative to the opposing bumper on the next carriage he pulled himself quickly upright thrust the torch back in his pocket and didnt hesitate because he was dimly aware without admitting it to himself that if he as much as paused to consider the near certainty of a miss a slip and being crushed to instant death under the wheels he could never have brought himself to do what he now did at once without any thought for the consequences he moved both feet along till they were at the very edge of the runningboard released his grip with his left hand stood there held against the outcurving side of the carriage by wind pressure alone then lifted his right foot into blind space his body curving far over to the left as he did so for an instant of time he was poised there in midair the toe of his left shoe the only contact he had left with the train and then in the very moment of that toe slipping off the frozen runningboard the wind caught him and he flung himself forward into the darkness he landed with one knee on the lateral member the shin of the other leg striking cruelly across the bumper even as his outstretched hands struck against the stiffly yielding side of the concertina coupling such was his momentum that his right leg slipped at once across the frozen metal of the bumper but he tightened his leg muscles convulsively and hooked his instep round the narrowest part of the bumper as his knees pointed down to the track rushing by beneath for a few seconds he hung there supported only by the counteracting pressures of his arms and one shin wondering vaguely whether his leg had been broken then he felt his hands for all the maximum pressure he was exerting against them begin to slip helplessly down the smooth snowcovered material of the coupling despairingly he flung out his left hand struck it painfully against the back of the carriage he had just left pushed it forward and felt his stiffened outstretched fingers slide in the narrow gap between the carriage and its coupling he clutched the rough edge of the toughened rubberised fabric as if he were seeking to drive his hooking fingers clear through it and three seconds later he was standing upright on the lateral member securely anchored by his left hand and trembling uncontrollably from the reaction of his effort but the trembling was from the reaction only reynolds afraid only moments ago as he had never been afraid before had crossed that nebulous frontier between fear and that strange world of uncaring and selfless indifference that lies beyond with his right hand he felt for his spring knife clicked open the blade and thrust the dagger point into the material about waistheight there could have been a dozen people streaming through the inside of the concertina coupling at that instant for all he cared a few seconds vigorous sawing with the blades razor edges and he had a hole cut in the material large enough to accommodate the toe of one foot and at headheight he cut another for a handgrip then he thrust his right toe into the first hole his left hand into the second pushed and heaved upwards and drove the blade into the hilt through the top of the coupling to give him a secure handhold and then he was on top clinging desperately to the handle of the knife as the full force of the wind caught him and sought to blow him over the other side of the wildly vibrating coupling the first carriage the fourth from the front that was proved to be relatively easy the narrow metal sheathing for the ventilation louvers ran the entire length of the carriage along the top and it took him less than half a minute lying on the leeward side of the roof with his face bowed against the knifing blizzard and overhanding himself along the sheathing to reach the far end all the way along his feet had hung out over the edge but he could do nothing about this he should have been able to get some purchase with his toes on the guttering but it was blocked and smooth with frozen snow and now he was reaching out gingerly on top of the corrugations of the next carriage coupling and had no sooner let go of the security of the ventilation sheathing that he realised the mistake he had made he should have launched himself across in a dive for the other side instead of exposing himself to that shrieking wind that was beginning to gust most dangerously now one moment all but blowing him clear over the far side of the furiously vibrating coupling the next easing so unexpectedly that he had to hang on grimly to prevent himself toppling off into the wind but by flattening himself as low as possible and working his handgrip from corrugation to corrugation he safely reached the end of the third carriage it was again a relatively easy matter to traverse this and when he reached the front he sat up swung his legs over on to the next coupling bent low and launched himself across the intervening space barking one of his knees badly as it struck the sheeting on the second carriage but getting a secure grip at the time seconds later only it seemed he was at the front end of the second carriage and it was then as he swung his legs out on to the coupling that he saw it the wavering dipping beams of headlights vanishing and reappearing through swirling flurries of snow on a road that paralleled the railway track not twenty yards away the elation that swept through reynolds banished for the moment all thought of exhaustion and cold and numbed senseless hands that could not serve him very much longer it could have been anyone of course driving that vehicle out there in the blinding snow but reynolds was oddly certain it wasnt he stooped again poised on his toes and launched himself across on to the roof of the first carriage it wasnt until he arrived there and was skidding along helplessly on his face that he realised that this carriage unlike the others had no ventilation sheathing running along the top for a moment panic returned again and he scrabbled furiously on the icesmooth slippery surface of the roof seeking for a handhold any handhold then he forced himself to be calm for that frantic threshing of legs and arms was exactly what was required to destroy what little friction coefficient there was between himself and the train and send him sliding helplessly over the side to his death there must he told himself desperately be ventilators of some kind or other and suddenly he knew what they must be those little tophatted chimneys spaced three or four to a coach and it was just at that moment he realised something else the train was curving round sharply into the wind and the centrifugal force was sending him sliding slowly remorselessly towards the edge he was sliding feet first face down and his toes beat a furious tattoo on the carriage roof as he sought to crack the frozen snow that filled up the guttering and gain at least a toehold but the snow was frozen into ice he smashed against it in vain and the first he knew that he had failed was when his shins struck painfully against the edge of the carriage roof and still the train kept curving round that interminable corner his knees now rested on the edge of the roof and his nails were breaking off as his fingers hooked into rigid talons furrowed through the smooth ice on the carriage top he knew nothing could save him and he could never afterwards explain what strange subconscious instinct for in that moment of approaching death his mind had ceased to work altogether had caused him to jerk out his knife press the release catch and bury the blade in the roof just before his hips reached the side and he had passed the point of no return how long he lay there at the full stretch of his knife he did not know it could have been only seconds gradually he became aware that the track beneath him had straightened out again that centrifugal force no longer had him in its murderous grip and that he was free to move once more although with infinite caution inch by inch he slowly pulled his legs back on to the roof again freed the knife stabbed it in farther up and gradually hauled himself on to the top a moment later still using his knife as his sole support he found the first circular ventilator and clutched it as if he would never let it go but he had to let it go there could only be two or three minutes left he had to reach the next ventilator he reached out in its direction raised the knife and stabbed it down but it struck some metal probably a bolt head with a jarring shock and when he brought it up to his eyes he saw that the blade had been snapped off cleanly at the hilt he flung ae handle away braced his feet against the ventilator and pushed off along the roof colliding heavily with the next ventilator perhaps only six feet away seconds later again using his feet to propel him forward from one ventilator to the next he had reached the third one and then the fourth and then he had realised he did not know how long the carriage was whether there were any more ventilators whether or not another push along the top of the carriage would send him skidding helplessly over the front of the carriage to fall to his death under the wheels of the train he decided to risk it placed his feet against the ventilator and was on the point of pushing off when the thought struck him that with any height at all he should be able to see from there into the cab of the locomotive and see limned against its brightness perhaps the edge of that coach for the snow was beginning to ease at last he knelt upright the ventilator clutched tightly between his thighs and his heart turned slowly over as he saw the edge of the carriage silhouetted clearly against the red glow from the locomotives open firebox a bare four feet away in die cab itself through the flurries of snow he caught a glimpse of the engineer and of his fireman turning and stooping as he shovelled coal from the tender into the firebox and he could see something that had no right to be there but which he might have expected a soldier armed with a carbine crouched for protection from the cold close into the gaping red maw of the firebox reynolds fumbled for his gun but all the feeling had left his hands he couldnt even get his frozen forefinger through the triggerguard he thrust it back in his pocket and rose quickly to his feet leaning far into the wind the ventilator still locked between his legs it was all or nothing now he took one short step the sole of his right shoe found the edge of the carriage with the second step he was in midair then he was sliding and slithering down the sloping crumbling coal of the tender to land on his shoulder and side temporarily winded at the back of the footplate they turned to stare at him all three engineer stoker and soldier turned to stare at him their faces almost comical in bewilderment and disbelief perhaps five seconds elapsed five precious seconds that enabled reynolds partially to regain his breath before the soldier abruptly recovered from his astonishment unslung his rifle swept the butt high in the air and leapt towards the prostrate reynolds reynolds grasped a lump of coal the first thing that came to hand and flung it despairingly at the advancing man but his fingers were too numb and as the soldier ducked low the coal flew high over his head missing him completely but the fireman didnt miss and the soldier collapsed on to the footplate as the flat of the shovel caught him on the back of the head reynolds scrambled to his feet with the torn clothes and bleeding frostwhitened hands and face streaked with coal dust he was an incredible spectacle but at that moment quite oblivious of the fact he stared at the fireman a big curlyhaired youngster with his shirt sleeves rolled far up in defiance of the bitter cold then transferred his gaze to the soldier at his feet the heat the youngster was grinning he was suddenly overcome but why look friend i dont know who youre for but i know who im against he leaned on his shovel can we help you you certainly can reynolds rapidly explained and the two men looked at each other the older man the driver hesitated we have to think of ourselves look reynolds ripped his coat open a rope take it off will you my hands are about gone you can tie each others wrists that should of course the younger man grinned even as the driver reached for the airbrake lever we were held up five or six men at least safe home my friend reynolds hardly stopped to thank the men who helped him so casually with so little thought for themselves the train was slowing down quickly on that incline and he had to get to the back wagon before it stopped altogether and the tightening of the coupling made it impossible to free it he jumped out from the lowest cab step tumbled head over heels regained his feet and started running back the train was almost stopped now as the guards van crawled past him and he had a momentary heartwarming glimpse of jansci standing in the open door at the rear of the van a gun rocksteady in his hand then the buffers were banging and rattling together as the locomotive up front came to a halt reynolds had his torch switched on and was lifting the towing links clear and knocking off the airbrake flange coupling with his hammer he looked briefly for a steam coupling but there was none convicts didnt need heat he had severed all connections between the last wagon and the train all the carriages were now jolting backwards under the impetus of the releasing pressure of the compressed buffer springs jansci a bunch of keys swinging in one hand and the levelled gun still in the other was stepping across from the guards van to the cattle truck and reynolds himself was just grabbing hold of the handrail when the guards van bumped violently into the truck and gave it its initial impetus for the run down the long gentle hill they had just climbed the big brake wheel was on the outside of the wagon and reynolds was beginning to turn this perhaps a mile after they had left the main train when jansci finally found the right key for the wagon kicked the door open and flashed his torch inside half a mile farther on reynolds was just giving the wheel its final lock and bringing the coach to a gentle standstill watched by a smiling jansci and a dr jennings who had been at first dazed then unbelieving but now as wildly excited as any schoolboy and they had barely left the wagon and were striking out for the west where they knew the road lay when they heard a cry and saw a figure floundering towards them through the deep snow it was the count all aristocratic reserve gone yelling and shouting and waving his arms like a madman chapter eleven they arrived at janscis headquarters in this country not ten miles from the austrian frontier at half past six hi the following morning they arrived after fourteen consecutive hours motoring over the frozen snowbound roads of hungary at an average speed of well under twenty miles an hour after fourteen of the coldest most uncomfortable most exhausting hours travelling that reynolds had ever done in his life but they arrived and for all their cold and hunger and weariness and sleeplessness they arrived in tremendous spirits their elation buoying them up above all their distress all except the count who after his first outburst of gladness at their safety and success had relapsed as the long hours of the night wheeled by into his usual remote detached mood of sombre cynicism they had covered exactly four hundred endless gruelling kilometres in the course of that night and the count had driven every kilometre of the way stopping twice only for petrol rousing reluctant sleeping pump attendants with the twin menaces of his voice and uniform more than once as the lines of strain had etched themselves more and more deeply into the counts lean face reynolds had been on the point of suggesting that he take over but each time his common sense had come to the rescue and he had refrained as he had observed on that first drive in the black mercedes the count as a driver was in a world all of his own and on these snow bound treacherous roads it was more important that they should arrive safely than that the counts exhaustion should be relieved and so for most of the night reynolds had sat and dozed and watched him as did the cossack by his side both of them being in the relatively warm cab for the same reasonto thaw out the cossack had been in far worse case than even reynolds and understandably so for the last half of the distance between szekszard and pecs almost twenty miles he had been perched outside the truck jammed between fender and bonnet keeping the screen completely clear for the count as he had driven through the blinding snow and it had been on that fender that he had his grandstand view of reynolds suicidal climb across the coach roofs and there was no scowl now in his face as he looked at reynolds just a kind of awed wonder the direct route from pecs to janscis house in the country would have been just under half of the actual distance they had covered but both jansci and the count had been convinced that taking that route could only have had one end a concentration camp the fiftymile stretch of lake balaton blocked off most of the escape routes to the austrian border in the west and both men had been sure that between its southern tip and the yugoslavian border not even the most insignificant road would be left unwatched the other routes to the west between the northern tip of balaton and budapest might or might not have been watched but they had taken no chances they had gone kilometres due north circled round the northern outskirts of the capital itself then taken the main highway to austria branching off to the southwest as they approached gyor and so it had taken them fourteen hours and kilometres and brought them to their destination cold and hungry and exhausted but once inside the safety and shelter of the house these things fell from them like a cloak and when jansci and the cossack produced a roaring fire in the wood stove sandor a cooking pot and a magnificent smell of cooking and the count a bottle of barack from a more than adequate stock he kept in the house their relief at their safe arrival their jubilation at having completely thwarted the avo expressed itself in talk and laughter and still more talk and with warm food inside them and the counts barack bringing life back to frozen bodies and limbs all thought of weariness and sleep was forgotten there would be time enough for sleep they had all day for sleep for jansci wasnt going to make his attempt at the border till after midnight of that day eight oclock came and with it the weather and news reports over the big modern radio jansci had recently installed in the house of their own activities and the rescue of the professor there was no mention nor had they expected any such a confession of failure was the last thing the communists would make to their satellite subjects the weather report which predicted further heavy and continuous snowfalls over almost the entire country contained an item of extreme interest all southwest hungary in an area stretching east from lake balaton to szeged on the yugoslavian border was completely immobilised by the severest snowstorm since the war every road railway line and airport being completely blocked jansci and the others listened in a silence more eloquent of their relief than any words could have been had their attempt been made twelve hours later both rescue and escape would have been impossible nine oclock came and with it the first grey tinges of dawn through the again thickly falling snow the second bottle of barack and the recounting of many stories jansci told of their sojourn in the szarhaza the count already with half a bottle of brandy inside him gave an ironic account of his interview with furmint and reynolds himself had to tell several times over of his perilous journey across the top of the train to all this the most avid listener by far was the old professor whose feeling towards his russians hosts as jansci and reynolds had observed when they had seen him in the szarhaza had undergone a radical and violent change the beginnings of the change and their change towards him had come he said when he had refused to speak at the conference until he knew what had happened to his son and when he had heard that his son had escaped he refused to speak anyway the russians last hold over him was gone being thrown into the szarhaza had made him more furious than ever and the final indignity of being imprisoned in the same freezing cattle truck as a band of hardened criminals had completed his conversion in no uncertain fashion and when he had heard of the tortures inflicted on jansci and reynolds his fury had known no bounds he swore in a most uncharacteristic fashion wait he said by heavens just wait till i get home the last frontier the british government their precious projects their missiles damn their projects and the missiles ive got more important things to do first such as jansci asked mildly communism jennings downed his glass of barack and his voice was almost a shout im not boasting but ive got the ear of nearly all the big newspapers in the country theyll listen to me especially when they remember the damned poppycock i used to talk before ill expose the whole damned rotten system of communism and by the time im finished too late the interruption came from the count and the tone was ironic what do you mean too late jennings demanded the count just means that communism has already been pretty thoroughly exposed jansci said soothingly and without offence dr jennings by people who have suffered for years under it not just a weekend as you have you expect me to go back to london and sit on my hands jennings broke off and when he spoke again ms tone was calmer damn it man its the duty of everyone all right all right im late in seeing it but i see it now its the duty of everyone to do what he can to stop the spread of this damned creed too late again the dry interruption came from the count he just means that communism outside its homeland is failing of its own accord jansci explained hastily you dont need to stop it dr jennings its already stopped oh it works here and there but only to a limited extent and then only among primitive peoples like the mongols who fall for the fine phrases and the even finer promises but not with us not with the hungarians czechs poles or others not in any country where the people are more politically advanced than the russians themselves take this country itself who were the most heavily indoctrinated people the youth i should imagine jennings was holding his impatience in check only with difficulty they always are the youth jansci nodded and the pampered darlings of communism the writers the intellectuals the lionised workers of heavy industry and who led the revolt here against the russians exactly the same people the young the intellectuals and the workers the fact that i think that the the last frontier whole rising was futile crazily illtimed has nothing to do with it the point is that communism failed most completely in those among whom it had the best chance of succeeding if it were ever to succeed and you should see the churches in my country the count murmured crowded masses every sunday packed with kids you wouldnt worry about communism so much then professor in fact he added dryly the only thing to match the failure of communism in our countries is its remarkable success in countries like italy and france who have never seen one of these in their lives he gestured with evident distaste at the uniform he was wearing and shook his head sadly human nature is a wonderful thing then what the devil would you have me do jennings demanded forget the whole damned thing no jansci shook his head with just a trace of weariness thats the last thing i want you to do thats the last thing i want anyone to do there may be a greater crime a greater sin than indifference but i dont know of it no dr jennings what i should like you to do is to go home and tell your people that we in central europe have only our one little life apiece to lead and time is running out tell them that we would like to smell the sweet air of freedom just once before we go tell them that we have been waiting for seventeen long years now and hope cannot last for ever tell them we dont want our children and our childrens children to walk along the dark and endless road of slavery and never see a light at the end tell them we dont want much we only want a little peace green fields and church bells and carefree children playing in the sun without fear without want without wondering what dark clouds tomorrow must surely bring jansci leant forward in his chair his glass forgotten the tired lined face beneath the thick white hair ruddy in the flickering flames of the fire earnest and intense as reynolds had never seen tell them tell your people at home that our lives and the lives of generations to come lie in their hands tell them that there is only one thing that ultimately matters on this earth and that is peace on this earth and tell them that this is a very small earth and growing smaller with every year that passes but that we all have to live on it together that we all must live on it together coexistence dr jennings raised an eyebrow coexistence a terrible word a big bogeyman word but what else could any sane man ever offer in its place all the nameless horrors of a thermonuclear war the requiem for the lost hopes of mankind no coexistence must come it must if mankind is to survive but this world without spheres the dream of that great american cordell hull will never come if you have impetuous fools as you do have dr jennings shouting for big results now here today it will never come so long as people in the west think in terms of parachute diplomacy of helping us to help ourselves my god theyve never seen even a single mongol division in action or they wouldnt talk such arrant nonsense it will never come while people talk dangerous drivel about the russian people being their secret allies who say get at the russian people or listen to the gratuitous advice of people who fled these unhappy countries of ours years ago and have lost all contact with what we are thinking and feeling today most of all it will never come so long as our leaders and governments our newspapers and our propagandists teach us incessantly insistently that we must hate and fear and despise all the other peoples who share this same tiny world with us the nationalism of those who cry we are the people the jingoistic brand of patriotism these are the great evils of our world today the barriers to peace that no man can overcome what hope is there for the world as long as we cling to the outmoded forms of national allegiance we owe allegiance to no one dr jennings at least not on this earth jansci smiled christ came to save mankind we are told but maybe he has made a special exception in the case of the russians what jansci is trying to tell you dr jennings the count murmured is that all youve got to do is to convert the western world to christianity and all will be well not quite jansci shook his head what i say applies to the russians even more than the western world but i think the first move must come from the western world a maturer people a more politically advanced people and not nearly so afraid of the russians as the russians are of them talk jennings was no longer angry not even ironic just thoughtful talk talk just talk itll require a great deal more than that my friend to bring about the millennium it needs action first move you said what move heaven only knows jansci shook his head i dont if i did know no name in all history would be so revered as that of majorgeneral illyurin no man can do more no man dare do more than make suggestions no one spoke and after a time jansci went on slowly it is essential i think to hammer home the idea of peace the idea of disarmament to convince the russians above all things of our peaceful intentions peaceful intentions jansci laughed without mirth the british and the americans filling the armouries of the nations of western europe with hydrogen bombs what a way to demonstrate peaceful intentions what a way rather to ensure that russia will never relax its grip on the satellites it no longer wants what a way to drive the men of the kremlin scared men i tell you inexorably nearer the last thing in the world they want to do sending the first intercontinental missile on its way the last thing they want to do the last act of panic or desperation because they know better than any that though in their deep cellars in moscow they may survive the retaliation that will surely come they will never survive the vengeful fury of the crazed survivors of the holocaust that will just as surely engulf their own nation to arm europe is to provoke the russians to the point of madness whatever else we may not do it is essential to avoid all provocation to keep the door of negotiation and approach always open no matter what the rebuffs may be it is essential to watch em like hawks i would say reynolds commented alas i thought we had made him see the light the count mourned perhaps we never will perhaps not jansci agreed but hes right all the same in the one hand the big gun in the other the olive branch but the safetycatch must always be on and the hand of peace always a little in advance and you must be endlessly patient rashness impatience could bring the world to catastrophe patience endless patience what matter a blow to your pride when the peace of the world is at stake you must try to meet them in as many fields as possible culture sport literature holidays all those things are important enough anything that brings people into contact with one another and lets them see the idiocies of chauvinism is bound to be important but the great opening lies in trade meet them in trade and never care how many concessions you make the losses would be negligible in exchange for the goodwill gained the suspicions allayed and get your churches to help as they are helping now here and in poland cardinal wyszinski who walks handinhand with gomulka of poland knows more about the way to achieve the peace of the world that must eventually come than i ever will people all over poland today walk in freedom talk in freedom worship in freedom and who knows what another five years may bring and all because men of vastly different creeds but of an equally great goodwill determined that they were going to get on together and get on well no matter what sacrifices they had to make no matter what blows to their pride they had received and that i think is the real answer not the proposing of courses of action as dr jennings suggested but in creating the climate of goodwill in which those actions can flower and bear fruit ask the rulers of the great nations who should be leading our sick world to a better tomorrow what their greatest need of today is and they will tell you scientists and still more scientists those luckless brilliant creatures who have long since traded in their birthright of independence buried their consciences and sold out to the governments of the world so that they can strive harder and still harder until they have in their hands the ultimate weapon of destruction jansci paused and wearily shook his head the governments of the world may not be mad but they are blind and their blindness is but one step removed from insanity the desperate most urgent need this world knows or will ever know is the need for an effort without parallel in history to get to know ourselves and the other people of the world even as well as we know ourselves and then we will see that the other man is just as we are that right and virtue and truth belongs to him as much as it does to us we must think of people not as a conglomerate mass not conveniently indiscriminately as a faceless nation we must always remember that a nation is made of millions of little human beings just like we are and to talk about national sin and guilt and wickedness is to be wilfully blind unjust and unchristian and while it is true that such a nation may go off the rails it never goes off because it wants to but because it couldnt help it because there was something in its past or in its environment that inescapably made it what it is today just as some forgotten incidents some influences that we can neither recall nor understand has made each one of us what we are today and with that understanding and knowledge there will come compassion and no power on earth can compete against compassion the compassion that makes the jewish society issue worldwide appeals for money for their sworn but starving enemies the arab refugees the compassion that made a russian soldier thrust his gun into sanders hands the compassion compassion born of understanding that made nearly all the russians who were stationed in budapest refuse to fight the hungarians whom they had come to know so well and this compassion this charity will come it must come but men the world over must want to make it come there is no certainty that it will come in our time its a gamble it must be a gamble but better surely a gamble from hope however tenuous that hope than a gamble from despair and pressing the button that sends the first intercontinental missile on its way but for the gamble to succeed understanding comes first mountains rivers seas are no longer the barriers that separate mankind just the minds of mankind itself the intolerance of ignorance not wanting to know that is the last real frontier left on earth for a long time after jansci had finished speaking only the crackling of pine logs in the fire and the gentle singing of a kettle broke the silence in the room the fire seemed to fascinate to hypnotise everyone sitting there and they stared into it as if by staring long enough they could see the future of janscis dream but it wasnt the fire that fascinated them k had been the effect of janscis quiet insistent hypnotic voice and what his voice had said and the memory lingered long even the professor had lost all his anger and reynolds reflected wryly that if colonel mackintosh could only know the thoughts that were running through his mind at that moment he would be unemployed as soon as he arrived back in england after a time the count rose to his feet walked round replenishing the empty glasses then took his seat again and all in silence no one even looked at him as he was doing it no one it seemed wanted to be the first to break the silence or even wanted the silence to break they were all deep sunk in their own private thoughts reynolds was thinking almost inevitably perhaps of the long dead english poet who had said centuries ago almost exactly what jansci had been saying then when the interruption came the harsh strident ringing of a telephone bell and it came so pat with reynolds thoughts the bell tolled the answer was not long to wait it tolled for jansci jansci startled out of a deep reverie sat up transferred his glass to his right hand and picked up the telephone with his other as the phone was lifted off its receiver the ringing stopped abruptly and in its place clearly audible to everyone in the room came a highpitched shriek a longdrawnout scream of agony which faded away into a thin horrible whisper as jansci pressed the phone to his ear the whisper gave way to staccato words then a lighter higher sobbing voice but what the words were no one could distinguish one ivoryknuckled hand was pressing the receiver so hard to janscis ear that only vague incoherent sounds could escape the others in the room could do no more than watch janscis face and as they watched it hardened into a mask of stone and the ruddy colour drained slowly from his cheeks until they were as pale almost as the snowwhite hair above twenty seconds perhaps thirty passed without jansci speaking a word then there came a sudden crack and a splintering of glass and the tumbler in janscis hand crashed and broke and shivered into a hundred fragments as it fell on to the stone floor and the blood from the scarred misshapen hand began to well and flow and drip steadily down among the shattered pieces ofglass jansci didnt even know it had happened his whole mind his whole being was at that moment at the other end of that telephone wire then he said suddenly call you back listened for another few moments whispered no no in a low strangled voice and thrust the phone violently back on its rest but not before the others had time to hear the same sound as they had heard when jansci had picked up thephone a hoarse scream of pain that ended as if sheared by a guillotine as the connection went that was a silly thing to do wasnt it jansci staring down at his hand was the first to speak and his voice was quiet and empty of all life he drew out a handkerchief and dabbed at the streaming blood and such a waste of all that good barack my apologies vladimir it was the first time that anyone had ever heard him call the count by his true name what in the name of god was that old jennings hands were shaking so that the brandy spilled over the lip of his glass and his voice was a trembling whisper that was the answer to many things jansci wrapped the handkerchief round his hand clenched his fist to keep it in place and stared into the dullred heart of the fire we know now why imre went missing we know now why the count was betrayed they caught imre and they took him down to stalin street and he talked to them just before he died imre the count whispered before he died heaven forgive me i thought he had run out on us he looked uncomprehendingly across at the telephone you mean that imre died yesterday jansci murmured poor lost lonely imre that was julia imre had told them where she was and they went out to the country and took her just as she was leaving to come here and then they made her tell where this place was reynolds chair crashed over backwards as he rose to his feet and his lower teeth were showing like a wolfs that was julia screaming his voice was hoarse and unreal totally unlike his normal voice they tortured her they tortured her that was julia hidas wanted to show that he meant business janscis dull voice became muffled as he buried his face in his hands but they didnt torture julia they tortured catherine in front of julia and julia had to tell reynolds stared at him uncomprehendingly jennings looked baffled and fearful and the count was swearing to himself over and over a meaningless blasphemous litany of oaths and reynolds knew that the count understood and then jansci was talking mumbling to himself and all of a sudden reynolds understood also and he felt sick and fumbled his chair upright and sat down his legs seemed to have become weak and nerveless i knew she hadnt died jansci muttered i always knew she hadnt died i never gave up hoping did i vladimir i knew she hadnt died oh god why didnt you let her die why didnt you make her die janscis wife reynolds realised dully his wife was still alive julia had said that she must have died died within days of the avo taking her away but she hadnt died the same faith and hope that had kept jansci searching the breadth of hungary in the sure knowledge that she lived must also have kept the spark of life burning in catherine firm in the faith that one day jansci would find her but now they had her hidas had left the szarhaza because he had known where to find her these devils of the avo had her and they had julia and that was a thousand times worse unbid shadowy pictures of her crossed his mind the mischievous way she had smiled at him when she had kissed him goodbye near margit island the deep concern in her face when she had seen what coco had done to him how she had been looking at him when he wakened from sleep the dead dull look and the clouded eyes when foreknowledge of coming tragedy had touched her mind suddenly without being aware that he had had any intention of doing so reynolds rose to his feet where did the call come from jansci his voice was back to normal again no trace of the icecold rage showing through the andrassy ut what does it matter meechail we can get them back for you we can go now and get them back just the count and myself we can do it if any two men alive could do it i can see these two before me now but even you cannot do it jansci smiled a slow wan smile that hardly touched his lips but none the less he smiled the job only the job nothing but your job that is your creed what you live by your job is done what would colonel mackintosh think meechail i dont know jansci reynolds said slowly i dont know and god knows i dont even care im through im finished ive done my last job for colonel mackintosh ive done my last job for our intelligence service so with your permission the count and i one moment jansci held up his hand theres more to it than that its even worse than you think what did you say dr jennings catherine the old man murmured what a strange coincidence my wifes name is catherine also the coincidence is affecting us even deeper than that im afraid professor for a long time jansci gazed sightlessly into the fire then he stirred the british used your wife as a lever against you and now of course of course jennings murmured he was no longer trembling but quiet and unafraid it is obvious is it not why else should they have rung up i shall leave at once leave at once reynolds stared what does he mean if you knew hidas as well as i the count said you wouldnt have to ask a straight trade is it not jansci catherine and julia returned alive in exchange for the professor here thats what they say theyll give them back to me if i return the professor jansci shook his head slowly finally it cannot be of course it cannot be i cannot give you up i cannot give you back god only knows what they might do to you if they had hands on you again but you must you must jennings was on his feet and was staring down at jansci they will not harm me i am too useful to them your wife jansci your family what is my freedom compared to their lives you have no choice in the matter i am going you would give my family back to me and you would never see your own again do you realise what you are saying dr jennings yes jennings spoke quietly doggedly i do know what im saying its not the separation thats so important its just that if i go to them both our families will be alive and who knows freedom may come my way again if i dont your wife and daughter die surely you can see that jansci nodded and reynolds even through his anxiety through his almost overpowering anger could still feel pity could feel heartsorry for any man presented with such a cruel inhuman choice and that the choice should be presented to a man like jansci a man who only moments ago had been preaching the creed of loving his enemies of the need for understanding and helping and conciliating his communist brother made everything so bitterly intolerable and then jansci cleared his throat to speak and reynolds knew what he was going to say even before he said it i am more glad than ever dr jennings that i have helped in what little way i could to save you you are a brave man and a good man but you shall not die for me or mine i will tell colonel hidas no i will tell colonel hidas the count interrupted he crossed to the phone cranked a handle and gave a number the colonel is always so pleased to have reports from his junior officers no jansci leave this to me you have never questioned my judgement before i beg of you dont start doing it now he broke off stiffened slightly then relaxed and smiled colonel hidas exmajor howarth here in excellent health im glad to say yes we have thought over your proposition and have one to make in return i know how grievously you must miss me me the most efficient officer in the avo a fact vouched for you will remember by no less a person than yourself and propose to remedy this if i can guarantee that professor jennings will not talk when he reaches the west will you accept myself a humble makeweight to be sure in exchange for majorgeneral illyurins wife and daughter yes yes certainly ill wait but i havent all day he cradled the phone in his hand and turned to face both the professor and jansci holding out a hand to stop their protestations and the professors futile efforts to take the phone from him rest easy gentlemen and reassure yourselves noble selfsacrifice has little appeal for me in fact not to put too fine a point on it it has none at all ah colonel hidas ah so i feared as much a blow to my selfesteem but then i am i suppose only a little fish then the professor it must be yes he is more than willing he will not go back to budapest for the transfer colonel hidas do you think we are mad if we go there then you have all three so if you insist on budapest then dr jennings crosses the border tonight and nothing you or any man in hungary can do can prevent that you know that better than aha i thought you would see reason you always were so reasonable a man were you not then listen carefully about three kilometres north of this house the generals daughter will show you the way here if you cannot find it easily a side road branches off to the left follow this road it ends about eight kilometres farther on at a small ferry across a tributary of the raab remain there about three kilometres to the north there is a wooden bridge over the same stream we are going to cross that destroy it so that you will not be tempted to follow it and make our way south to the ferrymans house opposite which you will arrive there is a small ropeoperated boat there which we will use to effect the transfer of prisoners all this is clear to you there was a long pause the faintly metallic indistinguishable murmur of hidas voice was the only sound in the silence of the room then the count said wait a moment covered the mouthpiece with his hand and turned to the others he says he must have an hours delay they must have government permission its quite likely its also more than likely that in normal circumstances our dear friend would use that hour to call up the army to surround us or the air force to drop a few wellchosen bombs down the chimney impossible jansci shook his head the nearest army units are at kaposvar south of balaton and we know from the radio that they must be completely bogged down and the nearest air force bases are up at the czech border the count glanced through the window at the grey world of driving snow even if they arent unserviceable or closed in no aircraft could ever find us in this weather we take a chance we take a chance jansci echoed you have your hour colonel hidas the count had removed his hand from the mouthpiece call us a minute late and youll find us gone one other thing you will come by way of the village of vylok and by no other way we do not wish to have our escape route cut off and you know the size of our organisation we will have every other road north of szombathely covered and if a car or truck as much as stirs along these roads you will arrive here to find us gone until we meet then my dear colonel in about three hours you would say au revoir he replaced the phone and turned to the others you see how it is gentlemen i get all the kudos and reputation for chivalry and selfsacrificing gallantry without any of the distressing risks customarily associated with these things missiles mean more than revenge and they want the professor we have three hours three hours and now one of them was almost gone it was an hour that should have been spent in sleep they were all exhausted and desperately in need of sleep but the thought of sleep occurred to none it could not occur to jansci dazed though he was with joy at the thought of seeing catherine again because he was at the same time unhappy consumed with anxiety and remorse and still in his heart blindly determined that the professor should not go it could not occur to the professor for he had no wish to spend his last few hours of freedom in sleep and it did not occur to the cossack because he was again at his interminable practice with his whip readying himself for glorious battle against the accursed avo sandor never thought of it he had just walked up and down in the bitter cold outside by janscis shoulder because he would not leave him at this hour and the count was drinking heavily steadily as if he would never see a bottle of brandy again reynolds watched him in silent wonder as he opened a third bottle of brandy and the count had already consumed more than half of the others he might have been drinking water for all the apparent effects you think i drink too much my friend he smiled at reynolds you do not conceal your thoughts wrong why shouldnt you why not indeed i like the stuff but but what my friend reynolds shrugged thats not why you drink no the count raised an eyebrow to drown my many sorrows perhaps to drown janscis sorrows i think reynolds said slowly then he had a moment of acute unusual perception no i think i know you know how you can be sure i do not know but you are sure that jansci will see his catherine and julia again his sorrow is gone but yours remains and yours was the same as his but now you have to bear yours alone so you feel it with redoubled effect jansci has been talking to you he has said nothing to me i believe you the count regarded him thoughtfully you know you have aged ten years in a few days my friend you will never be the same again you are of course leaving your intelligence service this is my last mission no more and going to marry the fair julia good god reynolds stared at him is it is it as obvious as that you were the last to see it it was obvious to everyone else well then yes of course he frowned in surprise i havent asked her yet no need i know women the count waved a lackadaisical hand she probably has faint hopes of making something of you i hope she has reynolds paused hesitated then looked directly at the count you put me off beautifully there didnt you yes i did it was unfair i was personal and you had the grace not to rebuff me sometimes i think pride is a damnable thing the count poured a halftumbler full of brandy drank from it chainlit another russian cigarette then went on abruptly jansci was looking for his wife i for my little boy little boy he would be twenty next month maybe he is twenty i dont know i dont know i hope he lived he was not your only child i had five children and the children had a mother and grandfather and uncles but i do not worry about them they are all safe reynolds said nothing there was no need to say anything he knew from what jansci had said that the count had lost everything and everybody in the world except his little boy they took me away when he was only three years old the count went on softly t can still see him standing there in the snow wondering not understanding i have thought of him since every night every day of my life did he survive who looked after him had he clothes to keep the cold out has he still clothes to keep the cold out does he get enough to eat or is he thin and wasted perhaps no one wanted him but surely to god he was such a little boy mr reynolds i wonder what he looks like i always wondered what he looked like i wondered how he smiled and laughed and played and ran i wanted all the time to be by his side to see him every day of my life to see all the wonderful things you see when your child is growing up but i have missed it all all the wonderful years are gone and it is too late now yesterday all our yesterdays can never come again he was all that i have lived for but to every man there comes a moment of truth and mine came this morning i shall never see him again may god look after my little boy im sorry i asked murmured reynolds im terribly sorry he paused then he said thats not true i dont know why i said that im glad i asked its strange but im glad i told you the count drained his glass refilled it glanced at his watch and when he spoke again he was the old count his voice brisk and assertive and ironic barack brings selfpity but it also dispels it time we were moving my friend the hour is almost up we cannot stay here only a madman would trust hidas so jennings must go jennings must go if they dont get him then catherine and julia finish is that it im sorry hidas must want him badly he wants him desperately the communists are mortally afraid that if he escapes to the west and talks and that would be a blow from which they would not recover for a long time the damage would be irreparable that is why i phoned and offered myself i knew how badly they wanted me i wanted to find out how badly they wanted jennings as i said they want him desperately why reynolds voice was strained he will never work for them again the count answered obliquely they know that what you mean is what i mean is that they only want his everlasting silence the count said harshly there is only one way you can ensure that god above reynolds cried we cant let him go we cant let him walk to his death and not do you forget about julia the count said softly reynolds buried his face in his hands too confused too dazed to think any more half a minute passed perhaps a minute then he jerked upright as the harsh strident ring of the telephone bell cut through the silence of the room the count had the receiver off its rest within two seconds howarth here colonel hidas again the listeners jansci and sandor had just hurried in through the doorway heads and shoulders matted with snow could hear the metallic murmur of the voices in the earpiece but were unable to distinguish anything all they could do was watch the count as he leaned negligently against the wall his eyes moving idly unseeingly around the room suddenly he straightened off the wall the contracting muscles of his eyebrows etching a deep vertical line on his forehead impossible i said an hour colonel hidas we cannot wait any longer do you think we are madmen to sit here till you can take us at your leisure he paused as the voice at the other end interrupted him listened for a few moments to the urgent staccato chatter stiffened as he heard the click of a receiver being replaced looked for a moment at the lifeless phone then slowly returned it to his hook his right thumb as he turned to face the others was rubbing slowly gratingly against the side of his forefinger and his lower lip was caught between his teeth somethings wrong the voice reflected the anxiety in his face somethings very wrong hidas says the minister responsible is at his country retreat the telephone lines are down theyve had to send a car to fetch him and it might be another halfhour or possibly you damned idiot what do you mean jansci demanded who me the uncertainty had vanished from the counts face and the low controlled voice was alive with a desperate urgency that reynolds had never heard before sandor start the truck now grenades ammonium nitrate to take care of that little bridge at the foot of the road and the field telephone hurry all of you for gods sake hurry no one stopped to question the count ten seconds later they were all outside in the heavily falling snow piling equipment into the truck and within a minute the truck was jolting down the bumpy path towards the road jansci turned to the count one eyebrow raised in mute interrogation that last call came from a callbox the count said quietly criminal negligence on my part not to catch on to it right away why is colonel hidas of the avo telephoning from a callbox because hes no longer in his budapest office its a hundred to one that the previous call wasnt from budapest either but from our divisional hq in gyor hidas has been on his way here all the time desperately trying to delay us to keep us here with these bogus phone calls the minister government permission broken phone lines lies all lies my god to think that we ml for that sort of thing budapest hidas left budapest hours ago ill wager hes no more than five miles from here at this very moment another fifteen minutes and he would have nailed us all six good little flies waiting patiently in the spiders parlour chapter twelve they waited at the foot of the telephone pole by the side of the wood peering through the momentarily thinning snow and shivering almost continuously too little sleep too much exhaustion and the treacherous quicklyevaporating warmth of the brandy were no fit preparation for even so brief a vigil in the bitter cold and it had been a brief vigil so far a scant fifteen minutes had elapsed since they had left the house driven down the dirttrack across the little humpbacked bridge then turned west along the main road till they had come to this wood perhaps two hundred yards from the turnoff with its hidingplace for the truck the count and sandor had been dropped at the bridge to place the charges of ammonium nitrate while reynolds and the professor had run into the wood improvised rough and ready switches from dead branches hurried back to the bridge and helped the count and sandor to conceal their tyre tracks and the wiring which led from the nitrate to the wood where sandor was now in hiding with the plunger in his hand by the time the others had returned to the truck jansci and the cossack the latter agile as a monkey on any pole or tree had already connected up their field set to the overhead telephone wires leading to the house another ten minutes passed twenty then half an hour the snow still fell thinly the cold reached deeper for the marrow of their bones and both jansci and the count with the avo now long overdue had become suspicious and anxious it was not like the avo to be late especially when such a prize was at stake it was most unlike colonel hidas the count declared to be late at any time perhaps they were being held up by bad or impassable roads perhaps hidas had disregarded instructions perhaps his men were at that very moment sealing off every road to the frontier and encircling them from the rear but the count thought it highly unlikely he knew that hidas was under the impression that jansci had a large and farreaching organisation and that jansci should neglect the obvious precaution of posting lookouts on the roads for miles around would probably never even cross his mind but that hidas had some stratagem in mind the count was now convinced hidas was a formidable adversary at any time and the concentration camps held all too many people who had underrated the astuteness and persistence of that thin and embittered jew hidas was upto something and it became immediately plain when hidas did finally turn up he had indeed been up to something he came from the east and he came in a big green closedin truck which the count said was his mobile hqcumcaravan accompanied by another small brown truck almost certainly with some of his avo killers inside so much jansci and the count had expected but what they had not expected and what amply accounted for the avos delay in arriving was the presence of the third vehicle in the convoy a big lumbering heavilyarmoured halftrack equipped with a vicious looking highvelocity antitank rifle almost half the length of the vehicle itself the watchers by the telephone pole at the woodside stared at each other in perplexity at the loss to discover any possible reason for this display of armed might they were not left to wonder long hidas knew exactly what he was doing he must have learned from julia that janscis house had two blind gable end walls for he didnt hesitate not even for a moment he had his men well briefed and trained and the manoeuvre was executed with smooth and effortless efficiency a few hundred yards distant from the track leading off the road to the house the two trucks accelerated leaving the halftrack behind then changed down almost in perfect unison braked swerved off the road and across the little humpbacked bridge raced up to the house and fanned out one on either side of it coming to rest opposite and several yards distant from either of the blind gable walls immediately the trucks had stopped armed men leapt out and took up crouching positions behind the trucks and behind the little outbuildings and some of the trees that bordered the back of the house even before the last man had taken up position the big halftrack had swung off the road scraped between the low walls of the hump bridge with the snout of its long gun pointing grotesquely skywards plunged down the other side and ground to a hart about fifty yards away from the front of the house a second elapsed then another then there came a flat whiplash crack as the big gun fired and a roar and eruption of smoke and flying debris as the shell exploded in the wall of the house just below the groundfloor windows a few more seconds passed the dust from the first explosion hadnt even had time to settle when the next shell smashed into the house perhaps a yard away from the first then another and another and another and already a hole almost ten feet in length had been torn in the masonry of the front wall the treacherous murderous swine the count whispered his face was quite expressionless i knew i couldnt trust him but i didnt know till now just how much i couldnt trust him he broke off as the big gun fired again and waited until the rolling echoes had died away ive seen this a hundred times this is the technique that the germans first perfected in warsaw if you want to bring a house down without blocking the streets you just knock the bottom out and the house falls in upon itself they also discovered just by way of an extra dividend that everyone hiding in such a house would be crushed to death at the same time and thats what they are trying i mean they think were in there there was a tremor in dr jennings voice and his horror showed in his pale face theyre not just amusing themselves by having target practice the count said roughly of course they think were there and hidas has his terriers stationed all round the house in case the rats should try to bolt from their hole i see jennings voice was steadier now it would appear that i have overestimated the value of my services to the russians no the count lied no you havent they want you all right but i suspect they want majorgeneral illyurin and myself even more jansci is communist hungarys enemy no and they know this chance would never come their way again they couldnt pass it up and they were prepared to sacrifice even you to make the most of this chance reynolds felt a slow stirring within him a stirring of anger and admiration anger for the way the count was hiding the truth from jennings for letting him think that they could still trade him without any danger to himself admiration for the ready skill with which he had invented so plausible an explanation theyre fiends theyre inhuman fiends jennings was saying in wonder it is certainly difficult to think of them as anything else at times jansci said heavily did did anyone see them there was no need to ask who he meant by them the mute headshakings showed that all had understood no then perhaps we had better call our friend up there the phone connection is under the gable it shouldnt have been damaged yet and it hadnt there was a lull in the firing and in the still frosty air it was quite easy for them to hear the ringing of the bell inside the house as jansci cranked the handle of the field telephone easy too to hear a shouted order and see the man who ran round the corner of the house waving a signal to the gunners in the halftrack almost at once the big rifle dipped to one side another order and the crouching soldiers round the house broke quickly from their hidingplaces some running towards the front of the house some towards the back at the front the watchers could see the avo men stooping low along the gaping ruin that was all that remained of the wall then jumping up and poking their carbines through the shattered windows while a couple of men kicked the front door back off its broken hinges and passed inside even at that distance there was no mistaking the first of the two men who had gone inside there was no mistaking the giant gorillalike figure of coco anywhere you begin to understand perhaps why the worthy colonel hidas has survived so long the count murmured one could hardly accuse him of taking unnecessary chances coco and the other avo men reappeared at the front door and at a word from the giant the other men watching at the windows relaxed while one of them disappeared round the corner of the house he reappeared almost at once followed by another who went straight inside the house and that this other could only have been colonel hidas was obvious when they heard his voice coming tinnily through the field phones head set seconds later jansci had only one of the receivers to his ear and the voice came clearly enough through the second for all the others to hear majorgeneral illyurin i presume hidas voice was calm composed and only the count knew it well enough to detect the faint edge of anger underneath yes is this the way the gentlemen of the avo keep their bargains colonel hidas there is no room for childish recrimination between the two of us hidas replied where are you speaking from may i inquire that too is irrelevant you have brought my wife and daughter there was a long pause while the receiver went dead then hidass voice came again naturally i said i would may i see them please you do not trust me a superfluous question colonel hidas let me see them i must think again the phone went dead and the count said urgently hes not thinking that fox never requires to think hes stalling for time he knows we must be somewhere we can see him so he knows he can see us that was what his first pause was for he was telling his men to a shout from the house brought confirmation of the counts guess even before he had made it in words and a moment later a man came rushing out of the front door and ran down pellmell towards the halftrack hes seen us said the count softly us or the truck behind us and now guess what no need to guess jansci dropped the field set the halftrack take cover will it blast us from there or will it come to seek us out thats the only question itll come for us reynolds was certain shells are useless in a wood he was right even as he was speaking the big diesel of the halftrack had growled into life and now it was lumbering up to the clear space in front of the house stopping and going into reverse hes coming all right jansci nodded they didnt have to move to fire from there that rifle turret can traverse through degrees he moved out from the cover of his tree jumped over the snowfilled ditch on to the road and held both arms just touching high above his head the agreed signal to the hidden waiting sandor that he was to press the plunger no one was prepared for what happened not even the count who had underestimated how desperate hidas had become faintly through the field telephone lying on the ground he heard hidas shouting tire and before the count had time even to call out a warning several automatic carbines had opened up from the house and they leapt back behind treetrunks to escape the whistling hail of rifle fire that smashed into the wood around them some shells striking into the boles with solid hammer blows others ricocheting off and whining away evilly to bury their misshapen metal in treetrunks still deeper in the wood and yet others just breaking off branches and twigs to bring tiny flurries of frozen snow sifting down gently to the ground but jansci had had no time no chance and no warning and he toppled and swayed and crashed heavily to the road as might one of the trees behind him when the fellers axe had struck the last blow at its base reynolds straightened from his shelter and had just taken his first plunging step towards the road when he was grabbed from behind and hauled roughly behind the tree he had just left do you want to get yourself killed too the counts voice was savage but the savagery was not directed at reynolds i dont think hes dead you can see his foot moving theyll fire again reynolds protested the crackling of the carbines had ended as abruptly as it had begun they can riddle him lying there all the more reason why you shouldnt commit suicide but sanders waiting he hadnt time to see the signal sanders nobodys fool he doesnt require any signal the count edged an eye round a corner of his sheltering tree saw the halftrack rumbling down the dirt road towards the bridge if that bridge goes up now that damn tank can stop and pulverise us from where it stands worse it can reverse and cross the ditch tracks first on to the main road sander knows it watch reynolds watched the halftrack was almost on the bridge now ten yards five yards it was climbing up the far hump of the bridge sandor had left it too late reynolds knew he had left it too late then there came a sudden flash of light a low dull roar nothing like so loud as reynolds had expected followed first by the rumbling of falling masonry then a grinding metallic screeching and a crash which shook the ground almost as much as the explosion had done as the halftrack plunged nose first into the bed of the stream and the far abutment of the bridge its long rifle smashing against what was left of the wall of the bridge fracturing and bending sharply upwards at a crazy angle as if it had been made of cardboard our friend has a superb sense of timing the count murmured the dry ironic tone accorded ill with the set bitter mouth the fury barely in check he picked up the field phone cranked the handle viciously and waited hidas howarth here the count bit each word out separately you mad crazy fool do you know who youve shot how should i know why should i care the easy suavity had gone from hidas voice the loss of his halftrack had shaken him badly ill tell you why you should care the count had his control back again and his voice was silky with menace that was jansci you shot and if hes dead you will be well advised to accompany us when we cross the border into austria tonight fool have you taken leave of your senses listen and judge who is sane if jansci is dead we have no further interest in either his wife or daughter you may do what you like with them if he is dead we will be across the border by midnight and within twentyfour hours professor jennings story will be splashed in banner headlines across the front page of every newspaper in western europe and america every paper in the free world the fury of your masters in budapest and moscow will know no bounds and i shall take great care that every paper will publish a full account of our escape and the part you played in it colonel hidas for you the black sea canal if youre lucky perhaps siberia but almost certainly just a disappearance shall we say if jansci dies you die also and no one knows it better than you do colonel hidas there was a long silence and when hidas finally spoke his voice was no more than a husky whisper perhaps he is not dead major howarth you can but pray we shall see im going to see now if you value your life call off these murderous hounds of yours i shall give the orders immediately the count replaced the phone to find reynolds staring at him did you mean that would you have turned julia and her mother over my god what do you think i am sorry boy didnt mean to bite i must have sounded convincing eh im bluffing but hidas doesnt know i am and even if he wasnt more scared right now than he has ever been in his life before and realised that perhaps i was bluffing he wouldnt even dare to try to call the bluff we have him by the hip come he should have called his dogs off by this time together they ran out on the road and stooped to examine jansci he was lying on his back his limbs outflung and relaxed but he was breathing steadily and evenly there was no need to search for the injury the welling red blood from the long wound that stretched from the temple back past the ear was in shocking contrast to the snowwhite hair the count stooped low examined him briefly then straightened no one could expect jansci to die as easily as that the wide grin on the counts face was eloquent of his relief hes been creased and concussed but i dont even think that the bone has been chipped hell be all right perhaps in a couple of hours come give me a hand to lift him will take him it was sandor speaking he had just emerged from the wood behind and he brushed them gently aside he stooped caught jansci under the body and legs and lifted him with the ease one would have lifted a little child he is badly hurt thank you sandor no just a glancing blow that was a splendid job down by the bridge take him into the back of the track and make him comfortable will you cossack a pair of pliers up that telephone pole and wait till i give you the word mr reynolds you might start the engine if you please she may be cold the count picked up the phone and smiled thinly he could hear the anxious breathing of hidas at the other end your time has not yet come colonel hidas jansci is badly hurt shot through the head but he will live now listen carefully it is painfully obvious that you are not to be trusted although that i may say is no recent discovery on my part we cannot and will not carry out the exchange here there is no guarantee that you will keep your word every possibility that you wont drive alongthe field for about half a kilometre it will be difficult in the snow but you have the men and it will give us time to be on our way and you will come to a plank bridge that will take you on to the road again then drive straight to the ferry this is clear it is clear some of the confidence was back in hidas voice we will be there as soon as possible you will be there an hour from now no more we do not wish to make you a present of the time to send for reinforcements and cut off escape routes to the west incidentally do not waste precious time in attempting to summon help by this telephone i am about to cut all the wires now and shall cut them again about five kilometres north of here but in an hour dismay was back in hidas voice to clear these fields so deep in snow and who knows what this side road to the river you speak of is like if we are not there in an hour then you will find us gone the count hung up the receiver gestured to the cossack to cut the wires looked into the back of the truck to see if jansci was comfortable then hurried round to the cab reynolds had the engine running moved over to make room for the count behind the wheel and within seconds they were bumping out of the wood on to the main road and off into the northeast where the first dusky fingers of twilight were beginning to touch the snowcapped hills under a dark and leaden sky darkness was almost upon them and the snow was beginning to fall more heavily again with the chill promise of still more to come when the count swung the truck off the river road drove a couple of hundred jolting yards up a narrow dirt track and stopped at the bottom of a small abandoned stone quarry reynolds started out of his deep reverie and looked at him in surprise the ferrymans house youve left the river yes just about another three hundred metres from here the ferry i mean leaving the truck in plain view of hidas when he arrives on the other side would be too much of a temptation altogether reynolds nodded and said nothing he had spoken barely a dozen words since they had left janscis house had sat in silence beside the count all the way had hardly exchanged a word with sandor as he had helped bin to destroy the bridge they had so lately crossed his mind was confused he was torn by conflicting emotions consumed by a torturing anxiety that made all previous anxieties fade into insignificance the most damnable part of it all was that old jennings had now become talkative and positively cheerful as he had never been since reynolds had first known him and was trying all he could to raise the flagging spirits of the others and reynolds suspected without in any way having reason for his suspicion that the old professor knew in spite of what the count had said that he was going to his death it was intolerable it was unthinkable that such a gallant old man should be allowed to die like that but if he didnt nothing was more certain than that julia would die reynolds sat there in the gathering darkness his fists clenched till his forearms ached but far at the back of his mind he knew without in any way consciously admitting his decision to himself that there could be only one answer how is jansci sandor the count had slid open the inspection hatch at the back of the cab he stirs sandors voice was deep and gentle and he is muttering to himself excellent it takes more than a bullet in the head to account for jansci the count paused a moment then continued we cannot leave him here it is altogether too cold and i dont want him to wake up not knowing where he is not knowing where we are i think i will carry him to the house five minutes later they reached the ferrymans house a small white stone building between the road and the heavily shingled sloping bank of the river the river here was perhaps forty feet wide and very sluggish and even in the near darkness it looked as if it might be very deep at that particular spot leaving the others at the door of the ferrymans house the door faced on to the river the count and reynolds jumped from the steep bank on to the shingle and went down to the waters edge the boat was doubleended perhaps twelve feet long without either engine or oars the sole means of propulsion being provided by a rope stretched tight between concrete embedded iron posts on either side of the river this rope passed through screwed pulleys one at either end of the boat and one on a raised amidships block and passengers simply crossed from one bank to the other by overhanding themselves along the rope it was a type of ferry reynolds had never seen before but he had to admit that for a couple of women who probably knew nothing whatsoever about boats it was a foolproof system the count echoed his thoughts satisfactory mr reynolds very satisfactory and so is the lay of the land on the other side of the river he gestured at the far bank at the curving halfmoon of trees that swept back from either bank enclosing a smooth treeless expanse of snow unbroken but for the bisecting road that reached down to the waters edge a terrain which might have been specifically designed to discourage our good friend colonel hidas who is no doubt at this very moment entertaining pleasant visions of his men lurking at the waters edge with their hands full of machineguns it would have been difficult i say it with modesty for anyone to have chosen a better spot for effecting the transfer come let us call upon the ferryman who is about to enjoy some unexpected and no doubt unwonted exercise the ferryman was just opening the door as the count raised his hand to knock he stared first at the counts highpeaked hat then at the wallet in the counts hand then licked suddenly dry lips in hungary it was not necessary to have a bad conscience to tremble at the sight of the avo you are alone in this house the count demanded yes yes i am alone what what is it comrade he made an attempt to pull himself together i have done nothing comrade nothing thats what they all say the count said coldly get your hat and coat and return immediately the man was back in a matter of moments pulling a fur cap on to his head he made to speak but the count raised his hand we wish to use your house for a short time for a purpose that is no concern of yours we are not interested in you the count pointed to the road leading south a brisk walk comrade and let an hour elapse before you return you will find us gone the man looked at him unbelievingly looked wildly around to see what the trap was saw none and scuttled round the corner of the house and up on to the road without a word within half a minute his legs going like pistons he was lost to sight round a comer of the road putting the fear of death in ones fellowman becomes as a pastime increasingly distasteful with the passing of the days the count murmured i must put an end to it bring jansci inside will you sandor the count led the way through the little lobby and into the ferrymans livingroom paused at the door expelled his breath gustily and turned round on second thoughts leave him in the lobby its like a damn furnace in this room itll only send him off again he looked closely at jansci as sandor propped him in a corner with coats and some cushions taken from the livingroom see his eyes open already but he is still dazed stay with him sandor and let him come out of it by himself yes my boy he raised an eyebrow as the cossack came rushing into the lobby you are perturbed about something colonel hidas and his men the cossack gasped they have arrived their two trucks have just pulled up at the waters edge even so the count screwed one of his russian cigarettes into his holder lit it and sent the match spinning out through the dark oblong of the open doorway they are punctual to a degree come let us go and pass the time of day with them chapter thirteen the count walked the length of the lobby stopped abruptly and barred the doorway with his arm remain inside professor jennings if you please i jennings looked at him in surprise remain inside my dear fellow im the only person who is not remaining here quite nevertheless remain here for the present sandor see that he does the count wheeled and walked quickly away without giving the professor opportunity for reply reynolds was at his heels and his voice when he spoke was low and bitter what you mean is that it requires only one single welldirected bullet into the professors heart and colonel hidas can retire complete with prisoners well satisfied with his nights work something of the kind had occurred to me the count admitted his feet ground on the shifting shingle then he halted by the boat and looked about the dark cold waters of the sluggish river the truck and each individual figure each man were easily seen against the white background of snow but it had already grown so dark that it was nearly impossible to distinguish features or uniforms just black empty silhouettes only coco was recognisable and that by virtue of his great height but one man stood in advance of the others his toes by toe waters edge and it was to this man that the count addressed himself colonel hidas i am here major howarth good let us not waste time i propose to effect this exchange as quickly as possible night colonel hidas is almost upon us and while youre treacherous enough in the daylight god only knows what youre like when darkness falls i dont propose to stay long enough to find out i shall honour my promise you shouldnt use words you dont understand tell your drivers to reverse till they come to the wood you and your men are also to fall back as far as that at that distance two hundred metres it should be quite impossible for you to distinguish any of us in any way from time to time guns are accidentally discharged but not tonight it shall be exactly as you say hidas turned gave some orders waited till the two trucks and his men had started to move back from the river bank then turned to face the count and now what major howarth this when i call you you will release the generals wife and daughter and they will start walking towards the ferry at the same moment dr jennings will get into the boat here and cross over to the other side once there he will climb up to the bank wait there till the women are closepass by them as they approach the river then walk slowly towards you by the time hes there the women should be safely across and it should be by then too dark for anyone on either side to achieve anything by indiscriminate shooting the plan i think is foolproof it shall be exactly as you say hidas repeated he wheeled scrambled up the shelving bank and started to walk back towards the dark line of trees in the distance leaving the count gazing after him and thoughtfully rubbing his chin just that little bit too compliant just that little bit too eager to please he murmured just a little tchah my endlessly suspicious nature what can he do the time has come he raised his voice sandor cossack he waited till the two men had come out from the cottage then spoke to sandor how is jansci sitting up still swaying a bit his head hurts very badly inevitably the count turned to reynolds i want to say a few words to jennings alone jansci and i perhaps you understand i wont keep him a minute i promise you be as long as you like reynolds said dully theres no hurry for me i know i know the count hesitated made to say something then changed his mind you might launch the boat will you reynolds nodded watched the count disappear into the house and turned to give the others a hand to pull the boat down the shingled beach into the water the boat was heavier than it looked they had to pull it gratingly across the pebbles but with sandors help it was in the water in a matter of a few seconds tugging gently on its rope as the sluggish current caught it sandor and the cossack walked back up to the top of the bank but reynolds remained at the waters edge he stood there for a few moments pulled out his gun checked that the safetycatch was on and thrust it in his coat pocket his hand still round it it seemed that only moments had elapsed but already dr jennings was at the door he said something that reynolds couldnt distinguish then came janscis deep voice and then the counts you you will forgive me if i remain here dr jennings the count was hesitant and unsure for the first time that reynolds had ever known its just i would rather i quite understand jennings voice was steady and composed do not distress yourself my friend and thank you for all you have done for me jennings turned away abruptly took sandors arm to help him down from the high bank then stumbled awkwardly down the shingle a stooped figure until this moment reynolds had never quite realised how stooped the old man really was with his collar turned high against the bitter chill of the evening and the skirts of his thin raglan coat flapping out pathetically about his legs reynolds felt his heart go out to the defenceless gallant old man the end of the road my boy jennings was still calm but just a little husky i am sorry im terribly sorry to have given you so much trouble and all for nothing you came a long way a long way and now this this must be a bitter blow for you reynolds said nothing he couldnt trust himself to say anything but the gun was coming clear of his pocket one thing i forgot to say to jansci jennings murmured dowidzenia tell him i said that just dowidzenia he will understand i dont understand and it doesnt matter jennings moving towards the boat gasped as he walked into the barrel of the gun held rigidly in reynolds hand youre not going anywhere professor jennings you can deliver your own messages what do you mean my boy i dont understand you theres nothing to understand youre just not going anywhere but then but then julia i know but but the count said you were going to marry her reynolds nodded silently in the darkness and youre willing i mean you will give her up there are some things even more important than that reynolds voice was so low that jennings had to stoop forward to catch the words your final word my final word i am well content jennings murmured i need now hear nothing more he turned to retrace his steps up the shingle and as reynolds made to thrust his gun back in his pocket pushed him with all his strength reynolds lost his footing on the treacherous pebbles fell heavily backwards and struck his head against a stone with force enough to leave him momentarily dazed by the time he had shaken his head clear and risen dizzily to his feet jennings had shouted something at the top of his voice it wasnt until much later that reynolds realised that it had been the signal for hidas to send julia and her mother on their way scrambled into the boat and was already halfway across the river come back come back you crazy fool reynolds voice was hoarse and savage and quite without realising the futility of what he was doing he was tugging frantically at the rope which stretched across the river and then he dimly remembered that the rope was fixed and the boat completely independent of it jennings paid no attention to his call did not even as much as look over his shoulder the bow was grinding on the pebbles of the far side when reynolds heard jansci calling him hoarsely from the door of the ferrymans cottage what is it whats happening nothing reynolds said wearily everything is going just according to plan he climbed up the bank as if his legs were made of lead and looked at jansci looked at the white hair and face and the blood that caked one side from temple to chin you had better get cleaned up your wife and daughter will be here at any moment i can see them crossing the field now i dont understand jansci pressed his hand to his head it doesnt matter reynolds fumbled a cigarette into his hand and lit it weve kept our side of the bargain and jennings is gone he stared down at the cigarette glowing in his cupped palm then looked up i forgot he said i was to say dowidzenia to you dowidzenia jansci had taken his hand from his head and was staring in perplexity at the blood on his fingers but now he looked strangely at reynolds he said that yes he said youd understand what does it mean farewell the polish auf wiedersehen till we meet again oh my god my god reynolds said softly he spun his cigarette into the darkness turned and walked quite slowly along the lobby into the livingroom the sofa was over in the far corner by the fire and the old jennings hatless coatless and shaking his head from side to side was trying to prop himself into a sitting position reynolds crossed the room with jansci now just behind him and steadied the old man with an arm round his shoulders what happened reynolds asked gently the count he was here jennings rubbed an obviously aching jaw he came in and took two grenades out of a bag and put them on the table and i asked him what they were for and he said if theyre going back to budapest with these trucks theyre going to have a damned long shove then he came across and shook hands with me and thats all i remember thats all there is professor reynolds said quietly wait here well be back soon and youll be with your wife and son within fortyeight hours reynolds and jansci went out into the lobby and jansci was speaking softly the count there was warmth in his voice something that touched on reverence he dies as he has lived thinking never of himself the grenades end the last chance of our being cut off before the border grenades a slow dull anger was beginning to kindle deep down inside reynolds a strange anger he had never felt before you talk of grenades at this hour i thought he was your friend you will never know a friend like him jansci was filled with a simple conviction he is the best friend that i or any man could ever have and because he is that to me i would not stop him now if i could the count has wanted to die he has wanted to die ever since i have known him it was just a point of honour with him to postpone it as long as possible to give as many suffering people what they wanted of life and freedom and happiness before he himself took what he wanted of death that is why risks did not exist for the count he courted death every day of his life but not openly and i have always known that when the chance came to seize it with honour he would grasp it with both hands jansci shook his bloodstained head and reynolds could see from the light streaming out of the livingroom that the faded grey eyes were misted with tears you are young meechail you cannot possibly conceive of the dreariness the purposelessness the dreadful emptiness of living day after interminable day when the wish to live has long since died in you i am as selfish as any other man but not so selfish as to buy my happiness at the expense of his i loved the count may the snow lie softly on him tonight i am sincerely sorry jansci reynolds spoke with genuine regret and in his heart he knew he was deeply sorry but for what or for whom he could not at that moment have said all he clearly knew was that the fire of anger within him was slowly increasing burning more brightly than ever they were at the front door now and he strained his eyes to pick out what he could on that white expanse of snow on the other side of the river julia and her mother he could clearly see making their way slowly towards the river bank but at first he could see no signs of the count but the pupils of his eyes were now widening steadily since he had left the brightness of the room behind him and he finally picked out his mowing figure no more than a halfseen blur against the dark line of the trees beyond him and reynolds suddenly realised far too near the trees julia and her mother were as yet hardly more than halfway across the field look reynolds grabbed the elder mans arms the counts almost there and julia and your wife are hardly moving in the name of heaven whats the matter with them theyll be caught theyll be shot what the devil was that a loud splash a thunderclap of a splash in the silence of the night had startled him with its unexpected suddenness he ran to the bank and saw the cold dark waters of the river churning to a foam as unseen arms thrashed through them sandor had seen the danger even before he had had flung off his overcoat and jacket and now his great arms and shoulders were carrying him across to the far bank like a torpedo they are in trouble meechail jansci too was on the bank now and his voice was tense with anxiety one of them it must be catherine can hardly walk you see how she drags her steps it is too much for julia sandor was at the other side now out of the water up the shingled shore and over the threefoot bank beyond as if it didnt even exist and then just as he cleared the bank they heard it a sharp flat explosion the unmistakable crack of a grenade from the woods beyond the field then another even while the echoes of the first explosion were still rolling away through the trees and then immediately afterwards the harsh staccato rattle of an automatic carbine and then silence reynolds winced and looked at jansci but it was too dark to see the expression on his face he could only hear him murmuring something over and over again to himself but reynolds could not distinguish the words they must have been ukrainian and there was not time to wonder even at that very moment colonel hidas might be stooping over the man whom he had thought to be professor jennings sandor had reached the two women now had an arm around each of them and was plunging back through the frozencrusted snow towards the river bank as if he had been leading two fleetfooted runners by the hand instead of virtually carrying them which he was reynolds wheeled round to find the cossack standing just behind him theres going to be trouble reynolds said quickly get up to the house stick the submachinegun through the window and when sandor drops below the level of the river bank but the cossack was already on his way his feet churning up the gravel as he raced for the house reynolds turned round again the fists by his side clenching and unclenching in his anxiety his frustration at their helplessness thirty yards to go now twentyfive twenty still a strange absence of all sound and activity from the woods in the background and reynolds was just beginning to hope against hope when he heard the excited shouts from the trees a barked command and at once an automatic carbine opened up with its harsh staccato cough the very first shells whistling by only inches from reynolds head he dropped to the ground like a stems dragging jansci with him and lay there with his open hand beating at the pebbles in his impotence while the bullets whined harmlessly overhead but even at that moment he found time to wonder why only the one man was firing one would have expected hidas to bring his entire arsenal to bear then muffled though the sound was by the thick snow there suddenly came to ms ears the thud thud of pounding feet and a moment later in a waisthigh flurry of flying snow sandor came over the top of the far bank like a charging bull literally lifting julia and her mother clear off their feet and landed with a grating sliding crunch on the pebbles at least ten feet beyond and below and even while he was still stumbling still recovering his balance on that treacherous footing a machinegun with a different cyclic rate had opened up the cossack had timed it without the loss of a second it was doubtful whether he could see anybody against the dark background of trees but the avo machinegun was pointing directly at him and must have betrayed its position flashcover or not by the red fire streaking from the mouth of the barrel in any event the firing from the wood stopped almost immediately sandor had reached the boat now and was lifting somebody into it a moment later he helped the second person inside dragged the heavilyladen boat off the gravel with one mighty heave and was overarming himself so powerfully across the river that the gurgling water at the forefoot piled high into a bowwave that gleamed whitely even in the darkness of the night jansci and reynolds on their feet again were at the waters edge waiting hands reached out ready to grab the boat and drag it ashore when all at once there came a hiss a soft crack and a blinding white light burst into life not a hundred feet above their heads and almost on the instant a machinegun and several rifles opened up again still from the trees but much farther to the south where the wood curved in to meet the river shoot the flare down reynolds shouted to the cossack never mind the avo shoot that damned flare down blinded by the glare he plunged into the river just as he heard jansci doing the same thing sworesoftly as the side of the boat struck painfully against the kneecap grabbed the gunwale jerked the boat up on the shelving pebbled beach staggered as someone who had incautiously stood up in the boat pitched forward against him recovered and caught her up in his arms just as the flare above the river died as suddenly as it had come to life the cossack was proving himself that night but the guns from the wood across the river still coughed and chattered the men behind them were firing from memory and bullets were still whistling and ricocheting all around them there was no doubt who reynolds had in his arms it must have been janscis wife she was too frail too light altogether for julia guided now only by the slope of the pebbled shore the darkness after the blinding whiteness of the flare was now quite impenetrable reynolds took a step forward and all but collapsed to the ground as the pain in his momentarily paralysed knee struck at him he freed one hand grabbed at the tautened rope to steady himself heard a thud as if someone had fallen heavily felt someone else brush by him and heard steps running up towards the bank clenched his teeth against the pain and limped up the shingles as quickly as he could he felt a bullet pluck at the sleeve of his coat the threefoot bank that he had to scale with his aching leg and the woman in his arms loomed as an unsurmountable obstacle in his mind then a great pair of hands caught him from behind and he was standing on top of the bank still clutching the woman before he had more than dimly realised what was happening the oblong of pale light that was the door of the ferrymans cottage was before him now not tan feet away and even as he saw it even as he heard bullets smashing against the stonework of the cottage and whining away into the darkness jansci who had been first to reach the house reappeared in the doorway suicidally silhouetted against the light behind him reynolds made to shout a warning changed his mindit was too late now if any marksman had drawn a bead and it was only two seconds away moved forwards heard the woman in his arms say something knew instinctively without understanding the words what she wanted and set her gently on her feet she took two or three faltering steps forward then flung herself into the outstretched arms of the waiting man murmuring alex alex alex i then she seemed to shudder leaned heavily against him as if she had been struck from behind but that was all reynolds saw sandor had bundled them all into the lobby and crashed the door shut behind him julia was halfsitting halflying at the far end of the corridor supported by an anxiouslooking dr jennings reynolds reached her in two strides and fell on his knees beside her her eyes were shut her face very pale there was the beginning of a bruise high upon her forehead but she was breathing shallowly but evenly whats happened to her reynolds asked huskily has she been has she been shell be all right sanders voice behind him was deep and reassuring he stooped and lifted her in his arms and turned towards the livingroom she fell getting out of the boat and she must have struck her head on the stones ill take her in to the couch here reynolds watched the giant the water dripping steadily from his soaking clothes carry her through the door as if she had been a child rose slowly to his feet and almost bumped into the cossack the youngsters face was alive with exultation you should be at your window reynolds said quietly no need the cossacks grin stretched from ear to ear theyve stopped firing and gone now back to the trucks i can hear their voices in the woods i got two of them mr reynolds two of them i saw them fall in the light of the flare just before you shouted at me to shoot the flare out and you did that too reynolds acknowledged that accounted he realised for the lack of any more of the pistol flares a doubleedged weapon it had turned disastrously in hidas hand youve saved us all tonight he clapped the proud boy on his shoulder turned to look at jansci and then stood very still jansci was kneeling on the rough wooden floor and his wife was in his arms her back was to reynolds and the first thing he saw was the round redringed hole in her coat high up below her left shoulder it was a very small hole and only a little blood and the stain wasnt spreading at all slowly reynolds walked the length of the corridor and sank on his knees beside jansci jansci lifted his white bloodstained head and looked at him with sightless eyes dead reynolds whispered jansci nodded without speaking my god reynolds shock showed in every line of his face now now to die now a merciful god meechail and understanding far beyond my deserts only this morning i asked him why he hadnt let catherine die why he hadnt made her die he has forgiven my presumption he knew far better than i catherine was gone meechail gone before the bullet ever touched her jansci shook his head a man marvelling at the splendour of it all could there be anything more wonderful meechail than to pass from this earth without pain at the moment of your greatest happiness look look at her face see how she smiles reynolds shook his head without speaking there was nothing to say he could think of nothing to say his mind was numbed we are both blessed jansci was talking almost rambling to himself he eased his arms so that he could look down on his wifes face and his voice was soft with memory the years have been kind to her meechail time loved her almost as much as i twenty years ago five and twenty years ago drifting down the dnieper on a summers night i see her now as i saw her then she has not been touched he said something in a tone so low that reynolds couldnt catch it then his voice came more clearly again you remember her photograph meechail the one you thought did julia more than justice now you can see it could never have been anyone else it could never have been anyone else jansci reynolds echoed he thought of the photograph of the beautiful laughing girl and stared down at the dead face in janscis arms at the thin white hair the grey face haggard and emaciated as he had never seen a face before a pitifully wasted face sculpted and graven into the deep lines of premature old age by unimaginable privations and hardships and he felt his eyes go blind it could never have been anyone else reynolds repeated the portrait did her less than justice thats what i said to catherine thats what i always said to her jansci murmured he turned away and bent low and reynolds knew that he wanted to be alone reynolds stumbled blindly to his feet he had to feel for the wall to support and guide him and walked slowly away the numbness in his mind slowly giving way first of all to a confusing maelstrom of conflicting thoughts and emotions then slowly clearing and settling till there was only one thought one fixed immovable purpose left in his mind the slow anger that had been smouldering within him all evening now burst into an intense white flame that consumed his mind his every thought to the exclusion of all else but there was no trace of this blazing fury within him when he spoke quietly to sandor could i ask you to bring the truck here please ira a moment sandor promised he gestured at the girl lying on the couch she is just coming to we must hurry thank you we will reynolds turned away and looked at the cossack keep a good watch cossack i will not be long he walked along the corridor went past jansci and catherine without looking at either of them picked up the automatic carbine that leaned against the wall and passed out through the door closing it softly behind him chapter fourteen the dark sluggish waters were icecold as the tomb bun reynolds didnt even feel their freezing touch and though his whole body shuddered involuntarily as he had slid silently into the river his mind had not even registered the shock there was no room in his mind for any physical sensation for any emotion or thought of any kind except for that one starkly simple primeval desire the desire that had sloughed off the tissue veneer of civilisation as if it had never been that of revenge revenge or murder there was no distinction in reynolds mind at that moment the absolute fixity of his purpose permitted of none that frightened boy in budapest janscis wife the incomparable count they were all dead they were dead primarily because he reynolds had set foot in hungary but he had not been their executioner only the evil genius of hidas could be held accountable for that hidas had lived too long automatic carbine held high above his head reynolds breasted his way through the thin film of crackling ice that stretched out from the far bank felt his feet touch bottom and scrambled ashore stooping be filled a spread handkerchief with handfuls of tiny pebbles and sand tied the corners and was on his way without even pausing to wring or shake any of the icy water out of his clothes he had run two hundred yards downriver before making his crossing and now he found himself in the perimeter of the wood that curved east and south to the bisecting road where the two trucks were parked here in the shadow of the trees he could not be seen and the frozen snow on the ground beneath their laden branches was so thin that his stealthy progress could have been heard barely ten feet away he had slung his automatic carbine now and the weighted handkerchief in his hand swung gently to and fro as he picked his wary way from tree to tree but for all his softfooted caution he had covered the ground swiftly and was alongside the parked trucks within three minutes peering out from the shelter of a tree there was no sign of life from either truck their rear doors were closed there was no sign of life at all reynolds straightened preparing to glide across the snow to hidas truck then froze into immobility rigid against the bole of his tree a man had moved out from behind the shelter of hidas truck and was coming directly towards him for a moment reynolds was certain that the man had seen him then almost at once relaxed avo soldiers didnt go hunting for armed enemies in a dark wood with their gun carried under the crook of one arm and a lighted cigarette in the other hand the sentry obviously had no suspicions was just walking around to keep his blood moving in that bitter cold he passed by within six feet of reynolds and as he began to move away reynolds waited no longer he took one long step out from the concealing shelter of the tree his right arm swinging and just as the man started to whirl round his mouth open to cry out the weighted cloth caught him with vicious force at the nape of the neck reynolds had time to spare and to catch both the man and his gun and lower them silently to the ground he had the carbine in his hand now and half a dozen steps took him to the front of the brown truck a truck reynolds could see with its engine hood blown off and motor damaged by the explosion of the counts grenade then he was moving silently across to hidas caravan his eyes so intently watching the back door that he all but tripped over the crumpled shape lying at his feet on the ground reynolds stooped low and although he knew even as he stooped who it was that was lying there nevertheless the shock of confirmation made him grasp the barrel of his carbine as if he would crush it in his bare hands the count was lying face upwards in the snow his avo cap still framing the lean aristocratic face the chiselled aquiline features even more aloof and remote in death than they had been in life it was not hard to see how he had died that burst of machinegun fire must have torn half his chest away like a dog they had shot him down like a dog they had left him lying there in the darkness of that bitter night and the gently falling snow was beginning to lie on the cold dead face moved by some strange impulse reynolds removed the hated avo cap sent it spinning away into the darkness pulled a handkerchief a handkerchief stained with the counts own blood from the dead mans breast pocket and spread it gently across his face then he rose and walked to the door of hidas caravan four wooden steps led to the door and reynolds walked up these as softly as a cat kneeling at the top to peer through the keyhole in the space of a second he could see what he wanted to see a chair on the lefthand side a madeup bunk on the right hand and at the far end a table with what looked like a wireless transmitter bolted to the top of it hidas back to the door was just seating himself in front of the table and as he cranked a handle with his right hand and picked up a telephone with his left reynolds realised that it was no transmitter but a radio telephone they should have thought of it hidas was not a man to move about the country without means of instant communication available to him and now with the skies clearing he would almost certainly be calling in the air force in a last desperate gamble to stop them but it didnt matter any more it was too late it made no difference new none to those whom hidas was pursuing and certainly none to hidas himself reynolds groping hand found the knob and he passed through the welloiled door like a shadow not quite closing it behind him hidas his ear filled with the sound of the ratchety whirl of the callup handle heard nothing reynolds took three steps forward the barrel of his carbine gripped in both hands and the stock raised high above his shoulders and as hidas began to speak brought it swinging down over hidas shoulder and smashed the delicate mechanism to pieces hidas sat for a moment in petrified astonishment then whirled round in his chair but he had lost the only moment he would ever need reynolds was already two paces away the carbine again reversed in his hands the muzzle trained on hidas heart hidas face was a stone mask carved in shock only his lips moved but no sound came from them as reynolds slowly retreated picked up the key he had seen lying on the bunk felt for the keyhole and locked the door his eyes never once leaving hidas then he moved forward and halted with the mouth of the carbine rocklike in its steadiness just thirty inches short of the man in the chair you look surprised to see me colonel hidas reynolds murmured you should not be surprised you of all men those who live by the sword as you have lived by the sword must know better than any man that this moment comes to all of us it comes to you tonight you have come to murder me it was a statement and not a question hidas had looked on death too often from the sidelines not to recognise it when its face turned towards himself the shock was slowly draining out of his face but no fear had yet come to replace it murder you no i have come to execute you murder is what you did to major howarth is there any reason why i shouldnt shoot you down in cold blood as you shot him he hadnt even a gun on him he was an enemy of the state an enemy of the people my god you try to justify your actions they need no justification captain reynolds duty never does reynolds stared at him are you trying to excuse yourself or just begging for your life i never beg there was no pride no arrogance in the jews voice just a simple dignity imre the boy in budapest he died slowly he withheld important information it was essential that we got it quickly majorgeneral illyurins wife reynolds spoke quickly to fight off a growing feeling of unreality why did you murder her for the first time a flicker of emotion showed in the thin intelligent face then vanished as quickly as it had come i did not know that he inclined his head it is no part of my duty to wage war on women i genuinely regret her death even though she was dying as it was you are responsible for the actions of your avo thugs my men he nodded they take their orders from me they killed her but you are responsible for their actions therefore you are responsible for her death if you put it that way i am if it were not for you these three people would be alive now i cannot speak for the generals wife the other two yes is there then i ask you for the last time any reason why i shouldnt kill you now colonel hidas looked at him for a long moment in silence then he smiled faintly and reynolds could have sworn that the smile was tinged with sadness numerous reasons captain reynolds but none that would convince an enemy agent from the west it was the word west that did it but reynolds was not to realise that until long afterwards all he knew was that something had triggered open a flood gate released a spate of pictures and memories in his mind pictures of jansci talking to him in his house in budapest in the dark agony of that torture cell in the szarhaza prison with the firelight on his face in the cottage in the country memories of what jansci had said what he had said over and over again with a repetitive persistence with a passionate conviction that had hammered his ideas more deeply home into his mind than reynolds had ever suspected everything he had said about deliberately desperately reynolds forced the thoughts and pictures from his mind his carbine jabbed forward another six inches on your feet colonel hidas hidas rose and stood facing him his hands hanging by his sides and stared down at the gun clean and quick colonel hidas eh as you wish his eyes lifted from reynolds whitening trigger finger and found his face i would not beg for myself what had been denied so many of my victims for a fraction of a second longer reynolds continued to increase the pressure on the trigger then almost as if something had snapped inside him he relaxed and took one pace back the white flame of anger still burnt within him burnt as brightly as ever but with these last words the words of a man quite unafraid to die he had felt the bitterness of defeat welling in him so powerfully that he could taste it in his mouth when he spoke his voice was strained and hoarse he scarcely recognised it as his own turn round thank you but no i prefer to die this way turn round reynolds said savagely or ill smash both your kneecaps and turn you round myself hidas looked at his face saw the implacability shrugged to the inevitable turned away and collapsed without a sound across his desk as the butt of the rifle caught him behind the ear for a long moment reynolds stared down at the fallen man swore in a bitter fury that was directed not against the man at his feet but at himself turned and left the caravan there was a feeling of emptiness almost of despair in reynolds mind as he descended the steps he was no longer particularly careful to conceal his presence that fury within him had still not found its outlet and though he would not have admitted it even to himself he would have welcomed the chance to turn his automatic carbine on the armed avo men within that other truck cut them down without compunction as they came pouring out the door silhouetted against the light behind just as they had cut down janscis wife silhouetted in the light of the door of the ferrymans cottage and then suddenly he broke step and stood still stood very still indeed he had just realised something that he should have realised minutes ago had he not been so bent on his reckoning with colonel hidas the brown lorry was not only quiet it was far too quiet to be true in three steps he had reached the side of the truck and pressed his ear against it there was nothing to be heard just nothing at all he ran round to the back flung open a door and peered inside he could see nothing it was pitch dark inside but he did not need to see anything the truck was empty and no one moved or even breathed inside the truth struck with such suddenness such savage force that he was for the moment numbed incapable of all action capable of nothing but the realisation of the enormity of his blunder the thoroughness the appalling ease with which he had been deceived he might have known he might have guessed the count had been suspicious of it even at the beginning that colonel hidas would never have accepted defeat never have given up far less given up with such submissive ease the count would never have fallen for it never hidas men must have been on their way to make the crossing of the river to the south even when the flare had been fired and both he and the cossack had blindly accepted as genuine the noisily faked withdrawal through the woods they would be there by now they were bound to be there by now and he reynolds was missing at the very moment his friends needed him as they had never done before and to crown the folly of his nights work he had sent sandor the one man who might have saved them to collect the truck jansci had only the boy and the old man to help him and julia was there when he thought of julia when he thought of her and the leering gargoyle face of the giant coco something snapped inside reynolds mind and released him from his motionless thrall two hundred metres lay between him and the bank of the river two hundred metres covered in deep frozen snow he was exhausted from sleeplessness and privations and weighed down by heavy boots and saturated clothes but he covered the distance in less time than he had ever done before it was not anger now although it was still there that lent wings to his heels and kicked the flying gouts of snow headhigh as he pounded along it was not anger it was fear fear such as he had never known before but it was not numbing paralysing fear but a fear instead that seemed to sharpen all his senses and lend him an abnormal clarity of mind he braked suddenly arms windmilling violently as he approached the bank of the river slid noiselessly over the edge on to the shingle catfooted down to the waters edge and pushed himself out into the icy current without even the tiniest splash he was almost halfway across swimming smoothly and powerfully one arm holding the carbine far above his head when he heard the first shot from the ferrymans cottage followed immediately afterwards by another and another the time for caution was gone if ever there had been such a time churning the water madly reynolds reached the far side in a few seconds touched bottom scrambled up the far shore with his driving feet slipping desperately on the sliding shingle swarmed over the bank clicked over the carbine switch from automatic to single shot firing a machinegun was less than useless it was positively dangerous if friend and enemy were fighting in the same confined space and ran crouching through the pale oblong of light that was the ferrymans front door ten minutes at the most had elapsed since he had walked out through that door janscis wife was no longer in the corridor but the corridor was not empty an avo man carbine in hand had just come out of the livingroom and was shutting the door behind him and even at that moment reynolds realised that that could mean only one thing the fight inside if there had been a fight and not just a massacre was over the avo man saw him tried to bring his gun up realised he could not make it in time and the warning shout died in his throat as the stock of reynolds carbine caught him terribly across the head and side of the face carbine again reversed in his hands reynolds gently toed open the door one swift allencompassing glance at the tableau before him and he knew that the fight was indeed over six avo men reynolds could see inside the room four of them still alive one lay almost at his feet in that strangely crumpled relaxation that only the dead can achieve another by the wall on the righthand side not far from where jennings was sitting with his head almost on his knees as he shook it slowly from side to side in one far corner a man held a carbine on a bleeding jansci while another bound his hands to the chair on which he was sitting while in the other corner the cossack lying on his back was struggling desperately with the man who lying on top of him was bludgeoning him with short arm blows to the head but the cossack fought on and reynolds could see how he was fighting he was pulling with all his strength on the stock of his whip whose sixteenfoot length was wrapped round and round the throat of the man above inexorably turning his face a strange bluish colour and slowly strangling him near the centre of the room stood the giant coco contemptuously ignoring the girl who struggled so futilely in the crook of one great arm grinning with wolfish expectation as the avo roan fighting with the cossack stopped belabouring him reached back with his right hand fumbled with his belt and came clear with a sheath knife reynolds had been trained and ruthlessly trained by wartime professionals who had survived similar situations a score of times and survived by neither demanding surrender nor wasting the tiniest fraction of a second in unnecessary announcement of their presence those who kicked open a door and said good evening gentlemen never lived to talk about it the door was still swinging gently on its hinges when he fired the first of three deliberate spaced carefully aimed shots the first pitched the cossacks assailant into the corner of the room the knife falling from his upraised hand and clattering to the floor the second took the man who held the gun on jansci the third the man who had been tying janscis hands reynolds was just lining up for the fourth shot sighting for cocos head with an almost inhuman lack of haste the giant avo had swung the girl round in front of his body for protection when a rifle barrel smashed across his carbine and left forearm sending his gun clattering heavily on the floor yet another avo man had been behind the door as it had opened and been completely hidden he must have thought it had been the man who had just left returning until reynolds had fired his first shot dont shoot him dont shoot him the quick hoarse order had come from coco with a careless shove he sent the girl across the room to land heavily on the couch and stood there with his hands on his hips while his fury at what had just happened and his elation at seeing reynolds powerless before him fought for supremacy in the darkly evil face the struggle didnt last long eves even the lives of his comrades mattered little to coco and a grin of unholy anticipation spread across the brutalised face see if our friend is armed he commanded the other man searched reynolds briefly hands running up and down the outside of the clothes then shook his head excellent catch this coco threw his carbine across to the other and drew his open palms slowly up and down across the front of his tunic i have an account to settle with you captain reynolds or perhaps you have forgotten coco meant to kill him reynolds knew meant to have the joy of killing him with his bare hands his own left arm was useless it felt as if it had been broken and useless it would remain for some time to come deep inside him he knew that he had no chance in the world that he couldnt hold coco off for more than a few seconds but he told himself that if ever he was to have a chance it was now before the fight had started while the element of surprise still existed as a possibility and even with the thought he was hurling himself across the room his legs jackknifing open as his feet reached for the giants chest coco was almost taken by surprise almost but not quite he was moving away even as the feet struck him making him grunt with the pain and one of his flailing arms caught reynolds behind the head so that he all but somersaulted his back striking painfully against the wall by the couch with a force that drove all the breath from his body with an explosive gasp for a moment he lay quite still then badly winded and aching though he was he forced himself to struggle to his feet again if cocos feet reached him while he was still on the floor reynolds knew that he would never rise again moved to meet the advancing giant and struck out with all that remained of his strength at the sneering face before him felt his fist strike home jarringly against solid bone and flesh then coughed in agony as coco contemptuously ignored the blow and struck him with tremendous force in the middle of the body reynolds had never been hit so hard he had never imagined any person could have been capable of hitting so hard the man had the strength of an ox in spite of the sea of pain below his chest in spite of his rubbery legs and the wave of nausea that threatened to choke him he was still on his feet but only because his splayed hands were supporting him from the wall against which he had been hurled he thought he could hear the girl calling his name but he couldnt be sure he seemed to have become suddenly deaf his vision too was blurred and dimmed he could just vaguely distinguish jansci struggling frantically with the ropes that secured him when he saw coco coming at him again hopelessly despairingly reynolds flung himself forward in a last futile attempt to lash out at his tormentor but coco just sidestepped laughed placed the flat of his hand against reynolds back and sent him reeling crazily across the room to crash into the jamb of the open door and slide slowly down to the floor for a few brief moments consciousness left him then slowly returned and he shook his head dazedly coco was still in the middle of the room arms akimbo triumph in every line of the seamed and evil face the lips drawn back in wolfish anticipation of pleasure yet to come coco meant him to die reynolds realised dimly but he meant him to die slowly well at this rate it would not be much longer he had no strength left he had to fight for every gasping breath he took and his legs were almost gone weakly dizzily he pushed himself somehow to his feet and stood thereswaying conscious of nothing but the reeling room the fire of his body the salt taste of blood on his lips and his indestructible enemy standing there laughing in the middle of the floor once more reynolds told himself dully once more he can only kill me once and he was reaching his hands behind to launch himself on his last tottering run when he saw the expression on cocos face change and an iron arm reached across his chest and pinned him to the corner as sandor walked slowly into the room reynolds would never afterwards forget how sandor looked at that moment like something that belonged not to this world but to the icehalls of scandinavian mythology fifteen minutes perhaps twenty had elapsed since sandor had plunged into that freezing river and most of the time since then he had spent out in the subzero cold he was coated now with ice coated almost from head to foot and the falling snow had clung to him and turned to ice also in the light from the ferrymans oil lamp he glistened and glittered in that rigid crackling suit of ice like some eerie visitor from another and alien world the avo man by the door stood openmouthed in shock recovered with a visible effort dropped one of the two carbines his own and cocos that were encumbering him and tried to line the other up on sandor but he was too late sandor caught the rifle with one hand tore it from the mans grasp as one would take a stick from a little child and pushed the man back against the wall with his free hand the man swore took two running steps and leapt snarling at him but sandor just plucked him out of the air whirled round in a complete circle then flung him across the room with dreadful force to smash high up against a wall where he hung grotesquely for a moment as if held there by invisible hands then fell to the floor like a broken crumpled doll even as the avo man had leapt at sandor julia had slid off the couch and thrown herself at cocos back flinging her arms round him trying to delay him if only for a second but her hands could not even meet round his chest he had broken her grip as if it were cotton and pushed her to one side without as much as looking at her and had already fallen upon an offbalance sandor bludgeoning him with great swinging sledgehammer blows so that sandor fell heavily to the floor with coco on top of him his great hands already round sanders throat there was no grin on cocos face now no gleam of anticipation in the small black eyes he was fighting for his life and he knew it for a moment sandor lay motionless while cocos iron fingers tightened inexorably round his throat the massive shoulders hunching as he put all his great strength into the effort then sandor stirred reached up his hands and caught coco round the wrists reynolds still weak and barely able to stand upright julia beside him now and clutching his arms stared in fascination reynolds entire body seemed a sea of pain but even through that pain he seemed to feel again something of the agony he had felt when sandor had once caught him by the forearms and squeezed and squeezed with the flat of his fingers and not as he was now doing with his hooked fingertips digging deep into the tendons on the inside of cocos wrists shock it was that showed first in cocos face the shock of unbelief then pain then fear as his wrists were crushed in the vice of sandors grip and his fingers round sandors throat slowly forced to open still holding cocos wrists sandor pushed him to one side rose to ms feet pulled coco after him so that the avo giant towered high above him swiftly released the wrists and had his arms locked round cocos chest before coco had had time to appreciate what was happening reynolds thought at first that sandor meant to throw the other and from the momentary relief on cocos face it seemed that he had thought so also but if he had so thought the disillusionment and the pain and the fear came soon and all in an instant as sander buried his head deep into cocos chest lifted his shoulders high and began to crush the giant in a murderous bear hug which coco must have known in a sudden flash of certainty he would never live to feel relaxing for the fear in his expression gave way to contorted terror as his face turned bluishred from the lack of oxygen as he moaned deep in his throat while his starving lungs fought for air and his fists hammered in frantic madness against sanders back and shoulders with as much effect as if he were beating them against a rock of granite but the memory of that moment that reynolds took with him was not of cocos threshing panic and darkening paincontorted features not even of sandors expressionless face with the still gentle eyes but of the steady crackling of ice as sandor crushed ever more tightly more remorselessly and of the horror on julias face as he caught her to him and tried to shut out from her ears as best he could the hoarse horrible scream that filled the room then slowly faded and died chapter fifteen it was just after four oclock in the morning when jansci halted them in the centre of a thick clump of headhigh reeds turned and waited until the others had caught up with him they came in single file julia reynolds the cossack and dr jennings with sandor beside him halfhelping halfcarrying him across the frozen marshes all with their heads bent low all except sandor with the trudging stumbling gait of those very close to exhaustion they had reason and more than reason for their exhaustion two hours and three miles lay between them and where they had left the truck two hours of winding in and out between the frozen reeds that snapped and crackled at the lightest touch two hours of interminable stumbling and crunching through the thin ice of freezing marshes ice just not strong enough to bear their weight but more than strong enough to impede their progress compelling them to lift each foot high to clear it before moving on to the next step where they would sink down again through ice and frozen mud often beyond their knees but that same ice was their salvation that night the dogs of the border guards would have found the conditions hopeless for operation and could only have floundered along helplessly out of their depth not that they had seen or heard either dogs or guards once in these three miles on a night such as this even the fanatical guards of the avo huddled high in their stilted border towers round the warmth of a stove and let who would pass by it was a night such as the night on which reynolds had crossed the border into hungary with the cold stars riding high in a cold and empty sky and a wind sighing gently through the marshes a bitter wind that touched their cheeks with icy talons and carried their frozen breath drifting away through the softly rustling reeds for a moment reynolds himself was lost in the memory of that first night when he had lain in the snow as cold and even colder than he was now and had felt the icy wind in his face and seen the stars high above and then with an almost physical effort he wrenched his mind away from that night for his thoughts had moved on to the police hut and the appearance of the count and he felt sick to his heart when he remembered for the hundredth time that the count would never come again no time for dreaming now meechail jansci said gently he nodded with his roughlybandaged head leaned forward and parted high reeds for reynolds to have a glimpse of what lay beyond a sheet of ice perhaps ten feet wide that stretched in both directions as far as he could see he straightened again and looked at jansci a canal a ditch thats all just a little drainage ditch but the most important in all europe on the other side lies austria jansci smiled five metres from freedom meechail freedom and the success of a mission nothing can stop you now nothing can stop me now reynolds echoed his voice was flat empty of all life the longedfor freedom interested him hardly at all the complete success of his mission even less the success was ashes in his mouth the cost had been too cruelly high worst of all perhaps was what was to come and he knew with a sombre certainty what that was he shivered in the bitter cold it grows even colder jansci the crossing is safe no guards are near the crossing is safe come then lets not wait any longer not me jansci shook his head just you and the professor and julia i remain here reynolds nodded heavily and said nothing he had known what jansci was about to say and knew with equal certainty that discussion was useless he turned away not knowing what to say and even as he turned julia broke loose from his arms and caught her father by the lapels of his coat what did you say jansci what was that you said please julia there is no other way you know there is no other way i have to stay oh jansci jansci she was pulling at his lapels shaking them in her anxiety you cant stay you mustnt not now not after all thats happened more than ever after all thats happened he put his arms round her and pulled her close and said i have work to do i have much work to do and as yet i have hardly begun if i stop now the count will never forgive me he smoothed the blonde hair with his scarred and twisted hand julia julia how could i ever accept freedom for myself while i know there are hundreds of poor people who will never know freedom unless it comes through me no one can help them as well as i you know that how can i buy for myself at the expense of others a happiness that would be no happiness at all can you expect me to sit at my ease somewhere in the west while the young men here are still being dragged off to the black sea canal or dying old women being driven out to work in the beet fields and the snow still on the ground do you indeed think so little of me julia jansci her face was buried in his coat and her voice was muffled i cant leave you jansci you can and must you were not known before but you are known now and there is no place for you in hungary no harm will come to me my dear not while sandor lives and the cossack too will look after me in the starlit gloom the cossack seemed to straighten and grow tall and you can leave me you can let me go you no longer need me my child you have stayed with me all these years because you thought i needed you and now meechail here will look after you you know that yes her voice was more muffled than ever he is very kind jansci caught her by the shoulders held her at arms length and looked at her for the daughter of majorgeneral illyurin youre a very silly girl do you not know my dear that if it were not for you meechail would not be returning to the west she turned and stared at reynolds and he could see that her eyes were shining in the starlight with unshed tears is is this true its true reynolds smiled faintly a long argument but i lost it he wont have me at any price im sorry i did not know the life had gone out of her voice this is the end of it then no my dear only the beginning jansci caught her close and held her as her body shook with dry soundless sobs looked over her shoulder and nodded at reynolds and sandor reynolds nodded in return shook the scarred misshapen hand in silence murmured his goodbye to the cossack parted the tall reeds and went down to the ditch followed by sandor who held one end of the cossacks whip while reynolds held the other and moved out gingerly on the ice on the second step it broke under his weight and he was standing on the muddy bottom covered to the thighs in the freezing water but he ignored the numbing cold of it broke the ice in front of him and pulled himself up on to the far bank austria he said to himself this is austria but the word meant nothing to him something splashed into the water behind him and he turned to see sandor forging his way through the water and broken ice carrying dr jennings high in his arms and as soon as reynolds had him safely on top of the bank sandor waded back to the hungarian side gently took the girl away from jansci and carried her in turn across the ditch for a moment she clung to him almost desperately as if she were terrified of breaking the last contact with the life she was leaving behind her then reynolds stooped down and raised her on to the bank beside him do not forget what i told you dr jennings jansci called softly he and the cossack had come through the reeds and were standing on the far bank we are walking a long dark road but we do not want to walk it for evermore i will not forget jennings was shaking with cold i will never forget it is good jansci bowed his white bandaged head in a barely perceptible token of farewell god be with you dowidzenia dowidzenia reynolds echoed dowidzenia till we meet again he turned caught julia and dr jennings by the arms and led them the shivering old man and the silently crying girl up the gentle slope to the field and the freedom that lay beyond at the top he turned just for a moment and he could see the three men walking slowly away across the hungarian marshes never once looking back and by and by they were j lost to sight behind the tall reeds and he knew that he would i never see them again the end
