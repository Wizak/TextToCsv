 five hundred dollars or jacob marlowes secret by horatio alger jr author of the erie train boy from farm boy to senator the young acrobat etc new york hurst company publishers chapter i a new arrival in lakeville slowly through the village street walked an elderly man with bronzed features and thin gray hair supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane he was apparently tired for seeing a slight natural elevation under a branching elm tree he sat down and looked thoughtfully about him well he said lakeville hasnt changed much since i left it twenty years since has there been any change among those who are near to me i dont know but i shall soon find out shall i receive a welcome or not there ought to be two families to greet me but here a boy appeared on the scene a boy of fifteen with a sturdy figure and a pleasant face whose coarse suit indicated narrow means if not poverty seeing the old man with instinctive politeness he doffed his hat and with a pleasant smile bade him goodmorning goodmorning returned the traveller won by the boys pleasant face and manner if you are not in a hurry wont you sit down by me and answer a few questions with pleasure sir my business isnt driving this is lakeville isnt it yes sir i used to know the place a good many years since it hasnt grown much no sir its rather quiet chiefly a farming region isnt it yes sir but there is a large shoe manufactory here employing a hundred hands who is the owner squire marlowe ha ejaculated the old man evidently interested albert marlowe isnt it yes sir do you know him i havent met him for twenty years but we are acquainted i suppose he is prosperous he is considered a rich man sir he is a relation of mine indeed what then is your name asked the old man eagerly herbert barton most people call me bert barton bert was surprised at the keen scrutiny which he received from the traveller was your mother mary marlowe the latter asked yes sir returned bert did you know her too i ought to she is my niece as the man you call squire marlowe is my nephew then you must be uncle jacob who has lived so many years in california said bert excitedly the same mother will be very glad to see you added bert cordially thank you my boy your kind welcome does me good i hope your mother is well and happy she is a widow answered bert soberly when did your father die two years ago i hope he left your mother in comfortable circumstances bert shook his head he only left the small house we live in and that is mortgaged for half its value then how do you live mother covers baseballs for a firm in the next town and i am working in the big shoe shop doesnt squire marlowe do anything for your mother he gave me a place in the shop that is all yet he is rich said the old man thoughtfully yes he lives in a fine house you can see it down the street on the other side that large one with a broad piazza he keeps two horses and two handsome carriages and i am sure he must have plenty of money i am glad to hear it i have been a long time among strangers it will be pleasant to come to anchor at the house of a rich relation where does your mother live in a small cottage at the other end of the street wont you come home with me uncle jacob mother will be glad to see you i must call at albert marlowes first what family has he he has one boy about my own age i suppose you are very intimate being cousins bert laughed he wouldnt thank you for calling us cousins he answered percy marlowe is a boy who thinks a good deal of himself he puts on no end of airs like his father before him is he a smart boy do you mean in his studies yes i dont know what he could do if he tried but he doesnt exert himself much he says it isnt necessary for him as his father is a rich man how is it with you i only wish i had his chance said bert warmly i am fond of study but i am poor and must work for a living you have the right idea and he has not said the old man sententiously at this moment a light buggy was driven swiftly by seated in it was a boy about the age of bert apparently but of slighter figure the horse suddenly spying the old man shied and in a trice the buggy was upset and the young dude went sprawling on the ground bert grasped the situation and sprang to the rescue he seized the terrified horse while the old man helped reverse the carriage which fortunately had not met with any material damage the same may be said of the young driver who with mortified face struggled to his feet and surveyed ruefully the muddy stains on his handsome suit i hope youre not hurt percy said bert with solicitude ive spoiled my suit thats all returned percy shortly what made you scare my horse i didnt answered bert with spirit what right have you to charge me with such a thing then if it wasnt you it was that old tramp you were talking with persisted percy sullenly hush percy said bert apprehensive lest the old mans feelings might be hurt you dont know who this gentleman is i never met the gentleman before rejoined percy with ironical deference then let me introduce him as your uncle jacob marlowe from california percys face betrayed much more surprise than pleasure as he stammered is that true yes answered the old man smiling calmly i have the honor to be related to you young gentleman does father know you are here no i am going to call upon him percy hardly knew what to think he had heard his father speak of uncle jacob and indulge in the hope that he had accumulated a fortune in california his shabby attire did not suggest wealth certainly but percy was wise enough to know that appearances are not always to be relied upon if this old man were wealthy he would be worth propitiating at any rate till he knew to the contrary he had better be polite will you ride to the house with me sir he asked considerably to berts surprise no thank you there might be another upset jump into the buggy and ill walk along after you percy was relieved by this decision for he had no wish to be seen with such a companion all right sir he said ill see you at the house without a word of acknowledgment to bert percy sprang into the buggy and drove rapidly away shall i go with you uncle jacob asked bert no thank you i can find the way tell your mother that i will call on her very soon chapter ii uncle jacobs reception percy found his father at home and quickly acquainted him with the arrival in town of uncle jacob his news was received with interest by squire marlowe why didnt you invite him to ride home with you asked the squire i did but he preferred to walk what does he look like like an old tramp answered percy squire marlowe was taken aback for without having received any definite intelligence from the long absent relative he had somehow persuaded himself that uncle jacob had accumulated a fortune at the mines then he is shabbily dressed said the squire inquiringly i should say so i say father i thought he was rich you always said so and i still think so then why dont he dress better he is rather eccentric percy and these california miners dont care much for dress as a rule i shouldnt wonder if he were worth half a million youd better treat him with attention for we are his natural heirs and theres no telling what may happen enough said father i dont care how he dresses if hes got the cash i must go and speak to your mother or she will treat him coldly you know how particular she is squire marlowe managed to drop a hint to his wife who was as worldly wise as himself and saw the advantage of being attentive to a wealthy relative by this time uncle jacob had reached the door squire marlowe himself answered the bell as a mark of special attention and gazed with curiosity at the old man jacob marlowe though coarsely clad was scrupulously neat and clean and there was a pleasant smile on his bronzed face as he recognized his nephew i believe you are uncle jacob said the squire affably yes albert and im mighty glad to see a relation its twentyfive years since i have seen one that was kin to me welcome to lakeville uncle jacob i am glad to see you percy told me he met you on the road why didnt you ride up with him it wasnt worth gettin in to ride a quarter of a mile i am used to exercise in california to be sure come into the house and lay your valise down anywhere here is my wife mrs marlowe julia this is uncle jacob of whom you have heard me speak so often i am glad to see you mr marlowe said the lady formally just touching the old mans hand where are you going to put uncle jacob julia asked the squire you may take him to the blue room said mrs marlowe in a tone of hesitation this blue room was the handsomest chamber in the house and was assigned to those whom it was considered politic to honor come right upstairs uncle jacob ill show you your room myself said albert marlowe i aint used to such luxury albert said the old man as he gazed around the comfortably appointed apartment you ought to see my cabin at murphys diggings i reckon your servant would turn up her nose at it i know you dont care much for style in california uncle no we dont though weve got as handsome houses in frisco as anywhere else why albert this room is fine enough for a prince then you can think yourself a prince said the squire genially now if you want to wash your face and hands and arrange your toilet you will have abundant time before dinner come down when you have finished albert marlowe returned to his wife mr marlowe said she are you very sure that old man is rich i have no doubt of it julia but what an old fright he is why he looks dreadfully common and his clothes are wretchedly shabby true julia but you must remember miners are not very particular about their dress i should think not if he is a fair specimen it makes me shudder to think of his occupying the blueroom the hall bedroom on the third floor would have been good enough for him remember my dear he is in all probability very wealthy and we are his heirs i am not so well off as people imagine and it will be a great thing for us to have a fortune of a quarter or half a million drop in by and by theres something in that to be sure the lady admitted but cant you induce him to wear better clothes i will suggest it very soon we mustnt be too precipitate for fear he should take offense you know these rich uncles expect to be treated with a good deal of consideration do you think he will expect to live with us i shall really give up if i have got to have such a looking old tramp as a permanent member of the family but julia if he is really very rich it is important for us to keep him strictly in view you know there will be plenty of designing persons who will be laying snares to entrap him and get possession of his money how old is he is he likely to live long i think he must be about sixtyfive and he looks alarmingly healthy said mrs marlowe with a sigh his father died at sixtyseven mrs marlowe brightened up that is encouraging she said hopefully i dont think he looks so very healthy added the squire he has a good color his father was the picture of health till within a few weeks of his death what did he die of apoplexy to be sure the old man looks as if he might go off that way in that case we should only need to be troubled with him a couple of years and for that we should be richly repaid they will seem like two eternities groaned the lady and the chief burden will come on me you shall be repaid my dear only treat him well will you give me half what money he leaves to us say onethird julia that will repay you richly for all your trouble very well let it be a third but mr marlowe dont let there be any mistake i depend upon you to find out as soon as possible how much money the old man has trust to me julia i am just as anxious to know as you are in twenty minutes uncle jacob came down stairs he had done what he could to improve his appearance or slick himself up as he expressed it and wore a blue coat and vest each provided with brass buttons but from close packing in his valise both were creased up in such a manner that squire marlowe and his wife shuddered and percys face wore an amused and supercilious smile i declare i feel better to be dressed up said the old man how long do you think ive had this coat and vest albert i really couldnt guess i had it made for me ten years ago in sacramento it looks pretty well but then ive only worn it for best percy had to stuff his handkerchief in his mouth to repress a laugh uncle jacob regarded him with a benevolent smile and seemed himself to be amused about something now uncle jacob well sit down to dinner you must be hungry well i have got a fairish appetite what a nice eatin room youve got albert i aint used to such style i presume not said mrs marlowe dryly chapter iii a visit to the factory during dinner the old man chatted away in the frankest manner but not a word did he let drop as to his worldly circumstances he appeared to enjoy his dinner and showed himself entirely at his ease im glad to see you so well fixed albert he said youve got a fine home it will do very well returned the squire modestly i suppose he never was in such a good house before thought mrs marlowe by the way just before i fell in with you here went on jacob i ran across marys boy herbert barton suggested the squire with a slight frown yes he said that was his name they live in the village said his nephew shortly theyre poor aint they yes barton was not a forehanded man he didnt know how to accumulate money i suppose he left very little to his widow very little however i have given the boy a place in my factory and i believe his mother earns a trifle by covering baseballs they dont want for anything that is anything in reason bert barton seems a likely boy oh hes as good as the average of boys in his position i suppose he and percy are quite intimate being cousins indeed we are not returned percy tossing his head his position is very different from mine uncle jacob surveyed percy in innocent wonder still hes kin to you he observed that doesnt always count said percy he has his friends and i have mine i dont believe in mixing classes i expect things have changed since i was a boy said uncle jacob mildly then all the boys were friendly and sociable no matter whether they were rich or poor i agree with percy broke in mrs marlowe stiffly his position in life will be very different from that of the boy you refer to any early intimacy even if we encouraged it could not well be kept up in afterlife perhaps you are right said the old man ive been away so long at the mines that i havent kept up with the age or the fashions percy smiled as his glance rested on his uncles creased suit and he felt quite ready to agree with what he said i was thinkin how pleasant it would be if you would invite mary and her boy to tea we are all related you know we could talk over old times and scenes and have a real social time mrs marlowe seemed horrorstruck at the suggestion i dont think it would be convenient she said coldly it would be better for you to see mrs barton at her own house put in the squire hastily well perhaps it would by the way uncle jacob i hope your experiences of california are pleasant insinuated squire marlowe theyre mixed albert ive had my ups and downs i have heard of large fortunes being made there pursued the squire i suppose theres some truth in what we hear to be sure why ten years from the time i went to the mines i had a hundred thousand dollars deposited to my credit in a sacramento bank squire marlowes eyes sparkled with pleasure it was just what he had been hoping to find out so uncle jacob was rich after all the squires manner became even more gracious and he pressed upon his relative another plate of ice cream no thank you albert said the old man im used to plain livin it isnt often i sit down to a meal like this do you know theres nothing suits me better than a dinner of corned beef and cabbage how vulgar the old man is thought mrs marlowe he may have money but his tastes are very common we never have corned beef and cabbage here she said with a slight shudder very likely bert bartons mother has it very often suggested percy my dear said the squire urbanely if uncle jacob really enjoys those dishes so much you might provide them for his special use i will think of it replied mrs marlowe shortly now that uncle jacob had hinted at the possession of wealth squire marlowe beheld him as one transfigured he was no longer a common shabby old man but a worthy old gentleman of eccentric ideas in the matter of wardrobe and manners i wonder if uncle jacob wouldnt advance me twentyfive thousand dollars was the thought that was passing through his mind as he gazed genially at his countrified guest it would help me amazingly in my business and enable me to do double as much i will mention it to him in good time ive a great mind to come upon the old man for a handsome birthday present thought percy fifty dollars wouldnt be much for him to give i shant get more than a fiver from the governor uncle jacob said the squire as they rose from the table suppose you walk over to the factory with me i should like you to see it nothing would please me better said jacob marlowe briskly will you come along percy asked his father no papa answered percy with a grimace you know i dont like the smell of leather i ought not to dislike it said the squire with a smile for it gives me a very handsome income oh its different with you returned percy just give me the profits of the factory and ill go there every day hes a sharp one said the squire with a smile i am afraid he is too sharp to suit me thought uncle jacob it seems to me the boys mind runs upon money and his own interests the shoe factory was a large building of two stories and within it was a hive of industry as the squire led the way he explained the various workings to the old man who was really curious and interested it was on a larger scale than was common at the time he left for california and the use of machinery had to a greater extent supplemented and superseded the work of the hands finally they came to a room where several boys were pegging shoes for this work was still done in the oldfashioned way uncle jacobs eyes lighted up when in one of them he recognized bert barton he hurried forward and put his hand on berts shoulder so this is your business he said yes answered bert with a smile do you find it hard work oh no that is i am used to it it used to tire me at first did you tell your mother i was in town yes answered bert and she says she hopes you will call to be sure i will i may call this evening hes a likely boy albert said uncle jacob rejoining the squire who stood aloof with a look of annoyance on his face he works very well i believe was the cold reply shall we move on albert doesnt seem to feel much interest in his poor relations thought uncle jacob well its human nature i suppose you seem to be doing a large business albert he said aloud yes but with a little more capital i could very much increase it rejoined the squire with twentyfive thousand dollars now i would enlarge the factory to double its present size and do twice the business i am now doing i am afraid you want to get rich too fast albert it would gratify my spirit of enterprise uncle jacob i feel that i have the ability to make a big business success very likely albert ive seen enough to convince me of that hell lend me the money if i work things right squire marlowe said to himself hell be like wax in my hands chapter iv uncle jacobs startling revelation uncle jacob was at the factory this afternoon said bert to his mother when he went home he says he may call here this evening i hope he will he was my poor mothers favorite brother always kind and goodhearted how is he looking bert he seems in good health for an old man his face is browned up as if he had been out in the open air a good deal i hope he has it is twentyfive years since he went to california does he look as if he had prospered i am afraid he is poor mother for although his clothing is neat and clean it is plain and the cloth is faded i am sorry to hear that but i will welcome him none the less warmly it will indeed seem like old times to have uncle jacob in my house meanwhile bert had been bringing in wood and doing chores for his mother did uncle jacob tell you how long he intended to stay in lakeville no mother i only had a short time to talk with him when percy rode by and then he started to call on the squire do you know mother i am rather surprised that he should have been so well received poor as he looks i think better of albert for it it shows that he is not so worldly as i feared certainly uncle jacob ought to be well received by albert marlowe for when alberts father was in trouble jacob lent him five hundred dollars all in money he had and i feel sure the money has not been repaid to him to this day i dont think percy will be very cordial you know what high notions he has he gets them principally from his mother who is extremely aristocratic in her ideas was she of a high family mrs barton smiled her father was a fisherman she replied and when a girl she used to run barefoot on the sand later on she sewed straw for a living she is no worse for that certainly but it doesnt give her any claims to aristocracy do you think percy knows about his mothers early life i presume she has kept it secret from him i shall think of it when percy gets into one of his patronizing moods remember bert that neither he nor his mother is any the worse for her humble birth i understand that i hope mother just as i dont feel ashamed of our being poor as long as we can make an honorable living we have no right to complain that reminds me mother that i heard bad news at the shop today what is that that the shop is likely to be shut down all next month why is that asked mrs barton an anxious look coming over her face i believe the market is oversupplied with shoes and it is thought best to suspend temporarily itll be rather hard on me yes it will said his mother gravely i earn so little at sewing balls dont you think i could get a job at that mother no you could not do the work satisfactorily besides there are hands enough for all that is required well we must hope for the best i think i can manage to earn something mother said bert hopefully ill try hard anyway we wont worry till the time comes bert an hour later there was a knock at the door mrs barton answered it in person why uncle jacob is it really you she exclaimed joyfully im delighted to see you mary said the old man his face lighting up ive been waiting twentyfive years for this meeting come right in uncle jacob i can hardly believe it is really you now tell me why you have not written these many years ive no good excuse mary but perhaps i shall think of one bimeby now tell me how you are getting along i am not rich as you can see uncle jacob but as long as bert and i have our health and work to do i shall be contented do you know mary said jacob marlowe looking about the plain little sittingroom i like your house better than alberts i dont think you will find many to agree with you perhaps not but this seems like home and that doesnt alberts house is finely furnished true and he lives in fine style but i dont think i should ever be contented to live with him has he invited you yes answered jacob but he added with a smile i dont think the invitation will hold good after tomorrow why not the fact is albert and the whole family think i am rich i shouldnt think they would judge that from your appearance oh they think i am eccentric and plain in my tastes and that ive got my pile safe somewhere i wish you had uncle jacob happiness doesnt depend on money mary as you realize in your own case i am an old man to be sure but i am well and strong and able to work for a living but at your age uncle jacob it would be comfortable to feel that you could rest come mary dont make me out a patriarch im only sixtyfive and i can tackle a pretty good days work yet you might be sick uncle jacob dont let us imagine unpleasant things mary i dont mean to be sick and at any rate you can come and stay with us you will always find a home here though an humble one do you really mean that mary said uncle jacob earnestly would you really be willing to take in the old man and provide for his comforts of course i would uncle jacob answered mrs barton heartily i hope you didnt think so poorly of me as to doubt it no i was sure you hadnt changed so much since you were a girl well mary i may some time remind you of your promise you wont need to remind me uncle jacob i was afraid albert would take you wholly away from us so he might if i were as rich as he thinks i am but now let us talk about other things remember i havent heard any family news for many years and i have a great many questions to ask the rest of the evening was spent in such conversation as uncle jacob suggested and when he had occasion to look at his watch he started in surprise bless my soul he exclaimed it is nearly ten oclock i ought to be getting back to alberts then bert shall accompany you as far as the house it will be lonely to go alone uncle jacob reached squire marlowes house as the church clock struck ten and he bade bert goodnight shortly after his return uncle jacob was shown to his room and being fatigued he soon fell asleep not waking till seven in the morning after breakfast squire marlowe said graciously have you any plans uncle jacob in which i can assist you if you would like to consult me about any investments i can perhaps be of service to you now for it thought the old man i was thinkin albert he said of askin your advice im gettin on in years and cant work as well as i could once do you think it would pay me to open here in lakeville a cigar and candy store and what exclaimed squire marlowe with an expression of horror and disgust on his face you see ive got about five hundred dollars which i think would be enough to stock it comfortably and but i thought you were a rich man gasped squire marlowe didnt you tell me you had a hundred thousand dollars in a sacramento bank yes many years ago but i bought mining stocks and after a while they went down to nothing and then you are a pauper said the squire harshly no i have five hundred dollars and i hope with that to get started so as to earn an honest living words cannot describe the scorn and disgust that appeared on the faces of percy and his mother at the old mans confession of poverty albert said the wife may i speak with you outside a moment certainly my dear get rid of the old man as soon as you can she said imperiously he doesnt eat another meal in my house be easy my dear said the squire ill manage it chapter v uncle jacob receives his walking papers squire marlowe returned to the breakfast room wearing rather an embarrassed expression percy had followed his mother and the old man found himself for a short time alone there was a twinkle of amusement in his eyes which vanished on the reappearance of his nephew i am sorry to have left you alone uncle jacob said the squire civilly oh dont treat me with any ceremony albert being as we are such near relations we ought to be free and easy like i am glad to hear you say so for i shall be obliged to treat you unceremoniously eh said uncle jacob inquiringly i regret to say that my wife who is of a very delicate organization is taken suddenly ill and i am afraid i shall have to ask you to cut your visit short and come again some other time im surprised to hear that albert i thought mrs marlowe looked in excellent health you cant always tell by outward appearances she is subject to severe headaches and in that condition cant bear the least noise or excitement that is why i cant invite you to stay any longer i understand said uncle jacob with it might have been a little significance in his tone i have no doubt went on the squire that mrs barton will be glad to have you pay her a short visit i will get percy to drive you down there thank you answered the old man dryly but its only a little way and i dont mind walking just as you prefer said the squire relieved by uncle jacobs declination of his offer for he knew that percy would not enjoy the trip ill get ready to go at once albert oh about my plan of opening a cigar store in lakeville i cannot advise you to do it rejoined the squire hastily you wouldnt make enough to pay your rent or not much more dont the men in your factory smoke theres a good many of them if i could get their trade they smoke pipes for the most part said the squire hurriedly theyd find cigars too expensive i meant to combine candy with cigars that would be a help they keep candy at the grocery store uncle jacob i see there isnt much show for me now if i only understood your business you could give me something to do in the factory albert but you dont and in fact uncle jacob its too hard work for a man of your age then what would you advise me to do albert asked the old man earnestly squire marlowe assumed a thoughtful look in fact he was puzzled to decide how best to get rid of the troublesome old man to have him remain in lakeville was not to be thought of he would gladly have got rid of mrs barton and her son whose relationship to his family was unfortunately known but there seemed to be no way clear to that without the expenditure of money to have uncle jacob for a neighbor in addition would be a source of mortification not only to himself but even more to his wife and percy whose aristocratic ideas he well knew i think you told me you had five hundred dollars he said after a pause about that then i really think it would be the best thing you could do to go back to california where you are known and where you can doubtless obtain some humble employment which will supply your moderate wants it wont cost you much for dress no albert this coat and vest will do me for best five years longer just so that is fortunate so you see youve only got your board to pay i might get sick suggested uncle jacob doubtfully you look pretty healthy besides youll have part of your five hundred dollars left you know thats so what a good calculator you are albert besides if things came to the worst theres that five hundred dollars i lent your father twentyseven years ago no doubt youd pay me back and i dont know what you refer to said squire marlowe coldly surely you havent forgot the time when your father was so driven for money when you were a lad of fifteen and i let him have all i had except about fifty dollars that i kept for a rainy day this is news to me uncle jacob said the squire with a chilling frown you must excuse me for saying that i think you labor under a delusion uncle jacob surveyed his neighbor intently with a gaze which disconcerted him in spite of his assurance fortunately i am able to prove what i say he rejoined after a slight pause he drew from his pocket a wallet which bore the signs of long wear and opening it deliberately drew out a folded sheet of note paper grown yellow with age and brittle with much handling then adjusting his spectacles he added heres something id like to read to you albert its written by your father my dear jacob i cannot tell you how grateful i am to you for lending me the five hundred dollars i so urgently need i know it is very nearly if not quite all you possess in the world and that you can ill spare it it will save me from failure and sometime i hope to repay it to you if i cannot i will ask my son albert to do so when he is able i dont want you to lose by your kindness to me your affectionate brother charles marlowe you can see the signature albert you know your fathers handwriting dont you squire marlowe reluctantly took the paper and glanced at it it may be my fathers writing he said may be repeated the old man indignantly what do you mean by that i dare say it is in fact i remember his mentioning the matter to me before he died what did he say that it was quite a favor to him the loan but that he repaid it within three years from the time he received it what exclaimed uncle jacob pushing his spectacles up in his amazement your father said that yes he did answered albert marlowe with unabashed effrontery that he paid back the five hundred dollars i lent him thats what i said repeated the squire impatiently then its a lie not of my brothers but of somebodys that money remains unpaid to this day squire marlowe shrugged his shoulders no doubt you think so he said but you are growing old and old people are forgetful that is the most charitable view to take of your statement i wouldnt have believed this albert said the old man sorrowfully and you a rich man too i dont mind the money i can get along without it but to be told that i am claiming what has already been repaid i dont lay it up against you went on the squire smoothly ive no doubt you have forgotten the payment of the debt and i dont forget so easily though i am sixtyfive dont fear that i shall ask for it again indeed i havent asked for it at all but i shall not forget how you have treated my claim of course it amounts to nothing in law its outlawed long ago but i only wish my poor brother were alive to disprove your words even albert marlowe was shamed by the old mans sorrowful dignity we cant agree about that uncle jacob he said but if ever you get very hard up let me know and ill see if i cant help you in a small way you are very kind answered the old man but i dont think that time will come as you say my wants are few and i am still able to work ill go up to my room and get my valise and then ill go over to mary bartons thank heaven ive got rid of him mused the squire as from the doorway he saw uncle jacob walking slowly down the street i was afraid hed mention that money he lent father with twentyseven years interest it would amount to a good deal of money more than i could well spare i dont think i shall hear from it again has he gone albert asked mrs marlowe returning to the breakfastroom yes i told him you were indisposed and couldnt stand excitement no matter what you told him as long as we are rid of him chapter vi squire marlowe is surprised mrs barton was washing the breakfast dishes and was alone bert having gone to his daily work at the shoe shop when the outer door opened and uncle jacob entered the cottage valise in hand ive accepted your offer sooner than you expected mary he said you are heartily welcome uncle jacob responded his niece with evident sincerity if you can put up with our poor accommodations after being entertained in alberts luxurious home dont trouble yourself about that mary interrupted the old man albert doesnt want me he civilly asked me to find another stopping place you dont mean it exclaimed mrs barton indignantly you see explained uncle jacob with a quiet smile his wife was taken suddenly indisposed after she found i wasnt as rich as she expected i hope you wont take it too much to heart uncle jacob observed mary barton in a tone of solicitude uncle jacobs amused laugh reassured her it is just what i expected mary he said and i shant grieve over it much you ought to have seen how they all looked when i asked alberts advice about opening a small cigar and candy store in the village you can imagine what a mortification it would be to my hightoned nephew to have my sign out jacob marlowe candy and cigars over a small seven by nine store when our relationship was known i hope that wont prevent your carrying out the plan uncle jacob if your gains are small you can make your home with us and pay what you can afford thank you mary you are a true friend and i shant forget your kind offer but i never had the slightest idea of opening such a store i only mentioned it to test albert but you will have to do something uncle jacob said mary barton perplexed and that would be as easy as anything bert could go in the evening and help you if you found it too confining i have something else in view in the city returned jacob i dont need to earn much you know i dont set up to be a dude he added with a comical glance at his rustic attire and i dont mean to board at the fifth avenue hotel i am sorry you cant stay in lakeville said mrs barton regretfully i will stay here a week mary to get acquainted with you and your boy i have taken a fancy to him he is a fine manly youth worth a dozen of such fellows as percy marlowe indeed he is a good boy said his mother proudly i dont see what i could do without him so mary if youll show me where you are going to accommodate me ill go up and take possession will you mind my putting you in with bert i have but two chambers not a bit it will be all the better if i were going to stay here permanently i would build an extension to the house for you but that would be expensive uncle jacob so it would im always forgetting that i am not a rich man you see i was rich once as i told albert i have seen the time when i had a hundred thousand dollars to my credit in a bank of sacramento oh uncle jacob why didnt you invest it in government bonds and you would have been independent for life because i was not so prudent as my niece i suppose however its no use crying over spilt milk and ive got a matter of five hundred dollars left but that wont last long uncle jacob not unless i work but im pretty rugged yet and i guess i can manage to scrape along when bert came home to dinner he was surprised and pleased to find uncle jacob installed and evidently feeling quite at home i wish i could stay at home this afternoon to keep you company he said but i have only an hour for dinner business first my boy said the old man for pleasure well wait till this evening is there a livery stable in the village yes sir houghtons then after supper well hire a buggy and you and your mother and i will take a ride but uncle jacob you forget that it will cost a dollar or perhaps two no i dont mary but im having a vacation and i want to enjoy myself a little before pitching into hard work again i am sure you will be the better for a ride yes i shall i havent had one for months and it will be a real treat then we will cast prudence to the winds for once and have a good time i suppose you can drive bert oh yes sir i like it i worked for a few weeks in the grocery store and drove every day i like a horse so do i but i dont care much about handling the reins myself youll promise not to upset the carriage as percy did the other day not unless we meet two tramps as he did said bert laughing i declare mary there is your boy calling his old uncle a tramp and myself too uncle that makes it seem a little better are you going back to the shop yes uncle my time is up ill walk along with you as the two walked together uncle jacob took a five dollar bill from his pocket and handed it to bert there bert he said i want you to give that to your mother toward buying groceries and meat this week as her expenses will be increased by my being in the house but uncle jacob we dont want you to pay board i am able to do it and prefer it bert so say no more about it in truth this donation was a relief to bert and his mother for they were compelled to economize closely and yet wanted to live well while uncle jacob was visiting them about seven oclock bert drove round to the house in a handsome top buggy drawn by a spirited black horse the best in houghtons stable ill let you have it bert said mr houghton because i know youre a careful driver there are few persons i would trust with prince you may depend on me mr houghton i know i can bert and with a few directions the stable keeper resigned the turnout to bert you have got a stylish rig bert said uncle jacob i think we shall have to drive by albert marlowes just what i would like remarked bert with a smile bert had his share of human nature and rather enjoyed being seen by his aristocratic relatives in such a stylish turnout supper was over at squire marlowes and the family were sitting on the piazza the evening being warm when percy espied the buggy approaching i wonder whos driving houghtons best team he said by gracious if it isnt bert barton and his mother and uncle jacob he exclaimed a minute later the squire adjusted his eyeglasses and looked at the carriage now nearly opposite you are right percy he said what can it mean albert asked his wife in bewilderment as uncle jacob bowed from the buggy it means that a fool and his money are soon parted answered the squire i thought your uncle was poor so he is and he will soon be poorer from all appearances uncle jacob never was a good financial manager he was always too liberal or he wouldnt be as poor as he is now why with five hundred dollars he probably feels as rich as a nabob no doubt bert barton will help him spend it said percy it wont last long at any rate if he drives out every evening when his money is all gone he will probably throw himself on you for support father i wash my hands of him said squire marlowe in a hard tone if he squanders his money he must take the consequences i am glad to hear you speak in that way albert commented his wife approvingly uncle jacob enjoyed his drive and paid two dollars at the stable without letting the thought of his extravagance worry him i hope you enjoyed it mary he said i dont know when i have enjoyed myself so much uncle jacob nor i put in bert then i think the money well spent it makes me feel young again mary i think i made a mistake in staying away so long chapter vii uncle jacob leaves lakeville on his way home to dinner the next day bert fell in with percy marlowe i saw you out driving last evening remarked percy yes answered bert composedly you had houghtons best team yes how much did you have to pay i believe uncle jacob paid two dollars he must be crazy to pay two dollars for a ride why hes almost a pauper i think that is his business percy as to being a pauper i dont believe he will ever be that dont be too sure of it why he told father he had only five hundred dollars how long do you think thats going to last him if he throws away his money on carriage rides its only for once and as i said that isnt our business i dont know about that either when he has spent all his money hell be coming upon father to support him i dont believe he will said bert to whom it was disagreeable to hear the kind old man spoken of slightingly you see if he doesnt but it wont do any good father says as he makes his bed he must lie on it and i say bert barton it isnt very creditable to you and your mother to help the old man squander his money i dont thank you for your advice percy marlowe retorted bert with spirit if ever uncle jacob does come to want ill work for him and help him all i can you why youre as poor as poverty itself exclaimed percy with a mocking laugh good morning said bert shortly provoked but not caring to prolong the discussion when he reached home he gave uncle jacob an account of his conversation with percy the old man laughed so albert says that as i make my bed i must lie upon it he repeated yes sir but i hope you wont be troubled at that you will always be welcome here uncle jacobs eyes grew moist and he regarded bert with affection you are a good boy and a true friend bert he said and i shall not forget it i dont know but percy was right uncle jacob it does seem extravagant paying such a price for a ride its only for once in a way bert you mustnt grudge the old man a little enjoyment in his vacation i shall be going to work next week you will where asked bert eagerly in new york an old california friend of mine who is in charge of a mine that has been put on the new york market will give me a clerkship and a small salary which will support me in comfort so you see i am all right i am very glad to hear it uncle jacob said bert joyfully i was afraid you wouldnt find anything to do and would have to spend all your money on living come bert that isnt much of a compliment to my ability if i am sixtyfive i am able to earn a living yet and though twelve dollars a week isnt much if i could earn twelve dollars a week i should feel rich uncle jacob true but you are only fifteen almost sixteen i forgot that said uncle jacob smiling well even at sixteen a boy can hardly expect to earn as much as twelve dollars a week by the way how much does albert pay you four dollars a week is that about the usual price for boys employed as you are most shoe bosses pay more the squire pays low wages all round then why dont the men go elsewhere because they live here and it is better to work cheaper here than to move some have gone away well keep up your courage bert and the time will come when you will be earning twelve dollars a week like your rich old uncle if the office were only in lakeville so that i could board with your mother i wish it was uncle jacob well mary i shant have to open a cigar store in lakeville remarked uncle jacob as his niece entered the room mrs barton looked an inquiry and bert exclaimed uncle jacob has secured a clerkship in new york at twelve dollars a week i am really glad said mrs barton with beaming face come mary did you too think like bert here that i was headed for the poorhouse i felt a little anxious for you uncle jacob i admit you see that your fears were idle will you have to work very hard asked mrs barton no my employer is an intimate friend when do you commence work next monday so that i must leave you on saturday bert and i will both miss you but as it is for your good we wont complain now uncle jacob i hope you wont take it amiss if i urge you not to be too free with your money but to try to save up some of your salary so that you can add to your little fund thank you mary i suppose you are afraid i will be driving fast horses in central park eh i am more afraid you will be too generous with your money and give away more than you can afford well thought of mary so far from that i am going to turn miser and hoard up every cent i can i dont think there is much danger of that oh you have no idea how mean i can be if i try however as i shall be acting according to your advice you cant find fault with me i see you dont mean to follow my advice uncle jacob still i am glad you gave it it shows that you feel a real interest in your shabby old uncle some time i cant promise how soon i shall invite you and bert to come and spend the day in new york i will get a day off from the office and well have a nice excursion somewhere on friday uncle jacob called on squire marlowe not at the house however but at the factory ive come to bid you goodby albert he said are you going back to california asked the squire no i am going to new york it is expensive living in new york i have obtained a situation there ah indeed that is different what sort of a position i shall be a clerk in a mining office what pay will you get twelve dollars a week very fair i congratulate you you ought to live on that and save money besides thats what mary barton says then she gives you very sensible advice it will be a great deal better than opening a cigar store in lakeville i wouldnt do that after what you said on the subject returned uncle jacob in a deferential tone though there was a twinkle in his eye i am glad you recognize the fact that i counseled you for your good said the squire pompously as an experienced business man my judgment is worth something i apprehend quite so albert quite so is your wife feeling better uncle jacob had seen mrs marlowe riding out the day before apparently in full health she is somewhat improved but still delicate said squire marlowe guardedly i am sorry i cannot invite you to dine with us again before you go to the city i should hardly be able to do so as i go away tomorrow just so i will say goodby for you and that will do just as well thats a load off my mind soliloquized the squire after uncle jacob had left him i was afraid the old man would squander all his money and then come upon me for that old loan i hope hell keep away from lakeville in the future the next day uncle jacob left town as he quitted the house he put a sealed envelope into mary bartons hand if you are ever in trouble and cannot communicate with me he said open this envelope take good care of it i will uncle jacob i will put it away in my trunk well goodby mary and god bless you a minute later and uncle jacob was gone mrs barton went back to covering balls and bert to his place in the shoe shop their united earnings enabled them to live comfortably and they were content though they had nothing to spare but trouble was close at hand though they did not suspect it what that trouble was will be disclosed in the next chapter chapter viii discharged three days later while on his way to the factory bert overtook luke crandall who was employed like himself in pegging shoes have you heard the news bert asked his friend no what is it all the peggers are to be discharged you and i and the two other boys is that true asked bert stopping short and surveying his friend with a look of dismay yes i wish it wasnt what is the reason the squire has bought a pegging machine and he has hired a man from out of town to run it so he will have no need of us how soon is he going to put it in asked bert with a sinking heart next monday at the end of this week we shall be discharged what are you going to do bert inquired after a pause i shall be all right i have an uncle who keeps a store in bradford and i am going there to tend in the store and shall board in the family what shall you do i dont know answered bert soberly this has come on me so suddenly that i havent had time to think theres precious little chance for a boy in lakeville unless he goes to work on a farm i dont even know if there is a chance to do that all the farmers are supplied with help besides they generally pay a boy in his board and clothes and i need money to help support my mother isnt old marlowe your uncle no but he is my mothers cousin then he ought to do something for you out of relationship i dont expect it answered bert he appears to feel very little interest in us they had reached the factory and entering were soon at work before noon the bad news was confirmed and the boys were informed that their services would not be required after saturday night at dinner bert informed his mother and she too was dismayed it was a calamity she had never dreamed of she supposed bert was sure of continued employment in pegging till he was old enough to be employed in some other part of the business i dont see what we shall do bert she said there is no other shop in lakeville if there were you might get a chance there there is no business of any kind here outside of marlowes shop true what are the other boys going to do luke crandall is going into his uncles shop at bradford and the other two boys talk of leaving town i do think albert marlowe might find some place for you we are near relations and he knows how i depend on your earnings he isnt a man to consider that mother mrs barton was silent but she determined to make an application to her cousin in berts behalf accordingly in the evening she said to him bert i am going out to make a call i would like to have you look after the house while i am gone yes mother mrs barton did not venture to let bert know of her intention for he would have done his best to prevent her applying to the squire for a special favor perhaps he was too proud but it was an honorable pride besides he knew very well that the appeal was likely to prove ineffectual with a faltering step mrs barton advanced and rang the bell of her cousins handsome house it was a call from which she shrank but she was spurred by necessity is mr marlowe in she inquired i will see maam squire marlowe was at home and she was ushered into his presence albert marlowe was not on the whole surprised to see his cousin he guessed the errand that brought her and he frowned slightly as she entered the room good evening he said in a distant tone i hope you are well well in health but anxious in mind albert she said bert tells me that he has been discharged from the shop yes but he is not the only one there are three other boys it has come upon us like a thunderbolt i had no idea that he was in any danger of losing his place i have nothing against your son mrs barton it is a business necessity that compels me to dispense with his services why a business necessity you may have heard that i intend to introduce a pegging machine it will do the work cheaper and more effectually than under the present system oh why couldnt you have let matters remain as they were you may gain something but you are depriving the boys of their livelihood you dont regard the matter in a business light mrs barton i must keep up with the times other manufacturers are making the change and i should stand in my own light if i adhered to the oldfashioned system i dont pretend to know about business albert but i do know that in dismissing bert you deprive us of more than half our income and heaven knows we need it all your son can find something else to do what is there for him to do in lakeville i shall be grateful if you will suggest anything no doubt he can get a chance to work on a farm i know of no farmer who needs his services and even if there were one he would not get money for his services and that is what we want of course farming isnt the only thing said the squire vaguely if he looks round sharp he will come across something mrs barton shook her head you know how little business there is in lakeville she answered isnt there some other department in the factory in which you can employ him squire marlowe shook his head he is too young for any other work he said then what are we to do oh youll think of something said the squire indefinitely he is to be in the shop the rest of the week and that will give you time to think the matter over then you cant hold out any hope said mrs barton mournfully no but you mustnt be despondent something will turn up mrs barton was silent and her sad face made the squire vaguely uncomfortable he wished she would go mrs marlowe is not feeling well this evening he said awkwardly or i would invite you to meet her some other evening i am not in the mood to meet any one tonight albert she said i will be going and she rose from her chair and moved toward the door goodevening then i am glad to have seen you mrs barton did not reply to the compliment her heart was too full of sorrow to respond to what she knew to be insincere and unmeaning she understood very well that albert marlowe was glad to be rid of her how unreasonable women are muttered squire marlowe impatiently as he closed the door upon his unwelcome guest mary barton would have had me postpone all improvements in my shop for the sake of keeping that boy of hers in his place business considerations are as nothing to women they are so unpractical mrs barton walked homeward slowly musing bitterly on her cousins want of feeling how coldhearted he is she murmured he evidently cares nothing for our needs or the prospect of our hardships he lives in a fine house and rears his family in luxury while bert and i are likely to want even the necessaries of life perhaps mrs barton was a little too despondent perhaps she ought to have had more trust in providence but there had been sorrows in her life which had robbed her of her natural hopefulness and she was no longer as courageous in the face of threatening misfortune as she had once been she had nearly reached home when from out of the darkness a mans figure advanced from the roadside and laid his hand upon her arm who are you she asked faintly suppressing a scream dont be frightened mary was the reply i am your husband simeon barton chapter ix mrs bartons secret mrs barton staggered and would have fallen had not the other held her up you here she exclaimed in amazement after being absent so many years yes it has been a cruel exile we have been very unfortunate where have you been these last ten years simeon for the last eight years in canada and you did not write me no i feared it would set officers on my track i have heard from you now and then indirectly have you suffered much it has been a weary time it would have been easier to bear if i had heard from you a letter from canada would have been sure to attract attention and invite comment besides i had no money to send you misfortune has pursued me and i have only been able to support myself when i think of the probable author of my misfortunes i own it has made me feel revengeful to whom do you refer simeon to albert marlowe what do you mean how is he responsible for your misfortune i will tell you i believe that it was he who stole the bonds the loss of which was imputed to me is it possible that you have any proof of this asked mary barton eagerly the bond that was found in your possession was placed in my overcoat pocket for the express purpose of throwing suspicion upon me you remember that it was a bond for five hundred dollars while the amount stolen was six thousand yes albert and i were both at work in the same establishment we were on a level so far as means are concerned yes now he is a rich man added simeon barton significantly yes he is considered worth thirty thousand dollars it was the stolen money that gave him his start i verily believe he did not start in business for himself for more than a year after the trouble no for he thought it would invite suspicion i have reason to think that he disposed of the bonds in canada and with the proceeds started in as a manufacturer how otherwise could he have done so he was only earning two dollars a day when we were working together and it cost him all of that to support his family i have often wondered where he obtained money to go into business i dont think there is any mystery about it and you have been compelled to bear the consequences of his wrongdoing while he has been living in luxury said mary barton bitterly yes but mine is not a solitary case wickedness often flourishes in this world we must look to the future for compensation do you think you will ever be able to prove your innocence simeon it is all that i live for if i can do that we can live together again but tell me before i go any further how are you and the boy getting along we are comfortable answered mary barton briefly she did not care to add to her husbands anxieties by speaking of berts discharge i wish i had some money to give you but i only had enough to bring me here and return you had an object in coming yes there was a man who was employed by weeks brothers at the time of the loss of the bonds i learned some months since it is not necessary to explain how that he could throw light on the long unsolved mystery that he knew the real thief i am in search of him some time i hope to find him and make clear my innocence by the aid of his testimony oh simeon if you only could exclaimed mrs barton clasping her hands i shall try at all events i wonder if it would not be well to consult uncle jacob uncle jacob repeated simeon barton in surprise yes i have not told you he has returned from california and is now in new york have you seen him yes he spent a week at our house mrs barton went on to give the particulars of uncle jacobs visit he is a poor man she concluded as i understand he brought home but five hundred dollars but he is lucky enough to be employed in an office in new york at a salary of twelve dollars a week if i were earning that and could hold up my head an honest man without a stain an undeserved stain upon my name i should be happy can you tell me uncle jacobs address he asked after a pause i dont think i shall venture to call upon him for i am subject to arrest on the old charge as you know and the new york detectives are sharp but i might write to him and ask his advice but stay he thinks me dead does he not yes and bert is that what you still call him he still thinks that he has no father living you wished it so simeon yes but the time may come when the secret can be revealed to him i may disclose myself to uncle jacob i dont remember him very well but he is the best and kindest of men i wish he could have found employment here did he visit albert yes he remained at his house one night was he well received at first for coming from california albert supposed him rich when he found he had but five hundred dollars he lost no time in turning him out of the house poor uncle jacob it must have hurt the old mans feelings i feared it would but he only seemed amused not at all offended he has seen so much of the world that he probably expected it the old man seemed in good spirits then yes he declared that he was well able to earn his own living still though he is sixtyfive and was as gay and cheerful as a young man he insisted on paying his board while he was with us there is nothing mean about uncle jacob no and it is a mystery to me why such men as he who would make so good use of riches should almost always be poor and men like albert marlowe are rich yes there are a good many things that are difficult to make out where are you going to stay tonight simeon she asked after a pause i dont know i wish i could invite you to the house where you have the best right to be i wish so too bert doesnt know that you are alive perhaps i might introduce you as an old friend of his father if you think it would do he would not speak of your having a visitor not if i told him not to do so you have tempted me strongly mary i should like to see our boy to see with my own eyes how he is looking at fifteen and it would be a comfort to rest once more beneath the same roof as the wife from whom i have been so long separated i think we can risk it simeon i must introduce you under another name call me robinson that is the name i have borne for some years past mother was heard from a little distance bert has come out in search of me being alarmed by my long absence now be on your guard is that you mother where have you been so long i got quite anxious about you i met an old friend of your father bert and in talking with him i forgot how time was passing mr robinson this is my son herbert bert greeted the stranger politely as his hand rested for a moment in the hand of mr robinson he felt the latter tremble do you remember your father herbert asked the supposed stranger not very well he died when i was quite a young boy true it was indeed a long time since murmured robinson with a sigh bert i have invited mr robinson to stay with us tonight it is long since i have seen him and we may not meet again for some time he will share your room certainly mother they went together to the cottage mrs barton prepared some tea and they sat down to a slight meal oh if it could only continue thus thought simeon barton as he looked wistfully at the wife and son from whom he had been so long separated it is like a sight of the promised land do you know my mothers cousin albert marlowe asked bert during the evening i used to know him some years ago shall you call upon him he is a rich man now i think not i never liked him much bert laughed ditto for me he said he is a cold selfish man he is not popular with his workmen by the way bert said his mother you need not mention mr robinsons visit his business requires secrecy all right mother ill bear it in mind chapter x stolen money saturday afternoon arrived and with it came berts discharge from the shoe shop he put the four dollars in his pocket and with a sober face went home there are my weeks wages mother he said i dont know when i shall have any more money to hand you we wont borrow trouble tonight bert responded mrs barton concealing her solicitude under a cheerful exterior tomorrow is sunday and we will defer all worldly anxieties till it is over you are right mother said bert readily chiming in with her cheerful humor i am young and strong and there is plenty of work to be done in the world keep up your courage bert and you will be more likely to win success when sunday was over however bert felt that he must begin to look about him but the more he looked the more downhearted he became he went to the village store having heard that the boy employed there was about to leave after buying a pound of sugar for his mother he ventured to say mr jones dont you want to hire a boy why should i want to hire a boy asked the storekeeper in a tone of surprise i thought that herman was going to leave you so he was but he has changed his mind oh ejaculated bert disappointed are you asking for yourself inquired the merchant yes sir i thought you were at work in the shoe shop so i was but i have lost my place ha exclaimed the storekeeper suspiciously if squire marlowe has discharged you i dont want to hire you you are mistaken mr jones about the cause of my discharge he had no fault to find with me so you say returned jones in evident skepticism boys dont get discharged for nothing bert felt inclined to be angry but he controlled his temper i am a pegger and the squire has introduced a pegging machine so he has discharged all the peggers oh thats different well im sorry for you but i have no vacancy if herman should change his mind again will you think of me yes i will i think you are a good boy and you look strong for your size bert felt a little encouraged by this promise though it was very doubtful if it would ever amount to anything day after day passed and no employment offered but one morning a bright idea came to bert blueberries were just coming into the market and he knew of a large pasture a little over a mile away mother he said if youll give me a large tin pail ill go after some berries i may be able to sell them at the hotel if you cant we can use them ourselves rejoined mrs barton it will be better to sell them for i hear they are bringing fifteen cents a quart they wont stay long at that figure so we will put off having them ourselves till they are cheaper it was with a light heart that bert set out for the berry pasture he had become tired of having nothing to do any sort of employment seemed desirable besides they were very much in want of money and here seemed a chance of earning some bert spent five hours in the pasture berries were high because they were scarce and it took fully twice as long to gather a quart as it would two weeks later but he kept steadily at his task and at length the pail which held four quarts was full he was tired enough and his back ached but still he felt happy as he left the field and trudged toward the lake house which was the name of the village hotel there were a few summer boarders there from new york and philadelphia who were glad to exchange the brick walls and crowded city streets for the verdure and pure breezes of the country fortunately bert found the landlord on the piazza and to him he preferred his request would you like to buy some blueberries go round to the side door bert said mr holbrook the goodnatured landlord i leave all such matters to mrs holbrook blueberries exclaimed the landlady why its just what i wanted mrs casewell from philadelphia has been teasing me for some blueberry pudding what do you ask fifteen cents a quart answered bert you know they have just come into the market thats true well i will pay you your price said mrs holbrook who received a good income from her boarders and was willing to be liberal to others how many have you got i think there are four quarts but you can measure them there proved to be four quarts and bert was made happy by receiving sixty cents in silver it is almost as much as i made in the shop he reflected complacently and perhaps i can sell some more tomorrow bert continued to pick berries but the price fell rapidly until it touched six cents and it was not so easy to sell the berries at all for many others engaged in picking them and the market was overstocked bert occasionally fell in with percy marlowe but the manufacturers son usually took very little notice of him this did not trouble bert however who felt independent and cared little for the opinion or notice of his wealthy cousin in one respect however percy resembled bert he was always short of money his father allowed him two dollars a week for spending money more than any other boy in lakeville received but percy felt that it was too little he had formed an intimacy with reginald ward a young man from new york who was boarding at the hotel and with him he used to play pool which he found rather an expensive game and still worse he played poker with him in his own room locking the door carefully as this game was not looked upon with favor in lakeville the young man from the city was much sharper than the country boy and steadily won his money till percy found himself in debt to him in the sum of ten dollars for this percy gave his note but no one knew better than reginald ward that it was not valid in law and he resolved to secure the money if possible percy you owe me ten dollars he said one afternoon i know it admitted percy rather ruefully when are you going to pay me i dont know answered percy but that wont do dont you know returned reginald frowning i may go away next week and i want my money i would pay it to you if i had it said percy but you know i have only my allowance of two dollars a week stuff and nonsense do you think you are going to put me off that way demanded reginald angrily i must have my money then i dont see how youre going to get it said percy doggedly i cant pay what i havent got go to your father and ask for it as if he would give it to me you dont know him doesnt he ever leave money lying round asked reginald significantly what do you mean asked percy reddening i see you understand i was only suggesting a way to get the money i am not a thief who said you were i see i shall have to take the matter into my own hands how what do you mean asked percy nervously i will go to your father show him this i o u of yours and ask him for the money you wouldnt do that reginald he would be awful mad with me and you wouldnt get your money either i must do something i cant afford to lose the money just wait a day or two ill see what i can do mind you do something then percy regretted that he had ever made the acquaintance of reginald ward or consented to play poker with him but the regret came too late the mischief was done and he saw from wards determined look that he must do something he was just in that frame of mind when temptations have the most power in the evening he went to the village store to purchase a fishingline for he had made an arrangement to go out fishing with reginald ward the next day he made the purchase and was about to go when his eye caught sight of a twentydollar bill lying on the desk mr jones had gone to the other end of the store and no one was looking on the impulse of the moment he seized the bill and with his heart beating quickly he left the store as he passed through the door bert barton entered with a kerosene can in his hand and walked up to the counter taking his stand near the desk chapter xi the twentydollar bill in order to understand what followed it is necessary to explain that the evening previous bert and his mother found themselves out of money about a dollar was due the latter for covering balls but it would not be paid for three days and meanwhile they were in an embarrassing condition what shall we do asked mrs barton with a troubled look if uncle jacob were only here i would ask his advice he left a note to be opened if we got into trouble said bert brightening up so he did do you think the time has come bert i have no doubt of it where is it mother i put it in a bureau drawer in my room shall i go up and get it no i will do so as i know exactly where it is she went upstairs and returned almost immediately with the letter in her hand bert produced his knife and cut open the envelope at one end then drawing out the contents he found them to be a half sheet of note paper and a bank bill its a twentydollar bill mother he exclaimed joyfully shall i read the note yes read it bert bert read as follows my dear niece as i know your income is small and you are liable in case of sickness or loss of employment to need help i put a twentydollar bill into this envelope which i wish you to use freely do not fear that it will inconvenience me to give it my health is good and i hope to earn my living for years to come your affectionate uncle jacob marlowe dear uncle jacob said the widow gratefully how good and kind he is with his small savings i dont feel that he can afford to be so generous i will pay him back some time mother you think then that we are justified in using it bert uncle jacob meant us to do so before it is gone i shall probably find something to do and then i may gradually be able to pay back the money in that case bert i am afraid we must break into it tomorrow probably mr jones can change it for us so it happened the next evening that bert with the kerosene can in his hand went to the store entering as already described just as percy left it with the bill which he had purloined on the impulse of the moment i would like two quarts of kerosene mr jones said bert handing over the can the proprietor went to one corner of the store to fill the can and brought it back please take your pay out of this said bert handing him the twentydollar bill mr jones started in surprise and his face darkened ominously he scanned the desk on which he remembered placing his own twentydollar bill and it was nowhere to be seen why you audacious young thief he exclaimed in a fury what do you mean demanded bert angrily what do i mean gasped jones you know what i mean well enough i never knew such audacity please explain yourself mr jones said bert with spirit i didnt come here to be insulted you are a hardened young reprobate do you mean to say you didnt steal this twentydollar bill from my desk where i laid it five minutes since i dont know anything about any twentydollar bill of yours mr jones this money is mine or rather my mothers and i brought it with me from home do you expect me to believe this bold falsehood bert barton the storekeeper exploded wrathfully i dont expect you to believe any falsehood at all mr jones will you either change that bill or give it back to me i will do neither then sir it is you who are the thief you impudent young rascal now i wont have any mercy on you for your mothers sake i might have done so but as you persist in brazening out your guilt i will see that you have a chance to repent here is the constable come in just at the right moment mr drake please come here a tall pleasantlooking officer who had just entered the store approached the desk what can i do for you mr jones he asked arrest this boy said jones pointing with flushed face at his young customer arrest bert barton exclaimed constable drake in amazement what on earth has he done stolen a twentydollar bill from my desk and then presented it to me in payment for some kerosene the charge is false said bert his eyes glowing with indignation hear him deny it said jones looking at the circle that had gathered around them i find it hard to credit your charge mr jones replied the constable we all know bert barton and i dont believe he would be guilty of theft i require you to arrest the boy persisted the storekeeper stamping his foot in excitement wait a moment did you see him take the bill no answered jones reluctantly then why do you accuse him please state the circumstances a few minutes since i was paid twenty dollars by mr holbrook of the hotel in settlement of his weekly bill for groceries and being somewhat hurried i laid it down on the desk while i was filling an order go on five minutes since bert barton came in and took up his position where he is now standing he asked me for two quarts of kerosene i filled his can for him and he gave me a twentydollar bill from which to take payment i was naturally surprised and looked for the bill i had left on the desk it was gone mr jones gazed about the circle triumphantly what do you say to that he asked sympathetic eyes were turned upon bert things certainly looked black for him i dont think i need say any more added the storekeeper i want you to arrest that boy bert looked at the faces that encircled him he saw that they believed him guilty and a feeling of hot indignation possessed him bert my boy said officer drake what have you to say to this that the twentydollar bill i handed to mr jones belongs to my mother i know nothing of the bill he says he laid on his desk thats a likely story put in mr jones in a tone of sarcasm how many more twentydollar bills have you got at your house i wasnt aware that your mother was so wealthy again opinion was unfavorable to poor bert his mothers straitened circumstances were well known and it certainly did seem improbable upon the face of it that she should have a twentydollar bill in her possession this was the only twentydollar bill that my mother had replied bert oh indeed i thought as much said mr jones significantly mr drake do you intend to arrest that boy he added angrily i have no warrant returned the officer if you will swear that you saw him take the bill i will assume the responsibility i didnt see him take it the storekeeper again admitted reluctantly but it stands to reason that it is mine here a young man in the outer circle stepped forward he was a summer boarder at the hotel and bert knew him slightly i am a lawyer he said and if bert will place his interests in my hands i will see what i can do to throw light upon this mystery i shall be very glad to do so mr conway answered bert no lawyer is needed sputtered jones the case is as plain as can be i have no more doubt that the boy took my bill than if i had seen him do it that isnt legal proof it is only an assumption said the young lawyer squire marlowe is i believe your magistrate here and i agree in behalf of my client to have the matter brought before him tomorrow morning meanwhile mr jones will you hand the twentydollar bill in dispute to officer drake why should i the bill is mine said the merchant sullenly that remains to be proved do i understand that you refuse to give up the bill i do answered jones doggedly then i will apply at once for a warrant for your arrest for holding property belonging to my young client said mr conway chapter xii mr jones is excited the astonishment and wrath of mr jones were almost ludicrous as he stared at the lawyer who cool and composed reiterated his threat i never heard of such a thing he gasped you take my own money from me it remains to be proved whether it is your own money the boy says it is his the boy lies really mr jones i cannot allow you to make such charges against my client unless you are ready to substantiate them by proof it stands to reason began mr jones but the young lawyer interrupted him nothing stands to reason that you cant prove he said we will give you an opportunity to prove your ownership of the bill tomorrow in court now hand the bill to officer drake very much against his will mr jones felt compelled to do this isnt the boy going to be arrested he demanded with an ugly look at bert it is unnecessary you can bring a formal charge against him before squire marlowe tomorrow the boy may escape during the night i wont trust him there was a murmur of disapproval among those present all liked bert and mr jones from his quick temper and ugly disposition was by no means a favorite the storekeeper saw that it would not be good policy to insist upon berts arrest and he said sullenly i will hold you responsible for his presence at the trial mr conway smiled if he is not present i will myself see that you do not suffer in consequence besides flight would be tantamount to confession and the case would go against him by default and should i in that case get the twentydollar bill i will take it upon me to offer no opposition said the lawyer now can i go asked bert yes i will accompany you home for consultation bert took the can of kerosene and was about to leave the store when the storekeeper said harshly put down that kerosene you havent paid for it bert flushed and looked embarrassed it was true that he had not paid for it nor did he have the money to pay outside of the twentydollar bill which had been taken from him i have no money he said i will leave it till tomorrow how much is it mr jones asked conway twentyfive cents i will advance the money bert take your can you are very kind mr conway said the boy gratefully we will settle hereafter now let us be going in explanation of the price mentioned i may say that kerosene is now much cheaper than at the date of my story now bert said mr conway as your legal adviser i shall have to ask you to tell me just where you obtained the bill you offered in payment to mr jones for the kerosene i have no doubt of your innocence but we must make it plain to all who may attend the trial i should like to have you come home with me mr conway mother will confirm what i say i shall be glad to do so will your mother be alarmed yes i think she will but you can make things clear to her mrs barton was indeed startled when she learned that bert had been charged with theft but after a free talk with mr conway she felt much relieved your defence is perfect i think said the young lawyer of course mr jones or his lawyer may claim that you wrote the letter yourself will it be necessary to send to uncle jacob and get him to testify i dont think so i think your defence will be complete without it there is another point of considerable importance which i shall look up tonight if things turn out as i suspect they will we shall not need to disturb your uncle jacob at nine oclock mr conway took his leave and returned to the hotel he had a short conference with the landlord which was evidently satisfactory i think we shall prove too many for mr jones he murmured softly as he went up to bed chapter xiii percy gets rid of the bill when percy marlowe left the grocery store with the stolen bill in his hand he was tremulous with excitement and agitation he felt that he had committed a crime and he was almost tempted to go back and replace the money but it was possible that its loss had already been discovered and he might be connected with it he felt that it would be safe to get as far away as possible from the store nobody will suspect me he said to himself plucking up courage then there was the pleasant thought that he could pay up his debt to reginald ward and have ten dollars left over it would be very comfortable to have ten dollars to spend and percy whose conscience was not sensitive began to consider what would be the pleasantest way of disposing of it he soon came to a decision on this point having like most boys rather a talent for spending money ill go round by the hotel he said to himself and if i find reg there ill pay him what i owe him and get it off my mind percy walked around to the lake house and found reginald ward in the billiard room ward treated him rather coldly goodmorning percy he said goodmorning reg i hope you have come prepared to pay me what you owe me i may have to go back to new york tomorrow i wish he would thought percy then if theres any trouble about this money he will be well out of the way and nobody can find out about it i can pay you tonight said percy you can youre a trump said reginald in gratified surprise suppose we go up to your room went on percy nervously and dont talk about it here i dont want anybody to know that i am owing you any money i understand the governor wouldnt like it hey no hed be awful mad follow me then percy and ward led the way up to his room lock the door said percy seems to me we are mighty mysterious commented ward laughing oh well anything to accommodate now where are the spondulicks can you change a twentydollar bill asked percy whew you are wealthy said ward in surprise let me see and he opened his pocket book much as ever he replied after investigating the contents here is a five a two a silver dollar and i think i can make up two dollars in small change itll take up about all ive got then perhaps youd rather wait till i have a chance to get the bill changed suggested percy not much returned reginald with a crafty smile a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush as somebody says i am willing to be inconvenienced for the sake of getting the debt paid oh well just as you say rejoined percy secretly glad to get the telltale bill out of his possession and to replace it in his pocket with the smaller bills and silver which ward proposed to give him when the transfer was made ward asked where did you raise the twenty percy now it was that percy looked embarrassed it is some money i had given to me a long while ago he answered with hesitation oh exclaimed ward evidently incredulous i promised not to use it but to keep it saved up continued percy and i meant to but you wanted me to pay what i owed you and so you acted like an honest young man said ward finishing his sentence for him yes there was a peculiar smile on reginald wards face but he did not think it best to question percys statement his money had been paid him and that was all he cared for percys found it in his fathers desk i reckon he said to himself but that doesnt concern me ive got my money and thats more than i expected by the way reg said percy hurriedly dont mention to any one my paying you this money why not it would be found out that i had been playing cards for money and thered be no end of a row besides then it would come out that i had parted with this bill all right percy ill keep mum wont you go down and have a game of billiards not tonight im rather tired that boys got something on his mind thought reginald ward chapter xiv bert stands trial percy went to bed early and heard nothing of berts arrest for the theft which he had himself committed till at the breakfast table the next morning his father said well young barton has got into a bad scrape what is it father asked percy pricking up his ears he is charged with stealing a twentydollar bill from mr jones the storekeeper this was certainly amazing and percy in his agitation nearly choked with some coffee that went the wrong way be more careful percy said his mother sharply i was so surprised mother at what father told me apologized percy i dont know why you need be surprised said mrs marlowe i never had a very good opinion of the boy how did it happen asked percy curious to know how suspicion could have fallen upon bert it appears that mr jones laid a twentydollar bill on his desk a very careless proceeding by the way while he was waiting upon a customer in another part of the store about five minutes afterward the barton boy called upon him to fill a small can with kerosene and actually had the hardihood to offer his own twentydollar bill in payment bert barton offered mr jones a twentydollar bill asked percy in great surprise yes no wonder you are surprised at his boldness perhaps it wasnt the same bill percy was constrained to suggest you must be a fool percy where else could he have got so large a bill as that we all know how poor the bartons are besides the bill on the desk had disappeared percy was silent for a moment he felt bewildered and could not understand it at all he knew very well that it was not the same bill but where did the other bill come from how happened a poor boy like bert barton to have such a large bill in his possession that was certainly mysterious was was bert arrested he asked in a hesitating tone he would have been but for the interference of a meddlesome young lawyer who it appears is staying at the hotel mr conway i believe that is his name he offered to defend the barton boy and would not permit him to be arrested percy was glad to hear this he was mean and selfish but he was not mean enough to wish bert to suffer for a crime of which he knew him to be innocent what was done then he asked after a pause the boy was allowed to go home but his trial is to take place before me this morning at ten oclock you can be present if you desire i dont know as i do said percy his father looked surprised i thought you would be eager to be there he said i may come in said percy but i am sorry for bert and i should not like to see him under arrest you are too goodhearted percy said his mother i am sure i hope the boy did not do what is charged though i dont think there is the slightest doubt of it but if he is guilty i want him punished that is the only way to protect the community from further thefts what would mother say if she knew i did it thought percy shivering i wish i hadnt done it but it was too late to wish that he had appropriated the money and it had been paid away suppose reginald ward should betray him percy earnestly hoped that he would leave town before he had a chance to hear of the stolen money for he felt certain that sharp young man would suspect him of having had something to do with it as the time drew near percy decided that he had better not attend the trial he was afraid that some one would call to mind that he too had been standing near the desk just before the bill disappeared he felt nervous and excited he wished it was all over and bert was acquitted suppose he were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment it would be terrible percy admitted to himself but what could he do he couldnt confess and incur the same punishment himself the very thought made him shudder he walked about the streets in a very uncomfortable frame of mind till about a quarter of ten then he suddenly encountered bert who in company with his lawyer was on his way to a room in the town hall where the trial was to take place bert held his head erect but his face was flushed with shame at the unpleasant predicament in which he found himself when he saw percy approaching he said to himself bitterly there is one who will rejoice at my misfortune what was his surprise then when percy came up with a pleasant smile and said goodmorning bert bert looked at him sharply to see if there was anything triumphant in his smile but percys manner was cordial and friendly have you heard of my trouble percy asked bert abruptly yes bert and i am very sorry for it do you believe me guilty no i dont returned percy and he offered his hand thank you percy said bert moved in spite of himself i misjudged you if you dont believe me guilty i hope others wont are you going to the trial i wasnt thinking of doing so but i will walk with you as far as the town hall there was quite a crowd gathered near the entrance to the building for it was generally known that bert was to be tried for the theft that morning some of those composing it in fact most were berts friends but there were a few who delighted in scandal and looked forward with eagerness to hearing the details and did not care much how bert might be affected by it the surprise was general when bert approached apparently in friendly converse with percy marlowe a boy whose want of cordial feeling toward him was generally known the occasion was a trial for bert but percys unexpected friendliness sustained him though he had not got over his surprise at it all parties entered the courtroom and presently squire marlowe himself appeared he walked with dignity to the platform and took his seat behind the desk over which justice was dispensed who is the complainant in this case he asked i am squire said mr jones advancing eagerly state your case i charge this boy bert barton with stealing a twentydollar bill from my desk last evening have you counsel no squire the case is plain and i can manage it myself i represent the defendant said the young lawyer conway you are a lawyer are you asked squire marlowe frowning yes sir have you any evidence or certificate to show this i can prove it if necessary but i will venture to suggest that your doubts on the subject are very singular and that lawyer or no lawyer i am at liberty to appear for the defendant if he desires it squire marlowe coughed and looked displeased at this remark state your case mr jones he said after the latter had been sworn the grocer told the story as it happened making it bear as heavily against bert as possible do you wish to ask the witness any questions mr conway inquired the judge yes sir mr jones what makes you think my client took your twentydollar bill it stands to reason commenced the grocer never mind about that please stick to facts well the bill disappeared admitted go on the barton boy was standing near the desk did you see him take it no how could i my back was turned this is important then so far as your knowledge goes any other person may have taken the bill didnt i tell you that the boy was brazen enough to offer me the same bill in payment for some kerosene which i got for him you are very sure it was the same bill are you mr jones asked conway carelessly why of course it was that wont do how can you prove it was because said the grocer triumphantly the bill i lost was a twentydollar bill and the bill the boy offered me was a twentydollar bill and mr jones looked around the courtroom with a complacent and triumphant smile squire marlowe judge though he was gave a little nod as if to show that he too thought the argument was unanswerable even berts friends in the courtroom glanced at each other gravely it certainly looked bad for our hero chapter xv berts triumphant vindication you have not answered my question mr jones persisted the young lawyer i rather think i have said the grocer looking around him triumphantly but not satisfactorily i ask you again how do you know that the twentydollar bill tendered you by my client was the same bill which you left on the desk it stands to reason stop there that is no answer it seems to me youre mighty particular retorted the grocer sharply my young clients interests require it now for your answer well there wasnt any other twentydollar bill around how do you know young barton says he brought the bill from home he says so repeated mr jones with a suggestive sneer upon that point i propose to call a witness who will corroborate his statement mrs barton the widow barton came forward pale and anxious and was sworn she was regarded with sympathy by all present except the grocer and the acting judge after one or two unimportant questions mr conway asked when your son went to the grocery store did he take any money with him yes sir how much twenty dollars was it in the form of one bill or several it was a single twentydollar bill mr jones who had now taken his seat looked insultingly incredulous can i ask a question he said turning to squire marlowe you can i should like to ask mrs barton where the prisoner obtained the twentydollar bill and the grocer looked around the courtroom again triumphantly it came from my uncle jacob marlowe answered mrs barton ah thats it is mr jacob marlowe in town no sir when was he in town three or four weeks since when did he give you the money he left a sealed envelope containing it which we were not to open unless in case of need when did you first open it last evening can you produce the envelope asked jones with an ironical smile here it is the envelope was taken and examined by the grocer there is nothing to show that this could not have been prepared by the defendant without the knowledge of this convenient uncle he said there was a note accompanying it mrs barton added let me see it i will read it said mr conway taking it in his hand this note has already been quoted in chapter xi mr jones looked somewhat nonplussed i am free to confess he said after a pause that i doubt the genuineness of this note nothing could be easier than to prepare it i appeal to the court to protect the witness from insult interposed mr conway i do not consider that she has been insulted said squire marlowe coldly the credibility of testimony is always a matter to be considered mr jones eyed the young lawyer with a triumphant smile have you any further questions to put mr jones added conway no sir i am satisfied then the witness may step down i call upon mr jones to take the witness stand again i have no objection i am sure said the grocer jauntily he saw that the judge was with him and he confidently anticipated berts conviction from whom did you obtain the twentydollar bill which you charge my client with taking asked mr conway from mr holbrook the landlord of the hotel you are sure of this demanded conway sternly of course i am and you will swear that this is the case certainly answered mr jones aggressively thinking it very important that he should substantiate this fact that will do mr jones the grocer took his seat feeling that he had scored a victory and foiled the lawyer it was not long before he had occasion to change his opinion mr holbrook called conway the landlord of the lakeville hotel took the stand he was a pleasantlooking goodhearted man and he glanced sympathetically at bert and his mother mr holbrook said conway do you remember paying mr jones the complainant a twentydollar bill yes sir the grocer smiled again everything seemed to favor his side of the case for what was the payment made for groceries furnished by mr jones would you recognize the bill you paid if you should see it again yes sir is this the bill asked the lawyer exhibiting the note taken from the grocer and now in the custody of the court mr holbrook took the bill in his hand and turning it over looked at the reverse side all eyes were upon him and there was a hush of expectation for it was felt that the whole case hinged upon the answer to this question this is not the same bill answered the landlord composedly berts friends looked joyful and mr jones looked dismayed he is mistaken ejaculated the grocer much perturbed of course continued the young lawyer you have some means of identification please state to the court how you know that this is not the same bill the bill which i paid to mr jones answered the landlord had the letters i w written in red ink on the back this note has no such mark conway looked triumphant it was his turn now he took the banknote and holding it up in sight of all called the attention of the court and those present to the fact attested by the witness it is clear he said that nothing was ever written on the back of this note in red ink it might have been effaced suggested the grocer querulously the bill since it was taken from the complainant has been in charge of the court said conway i hardly think the complainant will dare to assert that it has been tampered with and now your honor turning to the presiding judge i submit that the charge has been completely answered we have shown that the bill tendered by my client was not the bill lost by mr jones i claim his discharge squire marlowe hesitated but he could think of no pretext for holding bert since the case against him had so signally failed the prisoner is discharged he said briefly and rose from his seat berts friends surrounded him and he began to fear that in their enthusiasm they would shake his hand off it was almost as serious as being a presidential candidate it is needless to say however that mr jones was not one of the friends who congratulated him he on the other hand looked decidedly grumpy and as if he had lost his best friend he pushed his way through the crowd up to the young lawyer this is all very fine mr lawyer he said but will you tell me how i am to get my money back what money mr jones the twentydollar bill taken from my desk of course i wish i could mr jones but i know no more than the man in the moon is that all the satisfaction i am going to get demanded jones angrily from me yes you will have to find the person who actually took the money i dont see how i am to do it i would have sworn that it was bert barton and i am not sure now stop there mr jones if after my clients full vindication you insinuate any charge of dishonesty i shall advise him to sue you for defamation of character the grocer looked startled and conway continued but i will volunteer the suggestion that as you can now identify the bill you can advertise that a note so marked has been stolen from you and call upon any one into whose hands it may come to help you trace it back to the thief there is a chance that you may recover it chapter xvi what became of the stolen note among the attentive listeners at berts trial was a tall young man with light hair and pallid complexion upon whose thin face there played a shrewd smile he seemed unusually interested as was indeed the case for he strongly suspected that he knew who was the actual purloiner of the stolen twentydollar bill it is hardly necessary to say that the young man was percys friend reginald ward when the landlord gave his testimony he was no longer in doubt for he had himself noticed the letters i w on the back of the bankbill as he left the courtroom he saw percy lingering near the door come with me percy he said linking his arm with that of the boy i have something to say to you i have an engagement pleaded percy trying to release himself i will call round this afternoon i cant wait till afternoon said reginald decidedly i must speak to you now on a matter of importance how did the trial come out the boy was acquitted i thought he would be why asked reginald ward eyeing percy curiously because i dont think he would steal is he a friend of yours no he is only a working boy still you think he is honest oh yes how then do you account for the bills being stolen percy shrugged his shoulders i dont feel sure that any bill was stolen he said i dont think much of old jones i dare say he made up the story that is hardly likely what object could he have he wanted to get hold of bert bartons bill where did bert get it from did he say he said it was left in an envelope by some old uncle of his uncle jacob yes i think that was the name i didnt think the old man had so much money to spare you seem to know him then i have heard of him by this time they had reached the hotel and reginald asked percy to come up to his room what was it you wanted to speak to me about asked percy as he took a seat at the window i wanted to tell you that the stolen bill came from mr holbrook mr jones testified to this effect and mr holbrook also well what of that mr holbrook described the bill and stated that the letters i w were written in red ink on the reverse side percy began to see the point and waited anxiously for reginald to continue ward drew from his pocket the twentydollar bill and held it up to open view this is the bill you paid me last evening he said you will observe the letters i w as described by the landlord now where did you get this bill he asked searchingly drops of perspiration stood on percys forehead and he hesitated to reply finally an inspiration came to him and he said i picked it up in the street near the grocery store the thief must have dropped it you didnt tell me that when you paid it to me no i didnt think it necessary i was anxious to get out of debt to you percy marlowe that statement of yours wont pass muster werent you in the grocery store last evening no yes stammered percy and you saw this bill on mr joness desk yes or no i dont see what right you have to question me said percy sullenly because you have paid me stolen money and if i keep it i am likely to get into trouble indeed i came very near it this morning i was on the point of paying it to mr holbrook for my board you can imagine that he would have recognized it at once i dont see as you are to blame no i am not but if the bill were known to be in my possession the only thing i could do would be to state from whom i received it you wouldnt do that said percy in alarm i should have to but i dont mean to run the risk i will give you back the bill and you must return me the ten dollars i gave you in change but what can i do with the bill that is your lookout of course you will still owe me ten dollars reluctantly percy drew out the ten dollars he had received in change not having yet spent any of it and reginald ward gave him back the unlucky bill percy thrust it quickly into his vest pocket now percy said reginald let me advise you as a friend to get that bill out of your possession as soon as possible if it is traced to you you will get into hot water i cant pass it here you have no right to pass it anywhere you could pass it in new york reginald ward considered a moment but shook his head no it would be too dangerous he said it might be traced to me and it would be known that i have been in lakeville i should have to expose you to screen myself then what would you advise me to do get it back to mr jones in some way here take an envelope inclose the bill and mark the grocers name on it then drop it somewhere and the thing will be done jones will be happy and you will be safe all right percy followed reginalds advice and then put the letter in his pocket when are you going back to new york he asked tomorrow i will leave you my address and hope you will have the honesty to pay me what you owe me as soon as possible yes i will but i am afraid that wont be soon you ought to make an effort to pay me it isnt as if i really owed it to you it is money i have lost at cards if you are a boy of honor said reginald impressively you will feel that such debts ought to be paid above all others why should they asked percy and there will be many others who will be disposed to echo the question why should gambling debts take precedence of honest obligations it is not necessary to repeat reginalds explanation as it was shallow and sophistical two hours later sam doyle a young irish boy espied under a bush by the roadside what seemed to be a letter he picked it up and though his education was by no means extensive he made out the name of mr jones shure mr jones must have dropped it out of his pocket he said ill carry it to him he entered the store and attracted the attention of the grocer who was behind the counter and in a bad humor smarting still from his loss of twenty dollars clear out you sam doyle he said unless you want to buy something i dont want any boys loafing round my store is this your envelope mr jones asked sam producing the envelope give it to me mr jones read his name on the envelope in some wonder and tore it open what was his amazement and delight when he saw the lost bill where did you get this sam he asked i found it under a bush by the side of the road near the blacksmiths shop when shure it wasnt moren five minutes do you know what was in the envelope no you are sure no one gave you the letter to hand to me said the grocer with a searching glance shure i found it well im glad to get it you are a good boy to bring it to me heres ten cents sam took the money as much surprised as pleased for the grocer was considered and justly a very mean man thank you mr jones he said you are sure that bert barton didnt give you the letter yes sir i havent seen bert since mornin did you see any other boy near yes sir i saw percy marlowe did he speak to you yes sir he asked me what id got in my hand what did you say i showed him the letter did he say anything to you then he told me it was for you and he said id better take it right over to your store he gave you good advice wait a minute and ill do up a pound of sugar and send it to your mother as a present whats come to the old man thought sam shure hes gettin generous in his old age i wish i knew who took that bill thought the grocer meditatively however ive got it back and thats the main thing when percy dropped the envelope he remained near at hand and seeing sam pick it up instructed him to carry it to the grocer he then breathed a sigh of relief and felt that he was lucky to get out of a bad scrape so safely chapter xvii after the trial mr conway said bert as they walked home together from the trial i am very grateful to you for getting me out of my trouble if you will let me know your fee i will pay it my dear boy rejoined the young lawyer this is my vacation and i only took up your case to keep my hand in you are very kind and i shall always remember it lawyers are not always mercenary though they have that reputation with some i should like by the way to find out who did steal the bill so should i i have no idea for my part if you ever find out let me know i go back to new york tomorrow and am glad to leave the memory of a professional triumph behind me what is your address mr conway no nassau street room here is my card when you come to new york call and see me i shall do so though it may be some time in the future do you think i could get anything to do in new york yes but perhaps not enough to pay your expenses i find the same trouble here you have been at work in the shoe factory i believe yes but i have been discharged my place has been taken by a machine that is unfortunate is there no other opening in lakeville i have not found any yet i will keep your case in mind and if i hear of anything i will let you know when squire marlowe returned home from the trial his wife inquired with interest how did the case come out the boy was acquitted answered her husband shortly acquitted why you thought it was a close case so i did but it came out on the trial that there were two twentydollar bills and the one which the barton boy presented was left for him by uncle jacob by that old man why i thought he was poor so he is worth only five hundred dollars and he is making ducks and drakes of that as fast as he can and then he will fall back on you i suppose so then i hope you will let him go to the poor house said mrs marlowe with energy i shall i have no pity for a man who throws away his money percy came home to dinner in lively spirits he was free from anxiety and felt that he had been remarkably fortunate were you at the trial percy asked his mother no ma i thought you would be interested in seeing that boy on trial i was sorry for him and didnt want to be present sorry for him yes i felt sure he had not taken the money seems to me this is a new streak percy said the squire i thought you didnt like bert barton i am not intimate with him for he is only a working boy but all the same i dont want him convicted when he is innocent it is a mystery to me who could have taken the other twentydollar bill said the squire can you think of anybody no how should i returned percy nearly swallowing a spoonful of soup the wrong way there are so few people in the village that it must be some one we know perhaps old jones didnt lose any money after all there is no doubt on that point the stolen bill has been returned to him in an envelope by sam doyle is that so exclaimed percy counterfeiting surprise why it must be the same envelope sam showed me he showed you the envelope yes he picked it up by the roadside it was directed in pencil to mr jones so that contained the stolen bill yes then perhaps it was taken in joke a poor joke no the thief got alarmed and took that way of returning it i suggested to jones that the handwriting on the envelope might furnish a clew to the thief what did he say asked percy alarmed he said he should do nothing about it now that he had the money back i guess hes right said percy relieved in the afternoon bert met percy in the street he advanced cordially well percy i got free after all yes i am glad of it i feel grateful to you for believing in my innocence its all right said percy in a patronizing tone even if you are a working boy i was sure you wouldnt steal berts feelings cooled a little somehow percys manner kept him aloof yes i am a working boy he replied or at any rate i would like to be but i dont find it easy to get work just so if i hear of anything i will let you know goodmorning i dont know what to make of percy thought bert perplexed he was as kind as he could be this morning and now he is offish at any rate he didnt believe me guilty and i wont forget that in a hurry two more weeks passed and bert still found himself unable to find employment berries had become so plenty that he was unable to sell any and only picked some for consumption at home the sum of money which had been received from uncle jacob gradually dwindled and bert became alarmed what would they do when it was all gone he had no doubt that uncle jacob would give them further assistance if appealed to but both he and his mother felt that it would be an imposition on the old man with his limited fund of money to ask anything more of him i dont want any more of uncle jacobs money mother said bert but i should like to ask him if he could find me a place in new york i couldnt bear to have you leave me bert but i must take work wherever i can find it so bert with his mothers permission wrote to uncle jacob informing him of his discharge from the factory and his desire to obtain work elsewhere this letter reached jacob marlowe and led to his writing as follows to the squire nephew albert i hear by a letter from lakeville that you have discharged bert barton from your employment and that he cannot secure any other kind of work i am surprised that you should treat marys boy in this manner considering the relationship that exists between you i appeal to your better nature to reinstate him in his old place i can assure you that you will have no cause to regret it i have steady work here and am quite well satisfied with my position and prospects jacob marlowe the stupid old meddler ejaculated the squire throwing the letter from him in impatience i suppose the barton boy has been writing to him he evidently considers it my duty to support all my poor relations himself included i will undeceive him on that point he drew writing materials toward him and wrote as follows uncle jacob i have received your letter asking me to reinstate the barton boy in his old place this is a business matter and i dont permit any interference with my business i may add that even if he is a poor relation i do not feel called upon to support all my needy relations i am glad you have obtained a situation in which you can make an honest living i hope you will keep it and wont squander the small sum of money you have in reserve yours etc albert marlowe when uncle jacob read this letter he smiled it is what i expected he said to himself albert marlowe is thoroughly selfish and so i think are his wife and son i must find some other way of helping bert the day succeeding the receipt of uncle jacobs letter the squire met bert in the postoffice have you been writing to jacob marlowe he asked yes sir i suppose you asked him to urge me to take you back into the factory no sir at any rate he has done so but i allow no one to interfere in my business affairs you hear do you yes sir then remember it and squire marlowe turned his back rudely upon bert here is a letter for you bert said the postmaster bert opened the letter in some surprise and read it with interest and excitement chapter xviii bert obtains work to begin with the letter which bert so unexpectedly received contained a tendollar bill it must be from uncle jacob he thought he turned to the next page and looked for the signature it was as he anticipated jacob marlowe it was brief as will be seen from the copy given below my dear nephew i am sorry to hear that you have lost your place in the factory i think albert marlowe might at any rate have retained you knowing how much you and your mother needed your weekly wages i have written to him asking him to take you back into the shop but i do not suppose he will it is more to test him than anything else that i have made the request but at any rate we will give him a chance to deal considerately next week thursday if you should not have found work come up to the city and seek me at the office where i am employed no nassau street room and i may have it in my power to employ you in an important matter bring all your clothes with you but take only money enough to get to the city leaving the balance with your mother give my love to her and tell her to keep up good courage your affectionate uncle jacob marlowe i am to go to new york thought bert joyfully perhaps uncle jacob will find me a place there i shall enjoy that ever so much let me see i am to go next week thursday and it is now saturday i wish the time had come of course bert carried the letter home and showed it to his mother how kind uncle jacob is she murmured but i am afraid he is too generous he is a poor man he cannot afford to be giving us money all the time he is earning a good salary you know mother only twelve dollars a week bert but that is a good deal if i were earning twelve dollars a week i should feel rich it doesnt go very far in a large and expensive city like new york i could save half of it if i had it would you mind much mother if i should take a place in new york it would be terribly lonely for me bert sighed mrs barton but you would not oppose it not if your uncle jacob thought it best he seems to be our only friend just now yes i dont know what we should have done without him on monday morning considerably to his surprise bert received an offer of employment about a mile from his mothers cottage lived silas wilson an old farmer about sixty years of age who had the reputation of being one of the meanest men in lakeville even his horses and cows had a hungry look and it was easy to see that they were not pampered or injured by overfeeding this was the man who stopped his farm wagon in front of mrs bartons dwelling and spoke to bert who was just coming out of the front door here you bert barton goodmorning mr wilson replied bert squire marlowe tells me you are out of a job yes sir and ive been thinkin i could give you work on my farm bert was not overjoyed at this announcement but he felt that he ought to take into consideration any offer that might be made to him would you expect me to board at your house he asked sartin all my boys board with me how much wages would you be willing to pay fifty cents a week and board i calculate that would be about right fifty cents a week and board repeated bert by no means dazzled by the tempting offer yes what do you say i shouldnt be willing to work for that you wouldnt hey what did you get in the shoe shop four dollars a week boards worth that so i give you whats equal to four dollars and a half bert had heard something of the kind of board supplied by the farmer and he was hardly prepared to rate it so high it wouldnt be worth that to me he said i would rather work for three dollars and a half in cash and board at home ive got to have my boy in the house said silas wilson decidedly come now what do you say he regarded bert with some anxiety for he had been suddenly left in the lurch by a hired man who had received a better offer elsewhere and hardly knew where to turn for assistance ill tell you what ill do said bert ive got to go to new york on thursday on business but ill come and work for you till wednesday night for half a dollar and my board ill give you thirtyfive cents replied the farmer cautiously bert shook his head forty then and thats high pay for a half grown boy im more than half grown returned bert its no use mr wilson i wont take less than fifty cents then jump on the wagon its a big price to pay but im in a hole and wont stop to dicker i will go and tell my mother first well hurry up for part of the day is gone already i dont believe youll like it bert said mrs barton nor i but i made up my mind to accept the first offer i got and i shall feel better satisfied if i keep my word ill come round this evening after work and tell you how i like it as far as ive got bert seated himself in the wagon next to the farmer be you the boy that jones charged with stealin asked silas yes sir you didnt do it asked silas in some apprehension no of course not answered bert indignantly didnt you know i was acquitted and that it was shown that there were two twentydollar bills its wicked to steal observed the farmer apparently a little anxious still of course it is one of the boys that worked for me stole some money from a chestofdrawers in my chamber you see mis wilson and me sleep in a bedroom on the first floor openin out of the settin room did the boy take much asked bert in some curiosity yes he took a twentyfive cent piece answered silas wilson soberly bert wanted to laugh but controlled his facial muscles though he eyed his companion with a queer look that was a good deal of money he said soberly yes it was how did you find him out the boy i mean he spent the money at joness store what did he buy with it he bought some doughnuts did he board with you asked bert significantly yes he did then thought bert i dont wonder much that he was tempted ive got fifty cents in my pocket he said aloud producing the coin i show it to you so that if you hear of my spending money you neednt think i took it from you silas wilson eyed the halfdollar with a covetous look which the sight of money always brought to his face hadnt you better give it to me to keep for you no thank you i am very careful i shall not lose it boys ginerally are keerless they are apt to lose money i dont believe you ever lose money mr wilson not since i was a boy i lost two cents once but it was a lesson to me and ive never lost a copper since by this time they had reached the farmhouse the farmer drove into the barn and put up the horse now well go to work he said the work which awaited bert was in the cornfield he was set to hoeing and kept it up for three hours along with the farmer in the adjoining row noon came and silas pausing in his work said i calculate mis wilson will have dinner ready well go to the house chapter xix berts experience as a farmers boy bert followed the farmer into the kitchen in the center of which a table was set a bony and angular woman was just placing on it a large pitcher of water mis wilson said the farmer this is bert barton who is helping me about the farm work bert was no stranger to mrs wilson whose pew in church was near the one he occupied hows your ma she inquired jerkily pretty well thank you mrs wilson im glad to hear it she looks like a friend of mine mrs dusenberry who died of heart disease i dont think her heart is affected said bert not without anxiety maybe not but you cant tell folks lives along for years with their hearts out of kilter who never find it out till some day they drop dead mrs wilson decidedly was not a cheerful converser she prided herself on detecting signs of unsuspected diseases mebbe youve got heart disease yourself sophia remarked the farmer jocosely just as likely as not answered mrs wilson calmly im sure my livers affected for i feel it squirm sometimes mebbe id better look out for a second mis wilson suggested the farmer smiling you aint over healthy yourself silas responded his better half surveying her husband in a businesslike manner it looks to me as if your kidneys was out of order and youre the very image of jed pettibone who died of apoplexy he lived next door to my mother one day he was alive and well and tomorrow he was as the grass of the field the farmers face wore a very uncomfortable look and he was evidently by no means pleased with his wifes prognostications nonsense he said testily im as well as any man of my age in lakeville boast not thyself of tomorrow quoted mrs wilson solemnly come bert let us set down to dinner said silas hastily what have you got for us sophia ive warmed over them beans we had yesterday answered his helpmeet and theres two sausages besides i dont want any youd ought to make a dinner off of that why to be sure beans and sausages is hearty and will stand by us in the field the laborer is worthy of his meat wheres the meat thought bert silas wilson put a moderate portion of beans on a large plate flanking it with a thin consumptivelooking sausage help yourself to potatoes he said as he handed the plate to bert bert availed himself of the invitation and helped himself to a potato in that condition known as soggy he tried to eat it but though fond of potatoes he left it almost entire on his plate this however was not all there was a plate of ryebread on the table from which bert helped himself to a slice it was apparently two or three days old and needed something to make it palatable please give me some butter asked bert not having observed that this was a prohibited article on the wilsons dinner table there aint none answered mrs wilson promptly i beg pardon i hadnt noticed said bert blushing we never have butter at dinner explained silas wilson its apt to lead to humors particularly in boys isnt it mis wilson so ive always heard silas besides as we have it at breakfast and supper thats enough it goes fast enough even then why we used most a pound last week and butter twentyseven cents a pound chimed in the farmer why its extravagant do you know silas how much butter is used in squire marlowes family no answered the farmer with interest hannah mrs marlowes girl told me they used six pounds and a half last week and theres only four of them including the girl what do you think of that what do i think i think its sinful positively sinful six pounds and a half at twentyseven cents they pay thirtytwo and get the best in the market amended his wife worse and worse that comes to what bert two dollars and eight cents answered bert promptly sho did you ever well i spose the squire can stand it no doubt they live on the fat of the land i just wish theyd invite me to tea so i could judge for myself i could tell within five cents how much the supper cost it must be confessed that bert did not enjoy his dinner the sausage was far from rich or juicy and the beans were almost cold the potatoes and bread have already been referred to however there was to be a second course and to that bert looked forward anxiously for he had by no means satisfied his appetite it was a plain rice pudding and partially satisfactory for it takes very little skill to boil rice and there is little variety in the quality by way of sauce mrs wilson provided cheap grade of molasses still bert enjoyed it better than any other article on the table theres nothing like a good dinner to strengthen us for the labors of the field said silas wilson complacently as he rose from the table come bert now let us get to work to make up for lost time so mr wilson considers the time spent in eating as lost time thought bert id rather have one of mothers dinners than half a dozen like this ugh how nasty those potatoes were bert returned to the field and resumed his work he found it hard to keep up with silas wilson whose energies seemed to be quickened by his midday meal about four oclock a man came along who wanted to see silas on business and he went back to the house leaving bert to continue his work alone this is about the longest day i ever passed thought bert pausing to wipe his moistened forehead i am afraid i shall never want to be a farmer i mustnt forget though that i am to receive sixteen cents and a little over per day besides board and such board yet this is the way silas wilson has lived all his life and he must be sixtyfive at least how much more enjoyment uncle jacob has out of life though he is a poor man compared to the farmer at this moment he heard wheels passing on the road hard by and looking up he recognized percy marlowe neat and trim in his attire driving a light buggy hallo called out percy checking his horse hallo percy are you working for silas wilson yes for a few days i guess youll make a fortune in that time said percy laughing it seems like it responded bert how much does he pay you fifty cents for three days and board percy laughed i should want fifty cents an hour and then i wouldnt do it id work all the year round at that price said bert i never expect to work with my hands went on percy have you decided what to do asked bert curiously my father wants me to be a manufacturer but i think i shall be a lawyer i am afraid i shant have much choice i must take what i can get you might stay with mr wilson and be a farmer i dont think that will suit me at any rate unless i can work for a different man perhaps father can take you back into the shop when you are older i wish he would take me back now i like it a great deal better than working out in the field here you mustnt get too high notions into your head bert you know you are a working boy and mustnt expect to have things all your own way i am not likely to forget that i am a working boy especially with kind friends to remind me of it but we live in the best country in the world and there is many a working boy who grows up to be a distinguished man percy laughed ironically i wouldnt get such silly ideas into your head he said why are they silly you talk as if you expected to be a distinguished man ha ha i hope to be a successful man answered bert stoutly percy laughed again and drove on five minutes later bert saw the farmer running from the house in a state of great apparent excitement have you seen anything of my wallet he gasped as he came within hearing distance chapter xx bert is placed in an embarrassing position bert regarded his employer with surprise your wallet he repeated yes answered silas wilson impatiently i had it in my pocket when i was at work here i didnt think about it till just now after mr dexter had left me then i found that my pocket was empty i havent seen it but you may have dropped it somewhere just help me look for it has anybody been here no at least not in the field percy marlowe passed in his buggy and never mind about that help me look for the wallet the rows of corn were of considerable length and there were a good many of them at least ten minutes elapsed before anything was seen of the missing article and dark suspicions of his young assistant entered the mind of mr wilson but at last berts sharp eyes espied a faded leather wallet between two hills in one of the rows which the farmer had hoed is this it he asked holding it up in his hand yes exclaimed silas delighted where did you find it just here mr wilson opened it anxious to see whether the contents were intact its all safe he said with a sigh of relief was there much money in it asked bert yes two dollars and sixtyseven cents its a narrow escape suppose a dishonest person had found it it would have been terrible said bert successfully checking his disposition to laugh im much obliged to you bert for findin it i suppose you dont want any reward oh no i am working for you you know and it wasnt my own time i was using thats true still i am willin to give you two cents to encourage you to be honest thank you mr wilson but i dont need any reward for that youre a good boy and if you stay with me ill make a man of you thank you bert was privately of opinion that if he remained till the age of twentyone in silas wilsons employ boarding at his table he would grow into a very thin undersized man indeed supper was a less substantial meal than dinner in the wilson household consisting of bread and butter and tea with the addition of a plate of doughnuts which were so tough and hard that it occurred to bert that they would make very good baseballs if they had been of the right shape after supper he went home for an hour dont you feel very tired bert asked his mother yes mother but i feel still more hungry if youve got anything left from supper i think i can dispose of it certainly bert but didnt you eat supper at mr wilsons mother they dont know what good living is there id rather have one of your suppers than a dozen of mr wilsons i begin to think that the board part wont be worth over fifty cents for three days i am sure it wont cost them any more i wish you were going to sleep here bert i shall feel lonely so do i but i shall only be away two nights silas wilson promises to make a man of me if ill stay but id rather grow to manhood somewhere else bert returned to the farmhouse and about halfpast eight went to bed he knew he must be early astir and he felt fatigued by his day of labor in the field besides mr and mrs wilson went to bed at this hour the farmer was not fond of reading nor indeed was there anything in the house to read for neither he nor his wife had a literary taste once he took an agricultural paper for a year at a cost of two dollars but whenever the paper arrived he groaned in spirit over the cost and deplored his extravagance in subscribing for it the room assigned to bert was over the kitchen which was in the ell part the roof was sloping and toward the eaves very low there was one window near the bed which he occupied bert went to sleep in ten minutes and slept soundly for three or four hours then something roused him and he opened his eyes what he saw startled him by the bright moonlight he perceived a man climbing in at the window to say that bert was perfectly calm would not be true he was very much startled as i think almost any boy or man either would have been under the circumstances it is a burglar thought bert in excitement what can i do some one evidently had heard of silas wilsons miserly disposition and judged that there would be a good chance to secure booty in the farm house bert though he did not admire mr wilson felt that it was his duty to protect him from being plundered if possible he knew that he was in some personal peril but he was naturally a brave boy and his spirit rose to the occasion he waited until the supposed burglar was in the room and then sitting up in bed asked stoutly who are you what brings you here the man turned swiftly toward the bed and fixed his eyes on bert but did not immediately speak if you are a burglar continued bert emboldened by the mans hesitation you had better get out of the window again or i shall call mr wilson no dont call him at least not yet said the intruder sinking into a chair a few feet from the bed are you working here yes who are you this seemed a singular question what could his name matter to a burglar however bert answered mechanically my name is bert barton the widow bartons boy yes how do you know that demanded bert in bewilderment dont you know me was the unexpected rejoinder he drew nearer to the bed and bert gazed at him earnestly but no light dawned upon him no i dont know you he said shaking his head i am silas wilsons son said the stranger phineas wilson now bert remembered that eight years before the farmers son a man grown had left lakeville and so far as he knew had not been heard of since he had contracted a habit of drinking and had tired of farm work moreover when he left he had taken fifty dollars of his fathers money with him which had led to bitter feelings on the part of the farmer who appeared to mourn the loss of his money more than that of his son and this was the young man who had crept into his fathers house like a thief in the night why did you get into my window asked bert why didnt you come to the door i didnt know if i would be welcome i wanted to ask do you know how my father feels toward me no i have only been here one day he ought to be glad to see his son i took some money with me when i went away said phineas hesitating fathers very fond of money yes assented bert and he would find it hard to forget that why didnt you come back before i didnt dare to come till i could bring the money i have got it with me but not a dollar more if you want to know what brings me back look in my face and see for yourself the moon came out from behind a cloud and by its light bert saw that the young mans face was thin and ghastly i am sick he said irregular hours and whiskey have done their work i am afraid i have got to pass in my checks what does that mean die yes dont give up said bert feeling his sympathies go out toward this prodigal son you are young it takes a good deal to kill a young man youre a good fellow bert thats your name isnt it will you do me a favor to be sure i will i am famished i havent had anything to eat for twentyfour hours can you slip downstairs and fetch me something to eat no matter what and a glass of milk bert hesitated he could get what was required in the pantry but suppose the farmer or his wife should wake up it would make his position a very awkward one hadnt you better go down yourself he asked i can hardly stand i am so tired besides i dont know where mother keeps things i will try said bert and he slipped on his pantaloons and went softly downstairs chapter xxi the midnight visit to the pantry suppose mrs wilson sees me thought bert uncomfortably she will take me for a thief he was actuated by the kindest motives but he heartily wished his errand were done as he stepped into the kitchen he heard the deep breathing of mrs wilson and the noisy snore of her husband and rightly judged that it would not be easy to rouse either of them he opened the pantry door and by the light of the moon was able to inspect the shelves there was a half loaf of bread on one shelf half a dozen doughnuts on a plate on the shelf below and a few cold beans close beside them then there was a small pitcher halffull of milk i dont think the beans or doughnuts will set well on an empty stomach bert reflected id better take the milk and two or three slices of bread here the cat who had been asleep on the hearth roused herself perhaps at the sight of the milk pitcher and mewing loudly rubbed herself against berts legs scat cried bert in a low voice anxiously looking toward the door of the bed chamber in which the farmer and his wife lay asleep the cat got between his legs and nearly tripped him up but he managed to get out of the room and upstairs phineas looked at him eagerly i have some bread and milk here said bert i couldnt find any butter there were some cold beans and doughnuts but the bread and milk are better give them to me i am almost famished the bread was dry and stale but phineas was not in the mood to be particular he ate like one famished and drained the pitcher to the last drop i feel better he said then with a sigh of relief i suppose i had better take the pitcher back to the kitchen it will be missed reflected bert and he started downstairs again in his bare feet he paused at the kitchen door and heard the farmer talking in his sleep this alarmed him he decided that it would not do to replace the pitcher in the pantry as he would be likely to be heard he waited where he was for five minutes and then ventured into the kitchen this time he was successful and with mind relieved returned to his chamber phineas was dozing in his chair you had better get into the bed mr wilson said bert filled with compassion for the weary wayfarer ill lie on the floor if you dont mind i am fagged out bert made a pillow of his coat and trousers and stretched himself on the floor he found that there was an inside bolt with which he fastened the door to guard against any unexpected visit from mr or mrs wilson he fell asleep again and was only roused by a loud voice at the foot of the back stairs time to get up called the farmer all right responded bert in a loud tone fortunately silas wilson did not think it necessary to come up had he done so it would have been embarrassing for phineas was sound asleep on the bed bert thought it best to rouse him before he went down stairs are you not afraid some one will come upstairs and find you here he asked no mother never comes up till after she has got breakfast out of the way and the dishes washed i suppose you know best said bert doubtfully if necessary i shall tell her who i am bert went below and sat down at the breakfast table it was clear from the expression on mrs wilsons face that she had something on her mind silas she said solemnly something mysterious has happened during the night what is it asked the farmer in a tone of surprise we have been robbed what of he asked turning pale do you miss any of the spoons no or or money and he pulled out his wallet hurriedly no no it isnt that what is it then i left that pitcher half full of milk when i went to bed last night this morning there wasnt a drop in it and the pantry door was open cats are fond of milk suggested silas with a glance at tabby who was lying near the fireplace it wasnt the cat she couldnt get her head inside the pitcher besides there are three slices of bread missing wont cats eat bread it was a twolegged cat replied mrs wilson significantly bert reddened in spite of himself and tried to look unconscious he saw that mrs wilson was on the point of making a discovery and that suspicion was likely to fall upon him this he could clear up but it would be at the expense of the poor fellow who was asleep upstairs but how could anybody get into the house asked silas the doors were locked werent they yes silas in forty years i have never failed to lock the door before i went to bed then i dont see nor i yet said mrs wilson significantly and bert thought but he may have been mistaken that her eyes turned for a moment in his direction at any rate it isnt much of a loss was there anything else in the closet there were some doughnuts and beans were any of them taken no not that i can see cats dont care for them dont be a fool silas that poor cat had no more to do with the robbery than i have mebbe youre right but cats have been known to steal i like dogs better myself i dont cried mrs wilson with emphasis im not going to have any dog trapesing over my floors with his muddy feet just as you like sophia youd better lock the pantry door in future im not sure that that will answer unless i hide the key do you seriously think a human being took the things yes i do in the middle of the night by gracious thats serious he might have come into our room and taken my wallet and watch and maybe murdered us in our beds added mrs wilson grimly did you hear anybody walking round the house last night bert asked the farmer who was by this time worked up into a state of agitation no answered bert i am glad he did not ask me whether i saw anybody thought he i dont want to tell a lie i usually sleep pretty sound he added a little ashamed of his duplicity yet not knowing how else to avert suspicions so we all do said the farmers wife we might be all murdered in our beds without knowing anything about it i shouldnt want to know anything about it if that was going to happen observed silas not without reason i dont think it could have been a very desperate ruffian if he contented himself with taking bread and milk he may come again tonight suggested mrs wilson i hope not said silas fervently i i couldnt sleep if i thought so we must get to the bottom of this went on his wife resolutely i am not willing to have such goings on in my house how are you going to do it sophia probably the thiefs miles off by this time he may be or he may not be said mrs wilson in an oracular tone ive heard of folks walking in their sleep she added after a pause you dont mean me asked silas no if you did it id have had a chance to find out in forty years do you ever walk in your sleep she asked turning suddenly to bert the question was so unexpected that he could not help changing color and this served to increase mrs wilsons dawning suspicions not that i ever heard of bert answered after a pause i knew a boy once that did it was a second cousin of my brothers first wife i am sure i never get up in my sleep the door leading into the entry from which the backstairs ascended was open and through this just at this moment was heard a sound that startled all three who were sitting at the breakfast table it was a loud unmistakeable sneeze and it came from the chamber which bert had occupied the farmer and his wife started as if the house had been shaken by an exploding bombshell both turned as pale as death looked fearfully at each other and clutched tightly at the edges of the table silas said mrs wilson in a hollow voice the burglar is upstairs chapter xxii a panic at farmer wilsons silas wilson was not a brave man and at his wifes suggestion he turned pale and looked panicstricken do you think so he asked feebly do i think so i know so returned mrs wilson energetically how could he get up there mrs wilson walked to the window and her lynx eyes detected the ladder by which phineas had climbed to the window of berts room do you see that she asked it is rather surprising that she did not suspect bert of knowing something about the matter but she had not yet had time to put two and two together its terrible murmured silas mopping the cold perspiration from his forehead what can we do what can we do go and get your gun silas and go up and confront the villain thats what we can do somehow the suggestion did not seem to find favor with mr wilson he would shoot me he said hes probably waitin for me with a loaded weepun upon the landin silas wilson i am ashamed of you are you going to let a villainous burglar rampage round upstairs stealin whatever he can lay his hands on come now i believe you care more for the few things upstairs than for your husbands life said silas reproachfully do you want me to go silas whatll the folks in the village say when they hear of it i dont know as i know where the gun is said silas nervously its out in the woodshed behind the door i dont know as its loaded besides i wouldnt want to be took up for murder not much danger silas wilson such men as you dont get into such scrapes as that mrs wilson went out into the woodshed and returned holding the gun in such a way that it pointed directly at her husband dont you know no better than to pint that gun at me sophia exclaimed silas in no little terror beats all what fools women are about firearms they may be fools but they aint cowards returned mrs wilson come are you going up or not hadnt i better go to the foot of the stairs and fire up asked silas with a bright idea and then hed come down on you when your gun was discharged and run his bayonet into you said mrs wilson who knew that at the battle of bunker hill the muskets had bayonets attached ill give him warnin continued silas itll only be fair hell probably be frightened and climb down the ladder i never did see such a fraid cat in my life quoth mrs wilson contemptuously mebbe youre bravern i be if you are go up yourself said silas wilson angrily you want to put your wife in danger do you returned mrs wilson who was as averse to facing the burglar as her husband though she talked more courageously and you want to expose your husband to danger retorted silas so its an even thing so far as i can see it is hardly necessary to say that bert enjoyed the dispute between the husband and wife though he maintained an outward gravity which helped him to conceal his secret amusement by this time he thought it time for him to take part ill go up he said you will exclaimed silas in surprise and relief yes i am not afraid to be sure the burglar wouldnt do you no harm youre only a boy do you know how to fire a gun yes but i shant need the gun i am sure the burglar wouldnt harm me youre a brave boy bert said the farmer youre doing just what i would have done at your age you never would have done it silas i should be ashamed anyway to own up i was more of a coward as a grown man than as a boy sophia you dont know much about burglars and their ways dont be afraid bert ill back you up ill stand at the door of the kitchen with the gun in my hand and help you if you need it bert smiled for he knew just how valuable silas wilsons assistance would be but he made no comment and started on his perilous enterprise i hope he wont come to no harm said mrs wilson i dont know but id better go with him it would be safer for you sophia for burglars dont shoot women much you know about it silas the two moved toward the kitchen door silas handling the gun as if he were afraid of it they listened with painful attention and presently heard the sound of voices though they could not make out what was being said the boys speakin to him said silas awestruck i never see such a terrible time i wish id told bert to tell the burglar to go back the same way he came and we wouldnt fire at him i dont want to be too hard on the transgressor mebbe hes driven to his evil ways by destitution mrs wilson paid very little attention to what her husband was saying being more intent on what was passing upstairs after a short interval bert came down well said silas eagerly did you see the burglar yes where is he in my room what is he doin there he is lying on the bed well if i ever saw such impudence ejaculated mrs wilson has he got a gun with him did he offer to shoot you no answered bert gravely the poor fellow is sick poor fellow indeed sniffed mrs wilson what does he mean by getting into a respectable house through a window hell end up his days in jail does does he look desperate inquired silas wilson would he be likely to hurt me or mis wilson no he says he would like to have you come up well of all things ejaculated sophia ive got something to tell you went on bert turning from one to the other he wants me to tell you before you go up it is some one whom you both know though you havent seen him for a good many years silas did not understand but a mothers instincts were quicker is it our son phineas she asked yes answered bert it is your son who stole fifty dollars from his father and crept away like a thief in the night exclaimed the farmer indignantly he has suffered and is very weak rejoined bert he hadnt had anything to eat for twentyfour hours and i may as well tell you that it was i who came downstairs in the night and took up the bread and milk to him you did quite right said mrs wilson who was halfway upstairs by this time he was her own son in spite of all and though she was not an emotional woman she yearned to see the face of her only child with a mothers feelings all aroused within her he took fifty dollars repeated silas wilson still harping on a wrong which he had never forgotten nor forgiven bert was rather disgusted at the farmers meanness but he relieved his anxiety hes brought you back the money he said shortly he has exclaimed silas in a tone of gladness did he tell you so yes it is all the money he had and he went without food rather than spend any of it come thats encouragin said the farmer hes turnin from his evil ways when they reached berts chamber they saw mrs wilson kneeling beside the bed her harsh features softened by the light of an affection which had been absent from them for years she looked contented and happy now that her boy was restored to her got back again phineas hey said silas wilson youre lookin kinder peaked yes father ive been sick but now ill soon get him well interposed mrs wilson ill go right down and bring up some breakfast i can eat it mother i have had nothing except the bread and milk bert brought me on wednesday evening bert closed his engagement with the farmer and declined to continue it though urged strongly to do so he went home in a whirl of excitement for phineas wilson had told him something which overwhelmed him with astonishment chapter xxiii bert forms a resolution mother said bert abruptly as he entered the cottage at the close of his engagement with the farmer when did father die mrs barton sank into a chair and looked searchingly in her sons face why do you ask she said slowly i have been told today that he was living only a year since who told you phineas wilson the farmers son did he see him a year ago yes in some town in canada near toronto i believe but mother you dont seem surprised no bert for i knew your father was living then why dont he come home why dont he live with us is there some mystery yes bert and a painful one for your unfortunate father it is the fear of a prison that has kept him away from home surely mother said bert painfully shocked my father was not a criminal no but circumstances made him appear such tell me the story it is time that you heard it ten years ago your father and albert marlowe were employed by weeks brothers large shoe manufacturers in a massachusetts town both were skilled workmen did squire marlowe work at the bench yes his position was precisely the same as your fathers no worse and no better both received the same pay two dollars a day does percy know this probably not albert marlowe is not fond of speaking of his early days when he was a common workman at that time our families were intimate and associated on equal terms our circumstances and ways of living were the same we lived in a double house albert occupying one tenement we the other were you and mrs marlowe friendly then yes she had not yet become a fine lady but did her own work dispensing with a servant we lived plainly and if anything your father was the more prosperous of the two as we managed to save from fifty to seventyfive dollars a year while i dont believe albert saved anything but one day a terrible thing happened mr weeks the senior partner was a trustee and guardian for some minor children a part of their property was invested in united states bonds s as they are called he kept them in his safe in the factory one morning when he opened the safe they were missing you can imagine the dismay of the guardian and his indignation against the unknown thief the loss was publicly proclaimed and a reward of one hundred dollars was offered to any one who could and would give any information that would lead to the discovery of the thief some one a young man named harding entered the office of the firm and informed them that he had seen your father thrusting a paper looking like a government bond into the inside pocket of his overcoat it was in the middle of winter the workmen kept their coats in a small room near the entrance of the factory of course the room was visited your fathers coat was examined and in one of the pockets was found one of the missing bonds one for five hundred dollars your father was summoned charged with the theft and required to tell what he had done with the remaining bonds he was thunderstruck at the accusation and denied in the most positive terms any knowledge of the stolen property his statement was not credited he was arrested tried for the offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment berts face flushed with indignation and he clinched his fist almost unconsciously did he go to prison he asked hoarsely no some of his friends who believed in his innocence helped him to escape and supplied him with funds to get out of the country now you know why he has remained absent all these years but why was i never told of this mother why did i not know at the time you were only six years of age and were sent away during the excitement to the house of a friend living at some distance i moved away from the town in which my misfortunes were known and eventually came here learning that albert marlowe had established himself in business here you readily believed that your father was dead i understand now mother but is it not terrible that the happiness of a family should be broken up in this way yes bert providence permits it for some wise purpose no doubt though it is hard for us to understand why it should be one thing i dont understand mother you say that squire marlowe was a common workman like my father and a poor man yes bert how is it that he is now a rich manufacturer where did he get the necessary capital nobody knew he took all his friends by surprise when he went into business for himself on a large scale whatever the amount of his capital he has never been financially embarrassed and has gone on prospering till now he is a rich man living in luxury while we are living from hand to mouth and poor father is an exile somewhere yes bert dont you receive letters from father if i should it would draw attention to him and might imperil his safety i might meet him sometime and not know him have you no recollection of him not the least havent you any picture of him mother yes i have a daguerreotype upstairs an oldstyle picture why have you never shown it to me because it would have led you to ask questions which would have been embarrassing for me to answer you might have mentioned the existence of the picture before some visitor and compelled me to produce it suppose this had been the case and it had been recognized it might have got your father into trouble now that i know all the circumstances wont you show me the picture mother yes bert the only objection i had is now removed mrs barton went upstairs and soon returned with one of those oldfashioned pictures of which many of my readers may have specimens in their homes a daguerreotype bert scanned it attentively and he first looked bewildered then surprised i have seen a face like that he said after a pause where bert i dont remember is it possible that i can remember so far back it may be an accidental resemblance no the face is like in every respect cant you explain it to me mother think a little bert perhaps you will recall where you saw a face like this i have it now said bert his face brightening up it is like mr robinson the friend of father who called here a few weeks since bert said his mother slowly mr robinson was not your fathers friend it was your father himself bert looked the picture of astonishment why did you not tell me mother how could i you did not even know that he was alive ever since then i have been seeking an opportunity to tell you the truth i am glad to know what did father have to say he thinks he has found out at any rate he has strong suspicions who was the real thief for whom he suffered who is it mother is it any one i ever knew yes bert tell me quick then you must promise to keep it secret till we are in a condition to prove the truth of our suspicions it was albert marlowe the squire yes that must explain his being able to go into business for himself yes your father is on the track of a man who was his accomplice or rather his tool in the matter the young man named harding on whose information your father was arrested of course he is placed under a disadvantage in making these inquiries being under the ban of the law mother said bert solemnly i am going to solve the mystery if possible make my fathers evidence clear and expose the real criminal i am only a boy and i dont know how i shall accomplish it but i wont rest till i have done it may heaven grant you success my dear boy responded mrs barton fervently chapter xxiv the office of the magnet mine bert took the morning train to new york and arrived about halfpast seven oclock he met with no adventures on the way and as soon as he reached the grand central depot took a fourth avenue car down as instructed by uncle jacob in a large building of many stories on nassau street on the sixth floor was an office on the door of which bert read magnet mining co this as he understood was the office where jacob marlowe was employed bert was considering whether he ought to knock or not when a brisklooking gentleman stepped up and opening the door entered bert followed him in whom did you wish to see asked the brisklooking man mr jacob marlowe is this the office where he is employed yes answered the man with a smile bert hardly needed this assurance however as he had already discovered uncle jacob sitting in an inner room at a desk conversing on business apparently with an elderly man of dignified appearance he will soon be at leisure said the one who had just entered and seated himself at another desk in the outer room that must be uncle jacobs employer thought bert what news do you hear of the mine he heard the elderly man ask excellent answered uncle jacob it has gone up five points within two weeks the output is steadily increasing do you know anything of it from your own knowledge certainly i ought to for i was myself its discoverer this rather surprised bert it was a rich find continued uncle jacob and i have no hesitation in putting it on the new york market there are so many wildcat mines you know that a man needs to be very cautious quite true in such mines it is only the men who capitalize them who make money i would not lend myself to any such scheme of deception i have a reputation to sustain and i value that more than money our mine has found favor with some of the most conservative investors in the city here uncle jacob mentioned several names so prominent that they were familiar to bert country boy though he was you may put me down for five hundred shares said the elderly man apparently convinced i will send you round a check tomorrow to whom shall i make it payable to me very well the old gentleman rose drew on his gloves and went out uncle jacob accompanying him to the door this brought him face to face with bert so you have come bert he said with a pleasant smile how did you leave your mother very well uncle at what time did you breakfast at halfpast six then you must be hungry it is rather early for my lunch but i will go out with you now mr bascom i shall be back within an hour if any one calls to see me try to keep him yes sir answered bascom deferentially he cant be uncle jacobs employer thought bert he is too respectful i had no idea uncle was such a man of business he doesnt appear to be afraid of anybody they descended in the elevator rather to berts surprise who had climbed up by the staircase crossing the street they entered a dairy restaurant which in spite of the name supplied the usual variety of dishes they found a table at which no others were seated and uncle jacob ordered a substantial meal of roast beef and vegetables did you find me easily bert he inquired oh yes uncle i had to inquire the way once only do you like your place very well indeed bert is it a good man you work for uncle jacob smiled i have no fault to find with him he answered i thought perhaps that man with black hair and whiskers might be the boss no he is a clerk like you yes answered jacob with another smile does the boss often come in he doesnt interfere much you see he has a good deal of confidence in mr bascom and myself so i thought what made you think so you seem to talk and act as if you were independent its a way i have bert as i understand the business thoroughly more than anybody else there is no reason why i shouldnt is there oh no that is why i enjoy my position so well do you get paid your wages every saturday night oftener if i please answered jacob marlowe seeming amused if i happen to get short in the middle of the week i can draw in advance you seem to have a very good position uncle jacob it is a great deal better than opening a cigar store in lakeville yes i think so myself albert marlowe was right in advising me against it have you seen him lately i see him about every day but not to speak to it was mean in him to discharge you from the factory so i thought uncle jacob i wrote asking him to take you back what did he say asked bert with interest he in effect told me to mind my own business i hope you and your mother have not suffered for want of money no thanks to you uncle jacob mother thought you ought not to have sent so much i dont think i shall miss it bert said uncle jacob i am glad that it helped you the twentydollar bill got me into trouble how was that bert told the story of his arrest on the charge of robbing mr jones and gave an account of his trial and you were tried before albert marlowe yes i suppose percy rejoiced in your humiliation no he didnt he behaved like a brick he walked to the courtroom with me and told me he was sure i was not guilty i am certainly surprised but i am pleased also that is a point in percys favor an unexpected one he shant lose by it i am afraid i shouldnt have got off if it hadnt been for a young lawyer from new york named conway who volunteered to defend me go on give me an account of it can you give me the address of mr conway yes uncle i have it here i may be able to throw a little business in his way one good turn deserves another i wish you would uncle jacob mr conway refused to accept a fee knowing that i could not afford to pay him uncle jacob asked other questions as the dinner proceeded finally bert brought out his most important piece of news i have just found out that my father is still alive he said yes i knew that returned uncle jacob calmly you knew it yes he has been to see me he has when last week you dont think him guilty of the charge which was brought against him no i think him a badlyused man i wish i could be the means of proving his innocence i mean that you shall be bert surveyed his uncle in surprise in fact it is for that reason i have sent for you your father has put his case into my hands and i propose to see him righted this evening when i am free from business cares i will speak further with you on this subject uncle jacob called for his check paid it and they returned to the office chapter xxv an advertisement and what came of it uncle jacob left the office at five oclock and bert who had been exploring the lower part of new york went uptown with him on the sixth avenue road they got out at twentythird street and jacob marlowe led the way to a large roomy house near seventh avenue he took out a nightkey and opening the outer door proceeded to a large handsomely furnished apartment on the second floor with a bedroom attached this is where i live bert he remarked as he took off his hat and hung it up in a closet bert looked around him to him the room looked quite luxurious being furnished in a style which would compare favorably even with squire marlowes the best house in lakeville bert knew nothing of room rents in new york but inexperienced as he was he was surprised that his uncle on a salary of twelve dollars a week should be able to live so well he would have been even more amazed had he known that the weekly rent of the room he was in was twelve dollars youve got a splendid room uncle jacob he said i shouldnt think you could afford to live in such style some of my friends think i am extravagant observed jacob marlowe with a smile perhaps they are right i am afraid you cant save anything went on bert gravely what if you should get sick i see bert you are more prudent than i am however i have invested some of my money in the magnet mine and it is likely to double so i feel justified in making myself comfortable i am glad to hear that uncle jacob you deserve to succeed you are so kind to others i am glad you think so bert i want to do some good while i live it gives a man something to live for after supper which was taken at a restaurant near by uncle jacob said now let us come to business i promised your father that i would do what i could to prove him innocent of the charge made against him ten years since where is my father is he in the city no it is not safe for him to stay here as he is subject to arrest and might be recognized he has gone back to canada do you know the particulars of his story yes mother told me all about it last night you know then that a young man named ralph harding informed against him and that it was his testimony that led to your fathers arrest yes your father is under the impression that this harding was in league with albert marlowe and was employed by him to throw suspicion upon your father the weak point of the prosecution was that your father could only be connected with the fivehundred dollar bond found in his overcoat pocket while a large balance was wholly unaccounted for that made it seem like a cunning conspiracy as undoubtedly it was were the other bonds never traced i understand not no list of the numbers had been kept and not being registered they could easily be sold your father thinks that upon these the present prosperity of albert marlowe was built up how are we to prove that it will be difficult one thing is absolutely essential we must find this ralph harding and persuade him if we can to exonerate your father and place the guilt where it properly belongs does father know where to find harding no if he did the greatest difficulty in our way would be removed then i dont see that we can do anything said bert disappointed the task is difficult but not impossible all we know is that only two months after the robbery harding disappeared it was reported that he went to the west but this was by no means certain from that day to this nothing is positively known as to his whereabouts then i dont see what can be done repeated bert there is one thing to guide us continued uncle jacob the mans occupation there is a fair probability that he is working in some shoe town that is if he is still alive there are a good many shoe towns objected bert true the clew is only a faint one yet sometimes a faint clew leads to important discoveries have you taken any steps yet uncle jacob yes your father remembered that harding was a pennsylvanian by birth and this made it possible at least that he had gone back to his native state accordingly last week i inserted an advertisement in two daily papers printed in philadelphia calling for information touching the man of whom we are in search i will show you a copy of it uncle jacob took from his wallet a newspaper clipping and showed it to bert it ran thus wanted information as to the present residence of ralph harding who in the year was employed in the shoe manufactory of weeks brothers in lynn mass he will hear something to his advantage have you had any answer to this advertisement asked bert not till this morning when i received a letter from harrisburg written in a feminine hand here it is he placed in berts hands the following letter dear sir i have read in the philadelphia ledger your advertisement for a man named ralph harding a man by that name boarded with me two months ago he was working in a shoe shop in this city so he may be the one you are after you say you know of something to his advantage if there is any money coming to him i want you to see that i am paid a just debt mr harding was owing me eight weeks board when he left the house at four dollars a week and dirt cheap that is for if i do say it myself there are not many boardinghouses in harrisburg where so good a table is kept for four dollars as i give i inclose my bill and will be very glad if you will send me the money by return of mail taking it out of any money that is to come to mr harding i work hard for my money and i cant afford to lose thirtytwo dollars and it isnt right that i should hoping to hear from you very soon i remain yours respectfully amelia stubbs p s you can send me a check as i can get it cashed by my grocer mrs stubbs means business remarked bert with a smile have you sent her the money not yet i dont hold myself liable for ralph hardings debts even if this is the man i am after however i am willing to pay mrs stubbs for information if she can furnish any that will help us have you written to her i am going to send a letter to her by you am i to go to harrisburg exclaimed bert pleasantly surprised yes i shall send you there tomorrow i should like to go what am i to do when i get there first of all you must call on mrs stubbs it may be well for you to engage board at her house for a week paying in advance as that will put you in her good graces you will of course learn all you can from her but it will be necessary also to seek information outside i shall have to leave a good deal to your discretion i hope your confidence in me wont prove to be misplaced uncle jacob i know you will do your best bert but it is quite possible you may fail as the poet says tis not in mortals to command success i am sure you will deserve it isnt it going to cost considerable to make this journey uncle jacob i think we can find money enough for it i am afraid your money will soon melt away uncle think how much you have spent for us already you remember what i told you as to my lucky investment in the magnet mine at any rate it will be worth something to vindicate your father who for ten long and tedious years has been compelled to pass his life in exile under the ban of a crime which he never committed yes uncle jacob but it ought not to come out of you make yourself easy bert the money we spend for worthy purposes is well invested and we are often repaid tenfold and now as you are unacquainted with new york i will take you out for a walk and show you how it looks by gaslight nothing could have pleased bert better than this proposal they returned at nine oclock and both he and uncle jacob retired at an early hour chapter xxvi bert secures board in harrisburg bert arrived in harrisburg about four oclock in the afternoon he had in his hand a gripsack purchased for him by uncle jacob who also provided him with a fuller supply of shirts socks and underclothing than he had brought with him you may be gone some time he said just as bert got into the cars uncle jacob handed him a wallet this contains a sum of money for your immediate needs he explained when you are out send to me after the cars started bert opened the wallet and to his surprise found that he had fifty dollars in his possession uncle jacobs money wont last long at this rate he said to himself i must be very careful and economical i should like to take back to him a part of this sum of course bert enjoyed his trip the sun shone brightly the air was cool and invigorating and the scenes through which he was rapidly speeding were new to him in spite of the sense of responsibility which rested upon him he felt cheerful and exhilarated if i can only succeed in my mission he thought if i can only find ralph harding and induce him to vindicate my fathers reputation i shall feel happy it so happened that he had seated himself in the smoking car the car behind which he first entered being full a tall thin man wearing a white hat sat down beside him have a cigar young man he asked as he produced two of rather poor quality one of which he lighted and proceeded to smoke no thank you sir better accept a good offer urged the stranger thank you but i dont smoke indeed how old are you i am sixteen replied bert then you are a rara avis that means a rare bird most boys of your age smoke theyd be better off without it perhaps so i see you are a prudent young man how far are you going to harrisburg so am i queer coincidence isnt it i dont know answered bert smiling i presume there are other passengers on board who are also bound for that city very possibly ever been there before no sir i have often and the long ride is rather tedious what do you say to a little game of cards to fill up the time thank you but i would rather look out of the window the stranger seemed disappointed but a man in the seat just behind leaning over said if you want a game im your man all right said berts companion brightening up what game do you play anything poker all right the two took seats opposite between which was a small table and the game began bert looked over now and then and saw that they were playing for money he was startled for he had been taught to regard gambling with horror it seemed evident after awhile that his late seatmate was losing he became more and more excited and nervous and his face was overspread with gloom at length he came over to bert and said eagerly my young friend will you do me a favor what is it sir lend me five dollars this seemed to bert an extraordinary request from a perfect stranger you must excuse me sir he answered havent you got as much about you say two dollars then the money i have with me is not my own said bert i cannot lend anything but let me assure you i will give it back to you before the train reaches harrisburg i have had a streak of bad luck and that man over there has won all my money but ive got on to his game and i will soon have it all back if i get a start youll be doing me a great favor and there will be no risk he must take me for a fool thought bert you had better apply to some one else he said coldly i cant possibly help you so young and so hardhearted murmured the other eying bert reproachfully twas ever thus from childhoods hour i was born under an unlucky star sir i am afraid i must withdraw from our pleasant game unless you will kindly lend me a dollar to continue his late antagonist shrugged his shoulders i dont see how that would benefit me he said well wait till another time when you are in funds then i shall be happy to accommodate you did you lose much asked bert as his companion resumed a seat at his side fifteen dollars tis not much but twas my all if you would oblige me with a dollar i can win it all back bert shook his head i have no money of my own he said never mind twenty times i have been on the threshold of fortune and failed to secure it by my funds giving out be it so i will no longer resist but float downward to oblivion over the rapids of disappointment you are an actor are you not said bert yes at least so i sometimes flatter myself though the critics do not all concede it if you are going to remain in harrisburg long enough come and see me act he gave bert his card and then closing his eyes passed the remainder of the journey in dozing arrived in harrisburg bert found himself besieged by hackmen representing different hotels but he did not think it right to waste uncle jacobs money in unnecessary expense he picked out a bootblack and showing him the address of mrs stubbs asked is that near by bout quarter of a mile answered the street boy whatll you ask for showing me the way a dime go ahead then in five minutes bert found himself standing in front of a rather shabby threestory house in a decent but not fashionable street the name stubbs was on the door bert rang the bell and inquired for mrs stubbs he was ushered into a small reception room on one side of the front door furnished in cheap boardinghouse style and took a seat on a stiffbacked cane chair presently a thin lady with corkscrew curls and a pale washedout complexion entered the room did you wish to see me sir she said yes answered bert you answered an advertisement about ralph harding i come from new york have you brought my money asked mrs stubbs with animation what money do you refer to mr hardings board bill i sent it in the letter we dont feel called upon to pay mr hardings debts returned bert who had been instructed by uncle jacob to say this must i lose thirtytwo dollars then said the lady tragically its a shame no doubt it is but we dont even know mr harding then why did you advertise for him because we want his testimony in a law case the advertisement said that it would be for mr hardings advantage to report to you so it will if we can find him he will receive money enough to settle your bill and more too we will see that he does if you help us find him i am sure i am willing to do all i can said mrs stubbs considerably mollified have you got a small room vacant asked bert i may be detained in harrisburg for a while yes you can have the one mr harding used to occupy if you occupy it alone it will be five dollars a week with board i will take it said bert promptly can i have possession at once yes let me show you the way the room was on the third floor it was a small one but would answer the purpose bert took out his clothes and laid them away in the pine bureau near the window well he said as he waited for the bell to summon him to supper i have taken the first step toward finding ralph harding i am occupying the room which was once his what shall be the next step he little anticipated the singular experience that same evening had in store for him chapter xxvii a boardinghouse in harrisburg at the supper table bert made acquaintance with his fellowboarders there were eight in all three of them worked in the shoe factory where ralph harding had been employed two young ladies were saleswomen in a drygoods store professor silvio and wife taught a dancing school and the eighth was the landladys daughter a young woman of twentyfive who resembled mrs stubbs closely bert learned afterward that she was employed in a millinery store gentlemen and ladies said mrs stubbs as bert took the vacant chair that had been assigned to him let me introduce a new boarder mr barton eight pairs of curious eyes were fixed upon bert and he blushed a little not being accustomed to the scrutiny of strangers he is a friend of a former boarder mr harding whom some of you will remember have you heard from mr harding lately mr barton asked angelica stubbs who sat next to our hero no answered bert he left quite suddenly owing me eight weeks board so i heard do you think he will ever pay it up if i succeed in finding him i think there is some chance of it mr harding and i were very good friends continued miss stubbs he in fact showed quite a fondness for my society she added casting down her eyes modestly no wonder said bert smiling oh you sad flatterer said miss angelica appearing pleased at what she regarded as a compliment didnt he tell you where he was going asked bert no i think he was called away by bad news what sort of a looking man was he bert inquired you ask me that said angelica in surprise i thought you were a friend of his i never saw him in my life thats funny why then did ma introduce you as a friend of his she thought me so i am interested in finding him that is all you are not a horrid detective i hope has poor mr harding committed a crime oh tell me quick you actually make me creep all over i dont mean any harm but his testimony is wanted in a law case you havent told me about his appearance yet ive got his photograph and will show it to you after supper oh thank you said bert much pleased that is if you are sure it wont do him any harm he used to talk to me very confidentially and i cant help liking him even if he did get in debt to ma perhaps he was unfortunate and couldnt pay thats what i tell ma but mas rather severe on boarders that go away without paying her did he take all his baggage with him miss stubbs he left behind a box of books and papers they werent of much account some old letters and such did your mother preserve them asked bert eagerly yes i believe so but she would have preferred to have him leave his trunk that might have been sold for a part of his board bill do you think i could look over the books and papers asked bert what for inquired angelica her face expressing curiosity you know i want to find him and some of the papers might throw light on his movements i dont know but you could answered angelica indifferently ill be willing to pay your mother one weeks board for the box and its contents then i am sure she will let you have them they are worth nothing to her i only wonder she hasnt used them to kindle the fire with before now i hope she hasnt returned bert anxiously no i know she hasnt for i saw them in the attic only last week ill look them up for you some day when i am at leisure thank you i wonder mr harding hasnt written to you he said a little later oh go along you dont suppose there was anything between me and him said angelica who liked nothing better than to be teased about the attentions of members of the other sex bert was sharp enough to see this and thought he might make it available in promoting the object he had in view i thought perhaps he had gone away because you didnt smile upon his suit miss angelica laughed and tossed her head in great delight as if i would tell you she said i only hope he hasnt committed suicide oh mr barton how can you really i shall have to complain to ma all this was very amusing to bert who had a natural love of fun and quite understood angelica by this time though truth to tell she was not difficult to read when supper was over miss stubbs said graciously mr barton if you are not pressed for time will you linger a while i play a little on the piano and if you are fond of music i will play for you usually i have to be in the store but this is my evening off i shall be glad to stay miss stubbs i am fond of music mr harding often lingered with me in the evening hours he liked to hear me play as i no doubt shall do you sing mr barton no i wish i did miss angelicas piano was probably twentyfive years old and was very much out of tune but even if it had been a chickering grand her playing would hardly have captivated a musical ear she had little taste and the lessons she had taken had only given her the ability to play a few easy tunes bert found half an hour of miss angelicas music and society all he cared to enjoy at one time he therefore excused himself and taking his hat went out for a walk as he was a stranger in harrisburg he was not particular in what direction he strolled but naturally bent his steps toward what appeared to be the central part of the city as he sauntered along his attention was attracted to a flaring poster on a dead wall setting forth the attractive features of the streets of gotham a realistic play of new york life as given by a star combination of worldrenowned actors for one week only reserved seats cents balcony cents now bert had seldom enjoyed an opportunity of attending a dramatic performance and felt strongly tempted to avail himself of the one that now offered he wished to be as economical as possible and decided to content himself with a seat in the balcony where is the theatre he asked of a boy who was studying the bill at the same time with himself just round the corner ill show you was the reply thank you are you goin to see de play asked the boy with interest i think i shall id go myself if i had another nickel said the young guide ive got ten cents but i thought twentyfive cents was the lowest price i can go to de gallery for fifteen cents de gallery is good enough for me if a nickel will help you here is one thank you said the boy its a boss play dey tell me i hope it is as i am going myself the theatre was near at hand and the two boys soon stood before it it was rather early being only a quarter past seven but a small crowd of boys was already waiting for a chance to obtain admission to the gallery there seemed to be no hurry about buying a ticket and bert took a standing position near the box office surveying with interest the passers by all at once he felt a hand on his shoulder and these words fell upon his ear we meet again my dear boy shake bert immediately recognized his travelling friend who had lost his money on the train are you one of the dramatic company he asked yes i play the leading villain and am acting stage manager my name is orville jack orville you have heard of me i have always lived in the country said bert apologetically and so have little acquaintance with actors orville looked disappointed he liked to be known and recognized that accounts for it he said i am surprised to hear that you are from the country you have the city air bert was pleased to hear it though perhaps that might be a mark of weakness at the moment another man came up hurriedly and spoke to orville heres a pretty kettle of fish orville he said bob hazleton is sick and insists upon going back to new york where shall we find a boy to take his place orville had an inspiration he clapped his hand on berts shoulder exclaiming here he stands chapter xxviii berts first appearance on any stage bert eyed the actor with amazement rather disposed to doubt his sanity do you mean me he said certainly has he ever acted asked pearson the second actor doubtfully no but he can act ill undertake to train him there isnt much time hazleton cant appear tonight dont worry ill see that he is not missed as pearson went away orville said youll help us out wont you my boy what do you want me to do asked bert his heart beating with excitement take the part of a newsboy youve seen and heard them in the streets of new york havent you yes but it seems sudden i should have to learn the part all told there are not more than twenty lines and you wont come on till the second act youve spoken pieces havent you yes and i like it i was sure of it then you accept if you think i can do it and will tell me exactly what to do come round at once to the stage entrance i will give you your lines and tell you the business well speak about terms later as bert followed orville round to the stage door he asked himself whether he was not acting foolishly in accepting at such short notice a position to which he was entirely unaccustomed if he had not liked declamation and felt moderately selfpossessed before an audience he would have promptly refused as it was the prospect while it somewhat daunted also pleased him besides he saw that though he might not be able to fill the place of bob hazleton it was imperatively necessary that the part should be taken by some one and there was no time to lose in hunting up another boy if he did poorly he could limit his engagement to one evening he was not at home behind the scenes and at the outset came near tumbling through a trap door he followed orville to the general dressingroom where the manager assisted him to attire himself in the costume provided for the newsboy it is needless to say that it was not of a costly description and would have been dear at a dollar and a half ill dress you first and give you the lines afterward in five minutes bert surveyed himself in a cracked mirror and wondered if he were the same boy orville ruffled up his hair taught him the free and easy walk of the typical newsboy briefly instructed him in the business of the part and then gave him his lines to commit read them to me he said i want to see if youve caught the spirit of the part of course bert needed a little coaching but caught on as orville expressed it with remarkable quickness after a few minutes rehearsal his teacher said youll do that is if you dont get rattled whats that get an attack of stage fright and forget your lines i wont do that said bert confidently then youll have no trouble now stay here till you get a summons from the call boy i must make up for my part though i dont appear either till the second act remember that we rely upon you ill get through said bert confidently by this time our hero looked forward eagerly to the moment when he would appear on the stage he felt excited and yearned to distinguish himself he wanted to justify the stage managers hasty and it must be confessed rather imprudent choice he waited in the wings till he heard the call boys summons and then made his entrance as instructed by orville he glanced at the audience but only got a confused impression of hundreds of faces he did not allow himself to think of them but addressed himself to the business of his part a part of this was to rescue a little girl from the abuse of a tyrannical old woman he recited his lines with spirit and so enlisted the sympathies of those present by his manly bearing that he received a tribute of applause the scene came just at the close of the second act and when the curtain fell there was prolonged handclapping bert did not know what it meant but orville came up to him and said go before the curtain leading maud by the hand bow to the audience bert was a little bewildered but followed directions the corner of the curtain was moved aside and bert walked across the stage leading little maud who was a daughter of the leading actress by the hand children are always well received and there was plenty of applause when bert reappeared behind the scenes orville said barton you did yourself proud keep it up when you appear again in the fourth act and you may consider yourself an actor in the fourth and last act bert went on the stage in his street dress his circumstances and his social position were supposed to have improved at the close of the performance orville introduced bert to the different members of the company do you mean to say you have never acted before asked mr pearson this is my first appearance on any stage said bert with a smile then you have done yourself great credit i was myself trained at wallacks theatre but had been a year on the boards before i could acquit myself as well as you thank you i have done better than i expected you more than filled hazletons place has he been long with you a year bert felt this was indeed praise that on his first appearance he should have equaled a boy with a years experience of course you will play with us the balance of the week said pearson if you wish me to do so what salary will you expect bert smiled i hardly know what will be a fair price to ask we will give you the same salary that hazleton received fifteen dollars a week and you pay your own board is that satisfactory bert opened his eyes fifteen dollars a week seemed to him a large sum for evening work he found afterward that he was expected to appear at rehearsal but even with this additional duty the post appeared to him an easy one i accept the terms he said all right where are you boarding he gave the address please be at the theatre tomorrow at ten and mr pearson will hear you rehearse and give you a few points unknown to bert there were two persons present at the theatre that night who recognized him one of the male boarders prompted by a rather significant hint from miss angelica had invited that young lady to accompany him to the performance they sat in the sixth row from the stage though bert who attended only to his duties did not see them when he first came on as a newsboy miss stubbs said how much that newsboy looks like mr barton mas new boarder he does look some like him but of course it isnt he i wonder if he is here this evening i dont see him anywhere said the escort when bert appeared in his own clothes in the fourth act angelica exclaimed why it is mr barton after all is it possible that i know a live actor why i was talking to him at supper and he was really quite attentive to me he is put down on the bill as bob hazleton said the young man consulting the programme that must be his stage name i will get him to tell me all about acting tomorrow do you know mr cutting i should like to go on the stage myself i should so like to play juliet if you do will you let me be romeo yes if you desire it said angelica tapping her escort coquettishly with her fan its safe to say that mr cutting who was barely five feet in height and miss angelica who was tall thin and angular would have made a very remarkable romeo and juliet as bert left the stage door a boy touched his arm looking round he saw that it was the one who had guided him to the theatre the boys face wore a respectful look as he said say you didnt tell me you was one of de actors i didnt know it myself answered bert it was you that took off de newsboy continued the boy yes but im not the regular actor hes sick and i took his place it was tiptop are you goin to act tomorrow night i shall act all this week id like to see de play again its a boss play bert felt in a liberal mood here is fifteen cents he said tell your friends to come ill bring em ill tell em i know one of de actors it may be remarked that tom roach for this was the boys name gave such glowing accounts of the play to his intimate friends that no less than ten of them accompanied him to the theatre the next evening and were especially enthusiastic when bert was on the stage their liberal applause raised bert in the good opinion of the management who felt that they had secured a prize in the new actor chapter xxix bert secures a box of mr hardings papers when our hero went down to breakfast next morning he found himself the observed of all observers miss angelica stubbs and her escort had already made known that he was a member of the dramatic company and as none of the boarders had ever before met a live actor all felt great curiosity and a desire to become acquainted with so distinguished a public character as he took his seat beside miss stubbs she said i saw you on the stage last evening mr barton did you i was not aware that you were in the house why didnt you tell me that you were an actor ive got a bone to pick with you i didnt know it myself miss stubbs you mean to say you didnt play the newsboy oh mr barton yes but when i left the house i had no idea of playing it so happened that the young actor who usually takes the part bob hazleton was sick and i was applied to by the manager to take his place then he knew you were an actor no i only fell in with him on the train from new york why you acted just as if you were used to it i am glad you think so i hardly dared to accept the part will you play the rest of the week i have agreed to do so hazleton goes home today how nice i must go again i take that as a compliment cant you actors take your friends in free asked angelica whose rule was to make all she could out of her acquaintances i havent been an actor long enough to find out i should consider it such a favor i would get all my friends to go on the same terms asked bert with a smile no they can pay bert did secure a complimentary ticket for miss stubbs who boasted everywhere that she was intimately acquainted with one of the leading actors in the streets of gotham and that he was really very attentive to her what would my friends at lakeville say if they knew my new business thought bert i should be glad if percy marlowe could see me on the stage he determined however not to say anything in his letters about this new engagement for though he had been successful thus far his success and popularity might not last did you see the notice of your play in the morning paper mr barton asked miss angelica no i havent seen the paper yet it speaks of one of the actors i wont say who continued miss stubbs nodding playfully do you mean me asked bert in excitement yes here it is bert ran his eye hastily over the notice which occupied a quarter of a column this is the portion that most interested him the part of the newsboy was effectively taken by mr bert barton who was engaged at the last moment to fill the place of mr hazleton his acting was spirited and the fact that it was liked was shown by the hearty call before the curtain at the end of the second act the management are fortunate in securing so good a substitute for bob hazleton berts face showed his gratification it almost seemed a dream to him that he had really appeared on the stage and he was glad that he had given satisfaction at ten oclock he reported at the stage entrance where he was met by mr pearson who was associate manager he went through a rehearsal which enabled him to look forward with more confidence to a repetition of the part the afternoon he had to himself and a part of this he spent in trying to find out what he could about ralph harding he learned that harding had been employed in the shoe factory of benedict co two of mrs stubbss boarders worked at the same place but neither had been intimate with harding bert learned that he was looked upon as a rolling stone never content to remain long in one place he had been employed less than six months at the benedict shop when without assigning any reason he gave notice that he wanted to leave what sort of a man is he asked bert he is restless and at times gloomy answered blanchard to whom he had put the question i worked next to him but he seldom made any conversation with me was he a good workman excellent but he evidently did not like the business he often lamented that he had not the means of getting out of it have you any idea where he went when he left harrisburg from what i have heard him say i think it probable that he went to some western town or city you have not heard from him since he left harrisburg no he was not likely to correspond with me i doubt if he was intimate enough with any one here to do so except possibly with miss stubbs added blanchard with a smile she tells me mr harding paid her a good deal of attention it is more probable that miss stubbs paid him a good deal of attention at present you are her favorite i dont want to interfere with you mr blanchard said bert much amused i cant undertake to compete with an actor mr barton i cant get over my surprise at being called an actor however as long as it pays me better than anything else i dont object the next day mrs stubbs intercepted bert as he was leaving the house my daughter tells me she said that you are willing to pay four dollars for the papers which mr harding left behind him yes answered bert eagerly i dont see why i shouldnt sell them i cant afford to lose eight weeks board quite true mrs stubbs i dont see why they wont be just as safe in my hands as in yours you dont want to do mr harding any harm though i dont know why i should think of that after the way he has served me instead of that mrs stubbs i can assure you that it will be money in his pocket if through his papers i am able to find him and in that case you will try to get him to pay his honest debts i will mrs stubbs then mr barton if you will come up to the attic i will hand you the papers bert gladly followed mrs stubbs upstairs and was shown on the attic floor a wooden box about half full of old letters and other papers the box certainly did not look very valuable and bert said so i wouldnt have kept it said the landlady if i could have got hold of his trunk but he got the start of me and it was in the hands of an expressman before i knew that he was going to move i was downstairs in the basement when mr harding took the expressman upstairs and the trunk was brought down and put in his wagon before i knew what was going on mr harding didnt even say goodby and i havent seen or heard of him from that day to this well mrs stubbs here are your four dollars and i hope you will some day get the balance of the debt bert carried the box downstairs and into his room where he proceeded to examine the contents among which he was destined to come across a document of considerable interest to him chapter xxx bert obtains an important clew mr harding was not a literary man and his papers would hardly have been of any value to a publisher they consisted principally of letters some of them ten years old it seemed to have been a habit of ralph harding to keep his letters though he probably set no great value upon them bert opened fifteen or twenty and glanced over them only to find that they related to matters in which he felt no interest whatever he began to doubt whether they were even worth the small sum he had paid for them when all at once he made a discovery he found a letter dated lakeville who can have written him from lakeville he asked himself and naturally turned the page to read the signature his heart beat quickly when he read the name of the writer albert marlowe it was dated about two years previous and ran as follows dear sir i have received your letter and am surprised that you should have the boldness to write to me for money i am sorry to hear that you have been in bad luck but i presume it is your own fault you are able to earn good wages and ought to pay your own way without depending on anybody look at me i was once a common workman like you but thanks to my energy and enterprise i am now the owner of a large factory and able to live in comparative luxury i dont know why you should expect me to support you i have a family of my own to care for and my first duty is to them you intimate that you are in possession of a secret which if made known will injure me i suppose i know what you mean i dont think however that you will find any one to believe what you may say to my disadvantage and i warn you to be careful what you do or i may testify that you yourself took the missing bonds dont trouble yourself to write to me again for it will be time thrown away albert marlowe underneath the signature were a few lines evidently written by ralph harding who would believe that the writer of this letter is a thief and that the capital on which he started in business was stolen i bitterly repent that i was induced to join in the plot against poor barton he poor fellow is in exile afraid to return to his own country while the man who committed the crime which has shadowed his life is rich and prosperous and holds up his head in society and i miserable tool that i was by my testimony helped him to fasten the crime on an innocent man i dont know whether it will do any good to write again i am a poor man and albert marlowe is rich he will defy me and perhaps swear that i was implicated in the robbery myself so i was alas for i accepted a bribe of two hundred dollars for my part in the matter i wish i could see poor barton righted bert read this letter with flushed face and beating heart here was proof positive that his father was innocent and albert marlowe the rich manufacturer the magnate of lakeville was guilty not only of robbery but what was even more contemptible had schemed successfully to throw the guilt upon an innocent man the husband of his cousin through him john barton had suffered a tenyears exile and had been deprived for that time of his good name and the society of his family i wouldnt take a thousand dollars for this letter said bert to himself in exultation i dont know what it amounts to in the eyes of the law but i am sure it is valuable now if i could only find ralph harding himself bert continued his search among the letters and finally found one postmarked peoria illinois which appeared to have been received by ralph harding about a week before he left harrisburg this is an extract therefrom it is five years since i have seen you this is a long separation considering that we two are the only ones left of the family if you are in your old business as i infer from your letter why cant you get work just as well here in peoria as in harrisburg there is a large shop here where i think you would not have any difficulty in securing employment i presume as good wages are paid here as at the east we have a small room which you could occupy and it would be pleasant for a brother and sister who have been so long separated to find themselves under the same roof my husband is a carpenter as you know his earnings are not large and he doesnt always have work but we have a little sum saved up which we can fall back upon in time of need i cant lend you any money and indeed you ought not to expect it as you are a single man and have no one to take care of but yourself i am afraid you are not a very good manager come to peoria and i will see if i cant help you save money consider what a position you would be in if you should fall sick your affectionate sister helen clifton underneath in ralph hardings handwriting was this brief indorsement all true every word of it helen was always prudent and a good manager it is true as she says that there are but two of us why shouldnt i go to peoria and see her there was no more but as ralph harding a week later left harrisburg it seemed fair to infer that he had adopted his own halfexpressed intention and gone to peoria to see his sister especially as there seemed a good chance of his obtaining work there in his own line peoria repeated bert thoughtfully the chances are that ralph harding went there from harrisburg and it is very probable that he is there now i wish i could find some one that could tell me about the place mr pearson he said when he met the associate manager at rehearsal can you tell me anything about peoria yes answered the actor what do you want to know about it how large a place is it about the size of harrisburg i dont believe there is a thousand difference in the population is it far from here a matter of six or seven hundred miles i should think perhaps a little more it is southeast of chicago why do you want to know i want to find a man who i have reason to think is now living there i may have to leave the company as it is very important for me to find this man there will be no occasion for you to leave the company when we leave harrisburg we jump to chicago and probably three weeks from now we shall be playing in peoria it is on our list of places and is a very good city for a short engagement will that be soon enough bert hesitated if he remained with the company his expenses would be paid out to peoria and he would be earning fifteen dollars a week besides come now dont hesitate said mr pearson we shouldnt know how to get along without you naturally this pleased bert and helped to fix his resolution i dont know but i can wait two or three weeks he said slowly if you are sure we shall play at peoria i am certain of it the route was made up this morning we are having some new bills printed in which your name is substituted for that of bob hazleton so you see my boy you will be getting a reputation under your own colors this had its effect for bert felt that he should like to have a bill of the play in which his own name appeared otherwise he might find his friends incredulous as to his having actually been upon the stage later in the day he gave his promise that he would go with the company when they left harrisburg but would not sign an engagement for any definite time as he did not wish to put any obstacle in the way of his following any clew that might lead to the discovery of harding well mr barton said mrs stubbs after supper did you find anything of value in that box of papers yes i obtained some information that will probably be of value besides it gave me a clew to his present residence indeed said angelica who was present where is he in peoria illinois he has a married sister living there shall you go out west to find him i expect to go with the company they will play an engagement in peoria if you see mr harding please remember me to him say that is you may hint that i still think of him with interest and and hope he will some day return to us that message ought to bring him miss angelica of course i only think of him as a friend but we were very congenial and it is not often that one meets a congenial spirit why not send a letter to mr harding by me i that is mamma do you think it would be proper asked angelica with bashful hesitation i dont know why not answered mrs stubbs promptly you might ask in the letter when it will be convenient for him to pay his board bill oh ma how unromantic it may not be romantic angelica but its business said the practical mother miss stubbs did write the letter but it is certain she did not mention the board bill in it chapter xxxi squire marlowe is surprised it may be well to return to lakeville as something has occurred there which deserves to be recorded it is needless to say that mrs barton missed bert whose bright and cheerful presence had filled the little house with comfort and gladdened his mothers heart still she knew that he was well and heard from him every week though bert only detailed his experiences in general terms not caring to raise expectations which perhaps might prove illusive berts absence from lakeville excited some surprise and speculation squire marlowe to whom it had been mentioned by percy stopped mrs barton in the street one day and said percy tells me that your son is away yes where is he he went to new york is he at work there no he is travelling travelling what do you mean uncle jacob has sent him off on some mission he is at harrisburg i believe that is very strange remarked the squire arching his eyebrows what possible mission can jacob have for the boy he doesnt write particulars but his expenses are paid i dont see how jacob marlowe with his paltry twelve dollars a week can make such arrangements nor i but probably uncle jacob has interested his employer in bert it may be so but i think it very unwise to send off a boy by himself what judgment has he or what can he do i dont very well know he seems to enjoy the trip of course but it will spoil him for solid work he had better have stayed at home what encouragement was there for him to stay in lakeville if you had not discharged him he would be here now if you will take him back into the factory i will write him to that effect and perhaps it will induce him to return ahem i will think of it does he send you any money not yet then how do you live without calling upon you albert said mrs barton with a little tinge of bitterness i hardly think you feel enough interest in me to care how i live albert marlowe was somewhat embarrassed and regretted that he had asked the question mrs barton might take it into her head that he was willing to contribute to her support and this was far from being the case women look at things from a peculiar point of view he said of course i wish you well and for that reason regret that you are so injudicious in your management of bert i have no fear but that bert will turn out well rejoined mrs barton proudly ahem i hope so though that twentydollar affair led me to fear that he had inherited loose ideas about honesty what do you mean demanded mrs barton her cheeks aflame with indignation i shouldnt think you would need to ask of course we both know why mr barton is an exile unable to return home yes albert marlowe we do know he is an innocent man suffering for the crime of another that is what he says is it sneered the squire that might be expected because it is true but albert marlowe i have good hopes that his innocence may be vindicated and the real criminal brought to light her intense gaze made the squire uncomfortable did she mean anything he asked himself it is natural for you to take the most favorable view of the matter he said but your hope is hardly likely to be realized goodmorning mrs barton looked after him and her spirit rose in revolt against the inequalities of fortune here was the real criminal as she fully believed rich prosperous enjoying a high social position while her poor husband the scapegoat for anothers offense was an exile from home the next day squire marlowe went to new york on business he occasionally visited wall street and now and then made an investment he looked the embodiment of dignity and respectability with his ample figure fine broadcloth suit and goldrimmed eyeglasses and might readily have been taken for a prosperous and wealthy city banker about one oclock he entered an expensive restaurant a stones throw from broadway and taking up the bill of fare made a selection of dishes for his dinner as he did so he said to himself with a comfortable smile when i was a common workman in a shoe shop how little did i think that i should ever be able to sit down in a restaurant like this and pay a dollar and a half for my dinner why i didnt earn much more than that by a days labor here i am surrounded by brokers bankers and wealthy merchants and quite as good as they the thought led squire marlowe to look around him what he saw almost paralyzed him with surprise there at a neighboring table sat uncle jacob enjoying a luxurious dinner the cost of which the squire with the bill of fare before him estimated must come to a high figure can that be uncle jacob albert marlowe asked himself in amazement how on earth can a clerk on twelve dollars a week salary afford to dine at a restaurant like this as he had not yet given his order he moved over to the table occupied by uncle jacob and took a seat opposite him albert marlowe exclaimed the old man recognizing him with surprise yes uncle jacob it is i but what on earth brings you here i should think it was pretty evident said jacob marlowe with a smile i came in for my dinner yes but do you usually come here not always perhaps half the time i make my heartiest meal of the day at this time unlike most new yorkers and like it to be a good one of course but how can you afford to eat here didnt you say that your salary was twelve dollars a week i think i said so you are spending at that rate for your dinners alone i dont understand how you can do it i am an old man albert i cant live many years and i think it sensible to get as much comfort out of life as possible for my few remaining years still i had a little money you know five hundred dollars and i have managed to turn it to good account so that i dont feel quite so cramped as when i was at lakeville the old mans been speculating thought albert marlowe and he has had a stroke of luck but hes a fool to think he can live like a banker on the strength of that very likely his next venture will sweep away his small amount of capital well if he comes to grief he neednt apply to me henceforth i wash my hands of him and his affairs altogether of course its your own lookout he said but to me you seem recklessly extravagant because i come in here well perhaps so when i find i cant afford it ill go to a cheaper place have you seen mary barton lately yes she is well by the way what have you done with her boy he is traveling so i heard it seems to me a very foolish proceeding who is paying his expenses himself is he working then asked the squire in surprise yes he is a member of the streets of gotham company and is earning his living as an actor what does he know about acting asked the squire in amazement it appears that he is giving satisfaction he sent me a paper containing a highly commendatory notice of his first appearance it wont last said albert marlowe his wish being father to the thought when he returned to lakeville that evening he carried with him two pieces of news first that uncle jacob was living in luxury and secondly that bert barton was on the stage if he can act i can said percy jealously they must have been hard up for an actor when they took bert barton a boy brought up in a country town never been to a theatre in his life before pooh i dare say he appeared for one night only the idea of mary bartons son acting before a regular audience a boy who has hoed corn for farmer wilson chapter xxxii hiram french of chicago from harrisburg the dramatic company with which bert was connected went directly to chicago we dont like to make such long jumps said mr pearson with whom bert had become quite friendly but we could secure hooleys theatre this week and no other were you ever in chicago no answered bert i have never traveled much i suppose you have yes i went out to san francisco last year with the silver king you will find chicago a pleasant city are the hotels dear no only moderate in price the theatrical people get a discount you know i think i should rather live in a boarding house that will be cheaper i dont mind going with you to keep you company do you know of any good house i know a very comfortable boardinghouse on monroe street kept by mrs shelby a widow lady my sister once boarded there when visiting chicago that will suit me i think would you mind going round with me ill take you there with pleasure the two on arriving in chicago went at once to monroe street and called at the boardinghouse i am glad to see you mr pearson said the widow cordially is your sister with you not this time are you going to play here yes i shall appear at hooleys theatre all next week is that young gentleman your brother no he is one of our actors mr bert barton he looks young for an actor said the landlady surprised i appeared on the stage when i was only twelve but we have come on business mrs shelby have you a vacant room yes i had one vacated yesterday suppose mr barton and myself take it for a week i shall be glad to have you i cant afford to have my rooms remain vacant what will be your terms six dollars each including board is that satisfactory bert asked pearson quite so mr pearson then we will take possession i hope it is almost time for a meal mrs shelby i am almost famished you will only have to wait an hour i will show you to your rooms and then i must be excused as my presence is required downstairs the room shown by the landlady was of fair size and neatly furnished bert looked about him in satisfaction i would rather be here than at a hotel he said so would i as long as i have a companion returned mr pearson besides i shall be saving from four to five dollars a week i ought to pay more than half of it as i am receiving a considerably higher salary than you no mr pearson i prefer to pay my share but for you i should be paying more at a hotel bert felt a little diffidence in appearing before a chicago audience he had to be sure been favorably received in harrisburg but he had an idea that in a larger city it would be more difficult to achieve success the first night undeceived him he received a liberal share of applause and was called before the curtain i congratulate you bert said mr pearson you seem to have made yourself solid with the audience i am glad that i give satisfaction returned bert it will encourage me to do better you had better adopt the profession of an actor continued his friend bert shook his head i prefer to enter a business of some kind he said though i have succeeded in one part i am not sure that i should succeed in others bert was about leaving the theatre that night when the call boy brought him a card there is a gentleman at the door would like to see you he said bert glanced at the card and found it bore the name of hiram french it was a name he had never before heard and when he reached the door he looked inquiringly at the middleaged gentleman who stood before him you are young barton said the visitor yes that is my name are you the son of john barton who once worked in the shoe factory of weeks brothers yes sir answered bert coloring for he knew that the stranger must be aware that his father was resting under a criminal charge i thought i could not be mistaken you look as your father did at your age then you knew my father as a boy said bert eagerly i was a schoolmate of his later on i was employed in the same factory with him that of weeks brothers did you know under what circumstances he left the factory asked bert with some embarrassment yes i knew all about it but i want you to come home and pass the night at my house and we will talk over that and other matters thank you sir i will give notice to a friend who rooms with me bert found mr pearson and informed him that he would absent himself for one night from mrs shelbys boardinghouse then he returned to mr french i live on indiana avenue explained the latter we shall find a car at the corner of state and madison streets as they walked to the car berts new friend asked how long have you been on the stage mr barton only two weeks you dont mean that that comprises your whole experience yes i stepped in at harrisburg to supply the place of a young actor who was taken sick you act as if you had been trained to it but how came you to be at harrisburg that is not your home no as you were my fathers friend i will tell you what brought me out there bert briefly related the story that is already known to the reader hiram french listened with great attention i remember ralph harding he said he was not popular among his shopmates especially after his agency in throwing suspicion upon your father was it generally thought that my father was guilty asked bert no while circumstances were strong against him no one could believe that a man whose reputation for integrity was as high as your fathers would be guilty of stealing but the good will of his associates could not help him did you know mr marlowe albert marlowe yes was he well liked not by me he was far from being as highly respected as your father yet he has prospered he is the owner of a factory in lakeville and is considered worth thirty thousand dollars i am surprised to hear it when i knew him he was always in debt if he really took the bonds charged upon my father that would account for his start in business exactly so now that i think of it two or three days after the theft i saw him and ralph harding walking together apparently engaged in earnest conversation they evidently had a good understanding with each other i believe you are on the right track and i heartily hope you will succeed in making your fathers innocence evident to the world john barton was my favorite friend and i hope some day to see him in chicago are you in business here mr french yes i am in the old line like albert marlowe i am the owner of a large shoe factory and i am worth i should say considerably more money hiram french occupied a handsome house on indiana avenue furnished with taste and was as his style of living showed in easy circumstances he introduced bert to his wife and daughter who seemed at once drawn to the young actor when he left the house the next morning after breakfast he was urgently invited to call again during his stay and partially promised to do so but he was in haste to reach peoria for there it was he hoped to find a witness that would vindicate his fathers name and fame chapter xxxiii a late arrival at mrs bartons cottage one evening about eight oclock mrs barton was sewing in her little sittingroom when an unusual feeling of loneliness overcame her circumstances had separated her from her husband and her only son was hundreds of miles away why she asked herself can i not fare as well as other wives and mothers i am a wife yet i cannot enjoy my husbands society fortunately i am not likely long to be separated from bert if he only succeeds in his mission and comes home able to vindicate the fame of his father and restore him to me i shall be perfectly happy she felt unusually restless and found it difficult to keep on with her work i feel as if something were going to happen i hope no misfortune is impending over me she had hardly spoken when the door bell rang it is some neighbor come to make a call she thought i am glad of it for i am not in the mood for work she rose and opened the door she started back in surprise when in her visitors she recognized uncle jacob and leaning upon his arm the husband of whom she had just been thinking may we come in asked uncle jacob cheerily surely but has anything happened only this that your husband is sick and has come here to be nursed back to health by my advice but is it safe i think so the fact is bert has made an important discovery and is likely to make more we are in a fair way to prove your husbands innocence and put the guilt where it belongs and where does it belong the man who stole the bonds we have every reason to believe is albert marlowe i do not wish to get him into trouble but if it is necessary in order to vindicate my husbands reputation i will not object albert marlowe has been a cruel enemy to you and your family said jacob marlowe sternly he is entitled to no consideration the past ten years cannot be recalled but i think that we shall be able to provide a brighter future for yourself and mr barton the first thing to do is to get him well what is the matter with you john asked mrs barton now for the first time noting with alarm her husbands pale face the doctor says my system is run down and that i need time to recuperate i was living in a boardinghouse in montreal and the prospect of being sick there was too much for me i wanted my wife to take care of me and taking the first train to new york i consulted uncle jacob as to whether it would be safe in the light of berts discoveries he told me to take the risk so here i am may i stay do you need to ask that said mrs barton with an affectionate glance at her husband there is no place where you have a better right to be then as she thought of her scanty means a momentary look of anxiety overspread her face lest she should not be able to provide him with the medicines and nourishing food that he required uncle jacob who was a keen observer read her thoughts and reassured her by saying mr barton is provided with what money may be required for at least a month and after that time i think some more can be found but uncle jacob i cannot consent to impose upon your liberality any further you have but a small sum of money yourself what would happen to you if you should fall sick i think i should follow your husbands example and come here to be nursed back to health replied uncle jacob what am i to say to the neighbors for they will be sure to inquire say that you are taking care of a sick gentleman from new york it will not do to give his real name no call me mr robinson as you did on my former visit said mr barton now that this matter is arranged can you take care of us both tonight asked uncle jacob yes there is berts room then i will trespass upon your hospitality for one night cant you stay longer uncle jacob no i must get back to business i must not run any risk of losing my situation you know to be sure not said mrs barton earnestly do you like your employer uncle jacob i have no reason to complain of him answered the old man with a smile he lets me do about as i please you were very lucky in getting in with him as you say i am in good luck but i think i ought to get higher pay it seems to me twelve dollars a week is a very good salary said mrs barton soberly you could save something out of that if you were not so generous i must think seriously of that mary if i get mean and closefisted you mustnt be surprised it will be only because i follow your advice you can never become mean or closefisted uncle jacob it isnt in your nature to be either but i hope you will be reasonably economical and not give away so much money to others you are a good little woman mary said uncle jacob feelingly if you are ever blessed with means you will do just as you advise me not to do dont be worried about me mary god loves a cheerful giver you know and whatever i give to you is cheerfully given an hour was spent in conversation and then as mr barton showed fatigue he and uncle jacob retired to bed and mrs barton mixed some flour so as to be able to give her guests warm biscuits in the morning for she remembered that her husband had been very fond of them in former years the next morning after breakfast uncle jacob took his departure i leave you in good hands john he said to mr barton now get well as fast as you can there is one thing that will make me well said barton and that is vindication from the false charge that has darkened my life and destroyed my happiness during the last ten years that is coming and coming soon said uncle jacob only be patient a little while bert has already made a discovery that makes it clear who is the real criminal i hope he will never suffer as i have done said the sick man you have a more christian spirit than i john i think it only right that he should suffer for the wrong he has done you well goodby let me hear from you and if bert makes any further progress in his mission i will apprise you and mary uncle jacob left the village without being seen by albert marlowe or percy who alone were likely to recognize him but it leaked out that mrs barton had a boarder percy being the first to hear of it what do you think papa he said one day bert bartons mother has taken a boarder from the city a boarder from the city repeated squire marlowe surprised yes what brought him to lakeville i dont know i can tell you who brought him here who then uncle jacob has he been here then yes he came in the evening and went back the next morning i wonder he did not call upon us said the squire thoughtfully its no great loss if he didnt returned percy pertly he would probably want to borrow money no he appears to be doing very well in the city that is for him but what could induce a gentleman from the city to come here to lakeville to board in a humble cottage i hear he is in poor health said percy have you seen him do you know what his appearance is yes i saw him sitting at mrs bartons window he is of dark complexion and has dark hair then he seemed to have a high forehead squire marlowe started in surprise dark complexion dark hair a high forehead is it possible that it can be who father asked percy curiously never mind my son some one whom i used to know answers to that description as percy went out albert marlowe said to himself if it should be he what shall i do about it it is not for my interest that he should remain in lakeville i might denounce him to the authorities but i would warn him first then if he still lingers he must take the consequences chapter xxxiv bert interviews hardings sister the next week bert found himself in peoria his heart beat with excitement for here he hoped he would attain the object he had in view the first day he was occupied in obtaining a boarding place and in matters connected with the play he understood his duty to his employers and eager as he was to seek out ralph harding he waited till he could do so without intrenching upon their time after considerable inquiry he found himself standing in front of a neatlooking frame house of two stories in a quiet street the plate on the front door bore the name clifton bert rang the bell the door was opened by a girl about twelve years of age is mrs clifton at home asked bert yes sir wont you walk in she led the way into a tiny parlor so small that the owner would have found it difficult to give a fashionable party or indeed any party at all sit down here said the young girl pointing to a rockingchair and i will call ma bert took a seat and was startled a minute later by a hoarse voice saying with much energy get out you tramp he looked around the room in angry amazement but could see no one directly afterward he heard a discordant laugh and guided by the sound looked up to see that it proceeded from a green parrot in a cage above his head bert smiled it was impossible for him to be angry with a parrot however impolite the bird might be just then a lady entered the room a lady of middle size and middle age plain in feature but not unpleasant to look upon did you wish to see me sir she asked are you the sister of ralph harding asked bert the womans face changed instantly yes she answered eagerly do you bring me any news of him he is not in trouble is he it was berts turn to be surprised i thought he was staying with you he said not now but he has been here he came here from harrisburg didnt he yes and he was here till three weeks ago then he came home from the shop where he was at work and told me he was going away did he tell you where he was going asked bert eagerly he said he should go to chicago first but i have not heard from him since he went away ralph harding then was in chicago if bert had only known that he would have remained there and prosecuted the search in the lake city yet what chance would he have of finding a man whom he had never seen and would not know by sight in so large and populous a place his face showed the keenness of his disappointment and mrs clifton was led to inquire did you wish to see my brother on business of importance of importance to me yes is it she asked with hesitation likely to get ralph into trouble no madam on the contrary if i find him it will be of advantage to him then i hope you may find him but i am afraid it will be difficult ralph is very restless we tried all we could to keep him here but it was of no use he had a good place and though i say it myself a good home where he enjoyed every comfort but all that didnt prevent him leaving us to go among strangers she concluded with a sigh i only just came from chicago i wish i had known that he was there did you come to peoria expressly to see my brother asked mrs clifton showing some curiosity not entirely i am connected with the theatrical company we play the streets of gotham are you an actor and so young asked mrs clifton in surprise i take a small part in the play answered bert modestly allow me to place two admission tickets at your disposal oh ma can i go with you asked the young girl who had opened the front door perhaps so belle have you any picture of your brother which you could show me asked bert returning to the object of his visit fortunately ralph had some photographs taken while he was here but for me he would not have done so but i insisted and paid for them myself belle go and get one of the pictures of your uncle ralph the little girl left the room and soon returned with a photograph you can have that if you like said mrs clifton i got a dozen and ralph did not feel enough interest to keep one for himself so i have plenty i suppose it isnt anything extra but it look like ralph bert was eagerly scanning the picture which ralph hardings sister had given him the face was long the nose aquiline the cheeks hollow and the expression was that of a man who was dissatisfied with life there were side whiskers of scanty growth and there was a scrubby mustache of yellowish hue it was a front view and both ears were visible they were of extraordinary size and stood out prominently from the head i think i shall know ralph harding if i see him thought bert i am very much obliged to you for the picture said bert with it to help me i hope i may find your brother if you do returned mrs clifton will you write to me and let me know mr barton you will see my name on the playbill bert barton yes i will write to you in that case there is one question i would like to ask you mr barton you say you have never met my brother no then how did you learn that he had a sister in peoria and how did you know that that sister was myself i was staying at his old boardinghouse in harrisburg he left behind a box of papers and among those papers was a letter from you urging him to come to peoria i remember that letter it was that letter excuse my reading it that led me to come to peoria in search of mr harding i am glad you came for i have some hope through you of inducing ralph to return you see mr barton there are only two of us i had not seen him for five years and now that he has left us five years more may roll by before we meet again i think ralph would be better with us he is not a cheerful man sometimes i think he is burdened with a secret which is preying upon him i am sure he would be better off with us than among strangers i agree with you mrs clifton you may rest assured that should i be fortunate enough to find your brother i will do all i can to induce him to return to you when our business is concluded this may require him to go east but afterward he will be free to go where he pleases the secret you refer to may relate to the business upon which i wished to see him as bert rose to go mrs clifton took his hand and said earnestly i wish you success i am sure i feel better for your visit the information which bert had received made him desirous of going back to chicago as soon as possible and making every effort to find ralph harding but there was one embarrassment he did not like to leave the company till they were able to find a substitute in new york this would have been easy but here in peoria there would be a great difficulty but he was unexpectedly relieved from this perplexity on friday morning mr pearson who had just come from the managers room said to him i have news for you bert what is it mr pearson bob hazleton has just arrived and wants to take his old place but of course that would not be fair to you tell the manager to take him back said bert eagerly i have some important business calling me to chicago and i shall be glad to resign you are sure you wont be disappointed very sure i have been wondering how i could resign without embarrassing the company we shall be very sorry to lose you but if that is the way you feel bob is in luck bert played that evening in the presence of his predecessor in the role and on saturday took the morning train for chicago chapter xxxv success comes strangely on his return to chicago bert went back to mrs shelbys boardinghouse and was cordially received his board bill was but six dollars a week and he took care not to spend any money unnecessarily for outside expenses about the middle of the week he received a letter from uncle jacob to whom he had telegraphed his movements this is an extract therefrom you will be surprised to learn that your father is sick at lakeville under your mothers care i dont think his trouble is physical so much as mental if by your help his reputation is vindicated and he is relieved from suspicion i am sure he will soon be himself again there is some risk no doubt in the step he has taken he might be denounced and arrested if information were given to the authorities but a long time has elapsed since the charge was made and no one in lakeville was cognizant of the circumstances except albert marlowe and though he may learn that the city boarder at your house is your father i cannot believe he would be so base as to give a hint to the authorities if he should the letter of ralph hardings which you forwarded will throw suspicion upon him i am anxious however to have you find the man himself as his oral testimony will avail more than any letters you may assure him if found that he will be liberally dealt with if he helps clear your father i dont know how you may be situated as to money and i therefore send you an order for fifty dollars present it to clement green of no la salle street and he will cash it he is not a banker but an insurance agent with whom i am well acquainted i am glad to hear that you have left the stage as it will permit you to devote your entire time to hunting up ralph harding on account of the income from his dramatic engagement bert had spent but little of his uncles money for the last three weeks however he thought it best to cash the order at once as he might have unforeseen expenses he accordingly made his way to the office on la salle street to which he had been directed and presented his order to mr green in person how is my old friend mr marlowe asked that gentleman courteously he was very well when i left new york answered bert i knew him in california in fact we both worked together in the same mine try to persuade him to come out to chicago i should be delighted to entertain him are you a relative of his yes sir he is my great uncle shall you stay long in chicago i am not sure it will depend on my business you are young to be intrusted with a business matter yes sir but there was no one else to undertake it how will you have the money in tens and fives very well let me advise you to divide your money and not carry it all in your pocketbook you know of course that in a city like this there are pickpockets and designing persons who would be glad to rob you thank you for the suggestion i will follow your advice bert borrowed an envelope and put all his money except about ten dollars in small bills in the inside pocket of his vest this was wise for he had fifty dollars besides the sum which he had just been paid it proved to be a prudent precaution outside the office a young man of rather flashy appearance had noticed bert and following him in on some pretext that would avert suspicion had seen that mr green was paying him money he went out quickly and waited till bert emerged into the street he then quickened his steps and overtook him goodmorning young man he said goodmorning returned bert eyeing the stranger with some curiosity you must excuse the liberty i have taken in addressing you but if you will favor me with a few minutes conversation i think i can make it worth your while very well i am ready to hear what you have to say by the way are you staying at a hotel no i am boarding on monroe street is it a good boardinghouse excellent i am looking for one and if you will allow me i will walk round with you and see what it is like bert knew that mrs shelby had a room which she was anxious to let and he readily agreed to introduce the stranger i am staying at a hotel just now explained his companion but i prefer a boardinghouse as more homelike are you a stranger in the city yes sir where from from new york i am from san francisco i have only been here a week they conversed upon indifferent topics till they reached mrs shelbys i will go up and take a look at your room first if you dont mind that will give me an idea of the accommodations very well sir bert led the way to his own room and both entered very neat on my word said the stranger now i will allude to the little matter of business and then you can introduce me to your landlady just as you please sir it is briefly this do you see this watch he took out a showy gold watch and held it up before bert i find myself unexpectedly short of funds owing to the failure of a remittance to come to hand and i am going to offer you this watch at a bargain you have none i see no and i have no money to spare to buy one wait till i offer you an inducement this watch cost me a hundred dollars i have had it only six months i offer it to you for twentyfive i presume that is a good offer but i have no money of my own that i can use for the purpose of buying a watch my young friend it will pay you to borrow for you can double your money on the watch any one will give you fifty for it then why do you offer it to me for twentyfive asked bert shrewdly because i cant wait to hunt up a customer i cannot buy it then i will make you another offer lend me ten dollars on it and i will redeem it in three days and give you five dollars for the accommodation bert hesitated it seemed an easy way of earning five dollars if i dont redeem it you have the watch itself for security for a ridiculously small sum of course i shant give you the chance if i can help it i expect funds from san francisco tomorrow i think i shall have to decline bert said after a pause but your offer seems a good one and i have no doubt you will easily get accommodated elsewhere bert was not prepared for the next movement the stranger rose from his seat drew a sponge from his pocket and quickly applied it to berts nostrils he felt his head swimming and consciousness departing aha thought the stranger my prudent young friend will advance money this time without security he hastily thrust his hand into berts pocket drew out his pocketbook and without stopping to open it or examine its contents sprang to the door with the intention of making his escape but another boarder chanced to be passing through the entry at the moment a quick glance revealed to him bert unconscious on a chair and the pocketbook in the hand of the man who was leaving the room he took in the situation at once give me that pocketbook he said sternly the other looked undecided give it to me or i will hold you and summon help if you surrender it i will let you go scot free the thief muttered an execration but did not dare to refuse the boarder entered the room and set himself to reviving bert where am i asked bert languidly you are all right now was the reply bert looked up in the face of his visitor and started in great excitement tell me quick he said are you not ralph harding yes answered the other in great surprise who are you that recognizes me chapter xxxvi ralph harding is found bert was still partly under the influence of chloroform but the sight of ralph harding whom he recognized from the photograph which had been given him roused him from his stupefaction harding repeated his question who are you he asked and how do you know me i am bert barton what not the son of john barton exclaimed harding drawing back with a troubled look yes answered bert gravely i am the son of john barton and i have been in search of you for several weeks you have been in search of me why did you want to see me i want you to clear my father of the false charge which was brought against him ten years ago answered bert firmly i dont understand what you mean stammered harding who had sunk back into a chair and was eyeing bert with a troubled look oh yes you do mr harding it was you who gave the information that one of the stolen bonds was in my fathers overcoat pocket it was true said harding doggedly where were the rest asked bert pointedly how should i know your father had them secreted somewhere i suppose you know better than that my father was innocent he knew nothing of the bonds an enemy plotted to get him into trouble do you charge me with being that enemy demanded harding you had something to do with it but you were the instrument of another how do you know that admitted harding incautiously shall i tell you the name of that other yes it is albert marlowe ralph harding started in surprise does he admit it he asked after a pause no he does not know that it is suspected i want you to back me up in the demand that he clear my father from suspicion he will never do it how could he without criminating himself whatever be the result my fathers character must be cleared tell me is your father still living asked ralph harding earnestly yes he is have you seen him yes poor father he has suffered much he has been separated from my mother and myself these many years and has not dared to show himself at his old home or among his old friends because he was liable to be arrested on the old charge ralph was looking down upon the floor and his features were working convulsively bert guessed what was passing through his mind and paused to give him time he looked up after a while and asked what would you have me do testify to what you know it will clear my father and he can come home once more but it will condemn albert marlowe why not let it he is the guilty man have you so much reason to like albert marlowe that you will not do this act of justice no ralph harding burst out and his face wore an expression of resentment he has used me like a dog it was through me that he became a rich man and in return he has treated me with contempt and indifference if i dared you would expose him yes i would it is of no use to deny what you have said your father is an innocent man the bonds were stolen by albert marlowe bert looked triumphant he had wrung the truth from the accomplice of squire marlowe how did you find me asked harding abruptly how did you know i was in chicago i was told so by your sister have you been in peoria then asked harding in great surprise yes i was there last week but how did you find out that i had a sister at harrisburg you left a letter from your sister at your boardinghouse there which gave me the clew i wanted and how did you trace me to harrisburg bert explained and you defrayed your own expenses i thought you and your mother were left in poverty so we were but an uncle of my mothers recently returned from california and it is he who has supplied me with the funds needed for my journey then he is wealthy i dont think so he is employed in new york on a small salary but he is liberal with the little he has he has set his heart on clearing my fathers reputation it is he who sent me on my present mission does your father think that albert marlowe is the real thief he does in fact he is firmly convinced of it now mr harding i have told you why i wanted to find you you have as much as told me i am right in my suspicion you are partly responsible for my poor fathers undeserved sufferings but for you he would never have been charged with the crime is it not so i admit it ralph harding answered slowly will you tell me who put the bond into my fathers pocket i did and who prompted you to do it it was the man you suspected albert marlowe it was the proceeds of his theft that enabled him to start in business was it not you are right i have one more question to ask will you accompany me to new york and testify to this if needful but what will happen to me asked harding troubled my uncle bade me promise you that we will do our utmost to prevent your coming to harm as to albert marlowe we shall demand a confession from him or we shall have him arrested and the whole matter investigated ralph harding paused for a brief space and then said what are your plans if i agree to help you to start for new york tonight answered bert promptly in new york i will take you to uncle jacobs office and we will decide what to do next harding hesitated a moment then said i believe you will keep your promise and i will put myself in your hands i always liked your father better than albert marlowe who is a very selfish man and he has not kept his promise to me i have reproached myself more than once for consenting to help marlowe in his plot it has never been out of my mind i have been restless unable to settle down anywhere and have suffered punishment myself though not as severe as has fallen upon your father when i have made reparation as i now have a chance to do i shall be more contented in mind can you be ready to take the evening train with me yes where are you living in this house then we can remain together i have not thanked you yet for coming to my help and saving my money i am glad to have helped the son it will help offset the injury i have done the father bert accompanied by ralph harding took the evening train for new york their arrival was timely for reasons which will be shown in a later chapter chapter xxxvii albert marlowe meets his victim like most wrongdoers albert marlowe had never ceased to entertain an apprehension that his connections with the bond theft would some time be made public yet as the years rolled by and he became rich and prosperous his fears abated somewhat and he felt no qualms of conscience though he knew that an innocent man was suffering exile for his sake when he thought of john barton it was with dislike for nothing is truer than the saying that we dislike those whom we have injured he did not know whether barton was alive or dead but hoped that he was dead as this would make him absolutely safe when he learned from percy that mrs barton had a male boarder his fears instantly suggested that it might be john barton the description given by percy tallied with his recollections of the victim of his wicked plot his fears and suspicions were instantly aroused why was john barton here he was under the ban of the law liable to be rearrested yet he ran that risk what object had he in view that he sought the care of his wife because he was ill did not seem a sufficient motive evidently it behooved him to find out first whether mrs bartons boarder was really her husband and secondly if such should be the case to warn him to leave lakeville it gave the squire an uncomfortable feeling to have his victim so near at hand first to find out who the boarder was albert marlowe got into the habit of walking two or three times a day past the cottage of mrs barton in the hope of seeing the mysterious stranger he did this for several days but did not succeed in his object the reason was that mr barton was confined by weakness first to the bed and then to the lounge in the little sittingroom but on the fifth day squire marlowe was in luck the mysterious boarder was walking to and fro in the front yard attached to the cottage when he saw albert marlowe he turned away and was about to reenter the house the squire did not need this corroboration of his suspicion for he had already recognized barton though the two had not met for ten years he set his face firmly his expression became hard and dogged that man must leave lakeville he said to himself without hesitation he opened the gate and entered the yard meanwhile john barton seeing that he was recognized came to a halt and turning around faced the man who had been his bitter enemy he showed no signs of fear for what had happened was only what he had anticipated squire marlowe came up and stood at his side you are john barton he said do not attempt to deny it i do not propose to deny it to you albert marlowe answered barton calmly you are here under an assumed name i was told that mrs bartons boarder was named robinson i am passing under that name you know why yes i do know why you are under the ban of the law you are afraid of being arrested and brought to trial a second time i know there is danger of it and of course i shrink from it then why do you come here are you mad after ten years i wished to see my wife once more i am a sick man i came to her to be nursed back to health take care or when you leave here it will be for a less desirable boardingplace said the squire in a menacing tone you mean the prison yes that is what i mean no one in lakeville knows who i am why should i fear i know surely you would not betray me you the man who worked for years at my side i cannot compromise with crime it is my duty as a good lawabiding citizen to denounce you to the authorities you a good lawabiding citizen repeated john barton with scornful emphasis squire marlowe started back in astonishment the worm had turned do you mean to question it he demanded sharply yes i do on what grounds albert marlowe said john barton sternly one of us two is a thief but i am not the one do you mean to insult me exclaimed the squire white with anger not unmingled with uneasy fear come in i have something to say to you it is better said indoors where no passerby can hear it mechanically squire marlowe followed john barton into the little sittingroom mrs barton looked up from her rockingchair in surprise and apprehension and half rose stay where you are mary said her husband i wish you to hear what i am about to say to albert marlowe chapter xxxviii mr barton defies the squire squire marlowe sat down while john barton instead of quailing in his presence eyed him with cool indifference what is the meaning of this tomfoolery asked albert marlowe uneasily you may call it what you like but the time has come for an explanation albert marlowe you have done me a cruel wrong it is through you that i have had my name blackened and have been forced to fly from my country so you went to canada did you sneered the squire its a popular resort for gentlemen of your class your words do not trouble me for i never committed the crime with which i was charged of course not it is wonderful how innocent you all are but you say that i am responsible for the consequences of your crime what do you mean by that i mean answered barton with a penetrating glance that the bonds were stolen by you and that you schemed to throw the blame upon me is this plain are you mad said the squire angrily do you expect the world to believe this or are you in a conspiracy to blackmail me the last question you can ask when i demand money from you as the price of my silence take care john barton your silly tale is the last desperate expedient of a criminal you ought to see the folly of attacking a man in my position for years i have been the most prominent man in lakeville owner of the large shoe factory that gives employment to fifty hands it is no idle boast and your wife will confirm my words that i am the most influential and respected citizen of this town and on what are your position and prosperity based albert marlowe where did you obtain the capital that enabled you to start in business squire marlowe looked confused for a moment but his audacity did not desert him i started he answered on borrowed money of whom did you borrow that is my affair returned marlowe doggedly you would find it hard to answer let me answer for you the squire did not speak but waited not without uneasiness for barton to answer his own question he didnt have long to wait you started your factory on the money realized from the stolen bonds you will have to prove this said marlowe furiously do you wish me to do so asked john barton significantly this is all a scheme to clear yourself from the charge exclaimed the squire dont think i am so dull that i dont see through it how happens it that you have waited ten years before it occurred to you to implicate me it did not immediately occur to me but when you started in business on a large scale though you were no better off than myself at the time of the theft it set me to thinking i have already told you that i used borrowed money you wont tell me where you borrowed it because it is my private business john barton i warn you that you are making a powerful enemy if you keep quiet and let me alone i will not call attention to your presence in lakeville and for safetys sake i will not appear to know anything about you do you make that promise albert marlowe i am an innocent man but i am under a ban i want to prove my innocence and regain the right to live with my family and hold up my head before my fellowmen if in doing this attention should be drawn to you as the real criminal i cannot help it so you defy me do you demanded the squire if what i have said is a defiance then i defy you answered john barton calmly squire marlowe rose from his seat his face flushed with anger be it so he said you will hear from me again oh john exclaimed mrs barton as the squire left the room i am afraid albert will do you some harm then mary to relieve you let me say that i have heard through uncle jacob that bert has found the missing witness ralph harding and that both are probably in new york at this moment on his return squire marlowe telegraphed from a neighboring town as follows to robert manning no fulton st brooklyn john barton who ten years since stole your bonds and escaped trial is at lakeville at his wifes house albert marlowe the last act in the drama was about to be played and squire marlowe went about with a gleam in his eye as he anticipated the final downfall of the man who had dared to defy him chapter xxxix conclusion bert arrived in new york in due time accompanied by ralph harding they received a cordial welcome from uncle jacob you shall not regret your testimony in behalf of john barton he said to harding i will see that you are protected uncle jacob said bert i have twenty dollars left of the amount you gave me for expenses here it is keep it bert you will need it but uncle jacob i have already put you to too great expense if you were a rich man jacob marlowe smiled i can spare the money he said dont trouble yourself on that score you have done yourself great credit bert and shown great shrewdness in your expedition in search of mr harding i am not sure that you would not make a good detective i have no ambition in that direction uncle jacob i hope to get a little better education and then to devote myself to business i think you will have an opportunity to do both bert do you think you can get me a place of some kind in new york i know of course that i must work before i can afford to study we will speak of that later now i have to propose that we all go down to lakeville to meet your father and mother and incidentally to have an interview with albert marlowe do you wish me to go too asked ralph harding by all means you are the most important member of the party toward noon of the next day the three reached lakeville uncle jacob and ralph harding secured rooms at the hotel and then repaired to the little cottage we will precede them it was in the spirit of revenge that the squire had telegraphed to brooklyn and after he had done so he half regretted it if john barton were rearrested he would undoubtedly try to incriminate the squire himself and the mere accusation would do him harm it would be best if barton could be frightened into making his escape and this very act would seem like a confession of guilt yes that will be best thought the squire barton will never dare to come back and we shall be spared the scandal of a trial he took his hat and cane and set out for the barton cottage mrs barton opened the door is your husband in asked the squire yes i would like to see him on very important business i will see you said john barton who had overheard the squires words well he said as marlowe entered the sittingroom i have come to urge you to leave lakeville began the squire abruptly there is no time to be lost why should i leave lakeville you dont want to be arrested i take it is there any danger of it yes i telegraphed yesterday to robert manning that you were here officers of the law may arrive at any time why did you betray me asked barton quietly because i thought it my duty i had no right to shield a criminal then why have you put me on my guard for your wifes sake i am surprised at your consideration you showed very little when you discharged my boy from your factory that was a matter of business but there is no time to waste in discussion i advise you to go to the station at once a train will leave for new york in half an hour and you may be able to escape before the arrival of the officers but i dont want to escape are you mad demanded the squire impatiently do you want to spend a term of years in prison heaven forbid then profit by my warning and escape while there is time no if i am arrested i will stand trial have you taken leave of your senses no i wish to prove my innocence what chance have you of that the testimony of ralph harding what exclaimed squire marlowe rising in great agitation where is ralph harding here was the unexpected reply and uncle jacob entered the room accompanied by bert and mr harding albert marlowe turned his gaze from one to another in illconcealed dismay what is the meaning of this he asked hoarsely have you been hatching up a plot against me no answered uncle jacob with dignity it is our object to relieve john barton from the stigma upon his fair name in doing so it may be necessary to fasten the crime upon the guilty party who that is you know as well as i do no one will credit the testimony of that man said the squire pointing scornfully at ralph harding dont be too sure of that his story is plain and straightforward and i think it will impress the court that way albert has been urging me to escape said john barton he has set the officers on my track has he done this asked uncle jacob sharply so he says at this moment a knock was heard at the door and there was a new and unexpected arrival which produced a sensation it was robert manning of brooklyn you telegraphed to me mr marlowe he said this man i believe is john barton you are right sir responded barton calmly i might have brought with me an officer and an order of arrest but i have chosen instead to offer to drop all action against you if you will restore the bonds or their equivalent i have no wish to be revenged but i want reparation as i never took your bonds i am not the person to apply to replied barton then perhaps you will have the kindness to tell me who did take the bonds said manning incredulously i will do that responded ralph harding coming forward there he stands it is a lie interposed the squire hoarsely it is true you hired me to put a fivehundred dollar bond into john bartons pocket while you appropriated the remainder it was this that enabled you to go into business for yourself in lakeville it was in this way that you got together your wealth albert marlowe was overwhelmed and did not immediately reply i think i remember you said robert manning it was your testimony that weighed so heavily against mr barton and it has weighed heavily upon my conscience ever since i have at last determined to tell the truth what have you to say to this mr marlowe asked manning pointedly it is a lie answered the squire feebly you are willing to have the matter go to trial albert put in uncle jacob it appears to me that you are in a bad box ralph hardings testimony is sure to convict you will you take my advice what is it asked the squire sullenly accept the offer made to john barton under a misapprehension repay to mr manning the value of the stolen bonds with interest attached interposed manning and he will drop the matter am i right mr manning yes sir it will amount to about double the original sum say twelve thousand dollars i cant raise so large an amount in cash you are worth more yes but not in ready money i will advance it to you and take a bill of sale of the factory and your house said uncle jacob all eyes were turned upon the old man in amazement but where will you get the money gasped the squire i can raise ten times that sum if necessary but i thought you were a poor man i never told you so i said i had five hundred dollars but i didnt add that i am worth at least two hundred thousand dollars more that was my secret you said that you invested all your money in some mining shares that depreciated to nothing i foresaw the decline and sold out at a small loss why did you deceive us asked the squire irritably i wanted to test you all when you thought me poor you gave me my walking ticket but mary here and uncle jacob glanced affectionately at mrs barton gave me a warm welcome though she thought me nearly as poor as herself i shall not forget it bert also did not look down upon his old uncle even though he had little to expect from him but uncle jacob said bert why if you are so rich do you work for twelve dollars a week it was a harmless deception bert he replied i am at the head of the office where you think me employed and president of one of the richest mines on the pacific coast mr marlowe said the squire not venturing upon the familiar name of uncle jacob instead of advancing money on my house factory and stock are you willing to buy them outright at what sum do you value them fifteen thousand dollars it is a bargain said uncle jacob promptly you may feel disposed to run the business yourself it is out of my line i shall make a free gift of the whole to john barton who i suppose is quite capable of taking your place how can i thank you said mr barton much moved by making mary happy now mr manning if you and albert marlowe will call tomorrow at my office in new york we will complete the business john i shall not need you but bert will go with me and bring you back the deeds of the property i propose to transfer to you that evening was a happy one in the barton cottage but there was vain regret and dissatisfaction at the home of albert marlowe too late they all regretted that they had received uncle jacob so coldly and so forfeited in all probability their chances of sharing his wealth percys great regret was that that barton boy should be lifted above him a month later and the changes had taken place the bartons moved to squire marlowes handsome house and john barton was installed as owner and head of the shoe factory bert was placed at an academy where he will remain till he has acquired a good education and then will enter uncle jacobs office in the city he bids fair to redeem the promise of his boyhood and become an upright and manly man ralph harding has been made superintendent of the factory and enjoys the confidence of john barton who is happy in the society of his wife of which he was deprived for so many years albert marlowe with the remainder of his money went to illinois and has established a small shoe factory out there he is a discontented and unhappy man and his wife is peevish and discontented also they can no longer afford the expensive establishment they maintained in lakeville percy has not lost all hopes of being remembered in the will of his wealthy relative but whether he will or not is jacob marlowes secret the
