 wednesday is this going to take much longer the taxi driver asked plaintively twisting around to the back seat his passenger regarded him without enthusiasm what do you care youre getting paid arent you the driver banged his palm on the steeringwheel making it ring dully eh i hope so but theres more to life than getting paid you know its almost an hour weve been sitting here i usually have a bite to eat around now i mean if you wanted me for the evening you should have said so the street in which they were parked stretched straight ahead between the evenly spaced blocks of flats built on reinforced concrete stilts the ground fioor level consisting of a car park in the nearest block half of this space had been filled in to provide a few shops all closed between two of them was a lit plateglass frontage above which a blue neon sign read bar well the driver demanded all right but dont take all night about it the driver clambered awkwardly out of the car wheezing heavily years of high tension and low exercise seemed to have converted all his bone and muscle to flab im talking about a snack thats all he complained even the fucking car wont go unless you fill it up hitching up his ample trousers he waddled off past three metal rubbish skips overflowing with plastic bagsi and sacks zen watched him pick his way across the hun mocks and gullies that looked like piles of frozen snow ii the cheerless light of the ultramodern streetlamps nothing else moved no one was about apart from the bar there was nothing in the vicinity to tempt the inhabi tants out of doors after dark the whole area had a pro visional halffinished look as though the developer had lost interest halfway through the job the reason was no doubt to be found in one of those getout clauses which burolo constructions contracts had invariably included allowing them to suck the lucrative marrow out of a project without having to tackle the boring bits like the others the block near which they were parked was brandnew and looked as if it had been put together in about five minutes from prefabricated sections like a childs toy access to the four floors of flats was by rectan gular stairwells which descended like lift shafts to the cav park at ground level the flat roof bristled with televisicn aerials resembling the reeds which had flourished in thi marshy land before the developers moved in some of the windows were unshuttered and from time to time figures appeared in these lighted panels providing zen with his only glimpse so far of the inhabitants of the zone there was no way of knowing whether their shadowy gestures had any relevance to his concerns or not he had checked the list of residents posted outside each stairwell the name bevilacqua appeared opposite flat but the door to the stairs was locked and zen hadnt gone as far as trying to gain entry to the block it seemed to him that hed gone quite far enough as it was most of his afternoon had been spent trying to find a solution to the problem of the stolen video tape a visit to an electronics shop had revealed the existence of com plexities he had never guessed at involving choices of type brand and length in the end hed selected one which had the practical advantage of being sold separately rather than in packs of three it didnt really matter he told himself either they would check or they wouldnt if they did they werent going to feel any better disposed fpwards zen because he had replaced the missing video with exactly the right kind of blank tape or even given them a bugs bunny cartoon in exchange back at the ministry he walked down two flights of drably functional concrete stairs to the subbasement where the archives department was housed as he had foreseen only one clerk was on duty at that time of day so zens request to inspect the files relating to one of his old cases selected at random resulted in the desk being left unmanned for over five minutes this was quite long enough for zen to browse through the rubberstamp collection find the one reading property of the ministry of the interior index no apply this to the labels on the face a d spine of the video cassette and then copy the index number from the memorandum he had been sent when the clerk returned with the file he had asked for zer spent a few minutes leafing through it for appear ances sake the case was one that dated back almost twenty years to the time when zen had been attached to the questura in milan he scanned the pages with affection and nostalgia savouring the contrast between the oldfashioned report forms and the keen fiourish of his youthful handwriting but as the details of the case began to emerge these innocent pleasures were overshadowed darker memories why had he asked for this of all files the question was also the answer for the spadola case was not just another of the many investigations zen had been involved with in the course of his career it had been at once his first great triumph and his first great disil lusionment after the war when the fighting in italy came to an end many leftwing partisans were ready and willing to carry the armed struggle one stage further to overthrow the government and set up a workers state some had ideological motives others were just intoxicated by the thrills and glamour of making history and couldnt stomach the prospect of retuming to a life of mundane poorly paid work even supposing there was work to be had to such men and vasco spadola was one the decision of the communist leader togliatti to follow a path of reform rather than revolution represented a betrayal once it became clear that a national uprising of the italian working class was not going to happen spadola and his comrades put their weapons and training to use in a spor adic campaign of bank raids and holdups which they tried to justify as acts of class warfare the success of these ventures soon caused considerable strains and stresses within the group on one side were those led by ugo and carlo trocchio who still adhered to a doctrinaire political line and on the other spadolas followers who were beginning to appreciate the possibili ties of this kind of private enterprise these problems were eventually resolved when the trocchio brothers were shot dead in a cafe in the milan suburb of rho with their departure the gang abandoned all pretence of waging a political struggle and concentrated instead on consolidating its grip on every aspect of the citys criminal life highrisk bank raids were replaced by unspectacular percentage operations such as gambling prostitution drugs and extortion spadolas involvement in these areas was well known to the police but one aspect of his par tisan training which he had not forgotten was how to structure an organization in such a way that it could sur vive the penetration or capture of individual units no matter how many of his operations were foiled or his associates arrested spadola himself was never implicated until the tondelli affair bruno tondelli himself was not one of milans most savoury characters but when he was done to death with a butchers knife it was still murder the tondellis had been engaged in a longrunning territorial dispute with spadolas men which no doubt explained why spadola found it expedient to disappear from sight immediately after the murder nevertheless no one in the police would have wagered a piece of used chewinggum on their chances of pinning it on him then one day zen who had been given the thankless task of investigating tondellis stabbing received a mes sage from an informer asking for a meeting in order to protect them informers real names and addresses were kept in a locked file to which only a very few highranking officials had access everyone else referred to them by their code name the man who telephoned zen known as the nightingale was one of the polices most trusted and reliable sources of information the meeting duly took place in a secondclass compart ment of one of the ferrovia nord trains trundling up the line to seveso it was a foggy night in february at one of the intermediate stations a man joined zen in the pre arranged compartment pale balding slight and diffident he might have been a filing clerk or a university professor vasco spadola he said was hiding out in a farmhouse to the east of the city i was there the night tondelli got killed the informer went on spadola stabbed him with his own hand thisll teach the whole litter of them a lesson he said a lot of use that is to us if you wont testify zen retorted irritably the man gave him an arch look who said i wouldnt testify and testify he duly did not only that but when the police raided the farm house near the village of melzo they tound not only vasco spadola but also a knife which proved to have traces of blood of the same group that had once flowed in bruno tondellis veins spadola was sentenced to life imprisonment and aurelio zen spent three days basking in glory then he learned from an envious colleague that the knife had been smeared with a sample of tondellis blood and planted at the scene by the police themselves and that the reason why the nightingale had been prepared to come into court and testify that he had seen spadola commit murder was that the tondellis had paid him handsomely to do so zen closed the file and handed it back to the clerk with the blank video cassette oh by the way if it isnt too much trouble do you think you could manage to get my name right next time he asked sarcastically flourishing the memorandum whats wrong with it the clerk demanded taking the substitute video without a second glance my name happens to be zen not zeno zens not italian quite right its venetian but since its only three letters long id have thought that even you lot would be capable of spelling it correctly and while were at it what the hell does this say he indicated the phrase scribbled in the blank space since it is needed by another official the clerk read aloud maybe you need glasses zen frowned ignoring the comment who asked for it the clerk sighed mightily pulled open a filing cabinet and flicked through the cards fabri vincenzo even now sitting in the taxi looking out at the deserted streets of the dormitory suburb zen could feel the sense of panic these words had induced why should vincenzo fabri of all people have put in a request for the burolc video he had nothing to do with the case no legitimate reason for wishing to view the tape if nothing more it was monstrously unfortunate not only would zens sub stitution of the blank tape come to light but it would do so through the offices of his sworn enemy nervously zen lit a cigarette ignoring the sign on the taxis dashboard thanking him for not doing so and reflected uneasily that vincenzo fabri couldnt have contrived a better oppor tunity to disgrace his rival if hed planned it himself the earlier part of zens evening had not improved his mood dinner was always the most difficult part of his day in the morning he could escape to work and when he got home in the afternoon maria grazia the housekeeper was there to dilute the situation with her bustling loquacious presence later in the evening things got easier once again as his mother switched the lights off and settled down in front of the television flipping from channel to channel as the whim took her dipping into the various serials like someone dropping in on the neigh bours for a few minutes inconsequential chat but first there was dinner to be got through today to make matters worse his mother was having one of her deaf phases when she was or pretended to be unable to hear anything that was said to her until it had been repeated three or four times at an ever higher volume since their conversation had long been reduced to the lowest of common denominators zev found himself having to shout at the top of his voice remarks that were so meaningless it would have been an effort even to mumble them to zens intense relief the television news made no reference to the discovery of exclusive video footage showing every gory detail of the burolo murders indeed for once the case was not even mentioned the news was dominated by the shooting of judge giulio bertolini and featured an emotional interview with the victims widow in the course of which she denounced the lack of protec tion given to her husband even when giulio received threats nothing whatever was done we begged we pleaded we your husband was warned that he would be killed the reporter interrupted eagerly signora bertolini made a gesture of qualification not in so many words no but there were tokens signs strange disturbing things for example an envelop pushed through our letterbox with nothing inside but a lot of tiny little metal balls like caviare only hard and the giulios wallet was stolen and later we found it in the living room the papers and money all scattered about the floor but when we informed the public prosecutor he said ther were no grounds for giving my husband an armed guard and just a few days later he was gunned down a helpless victim betrayed by the very people who should zen glanced at his mother so far neither of them had referred to the mysterious metallic scraping which had disturbed her the previous night and which he had explained away as a rat in the skirting he hoped signora bertolinis words did not make her think of another possible explanation which had occurred to him that someone had been trying to break into the flat dont you like your soup he remarked to his mother who was moodily pushing the vegetables and pasta aroun in her plate what your soup arent you going to eat it its got turnip in whats wrong with that turnips are for cattle not people his mother declare her deafness miraculously improved you ate them last time what zen took a deep breath put them to one side and eat the rest he yelled repeating word for word the formula she had one used with him im not hungry his mother retorted sulkily that wont stop you eating half a box of chocolates whilc you watch tv what nothing zen pushed his plate away and lit a cigarette from the television set signora bertolini continued her confused and vapid accusations although he naturally sympath ized with her zen also felt a sense of revulsion it was hecoming too convenient to blame the authorities for everything that happened soon the relatives of motorists killed on the motorway would appear on television claiming that their deaths were due not to the fact that they had been doing zoo kilometres an hour on the hard shoulder in the middle of a contraflow system but to the criminal negligence of the authorities in not providing for the needs of people who were exercising their constitu tional right to drive like maniacs at one minute to seven exactly zen walked through to the inner hallway where the phone was and dialled the number tania had given him a woman answered yes good evening i have a message for signora biacis whos this the womans voice was frugal and clipped as though she had to pay for each word and resented the expense the ministry of the interior muffied squawks penetrated to the mouthpiece which the woman had covered with her hand while she talked to someone else whos this a man abruptly demanded im calling from the ministry zen recited i have a me ssage for signora biacis im her husband what have you got to say youve no doubt heard about the recent terrorist out rage signor biacis bevilacqua mauro bevilacqua the man cut in zen noted the name on the scratch pad by the phone evidently tania biacis like many italian married women had retained her maiden name as a result ministerial staff have been placed on an emer cncy alert your wife is liable for a halfshift this evening the man snorted angrily this has never happened before on the contrary it has happened all too often i mean shes never been called in at this time before then shes been very lucky zen declared with finality and hung up that was all hed needed to do zen thought as he sat in the taxi waiting for the driver to return it was all hed been asked to do it was all he had any right to do but instead of returning to the living room and his mothers company hed lifted the phone again and called a taxi the address listed in the telephone directory after bevilacqua mauro did not exist on zens map of rome the taxi driver hadnt known where it was either but after consultations with the dispatcher it had finally been located in one of the new suburbs on the eastern fringes of the city beyond the grande raccordo anulare whether it was that the dispatchers instructions had been unclear or that the driver had forgotten them they had only found the street after a lengthy excursion through unsurfaced streets that briefiy became country roads pocked with potholes and ridged into steps where concretecovered drainage pipes ran across the eroded surface until recently this had all been unfenced grazing land open campagna where sheep roamed amid the strid ing aqueducts and squat round towers that now gave their names to the new suburbs which had sprung up as the capital began its pathological postwar growth laid out piecemeal as the area grew the streets rambled aimlessly about often ending abruptly in culdesacs that forced the driver to make long and disorientating detours here was a zone of abusive development from the early sixties a shanty town of troglodytic hutches run up by immigrants from the south each surrounded by a patch of enclosed ground where chickens and donkeys roamed amid old lavatories and piles of abandoned pallets next came an older section of villas for the welltodo thick with pines and guard dogs giving way abruptly to a huge cleared expanse of asphalt illuminated by gigantic searchlights trained down from steel masts where a band of gypsies had set up home in caravans linked by canopies of plastic sheeting after that there was a field with sheep grazing and then the tower blocks began fourteen storeys high spaced evenly across the landscape like the pieces in a boardgame for giants on tracts of land that had been brutally assaulted and left to die finally they had found the development of walkup apartments where mauro bevilacqua and tania biacis had made their home zen sank back in the seat wondering why on earth he had come as soon as the driver returned from his snack he would go home tania must have left long ago while the taxi was lost in this bewildering urban hinterland not that he had really intended to follow her anyway putting together her comment about her husband that morning and then her request that zen phone up with a fictitious reason for her to leave the house it seemed pretty clear what she was up to the last thing he wanted was proof of that he had accepted the fact that tania was happily and irrevocably married he didnt now want to have to accept that on the contrary she was having an illicit affair but not with him a silhouetted figure appeared at one of the windows of the nearby block zen imagined the scene viewed from that window the deserted street the parked car it made him think of the night before and suddenly he under stood what he had found disturbing about the red car like the taxi it had been about fifty metres from his house and on the opposite side of the street the classic surveil lance position but he had no time to follow up the implications of this thought because at that moment a woman emerged from one of the staircases of the apart ment block she started to walk towards the taxi then suddenly stopped turned and hurried back the way she had come at the same moment as if on cue the taxi driver re appeared from the bar and a swarthy man in shirtsleeves ran out into the car park underneath the apartment block looking round wildly the woman veered sharply to her left making for the bar but the man easily cut her off they started to struggle the man gripping her by the arms and trying to pull her back towards the door of the block zen got out of the taxi and walked over to them unfolding his identity card police locked in their clumsy tussle the couple took no notice zen shook the man roughly by the shoulder let her go the man swung round and aimed a wild punch at zen who dodged the blow with ease seized the man by the collar and pulled him off balance then shoved him backwards sending him reeling headlong to the ground right what would you like to be arrested for he asked assaulting a police officer you assaulted me the man interrupted indignantly as he got to his feet or interfering with this lady zen concluded the man laughed coarsely he was short and slightly built with a compensatory air of bluster and braggadocio which seemed to emanate from his neatly clipped moustache lady what do you mean lady shes my wife understand this is a family affair zen turned to tania biacis who was looking at him in utter amazement what happened signora she was running away from her home and her duties her husband exclaimed his arms were outstretched to an invisible audience i that taxi i thought it was free tania said she was evidently completely thrown by zens presence i was going to take it then i saw there was someone in it so i was going to the bar to phone for one mauro bevilacqua glared at zen what the hell are you doing lurking about here any way its as bad as russia policemen on every street corner there happens to be a terrorist alert on zen told him coldly tania turned triumphantly on her husband you see i told you having recovered her presence of mind she appealed to zen i work at the ministry of the interior i was called in for emergency duties this evening but my husband wouldnt believe me he wouldnt let me use the car he said it was all a lie a plot to get out of the house zen shook his head in disgust so its come to this heres your wife signore a key member of a dedicated team who are giving their all night and day to defend this country of ours from a gang of ruthless anarchists and all you can do is to hurl puerile and scandalous accusations at her you ought to be ashamed of yourself its none of your business bevilacqua snapped on the contrary zen warned him if i choose to make it my business you could be facing a prison sentence for assault he paused to let that sink in luckily for you however i have more important things to do just as your wife does but to set your fears at rest ill accompany her personally to the ministry will that satisfy you or perhaps youd like me to summon an armed escort to make sure that she reaches her place of work safely mauro bevilacqua flapped his arms up and down like a flightless bird trying vainly to take off what id like what id like what id like is for her to start behaving like a wife should instead of gadding about on her own at this time of night he swung round to face her you should never have gone to work in the first place i never wanted you to go if you brought home a decent income from that stinking bank i wouldnt have to mauro bevilacqua looked at her with hatred in his eyes well settle this when you get home he spat out turning on his heel zen ushered tania into the back of the taxi he got into the front seat beside the driver what were you doing there tania asked after they had driven in silence for some time he did not reply now that their little farce had been played to its conclusion all his confidence had left him he felt ill at ease and constrained by the situation you werent really on a stakeout were you she prompted zen usually had no difficulty in thinking up plausible stories to conceal his real motives but on this occasion he found himself at a loss he couldnt tell tania the truth and he wouldnt lie to her not an official one he glanced round at her as they passed each street lamp its light moved across her in a steady stroking move ment revealing the contours of her face and body you sounded very convincing she said he shrugged if youre going to tell someone a pack of lies theres no point in doing it halfheartedly with the help of tanias directions they quickly regained via casilina and soon the city had closed in around them again zen felt as though he had returned to earth from outer space how can you stand living in that place he demanded as soon as he had spoken he realized how rude the question sounded but tania seemed unoffended thats what i ask myself every morning when i leave and every evening when i get back the answer is simple money you could always economize on your social life thought zen sourly cut out the fancy dinners and the season ticket to the opera and the weekends skiing and skindiving he was rapidly going off tania biacis he found but he didnt say anything mauro bevilacqua had been quite right it was none of his business so wheres it to the driver asked as they neared porta maggiore zen said nothing he wanted tania to decide and he wanted her to have all the time she needed to do so although zen had aided and abetted her deception of her husband he actually felt every bit as resentful of her behaviour as mauro bevilacqua though of course he couldnt let it show he was also aware that tania would have to invent a different cover story for his consumption since the one she had used with her husband clearly wouldnt do he wanted it to be a good one something convincing something that would spare his feelings hed done the dirty work shed requested now let her cover her tracks with him too eh oh signori the driver exclaimed a bit of informa tion thats all i need this car isnt a mule you know it wont go by itself you have to turn the wheel so which way tania gave an embarrassed laugh to tell you the truth i just wanted to go to the cinema well it was better than saying outright that she was going to meet her lover zen supposed but not much better not when she had been regaling him for months with her views of the latest films as they came out flaunting the fact that she and her husband went to the cinema the way other people turned on the television to lie so crudely so transparently was tantamount to an insult no wonder she sounded embarrassed she couldnt have expected to be believed not for a moment she must have done it deliberately as a way of getting the truth across to her faithful stupid besotted admirer well it had worked hed understood finally did you have any particular film in mind he inquired sarcastically anything at all she sounded dismissive no doubt impatient with him thinking that hed missed the point hed soon put her right about that via nazionale he told the driver turning to tania he added im sure youll be able to find what you want there whatever it happens to be as their eyes met he had the uneasy feeling that hed somehow misunderstood but how could he what other explanation was there please stop tania said to the driver were not there yet it doesnt matter just stop the taxi cut across two lanes of traffic unleashing a chorus of horns from behind tania handed the driver a ten thousand lire note deduct that from whatever he owes you she got out slammed the door and walked away where now queried the driver same place you picked me up zen told him they drove down via nazionale and through piazza venezia the driver jerked his thumb towards the white mass of the monument to vittorio emanuele you know what i heard the other day i had this city councillor in the back of the cab we were going past here you know the unknown soldier they have buried up there this councillor he told me they were doing main tenance work a couple of years ago and they had to dig up the body you know what they found the poor bastard had been shot in the back must have been a deserter they reckoned ran away during the battle and got shot by the military police isnt that the end fucking monument to military valour with the two sentries on guard all the time and it turns out the poor fucker buried there was a deserter makes you think eh zen agreed that such things did indeed make you think but in fact his thoughts were elsewhere the history of his relationships with women was passing in review before his eyes like the life of a drowning man and indeed zen felt that he was drowning in a pool of black indifference and icy inertia his failed marriage could be written off to experience he and luisella had married too early and for all the wrong reasons that was a common enough story it was what had happened since then that was so disturb ing or rather what had not happened for zen was acutely aware that in the fifteen years since his marriage broke up he had failed to create a single lasting bond to take its place the final blow had been the departure of ellen the american divorcee he had been seeing on and off for over three years the manner of her going had hurt as much as the fact ellen had made it clear that zen had failed her in just about every conceivable way and once he had got over his anger at being rejected he found this hard to deny the opportunity had been there for the taking but he had hesitated and dithered and messed about using his mother as an excuse until things had come to a crisis then it had been a case of too much too late as he had blurted out an unconsidered offer of marriage which must have seemed like the final insult it wasnt marriage for its own sake that ellen had wanted but a sense of zens commitment to her and he just hadnt been able to feel such a commitment it was no surprise of course at his age with every year that passed the number of things he really cared about decreased and zen soon convinced himself that his failure with ellen had been an indication that love was fast coming to seem more trouble than it was worth why else should he have let the opportunity slip and why did he never get round to answering the postcards and letters ellen sent him from new york the whole affair had been nothing but the selfdelusion of an ageing man who couldnt accept that love too was something he must learn to give up gracefully zen had just got all this nicely sorted out when tania biacis walked into his life it was the first day of his new duties at the ministry tania introduced herself as one of the administrative assistants and proceeded to explain the bureaucratic ins and outs of the department zen nodded smiled grunted and even managed to ask one or two relevant questions but in fact he was on autopilot throughout all his secondhand wisdom swept away by the living breathing presence of this woman whom to his delight and despair he found that he desired in the old familiar raw painful hopeless way unlike the genoese couple who had featured in the paper that morniag however he and tania ran no risk of being barbecued by an irate husband for the simple reason that mauro bevilacqua had nothing whatever to feel jealous about at least as far as zen was concerned true he and tania had become very friendly but nothing precludes the possibility of passion as surely as friendli ness those long casual chats which had once seemed so promising to zen now depressed him more than anything else it was almost as if tania was treating him as a sur rogate female friend as though for her he was so utterly unsexed that she could talk to him for ever without any risk of compromising herself sometimes her tone became more personal particularly when she talked about her father he had been the village schoolteacher an utterly impractical idealist who escaped into the mountains at every opportunity tanias name was not a diminutive of stefania as zen had assumed but of tatania her father having named her after gramscis sisterinlaw who stood by the communist thinker throughout the eleven years of his imprisonment by the fascists but despite this degree of intimacy tania had never given zen the slightest hint that she had any per sonal interest in him while he had of course been careful not to reveal his own feelings he quailed at the thought of tanias reaction if she guessed the truth it was clear from what she said that she and her husband lived a rich full exciting life what on earth could zen offer her that she could possibly want or need it was therefore a sickening blow to discover that tania apparently did want or need things that her marriage didnt provide not only hadnt she thought of turning to him to provide them but she had treated him as someone she could use and then lie to this was so painful that it triggered a mechanism which had been created back in the mists of zens childhood when his father had disappeared into an anonymous grave somewhere in russia that loss still ached like an old fracture on a damp day but at the time the pain had been too fierce to bear to survive zen had withdrawn totally into the present denying the past all reality taking refuge in the here and now that was his response to tanias betrayal and it was so successful that when they arrived and the taxi driver told him how much he owed zen thought the man was trying to cheat him ooo lire for a short ride across the city what the hell are you talking about the driver retor ted two and a quarter hours youve had i could have picked up three times the money doing short trips instead of freezing to death in some shitty suburb zen gradually counted out the notes well that was the last amateur stakeout hed be doing he vowed as the taxi roared away past a red saloon parked about fifty metres along the street on the other side the only people about were an elderly couple making their way at a snails pace along the opposite pavement zen crossed over to the car an alfa romeo with rome registration plates there were several deep scratches and dents in the bodywork and one of the hubcaps was miss ing although the vehicle was quite new zen looked in through the dirty window a packet of marlboro cigarettes lay on one of the leather seats which looked almost unused the floor was covered in cigarette butts and scorched with burn marks the empty box of an adriano celentano tape lay in the tray behind the gearlever the cassette itself protruding from the player he straightened up as footsteps approached but it was only the elderly couple they trudged past the man several paces ahead of his wife neither of them looked at the other although they kept up a desultory patter the whole time then we can right or not who knows well anyway zen noted down the registration number of the car and walked back to the house giuseppe was off duty so the front door was closed and locked the lift was on one of the upper floors zen pressed the light switch and set off up the stairs taking the shallow marble steps two at a time a rumble overhead was followed by a whining sound as the lift started down a few moments later the lighted cubicle passed by its single occupant revealed in fuzzy silhouette on the frosted glass by the time he reached the fourth floor zen was breath less he paused briefly to recover before unlocking his front door there was a clanking far below as the lift shuddered to a halt then the landing was abruptly plun ged into darkness as the time switch expired zen groped his way to the door opened it and turned on the hall light as he closed the door again he noticed an envelope lying on the sideboard he picked it up and walked along the passage past the lugubrious cupboards carved chests and occasional tables for which no suitabie occasion had ever presented itself as he neared the living room he heard the sound of voices raised in argument never in a hundred years never in a thousand will i permit you to marry this man but papa i love alfonso more than life itself do not dare breathe his accursed name again tomor row you leave for the convent there to take vows more sacred and more binding than those with which you seek to dishonour our house the convent no do not condemn me to a living death dear father zen pushed open the glasspanelled door by the flick ering light of the television he saw his mother asleep in her armchair he crossed thc darkened room and turned down the volume silencing the voices but leaving the costumed figures to go through their melodramatic motions then he went to the window opened the shut ters and peered out throubh the slats in the outer jalousies the red car was no longer there he held the envelope so that it caught the light from the television it seemed to be empty although it was surpris ingly heavy his name was printed in block capitals but there was no stamp or address he wondered how it had come to be left on the sideboard normally post was put in the box in the hallway downstairs or left with giuseppe if a message was delivered to the door maria grazia would take it into the living room he ripped the envelope open it still seemed empty but something inside made a scratching sound and when he pulled the paper walls apart he saw clustered together at the very bottom a quantity of tiny silvery balls he let them roll out into his palm in the hickering glimmer of the television they could have been almost anything medi cine seeds even cake decorations but zen knew they were none of these they were shotgun pellets the nights brought relief at night i mozed freely i felt my strength returning the others never venture out once darkness has faen dissolved by darkness the world is io longer theirs they stay at home lock their doors and watch moving pictwres made with light they are afraid of the dark they are rght to be afraid beyond their ocked doors and shuftered windows i cam into nty own fitting effortlessly fmm place to place appearing and dis appearing at will yielding to the darkness as though to the embraces of a secret lozer untii the lights came on the innmtes stirred and the prison awoke to another day it was easy to find my uay back here id aluays come and gone as i liked they never urderstood that they never tried to under stand no one asked me anything they told me things they told me my imprisonment as they called it md been an accident a mistake what you rnust have suffered they said id lost my home and farnily but they werent satisfied with that they wanted me to lose myself as well what am i but what the darkness made me if that was a mistake an accident then so am l sometimes the priest came he had things to tell me too about a loving father a tortured son a virgin mother not like my family i thought the father who came home drunk and fucked his wife until she screamed and screamed again when the son was born a pampered brat arrogant and selfish strutting about as though he owned the place and all because of that thing dangling between his legs barely the size of my little finger but i kept my mouth shut i didnt think the priest would want to know about them and who was i when the family was together the holy ghost i suppose the unholy ghost
