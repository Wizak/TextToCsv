 prologue she was born the night the witch tree fell with the first breath she drew she tasted the power the richness of it and the bitterness her birth was one more link in a chain that had spanned centuries a chain that was often gilded with the sheen of folklore and legend but when the chain was rubbed clean it held fast tempered by the strength of truth there were other worlds other places where those first cries of birth were celebrated far beyond the sweeping vistas of the monterey coast where the childs lusty cry echoed through the old stone house the new life was celebrated in the secret places where magic still thrived deep in the green hills of ireland on the windswept moors of cornwall deep in the caves of wales along the rocky coast of brittany that sweet song of life was welcomed and the old tree hunched and gnarled by its age and its marriage to the wind was a quiet sacrifice with its death and a mothers willing pain a new witch was born though the choice would be hers a gift after all can be refused treasured or ignored it would remain as much a part of the child and the woman she became as the color of her eyes for now she was only an infant her sight still dim her thoughts still halfformed shaking angry fists in the air even as her father laughed and pressed his first kiss on her downy head her mother wept when the babe drank from her breast wept in joy and in sorrow she knew already that she would have only this one girl child to celebrate the love and union she and her husband shared she had looked and she had seen as she rocked the nursing child and sang an old song she understood that there would be lessons to be taught mistakes to be made and she understood that one day not so long from now in the vast scope of lifetimes her child would also look for love she hoped that of all the gifts she would pass along all the truths she would tell the child would understand one the vital one that the purest magic is in the heart chapter contents prev next there was a marker in the ground where the witch tree had stood the people of monterey and carmel valued nature tourists often came to study the words on the marker or simply to stand and look at the sculptured old trees the rocky shoreline the sunning harbor seals locals who had seen the tree for themselves who remembered the day it had fallen often mentioned the fact that morgana donovan had been born that night some said it was a sign others shrugged and called it coincidence still more simply wondered no one denied that it was excellent local color to have a selfproclaimed witch born hardly a stones throw away from a tree with a reputation nash kirkland considered it an amusing fact and an interesting hook he spent a great deal of his time studying the supernatural vampires and werewolves and things that went bump in the night were a hell of a way to make a living and he wouldnt have had it any other way not that he believed in goblins or ghoulies or witches if it came to that men didnt turn into bats or wolves at moonrise the dead did not walk and women didnt soar through the night on broomsticks except in the pages of a book or in the flickering light and shadow of a movie screen there he was pleased to say anything was possible he was a sensible man who knew the value of illusions and the importance of simple entertainment he was also enough of a dreamer to conjure images out of the shades of folklore and superstition for the masses to enjoy hed fascinated the horrorfilm buff for seven years starting with his first and surprisingly successful screenplay shape shifter the fact was nash loved seeing his imagination come to life onscreen he wasnt above popping into the neighborhood movie theater and happily devouring popcorn while the audience caught their breath stifled screams or covered their eyes he delighted in knowing that the people who plunked down the price of a ticket to see one of his movies were going to get their moneys worth of chills he always researched carefully while writing the gruesome and amusing midnight blood hed spent a week in rumania interviewing a man who swore he was a direct descendant of vlad the impaler count dracula unfortunately the counts descendant hadnt grown fangs or turned into a bat but he had proven to possess a wealth of vampire lore and legend it was such folktales that inspired nash to spin a story particularly when they were related by someone whose belief gave them punch and people considered him weird he thought grinning to himself as he passed the entrance to seventeen mile drive nash knew he was an ordinary groundedtoearth type at least by california standards he just made his living from illusion from playing on basic fears and superstitions and the pleasure people took in being scared silly he figured his value to society was his ability to take the monster out of the closet and flash it on the silver screen in technicolor usually adding a few dashes of unapologetic sex and sly humor nash kirkland could bring the bogeyman to life turn the gentle dr jekyll into the evil mr hyde or invoke the mummys curse all by putting words on paper maybe that was why he was a cynic oh he enjoyed stories about the supernatural but he of all people knew that was all they were stories and he had a million of them he hoped morgana donovan montereys favorite witch would help him create the next one for the past few weeks between unpacking and taking pleasure in his new home trying his skill at golf and finally giving it up as a lost cause and simply treasuring the view from his balcony nash had felt the urge to tell a tale of witchcraft if there was such a thing as fate he figured it had done him a favor by plunking him down only a short pleasant drive from an expert whistling along with the car radio he wondered what shed be like turbaned or tasseled draped in black crepe or maybe she was some new age fanatic who spoke only through gargin her channeler from atlantis either way he wouldnt mind a bit it was the loonies in the world that gave life its flavor hed purposely avoided doing any extensive research on the witch he wanted to form his own opinions and impressions leaving his mind clear to start forming plot angles all he knew was that shed been born right here in monterey some twentyeight years before and she ran a successful shop that catered to people who were into crystals and herbs he had to give her two thumbsup for staying in her hometown after less than a month as a resident of monterey he wondered how he could ever have lived anywhere else and god knew he thought as his angular face creased in a grimace hed already lived just about everywhere again he had to thank his luck for making his scripts appealing to the masses his imagination had made it possible for him to move away from the traffic and smog of la to this priceless spot in northern california it was barely march but he had the top down on his jag and the bright brisk breeze whipped through his dark blond hair there was the smell of water it was never far away here of grass neatly clipped of the flowers that thrived in the mild climate the sky was cloudless a beautiful blue his car was purring like a big lean cat hed recently disentangled himself from a relationship that had been rushing downhill and he was about to start a new project as far as nash was concerned life was perfect he spotted the shop as hed been told it stood neatly on the corner flanked by a boutique and a restaurant the businesses were obviously doing well as he had to park more than a block away he didnt mind the walk his long jeansclad legs ate up the sidewalk he passed a group of tourists who were arguing over where to have lunch a pencilslim woman in fuchsia silk leading two afghan hounds and a businessman who strolled along chatting on his cellular phone nash loved california he stopped outside the shop the sign painted on the window simply read wicca he nodded smiling to himself he liked it the old english word for witch it brought to mind images of bent old women trundling through the villages to cast spells and remove warts exterior scene day he thought the sky is murky with clouds the wind rushes and howls in a small rundown village with broken fences and shuttered windows a wrinkled old woman hurries down a dirt road a heavy covered basket in her arms a huge black raven screams as it glides by with a flutter of wings it stops to perch on a rusted gatepost bird and woman stare at each other from somewhere in the distance comes a long desperate scream nash lost the image when someone came out of the shop turned and bumped into him sorry came the muffled apology he simply nodded just as well nash thought it wouldnt do to take the story too far until hed talked to the expert for now what he wanted was to take a good look at her wares the window display was impressive he noted and showed a flair for the dramatic deep blue velvet was draped over stands of various heights and widths so that it resembled a wide river with dark waterfalls floating over it were clusters of crystals sparkling like magic in the morning sun some were as clear as glass while others were of almost heartbreaking hues rose and aqua royal purple ink black they were shaped like wands or castles or small surrealistic cities lips pursed he rocked back on his heels he could see how they would appeal to people the colors the shapes the sparkle that anybody could actually believe a hunk of rock held any kind of power was one more reason to marvel at the human brain still they were certainly pretty enough above the clusters faceted drops hung from thin wires and tossed rainbows everywhere maybe she kept the cauldrons in the back the idea made him chuckle to himself still he took a last look at the display before pushing open the door it was tempting to pick up a few pieces for himself a paperweight or a suncatcher he might just settle for that if she wasnt selling any dragons scales or wolfs teeth the shop was crowded with people his own fault nash reminded himself for dropping in on a saturday still it would give him time to poke around and see just how a witch ran a business in the twentieth century the displays inside were just as dramatic as those glistening in the window huge chunks of rock some sliced open to reveal hundreds of crystal teeth dainty little bottles filled with colored liquid nash was slightly disappointed when he read one label and discovered that it was a rosemary bath balm for relaxing the senses hed hoped for at least one love potion there were more herbs packaged for potpourri for tea and for culinary uses as well as candles in soft colors and crystals in all shapes and sizes some interesting jewelry again leaning heavily on crystals was sparkling behind glass artwork paintings statues sculpture all so cleverly placed that the shop might more accurately have been termed a gallery nash always interested in the unusual took a fancy to a pewter lamp fashioned in the shape of a winged dragon with glowing red eyes then he spotted her one look had him certain that this was the very image of the modern witch the sulkylooking blonde was holding a discussion with two customers over a table of tumbling stones she had a luscious little body poured into a sleek black jumpsuit glittery earrings hung to her shoulders and rings adorned every finger the fingers ended in long lethallooking red nails attractive isnt he hmm the smokeedged voice had nash turning away from the dragon this time one look had him forgetting the stacked young witch in the corner he found himself lost for several heartbeats in a pair of cobalt blue eyes excuse me the dragon smiling she ran a hand over the pewter head i was just wondering if i should take him home with me she smiled and he saw that her lips were full and soft and unpainted do you like dragons crazy about them he decided on the spot do you shop in here often yes she lifted a hand to her hair it was black as midnight and fell in careless waves to her waist nash made an effort and tried to put the pieces of her together the ebony hair went with pale creamy skin the eyes were wide and heavily lashed the nose was small and sharp she was nearly as tall as he and wand slender the simple blue dress she wore showed taste and style as well as subtle curves there was something well dazzling about her he realized though he couldnt analyze what while he was so busy enjoying it as he watched her lips curved again there was something very aware as well as amused in the movement have you been in wicca before no great stuff youre interested in crystals i could be idly he picked up a hunk of amethyst but i flunked my earth science course in high school i dont think youll be graded here she nodded toward the stone he held if you want to get in touch with your inner self you should hold it in your left hand oh yeah to indulge her he shifted it he hated to tell her he didnt feel a thing other than a shaft of pleasure at the way the dress skimmed around her knees if youre a regular here maybe you could introduce me to the witch brow lifted she followed his look as he glanced at the blonde who was finishing up her sale do you need a witch i guess you could say that she turned those wonderful blue eyes on him again you dont look like the type whod come looking for a love spell he grinned thanks i think actually im doing some research i write movies i want to do a story on witchcraft in the nineties you know secret covens sex and sacrifices ah when she inclined her head clear crystal drops swung at her ears nubile women doing ring dances skyclad naked she explained mixing potions by the dark of the moon to seduce their hapless victims into orgies of prurient delights more or less he leaned closer and discovered that she smelled as cool and dark as a forest in moonlight does this morgana really believe shes a witch she knows what she is mr kirkland nash kirkland her laugh was low and pleased of course ive enjoyed your work i particularly liked midnight blood you gave your vampire a great deal of wit and sensuality without trampling on tradition theres more to being undead than graveyard dirt and coffins i suppose and theres more to being a witch than stirring a cauldron exactly thats why i want to interview her i figure shes got to be a pretty sharp lady to pull all this off pull off she repeated as she bent to pick up a huge white cat that had sauntered over to flow around her legs the reputation he explained i heard about her in la people bring me weird stories im sure they do she stroked the cats massive head now nash had two pair of eyes trained on him one pair of cobalt and one of amber but you dont believe in the craft or the power i believe i can make it into a hell of a good story he smiled putting considerable charm into it so how about it put in a good word for me with the witch she studied him a cynic she decided and one entirely too sure of himself life she thought was obviously one big bed of roses for nash kirkland maybe it was time he felt a few thorns i dont think thatll be necessary she offered him a hand long and slender and adorned with a single ring of hammered silver he took it automatically then hissed out a breath as a jolt of electricity zinged up to his shoulder she just smiled im your witch she said static electricity nash told himself a moment later after morgana had turned away to answer a question from a customer about something called st johns wort shed been holding that giant cat rubbing the fur that was where the shock had come from but he flexed his fingers unconsciously your witch shed said he wasnt sure he liked her use of that particular pronoun it made things a bit too uncomfortably intimate not that she wasnt a stunner but the way shed smiled at him when he jolted had been more than a little unnerving it had also told him just why hed found her dazzling power oh not that kind of power nash assured himself as he watched her handle a bundle of dried herbs but the power some beautiful women seemed to be born with innate sexuality and a terrifying selfconfidence he didnt like to think of himself as the kind of man who was intimidated by a womans strength of will yet there was no denying that the soft yielding sort was easier to deal with in any case his interest in her was professional not purely he amended a man would have to have been dead a decade to look at morgana donovan and keep his thoughts on a straight professional plane but nash figured he could keep his priorities in order nash waited until she was finished with the customer fixed a selfdeprecating smile in place and approached the counter i wonder if youve got a handy spell for getting my foot out of my mouth oh i think you can manage that on your own ordinarily she would have dismissed him but there must be some reason shed been drawn across the shop to him morgana didnt believe in accidents anyway she decided any man with such soft brown eyes couldnt be a complete jerk im afraid your timings poor nash were very busy this morning you close at six how about if i come back then ill buy you a drink dinner her impulse to refuse was automatic she would have preferred to meditate on it or study her scrying ball before she could speak the cat leapt onto the counter clearing the four feet in that weightless soar felines accomplish so easily nash reached out absently to scratch the cats head rather than walking off insulted or spitting badtemperedly as was her habit with strangers the white cat arched sinuously under the stroking hand her amber eyes slitted and stared into morganas you seem to have lunas approval morgana muttered six oclock then she said as the cat began to purr lustily and ill decide what to do about you fair enough nash gave luna one last long stroke then strolled out frowning morgana leaned down until her eyes were level with the cats youd better know what youre about luna merely shifted her notinconsiderable weight and began to wash herself morgana didnt have much time to think about nash because she was a woman who was always at war with her impulsive nature she would have preferred a quiet hour to mull over how best to deal with him with her hands and mind busy with a flood of customers morgana reminded herself that she would have no trouble handling a cocksure storyteller with puppy dog eyes wow mindy the lavishly built blonde nash had admired plopped down on a stool behind the counter we havent seen a crowd like that since before christmas i think were going to have full saturdays throughout the month grinning mindy pulled a stick of gum out of the hip pocket of her snug jumpsuit did you cast a money spell morgana arranged a glass castle to her liking before responding the stars are in an excellent position for business she smiled plus the fact that our new window display is fabulous you can go on home mindy ill total out and lock up ill take you up on it she slid sinuously off the stool to stretch then lifted both darkened brows my oh my look at this tall tanned and tasty morgana glanced over and spotted nash through the front window hed had more luck with parking this time and was unfolding himself from the front seat of his convertible down girl chuckling morgana shook her head men like that break hearts without spilling a drop of blood thats okay i havent had my heart broken in days lets see she took a swift and deadly accurate survey six foot a hundred and sixty gorgeous pounds the casual type maybe just a tad intellectual likes the outdoors but doesnt overdo it just a few scattered sun streaks through the hair and a reasonable tan good facial bones hell hold up with age then theres that yummy mouth fortunately i know you and understand you actually do think more of men than you do puppies in a petstore window with a chuckle mindy fluffed her hair oh i think more of them all right a whole lot more as the door opened mindy shifted position so that her body seemed about to burst out of the jumpsuit hello handsome want to buy a little magic always ready to accommodate a willing woman nash flashed her a grin what do you recommend well the word came out in a long purr to rival one of lunas mindy mr kirkland isnt a customer morganas voice was mild and amused there were few things more entertaining than mindys showmanship with an attractive man we have a meeting maybe next time nash told her maybe anytime mindy slithered around the counter shot nash one last devastating look then wiggled out the door i bet she boosts your sales nash commented along with the blood pressure of every male within range hows yours he grinned got any oxygen sorry fresh out she gave his arm a friendly pat why dont you have a seat i have a few more things to damn excuse me didnt get the closed sign up quick enough she muttered then she beamed a smile as the door opened hello mrs littleton morgana the word came out in a long relieved sigh as a woman nash judged to be somewhere between sixty and seventy streamed across the room the verb seemed apt he thought she was built like a cruise ship sturdy of bow and stern with colorful scarves wafting around her like flags her hair was a bright improbable red that frizzed cheerfully around a moonshaped face her eyes were heavily outlined in emerald and her mouth was slicked with deep crimson she threw out both hands they were crowded with rings and gripped morganas i simply couldnt get here a moment sooner as it was i had to scold the young policeman who tried to give me a ticket imagine a boy hardly old enough to shave lecturing me on the law she let out huff of breath that smelled of peppermint now then i hope you have a few minutes for me of course there was no help for it morgana thought she was simply too fond of the batty old woman to make excuses youre a dream shes a dream isnt she mrs littleton demanded of nash you bet mrs littleton beamed turning toward him with a musical symphony of jaggling chains and bracelets sagittarius right ah nash heedlessly amended his birthday to suit her right amazing she puffed out her ample bosom i do pride myself on being an excellent judge i wont keep you but a moment from your date dear i dont have a date morgana told her what can i do for you just the teensiest favor mrs littletons eyes took on a gleam that had morgana stifling a moan my grandniece theres the matter of the prom and this sweet boy in her geometry class this time shed be firm morgana promised herself absolutely a rock taking mrs littletons arm she edged her away from nash ive explained to you that i dont work that way mrs littleton fluttered her false eyelashes i know you usually dont but this is such a worthy cause they all are narrowing her eyes at nash whod shifted closer morgana pulled mrs littleton across the room im sure your niece is a wonderful girl but arranging a prom date for her is frivolous and such things have repercussions no she said when mrs littleton began to protest if i did arrange it changing something that shouldnt be changed it could affect her life its only one night altering fate one night potentially alters it for centuries mrs littletons downcast look had morgana feeling like a miser refusing a starving man a crust of bread i know you only want her to have a special night but i just cant play games with destiny shes so shy you see mrs littleton said with a sigh her ears were sharp enough to have heard the faint weakening in morganas resolve and she doesnt think shes the least bit pretty but she is before morgana could protest she whipped out a snapshot see she didnt want to see morgana thought but she looked and the pretty young teenager with the somber eyes did the rest morgana cursed inwardly dragons teeth and hellfire she was as soppy as a wet valentine when it came to puppy love i wont guarantee only suggest that will be wonderful seizing the moment mrs littleton pulled out another picture one shed cut from the high school yearbook at the school library this is matthew a nice name isnt it matthew brody and jessie littleton she was named for me you will start soon wont you the proms the first weekend in may if its meant its meant morgana said slipping the photos into her pocket blessed be beaming mrs littleton kissed morganas cheek i wont keep you any longer ill be back monday to shop have a good weekend annoyed with herself morgana watched mrs littleton depart wasnt she supposed to cross your palm with silver nash asked morgana tilted her head the anger that had been directed solely at herself shot out of her eyes i dont profit from power he shrugged then walked toward her i hate to point it out but she twisted you around her finger a faint flush crept into her cheeks if there was anything she hated more than being weak it was being weak in public im aware of that lifting a hand he rubbed his thumb over her cheek to wipe away the faint smear of crimson mrs littleton had left there i figured witches would be tough i have a weak spot for the eccentric and the good hearted and youre not a sagittarius he was sorry he had to remove his thumb from her cheek her skin was as cool and smooth as milk no what then gemini his brow lifted and he stuck his hand in his pocket good guess his discomfort made her feel a little better i rarely guess since you were nice enough not to hurt her feelings i wont take out my annoyance on you why dont you come in the back ill brew us some tea she laughed when she saw his expression all right ill pour us some wine better he followed her through a door behind the counter into a room that served as storage office and kitchenette though it was a small area it didnt seem overly crowded shelves lined two walls and were stacked with boxes uncrated stock and books a curvy cherry desk held a brass lamp shaped like a mermaid an efficientlooking twoline phone and a pile of paperwork held in place by a flatbottomed glass that tossed out color and reflection beyond that was a childsize refrigerator a twoburner stove and a dropleaf table with two chairs in the single window pots of herbs were crowded and thriving he could smell he wasnt sure what sage perhaps and oregano with a homey trace of lavender whatever it was it was pleasant morgana took two clear goblets from a shelf over the sink have a seat she said i cant give you very much time but you might as well be comfortable she took a long slimnecked bottle out of the refrigerator and poured a pale golden liquid into the goblets no label its my own recipe with a smile she sipped first dont worry theres not a single eye of newt in it he would have laughed but the way she studied him over the rim of her glass was making him uneasy still he hated to refuse a challenge he took a sip the wine was cool faintly sweet and smooth as silk nice thank you she took the chair beside him i havent decided whether im going to help you or not but im interested in your craft particularly if youre going to incorporate mine into it you like the movies he said figuring that gave him a head start he hooked an arm around the back of the chair scratching luna absently with his foot as the cat wound around his legs among other things i enjoy the variety of human imagination okay but she went on interrupting him im not sure i want my personal views going hollywood we can talk he smiled again and again she understood that he was a power to be reckoned with as she considered that luna leapt onto the table for the first time nash noticed that the cat wore an etched round crystal around her neck look morgana im not trying to prove or disprove im not trying to change the world i just want to make a movie why horror and the occult why he shrugged his shoulders it always made him uncomfortable when people asked him to analyze i dont know maybe because when people go into a scary movie they stop thinking about the lousy day they had at the office after the opening scream his eyes lit with humor or maybe because the first time i got past first base with a girl was when she wrapped herself all over me during a midnight showing of carpenters halloween morgana sipped and considered maybe just maybe there was a sensitive soul under that smug exterior there certainly was talent and there was undeniably charm it bothered her that she felt pushed somehow pushed to agree well shed damn well say no if she chose to but shed test the waters first why dont you tell me about your story nash saw the opening and pounced i havent got one to speak of yet thats where you come in i like to have plenty of background i can get a lot of information out of books he spread his hands i already have some my research tends to overlap and take me into all areas of the occult what i want is the personal angle you know what made you get into witchcraft do you attend ceremonies what kind of trappings you prefer morgana ran a fingertip thoughtfully around the rim of the goblet im afraid youre starting off with the wrong impression youre making it sound as though i joined some sort of club coven club a group with the same interests i dont belong to a coven i prefer working alone interested he leaned forward why there are groups who are quite sincere and those who are not still others dabble in things best left locked black magic whatever name you give it and youre a white witch youre fond of labels with a restless move she picked up her wine again unlike nash she didnt mind discussing the essence of her craft but once she agreed to she expected to have her thoughts received respectfully were all born with certain powers nash yours is to tell entertaining stories and to attract women her lips curved as she sipped im sure you respect and employ your powers i do exactly the same what are yours she took her time setting her goblet down lifted her eyes to his the look she leveled at him made him feel like a fool for having asked the power was there the kind that could make a man crawl his mouth went so dry that the wine he was drinking could have been sand what would you like a performance the faintest hint of impatience had seeped into her tone he managed to draw a breath and shake himself out of what he would almost have thought was a trance if he believed in trances id love one maybe it was twitching the devils tail but he couldnt resist the color that temper brought to her cheeks made her skin glow like a freshly picked peach what did you have in mind she felt the quick unwelcome tug of desire it was distinctly annoying lightning bolts from the fingertips should i whistle up the wind or draw down the moon dealers choice the nerve of the man she thought as she rose the power humming hot in her blood it would serve him right if she morgana she whirled anger sizzling with an effort she tossed her hair back and relaxed ana nash couldnt have said why he felt as though hed just avoided a calamity of major proportions but he knew that for an instant his whole being had been so wrapped up in morgana that he wouldnt have felt an earthquake shed pulled him right in and now he was left a little dazed a little dullwitted staring at the slim blond woman in the doorway she was lovely and though a head shorter than morgana she exuded an odd kind of soothing strength her eyes were a soft calm gray and they were focused on morgana in her arms she carried a box that was overflowing with flowering herbs you didnt have the sign up anastasia said so i came in the front let me take that messages passed between the two women nash didnt have to hear them to know it ana this is nash kirkland nash my cousin anastasia im sorry to interrupt her voice low and warm was as soothing as her eyes youre not morgana said as nash got to his feet nash and i were just finished just beginning he told her but we can pick it up later nice to meet you he said to anastasia then he smiled at morgana and tucked her hair behind her ear till next time nash morgana set the box down and took out a small pot of blooms a gift she offered it and her sweetest smile sweet peas she explained to symbolize departure he couldnt resist leaning over the box he touched his lips to hers for the hell of it he sauntered out in spite of herself morgana chuckled anastasia settled into a chair with a contented sigh want to tell me about it nothing to tell hes a charming annoyance a writer with very typical views on witches oh that nash kirkland to please herself anastasia picked up morganas halffull goblet and sipped the one who wrote that gory movie you and sebastian dragged me to it was really quite intelligent and sly hmm anastasia drank again and gory then again youve always enjoyed that kind of thing watching evil is an entertaining way to reaffirm good she frowned unfortunately nash kirkland does very superior work that may be id rather watch the marx brothers automatically she walked over to check the herbs in morganas window i couldnt help but notice the tension you looked as if you were about to turn him into a toad when i walked in the thought gave morgana a moment of sterling pleasure i was tempted something about that smugness set me off youre too easily set off you did say you were going to work on control didnt you love scowling morgana snatched up nashs glass he walked out of here on two legs didnt he she sipped and realized instantly it was a mistake hed left too much of himself in the wine a powerful man she thought as she set the goblet down again despite the easy smile and the relaxed manner a very powerful man she wished shed thought to charm the flowers shed given him but she dismissed the idea immediately perhaps something was pushing them together but she would deal with it and she would deal with it and with nash kirkland without magic chapter contents prev next morgana enjoyed the peace of sunday afternoons it was her day to indulge herself and from her first breath morgana had appreciated indulgences not that she avoided work she had put a great deal of time and effort into seeing that her shop ran smoothly and turned a profit without using her special skills to smooth her path still she firmly believed that the proper reward for any effort was relaxation unlike some business owners morgana didnt agonize over books and inventory and overhead she simply did what she felt needed to be done making sure she did it well then when she walked away from it if only for an hour at a time she forgot business completely it amazed morgana that there were people who would spend a beautiful day inside biting their nails over ledgers she hired an accountant to do that she hadnt hired a housekeeper but only because she didnt care for the idea of someone poking through her personal things she and only she was their caretaker though her gardens were extensive and shed long ago accepted that she would never have the way with growing things that her cousin anastasia had she tended the blooms herself she found the cycle planting watering weeding harvesting rewarding she knelt now in a strong stream of sunlight at the extensive rockery where her herbs and spring bulbs thrived there was the scent of rosemary of hyacinth the delicacy of jasmine the richness of anise music drifted through the windows the penny whistles and flutes of a traditional irish folk tune clashing cheerfully with the surge and thrust of water spewing up from the rocks a few hundred yards behind her it was one of those precious and perfect days with the sky spread overhead like clear blue glass and the wind light and playful carrying the scents of water and wildflowers from beyond the low wall and sheltering trees at the front of her property she could hear the occasional swish of a car as tourists or natives took in the scenery luna was sprawled nearby in a patch of sunlight her eyes slitted nearly closed her tail switching occasionally as she watched birds if morgana werent there she might have tried for a snack for all her bulk she could move like lightning but her mistress was very firm about such habits when the dog padded over to drop his head into morganas lap luna gave a mutter of disgust and went to sleep dogs had no pride content morgana sat back on her heels ruffling the dogs fur with one hand as she surveyed her rockery perhaps she would pluck a few sprigs she was running low on angelica balm and hyssop powder tonight she decided if there was a moon such things were best done by moonlight for now she would enjoy the sun lifting her face to it letting its warmth and life pour over her skin she could never sit here without feeling the beauty of this spot this place where she had been born though she had traveled to many other lands seen many magic places it was here she belonged for it was here she had learned long ago that she would find love share love and bear her children with a sigh morgana closed her eyes those days could wait she mused she was content with her life precisely as it was when the time came for it to change she intended to remain fully in charge when the dog sprang to his feet a warning growl humming in his throat morgana didnt bother to look around shed known hed come she hadnt needed the crystal or the black mirror to tell her nor could she claim it was clairvoyance that was more her cousin sebastians territory shed needed only to be a woman to know she sat smiling while the dog sent out a series of rapid unfriendly barks she would see just how nash kirkland handled the situation how was a man supposed to react when the woman hed come to see was being guarded by a he was sure it couldnt really be a wolf but it sure as hell looked like one he was doubly sure that if she gave the word the sleek silver beast would take one long leap and go for his throat nash cleared that throat then jolted when something brushed his leg glancing down he noted that luna at least had decided to be friendly nice dog you got there he said cautiously nice big dog morgana deigned to glance over her shoulder out for a sunday drive more or less the dog had subsided into those low dangerous growls again nash felt a bead of sweat slide down his back as the mass of muscle and teeth stalked toward him to sniff at his shoes i ah then the dog looked up and nash was struck by the gleam of deep blue eyes against that silver fur god youre a beauty arent you he held out a hand sincerely hoping the dog would let him keep it it was sniffed thoroughly then rewarded with a lick lips pursed morgana studied them pan had never so much as nipped anyones ankle but neither was he given to making friends so quickly you have a way with animals nash was already crouched down to give the dog a brisk scratching all throughout his childhood hed yearned for a dog it surprised him to realize that his boyhood desire had never quite faded they know im just a kid at heart what breed is he pan her smile was slow and secret well just say hes a donovan what can i do for you nash he looked over she was in the sunlight her hair bundled under a widebrimmed straw hat her jeans were too tight and her tshirt was too baggy because she hadnt used gardening gloves her hands were smeared with rich dark earth her feet were bare it hadnt occurred to him that bare feet could be sexy until now besides that she said with such an easy ripple of amusement in her voice that he had to grin sorry my mind was wandering it didnt offend her to be found desirable why dont you start with telling me how you found me come on honey you know youve got a reputation he rose to walk over and sit on the grass beside her i had dinner in the place beside your shop struck up a conversation with my waitress ill bet you did he reached over to toy with the amulet she wore an interesting piece he thought shaped like a halfmoon and inscribed in greek arabic he was no scholar anyway she was a fount of information fascinated and spooked do you affect a lot of people that way legions and shed learned to enjoy it did she tell you that i ride over the bay on my broomstick every full moon close enough he let the amulet drop it interests me how ordinarily intelligent people allow themselves to get caught up in the supernatural isnt that how you make your living exactly and speaking of my living i figure you and i started off wrong how about a clean slate it was hard to be annoyed with an attractive man on a beautiful day how about it he thought it might be wise to take the conversation where he wanted by way of the back door you know a lot about flowers and stuff a few things she shifted to finish planting a fresh pot of lemon balm maybe you can tell me what ive got in my yard and what i should do about it hire a gardening service she said then she relented and smiled i suppose i might find time to take a look id really appreciate it he brushed at a smear of dirt on her chin you really could help me with the script morgana its no problem getting things out of books anyone can do that what im looking for is a different slant something more personal and i what is it you have stars in your eyes he murmured little gold stars like sunlight on a midnight sea but you cant have the sun at midnight you can have anything if you know how to get it those fabulous eyes held his he couldnt have looked away to save his soul tell me what you want nash to give people a couple of enjoyable hours to know theyll forget problems reality everything when they step into my world a good storys like a door and you can go through it whenever you need to after youve read it or seen it or heard it you can still go back through it once its yours its always yours he broke off startled and embarrassed this kind of philosophizing didnt fit in with his carefree image hed had expert interviewers dig at him for hours without unearthing a statement as simple and genuine as that and all shed done was ask and of course i want to make pots of money he added trying to grin his head felt light his skin too warm i dont see that one desire has to be exclusive of the other there have been storytellers in my family from the fairy days down to my mother we understand the value of stories perhaps that was why she hadnt dismissed him from the outset she respected what he did that too was in her blood consider this she leaned forward and he felt the punch of something in his gut something that went beyond her beauty if i agree to help you i refuse to let you fall back on the least common denominator the old crone cackling as she mixes henbane in the cauldron he smiled convince me be careful what you dare nash she murmured rising come inside im thirsty since he was no longer worried about being chewed up by her guard dog who was now strolling contentedly beside them nash took time to admire her house he already knew that many of the homes along the monterey peninsula were extraordinary and unique hed bought one himself morganas had the added allure of age and grace it was three stories of stone turreted and towered to suit a witch he supposed but it was neither gothic nor grim tall graceful windows flashed in the sunlight and climbing flowers crept up the walls to twine and tangle in lacy ironwork carved into the stone were winged fairies and mermaids adding charm lovely robed figures served as rainspouts interior scene night he mused inside the topmost tower of the old stone house by the sea the beautiful young witch sits in a ring of candles the room is shadowy with the light fluttering over the faces of statues the stems of silver goblets a clear orb of crystal she wears a sheer white robe open to the waist a heavy carved amulet hangs between the swell of her breasts a deep hum seems to come from the stones themselves as she lifts two photographs high in the air the candles flicker a wind rises within the closed room to lift her hair and ripple the robe she chants ancient words in a low smoldering voice she touches the photos to the candle flame no scratch that she yeah she sprinkles the photos with the glowing liquid from a cracked blue bowl a hiss of steam the humming takes on a slow sinuous beat her body sways with it as she places the photos facetoface laying them on a silver tray a secret smile crosses her face as the photos fuse together fade out he liked it though he figured she could add a bit more color to the casting of a love spell content with his silence morgana took him around the side of the house where the sound of water on rock rumbled and the cypress grove trees bent and gnarled by time and wind stood watch they crossed a stone patio shaped like a pentagram at whose top point stood a brass statue of a woman water gurgled in a tiny pool at her feet whos she nash asked she has many names moving to the statue morgana took up a small ladle dipped it in the clear pool she sipped then poured the rest onto the ground for the goddess without a word she crossed the patio again and entered a sunny spotless kitchen do you believe in a creator the question surprised him yeah sure i suppose he shifted uncomfortably while she walked across a white tiled floor to the sink to rinse her hands this your witchcraft its a religious thing she smiled as she took out a pitcher of lemonade lifes a religious thing but dont worry nash i wont try to convert you she filled two glasses with ice it shouldnt make you uncomfortable your stories are invariably about good and evil people are always making choices whether to be one or the other what about you she offered him his glass then turned to walk through an archway and out of the kitchen you could say im always trying to check my less attractive impulses she shot him a look it doesnt always work as she spoke she led him down a wide hallway the walls were decorated with faded tapestries depicting scenes from folklore and mythology ornate sconces and etched plates of silver and copper she opted for what her grandmother had always called the drawing room its walls were painted a warm rose and the tone was picked up in the pattern of the bokhara rug tossed over the wideplanked chestnut floor a lovely adam mantel draped over the fireplace which was stacked with wood ready to be put to flame should the night turn cool or should morgana wish it but for now a light breeze played through the open windows billowing the sheer curtains and bringing with it the scents of her gardens as in her shop there were crystals clusters and wands scattered around the room along with a partial collection of her sculpture pewter wizards bronze fairies porcelain dragons great stuff he ran his hand over the strings of a gold lap harp the sound it made was soft and sweet do you play when im in the mood it amused her to watch him move around the room toying with this examining that she appreciated honest curiosity he picked up a scribed silver goblet and sniffed smells like hellfire she suggested he set it down again preferring a slender amethyst wand crusted with stones and twined with silver threads magic wand naturally be careful what you wish for she told him taking it delicately from his hand he shrugged and turned away missing the way the wand glowed before morgana put it aside ive collected a lot of this kind of thing myself you might like to see he bent over a clear glass ball and saw his own reflection i picked up a shamans mask at an auction last month and a what do you call it a scrying mirror looks like we have something in common a taste in art she sat on the arm of the couch and literature he was poking through a bookshelf lovecraft bradbury ive got this edition of the golden dawn stephen king hunter brown mccaffrey hey is this he pulled out the volume and opened it reverently its a first edition of bram stokers dracula he looked over at her will you take my right arm for it ill have to get back to you on that i always hoped hed have approved of midnight blood as he slipped the book back into place another caught his eyes four golden balls the faerie king he skimmed a finger over the slim volumes whistle up the wind youve got her entire collection envy stirred in his blood and in first editions you read bryna are you kidding it was too much like meeting an old friend he had to touch to look even to sniff ive read everything shes written a dozen times anyone who thinks theyre just for kids is nuts its like poetry and magic and morality all rolled into one and of course the illustrations are fabulous id kill for a piece of the original artwork but she just wont sell interested morgana tilted her head have you asked ive filtered some pitiful pleas through her agent no dice she lives in some castle in ireland and probably papers the walls with her sketches i wish he turned at morganas quiet laugh actually she keeps them in thick albums waiting for the grandchildren she hopes for donovan he tucked his thumbs in his pockets bryna donovan thats your mother yes and shed be delighted to know you approve of her work she lifted her glass from one storyteller to another my parents lived in this house off and on for several years actually she wrote her first published work upstairs while she was pregnant with me she always says i insisted she write the story down does your mother believe youre a witch it would be better to ask her that yourself if you get the opportunity youre being evasive again he walked over to sprawl comfortably on the couch beside her it was impossible not to be comfortable with a woman who surrounded herself with things he himself loved lets put it this way does your family have any problem with your interests she appreciated the way he relaxed legs stretched body at ease as if hed been making himself at home on her couch for years my family has always understood the need to focus energies in an individual direction do your parents have a problem with your interests i never knew them my parents im sorry the mocking light in her eyes turned instantly to sympathy her family had always been her center she could hardly imagine living without them it wasnt a big deal but he rose again uneasy with the way shed laid a comforting hand on his shoulder hed come too far from the bad old days to want any sympathy im interested in your familys reactions i mean how would most parents feel what would they do if they found their kid casting spells did you decide to start dabbling as a child sympathy vanished like a puff of smoke dabbling she repeated eyes slitted i may want to have a prologue you know showing how the main character got involved he was paying less attention to her than to the room itself the atmosphere as he worked out his thoughts he paced not nervously not even restlessly but in a way that made it obvious that he was taking stock of everything he could see maybe she gets pushed around by the kid next door and turns him into a frog he continued oblivious to the fact that morganas jaw had tensed or she runs into some mysterious woman who passes on the power i kind of like that as he roamed he played with ideas slender threads that could be woven into whole cloth for a story im just not sure of the angle i want to use so i figured wed start by playing it straight you tell me what started you off books you read whatever then i can twist it to work as fiction she was going to have to watch her temper and watch it carefully when she spoke her voice was soft and carried a ring that made him stop in the center of the rug i was born with elvish blood i am a hereditary witch and my heritage traces back to finn of the celts my power is a gift passed on from generation to generation when i find a man of strength well make children between us and they will carry it beyond me he nodded impressed thats great so she didnt want to play it straight he thought hed humor her the stuff about elvish blood had terrific possibilities so when did you first realize you were a witch the tone of his voice had her temper slipping a notch the room shook as she fought it back nash snatched her off the couch so quickly that she didnt have time to protest hed pulled her toward the doorway when the shaking stopped just a tremor he said but he kept his arms around her i was in san francisco during the last big one because he felt like an idiot he gave her a lopsided grin i havent been able to be casual about a shake since so he thought it was an earth tremor just as well morgana decided there was absolutely no reason for her to lose her temper or to expect him to accept her for what she was in any case it was sweet the way hed jumped to protect her you could move to the midwest tornados since he was here and so was she he saw no reason to resist running his hands up her back he enjoyed the way she leaned into the stroke like a cat morgana tilted her head back staying angry seemed a waste of time when her heart gave such an eager leap it was perhaps unwise of them to test each other this way but wisdom was often bland the east coast she said letting her own hands skim up his chest blizzards he nudged her closer wondering for just an instant why she seemed to meld with him so perfectly body to body the south she twined her arms around his neck watching him steadily through a fringe of dark lashes hurricanes he tipped the hat off her head so that her hair tumbled down to fill his hands like warm silk disasters are everywhere he murmured might as well stay put and deal with the one mats yours you wont deal with me nash she brushed her lips teasingly over his but youre welcome to try he took her mouth confidently he didnt consider women a disaster perhaps he should have it was more turbulent than any earthquake more devastating than any storm he didnt feel the ground tremble or hear the wind roar but he knew the moment her lips parted beneath his that he was being pulled in by some irresistible force that man had yet to put a name to she was molded against him soft and warm as melted wax if hed believed in such things he might have said her body had been fashioned for just this purpose to mate perfectly with his his hands streaked under her loose shirt to race over the smooth skin of her back to press her even closer to make sure she was real and not some daydream some fantasy he could taste the reality but even that had some kind of dreamy midnight flavor her mouth yielded silkily under his even as her arms locked like velvet cords around his neck a sound floated on the air something she murmured something he couldnt understand yet he thought he sensed surprise in the whisper and perhaps a little fear before it ended with a sigh she was a woman who enjoyed the tastes and textures of a man she had never been taught to be ashamed of taking pleasure with the right man at the right time she hadnt ever learned to fear her own sexuality but to celebrate it cherish it and respect it and yet now for the first time she felt the sly quickening of fear with a man the simplicity of a kiss filled a basic need but there was nothing simple in this how could it be simple when excitement and unease were dancing together along her skin she wanted to believe that the power came from her was in her she was responsible for this whirlwind of sensation that surrounded them conjuring was often as quick as a wish as strong as the will but the fear was there and she knew it came from the knowledge that this was something beyond her reach out of her control past her reckoning she knew that spells could be cast on the strong as well as the weak to break a charm took care and action she slid out of his arms moving slowly deliberately not for an instant would she let him see that he had had power over her she closed a hand over her amulet and felt steadier nash felt like the last survivor of a train wreck he jammed his hands in his pockets to keep himself from grabbing her again he didnt mind playing with fire he just liked to be sure he was the one holding the match he knew damn well whod been in charge of that little experiment and it wasnt nash kirkland you play around with hypnosis he asked her she was fine morgana told herself she was just fine but she sat on the couch again it took an effort but she managed a smile that was sultry around the edges did i mesmerize you nash flustered he paced to the window and back i just want to be sure when i kiss you that its my idea her head came up the pride that swam in her blood was something else that was ageless you can have all the ideas you like i dont have to resort to magic to make a man want me she lifted a finger to touch the heat hed left on her lips and if i decided to have you youd be more than willing under her finger her lips curved then youd be grateful he didnt doubt it and that scraped at his pride if i said something like that to you youd claim i was sexist and egocentric lazily she picked up her glass the truth has nothing to do with sex or ego the white cat jumped soundlessly on the back of the couch without taking her eyes off nash morgana lifted a hand and stroked lunas head if youre unwilling to take the risk we can break off our creative partnership you think im afraid of you the absurdity of it put him in a slightly better mood babe i stopped letting my glands do the thinking a long time ago im relieved to hear it id hate to think of you as some calculating womans love slave the point is he said between his teeth if were going to work this out wed better have some rules he had to be out of his mind nash decided five minutes ago he had had a gorgeous sexy incredibly delicious woman in his arms and now he was trying to think up ways to keep her from seducing him no lips pursed morgana considered im not very good with rules youll just have to take your chances but ill make a deal with you i wont lure you into any compromising situations if youll stop taking smug little potshots at witchcraft she combed her hair back with her fingers it irritates me and i sometimes do things i regret when im irritated i have to ask questions then learn to accept the answers calm but determined she rose i dont lie or at least i rarely do im not sure why ive decided to share my business with you perhaps because theres something appealing about you and certainly because i have a great deal of respect for a teller of tales you have a strong aura and a questing if cynical brain along with a great deal of talent and perhaps because those closest to me have approved of you such as anastasia and luna and pan theyre all excellent judges of character so hed passed muster with a cousin a cat and a dog is anastasia also a witch her eyes remained steady well discuss me and the craft in general anas business is her own all right when do we start they already had she thought and nearly sighed i dont work on sundays you can come by tomorrow night at nine not midnight sorry he said quickly force of habit id like to use a tape recorder if thats all right of course should i bring anything else tongue of bat and some wolfbane she smiled sorry force of habit he laughed and kissed her chastely on the cheek i like your style morgana well see she waited until sundown then dressed in a thin white robe forewarned was always best shed told herself when shed finally broken down and slipped into the room at the top of the tower she didnt like to admit that nash was important enough to worry about but since she was worrying she might as well see she cast the protective circle lit the candles drawing in the scent of sandalwood and herbs she knelt in the center and lifted her arms fire water earth and wind not to break and not to mend only now to let me see as i will so mote it be the power slid inside her like breath clean and cool she lifted the sphere of clear crystal cupping it in both hands so that the light from the candles flickered over it smoke light shadow the globe swam with them and then as if a wind had blown cleared to a pure dazzling white within she saw the cypress grove the ancient and mystical trees filtering moonlight onto the forest floor she could smell the wind could hear it and the call of the sea some said was the goddess singing candlelight in the room inside the globe herself in the room inside the globe she wore the white ceremonial robe belted with a rope of crystals her hair was unbound her feet were bare the fire had been lit by her hand by her will and it burned as cool as the moonlight it was a night for celebration an owl hooted she turned saw its white wings flash and cut the dark like knives she watched it glide off into the shadows then she saw him he stepped away from the trunk of a cypress into the clearing his eyes were full of her desire demand destiny trapped in the sphere morgana held out her arms and took nash into her embrace the walls of the tower room echoed with one brief curse betrayed by herself morgana threw up a hand the candles winked out she stayed where she was sulking in the dark she cursed herself thinking shed have been better off not knowing a few miles away nash woke from a catnap hed taken in front of a blaring television groggy he rubbed his hands over his face and struggled to sit up hell of a dream he thought as he worked out the kinks in his neck vivid enough to make him ache in several sensitive areas and it was his own fault he decided on a yawn as he reached absently for the bowl of popcorn hed burned he hadnt made enough of an effort to get morgana out of his mind so if he was going to end up fantasizing about watching her do some kind of witch dance in the woods about peeling her out of white silk and making love with her on the soft ground in the moonlight he had no one to blame but himself he gave a quick shudder and groped for his lukewarm beer it was the damnedest thing he mused he could have sworn he smelled candles burning chapter contents prev next morgana was already annoyed when she turned into her driveway monday evening an expected shipment had been delayed in chicago and shed spent the last hour on the phone trying to track it down she was tempted to deal with the matter her own way nothing irked her more than ineptitude but she was fully aware that such impulses often caused complications as it was shed lost valuable time and it was nearly dusk before she parked her car shed hoped for a quiet walk among the trees to clear her mind and yes damn it to settle her nerves before she dealt with nash but that wasnt to be she sat for a moment scowling at the gleaming blackandchrome motorcycle in front of her car sebastian perfect just what she didnt need luna slid out of the car ahead of her to pad up the drive and rub herself against the harleys back wheel you would morgana said in disgust as she slammed the door as long as its a man luna muttered something that sounded uncomplimentary and stalked on ahead pan greeted them both at the front door with his wise eyes and his loving tongue while luna moved on ignoring him morgana took a moment to stroke his fur before tossing her purse aside she could hear the soft strains of beethoven drifting from her stereo she found sebastian exactly where shed expected he was sprawled on her couch booted feet comfortably crossed on her coffee table his eyes halfclosed and a glass of wine in his hand his smile might have devastated an ordinary woman with the way it shifted the planes and angles of his dusky face curved those sculptured sensuous lips deepened the color of the heavylidded eyes that were as tawny and sharp as lunas lazily he lifted a long leanfingered hand in an ancient sign of greeting morgana my own true love hed always been too handsome for his own good she thought even as a boy make yourself at home cousin thank you darling he raised his glass to her the wines excellent yours or anas mine my compliments he rose graceful as a dancer it always irritated her that she had to tilt her head to keep her eyes level with his at sixthree he had five full inches on her here you go he passed her the glass you look like you could use it ive had an annoying day he grinned i know she would have sipped but her teeth had clenched you know i hate it when you poke into my mind i didnt have to in a gesture of truce he spread his hands a ring with a square amethyst and intricately twisted gold winked on his little finger you were sending out signals you know how loud you get when youre annoyed then i must be screaming now since she wasnt drinking the wine he took it back darling i havent seen you since candlemas his eyes were laughing at her havent you missed me the hell of it was she had no matter how often sebastian teased her and hed been doing it since she was in the cradle she enjoyed him but that wasnt any reason to be too friendly too soon ive been busy so i hear he chucked her under the chin because he knew it annoyed her tell me about nash kirkland fury snapped into her eyes damn you sebastian you keep your psychic fingers out of my brain i didnt peek he made a good show of looking offended im a seer an artist not a voyeur ana told me oh she pouted a moment sorry she knew that at least since hed gained some maturity and control sebastian rarely invaded anyones private thoughts unless he considered it necessary well theres nothing to tell hes a writer i know that havent i enjoyed his movies whats his business with you research he wants a witch tale tale as in story i hope she fought back a chuckle dont be crude sebastian just looking out for my baby cousin well dont she tugged hard on a lock of his hair that lay over his collar i can look after myself and hes going to be here in a couple of hours so good thatll give you time to feed me he swung a friendly arm over her shoulders hed decided shed have to blast him out of the house to make him leave before meeting the writer i talked to my parents over the weekend by phone his eyes widened in shock when he spoke the faint wisps of ireland that occasionally surfaced in his voice enlivened his tone really morgana you know how much they charge you for overseas calls they positively soak you laughing she slipped an arm around his waist all right ill give you some dinner and you can catch me up she could never stay annoyed with him after all he was family when one was different family was sometimes all that could be relied on they ate in the kitchen while he told her of the latest exploits of her parents her aunts and uncles by the end of an hour she was completely relaxed again its been years since ive seen ireland by moonlight morgana murmured take a trip you know theyd all love to see you maybe i will for the summer solstice we could all go you anastasia and me maybe sighing she pushed her plate aside the problem is summers my business time youre the one who tied yourself up with free enterprise there was the better part of a pork chop on her plate sebastian stabbed it and ate it himself i like it really meeting people even though some of them are weird he topped off their wineglasses such as she smiled and leaned forward on her elbows there was this little pest he came around day after day for weeks he claimed that he recognized me from another incarnation a pathetic line yes fortunately he was wrong id never met him before in any life one night a couple of weeks ago when i was closing up he burst in and made a very strong sloppy pass hmm sebastian finished off the last bite of pork he was well aware that his cousin could take care of herself that didnt stop him from being annoyed that some pseudonew ager had put the moves on her whatd you do punched him in the stomach she lifted her shoulders as sebastian laughed style morgana you have such style you didnt turn him into a bullfrog all dignity she straightened you know i dont work that way what about jimmy pakipsky that was different i was only thirteen she couldnt fight back the grin besides i turned him right back to a nasty little boy again only because ana pleaded his case sebastian gestured with his fork and you left the warts on it was the least i could do she reached out to grab his hand damn it sebastian i have missed you his fingers curled tight around hers and ive missed you and anastasia she felt something their bond was too old and too deep for her to miss it what is it love nothing we can change he kissed her fingers lightly then let them go he hadnt intended to think about it or to let his guard down enough to have his cousin tune in got anything with whipped cream around here but she shook her head she had picked up grief though he was skilled enough to block it from her now she refused to let it pass the case you were working on the little boy whod been kidnapped the pain was sudden and sharp he forced it away again they didnt get to him in time the san francisco police did everything they could but the kidnappers had panicked he was only eight years old im sorry there was a wave of sorrow his and her own she rose to go over and curl into his lap oh sebastian im so sorry you cant let it get to you seeking comfort he rubbed his cheek against her hair he could feel the sharper edges of his regret dulling because she shared it with him itll eat you up if you do but damn it i got so close to that kid when something like this happens you wonder why why youve been given this gift if you cant make a difference you have made a difference she cupped his face in her hands her eyes were wet and strong i cant count the times youve made a difference it wasnt meant to be this time it hurts i know gently she stroked his hair im glad you came to me he hugged her tight then drew her back look i came here to mooch a meal and have a few laughs not to dump im sorry dont be an ass her voice was so brusque that he had to chuckle all right if you want to make me feel better how about that whipped cream she gave him a smacking kiss between the eyes how about a hot fudge sundae my hero she rose and knowing sebastians appetites got out an enormous bowl she also knew she would help him more by saying nothing else about the case he would struggle past it and go on because there was no other way flicking her mind toward the living room she switched channels on the stereo moving from classical to rock better sebastian said and propped his feet on an empty chair so are you going to tell me why youre helping this kirkland with research it interests me she heated a jar of fudge sauce in the conventional way she used the microwave do you mean he interests you somewhat she scooped out a small mountain of french vanilla of course he doesnt believe in anything supernatural he just exploits it for movies i dont have a problem with that really thoughtful she licked ice cream from her thumb with the movies i mean theyre very entertaining his attitude now well i might have to adjust it before were through dangerous ground cousin hell sebastian lifes dangerous ground she poured a river of sauce over the mountain of ice cream we might as well have some fun with it to prove her point she covered the entire confectionary landscape with heaping clouds of whipped cream with a flourish she set the bowl in front of sebastian no nuts she slapped a spoon into his hand i dont like nuts and youre sharing after sitting again she dug deep into the sundae youd probably like him she said with her mouth full nash he has that relaxed sort of arrogance men think is so manly which of course it was she thought resentfully and obviously he has a very fluid imagination hes good with animals pan and luna reacted very favorably hes a big fan of mothers has a nice sense of humor a good brain and he drives a very sexy car sounds like youre smitten if she hadnt just swallowed she would have choked dont be insulting just because i find him interesting and attractive doesnt mean im as you so pitifully put it smitten she was sulking sebastian noted pleased it was always a good sign the closer morgana got to anger the easier it was to slide information out of her so have you looked of course i looked she shot back merely as a precaution you looked because you were nervous nervous dont be ridiculous but she began to drum her fingers on the table hes just a man and you despite your gifts are a woman shall i tell you what happens when men and women get together she curled her fingers into fists to keep from doing something drastic i know the facts of life thank you if i do take him as a lover its my business and perhaps my pleasure happy that shed lost interest in the ice cream sebastian nodded as he ate trouble is theres always a risk of falling in love with a lover tread carefully morgana theres a difference between love and lust she replied primly from his spot under the table pan lifted his head and gave a soft woof speaking of which eyes full of warning morgana rose behave yourself sebastian i mean it dont worry about me go answer the door the bell rang a heartbeat later chuckling to himself sebastian watched her stalk off damn it morgana thought when shed opened the front door he looked so cute his hair was tumbled by the wind he carried a battered knapsack over one shoulder and had a hole in the knee of his jeans hi i guess im a little early its all right come in and sit down i just have a little mess to clear up in the kitchen what a way to speak about your cousin sebastian strolled down the hall carrying the bowl of rapidly depleting ice cream hello he gave nash a friendly nod you must be kirkland morgana narrowed her eyes but spoke pleasantly enough nash my cousin sebastian he was just leaving oh i can stay for a minute ive enjoyed your work thank you dont i know you his gaze changed from mild to shrewd as he studied sebastian the psychic right sebastians lips quirked guilty ive followed some of your cases even some hardboiled cops give you the credit for the arrest of the yuppie killer up in seattle maybe you could sebastian hates to talk shop morgana told him there were dire threats in her eyes when she turned them on her cousin dont you actually im so glad you could stop by darling a quick jolt of power passed as she snatched the bowl out of his hands dont be a stranger he gave in thinking it was still early enough to stop by anastasias and discuss morganas current situation in depth take care love he gave her a long kiss lingering over it until he felt nashs thoughts darken blessed be blessed be morgana returned automatically and all but shoved him out the door now if youll just give me a minute we can get started she tossed her hair back pleased when she heard him gun the engine of his motorcycle would you like some tea his brows were knitted and his hands in his pockets id rather have coffee he trailed after her as she walked toward the kitchen what kind of a cousin is he sebastian often an annoying one no i mean in the kitchen he frowned at the remnants of their cozy dinner for two is he a first cousin or one of the threetimesremoved sort she set an oldfashioned iron kettle on the stove to heat then started to load a very modem dishwasher our fathers are brothers catching nashs look of relief nearly had her chuckling in this life she couldnt help but add in this oh sure he set his knapsack aside so youre into reincarnation into it morgana repeated well thats apt enough in any case my father sebastians and anas were born in ireland theyre triplets no kidding he leaned a hip on the table as she opened a small tin thats almost as good as being the seventh son of a seventh son with a shake of her head she measured out herbs for tea such things arent always necessary they married three sisters she went on triplets also nash rubbed pans head when the dog leaned against his leg thats great an unusual arrangement some might say but they recognized each other and their destiny she glanced back with a smile before she set a small pot of tea aside to steep they were fated to have only one child apiece a disappointment to them in some ways between the six of them they had a great deal of love and would have showered it over quantities of children but it wasnt meant she added a pot of coffee to a silver tray where shed arranged delicate china cups along with a creamer and sugar bowl both in the shape of grinning skulls ill carry it in nash told her as he hefted the tray he glanced down heirlooms novelty shop i thought theyd amuse you she led the way into the drawing room where luna was curled in the center of the sofa morgana chose the cushion beside her and gestured for nash to set the tray on the table cream and sugar she asked both thanks watching her use the grim containers he was amused i bet youre a stitch around halloween she offered him a cup children come for miles to be treated by the witch or try to trick her and her fondness for children had her postponing her own all hallows eve celebration every year until the last goody bag had been filled i think some of them are disappointed that i dont wear a pointed hat and ride out on my broomstick the silver band on her finger winked in the lamplight as she poured a delicate amber tea brewed from jasmine flowers most people have one of two views on witches its either the hookednosed crone passing out poisoned apples or the glittering spirit with a starshaped wand telling you theres no place like home im afraid i dont fit either category exactly why youre what i need after setting his cup aside he dug in his knapsack okay he asked setting his tape recorder on the table sure he punched the record button then dug again i spent the day slogging through books the library bookstores he offered her a slim softcover volume what do you think about this one brow arched morgana studied the title fame fortune and romance candle rituals for every need she dropped the book into his lap smartly enough to make him wince i hope you didnt pay much for it sixninetyfive and it comes off my taxes you dont go in for this sort of thing then patience she told herself slipping off her shoes and curling up her legs the little red skirt she wore slid up to midthigh lighting candles and reciting clever little chants do you really believe that any layman can perform magic by reading a book you gotta learn somewhere snarling she snatched it up again flipped it open to arouse jealousy she read disgusted to win the love of a woman to obtain money she slapped it down again think about this nash and be grateful it doesnt work for everyone youre a little strapped for cash bills are piling up youd really like to have that new car but the credits exhausted so light a few candles make a wish maybe dance naked for effect abracadabra she spread her hands you find yourself getting a check for ten thousand only problem is your beloved grandmother had to die to leave it to you okay so youve got to be careful how you phrase your charm follow me here she said with a toss of her head actions have consequences you wish your husband were more romantic shazam hes suddenly a regular don juan with every woman in town but youll be noble and cast a charm to stop a war it works just fine but as a result dozens of others spring up she let out a huff of breath magic is not for the unprepared or the irresponsible and it certainly cant be learned out of some silly book okay impressed by her reasoning he held up both hands im convinced my point was that i could buy this in a bookstore for seven bucks people are interested people have always been interested when she shifted her hair slid down over her shoulder there have been times when their interest caused them to be hanged burned or drowned she sipped her tea were a bit more civilized today thats the thing he agreed thats why i want to write the story about now now when weve got cellular phones and microwave ovens fax machines and voice mail and people are still fascinated with magic i can go a couple of ways use lunatics who sacrifice goats not with my help okay i figured that anyway thats too easy too ah ordinary ive been thinking about leaning more toward the comic angle i used in rest in peace maybe adding some romance not just sex luna had crawled into his lap and he was stroking her running long fingers down her spine the idea is to focus on a woman this gorgeous woman who happens to have a little extra how does she deal with men with a job with i dont know grocery shopping she has to know other witches what do they talk about what do they do for laughs when did you decide you were a witch probably when i levitated out of my crib morgana said mildly and watched laughter form in his eyes thats just the kind of thing i want he settled back and luna draped herself over his legs like a lap rug mustve sent your mother into shock she was prepared for it when she shifted her knees brushed his thigh he didnt figure there was anything magical about the quick flare of heat he felt it was straight chemistry i told you i was a hereditary witch right his tone had her taking a deep breath so did it ever bother you thinking you were different knowing i was different she corrected of course as a child it was more difficult to control power one often loses control through emotion in the same way a woman might lose control of the intellect with certain men he wanted to reach out and touch her hair but he thought better of it does it happen often losing control she remembered the way it had felt the day before with his mouth on hers not as often as it did before i matured i have a problem with temper and i sometimes do things i regret but there is something no responsible witch forgets an it harm none she quoted power must never be used to hurt so youre a serious and responsible witch and you cast love spells for your customers her chin shot out certainly not you took those pictures that womans niece and the geometry heartthrob he didnt miss a trick morgana thought in disgust she didnt give me much choice because she was embarrassed she set down her cup with a snap and just because i took the pictures doesnt mean im about to sprinkle them both with moondust is that how it works yes but she bit her tongue youre making fun of me why do you ask questions when youre not going to believe the answers i dont have to believe them to be interested and he was very he found himself sliding a few inches closer so you didnt do anything about the prom i didnt say that she sulked a little while he gave in and toyed with her hair i simply removed a small barrier anything else would have been interference what barrier he didnt have a clue as to what moondust might smell like but he thought it would carry the same perfume as her hair the girls desperately shy i only gave her confidence a tiny boost the rest is up to her she had a beautiful neck slim and graceful he imagined what it would be like to nibble on it for an hour or two business he reminded himself stick to business is that how you work giving boosts she turned her head and looked directly into his eyes it depends on the situation ive been reading a lot witches used to be considered the wise women of the villages making potions charming foretelling events healing the sick my speciality isnt healing or seeing what is your speciality magic whether it was a matter of pride or annoyance she wasnt sure but she sent thunder walking across the sky nash glanced toward the window sounds like a storm coming could be why dont i answer some of your questions so you can beat it home damn it she wanted him gone she knew what shed seen in the scrying ball and that with care with skill such things could sometimes be changed but whatever was to be she didnt want things moving so fast and the way he was touching her just those long fingertips to her hair had little flicks of fear lighting in her gut that made her angry no hurry he said easily wondering whether if he took a chance and kissed her again hed experience that same otherworldly sensation i dont mind a little rain its going to pour she muttered to herself shed damn well see to it some of your books might be helpful she began giving you history and recorded facts a general outline of rituals she poked a finger at the first one hed given her not this one there are certain trappings that are used in the craft graveyard dirt she rolled her eyes oh please come on morgana its a great visual he shifted slipping a hand over hers wanting her to see as he saw exterior scene night our beautiful heroine wading through the fog crossing over the shadows of headstones an owl screams in the distance echoes the long ululant howl of a dog closeup of that pale perfect face framed by a dark hood she stops by a fresh grave and chanting sifts a handful of newly turned earth into her magic pouch thunder claps fade out she tried really tried not to be offended imagine anyone thinking she skulked around graveyards nash im trying to remember that what you do is entertainment and youre certainly entitled to a great deal of artistic license he had to kiss her fingers really had to so you dont spend much time in cemeteries she snagged her temper and a bolt of desire ill accept the fact that you dont believe what i am but i will not i absolutely will not tolerate being laughed at dont be so intense he brushed the hair off her shoulder and gave the back of her neck a quick massage i admit i usually do a better job at this hell i did twelve hours of interviews with this whackedout rumanian who swore he was a vampire didnt have a mirror in the house he made me wear a cross the whole time not to mention the garlic nash remembered with a grimace anyway i didnt have a problem humoring him and he was a treasure chest of information but you but me she prompted doing her best to ignore the fact that he was trailing a finger up her arm with the same skill and sensuousness he had used to stroke luna i just cant buy it morgana youre a strong intelligent woman youve got style taste not to mention the fact that you smell terrific i just cant pretend to believe that you believe all this her blood was starting to boil she would not simply could not tolerate the fact that he could infuriate her and seduce her at the same time is that what you do to get what you want pretend when some ninetyyearold woman tells me her lover was shot as a werewolf in im not going to call her a liar i figure either shes a hell of a storyteller or she believes it either way its fine with me as long as you get the angle for your movie thats my living illusion and it doesnt hurt anyone oh im sure it doesnt not when you walk away then have a few drinks with the boys and laugh about the lunatic you interviewed her eyes were flaming try it with me nash and youll get warts on your tongue because he could see that she was really angry he swallowed his grin all im saying is i know youve got a lot of data a lot of facts and fantasy which is exactly what im looking for i figure building a reputation as a witch probably adds fifty percent to your sales annually its a great hook you just dont have to play the game with me you think i pretend to be a witch to increase sales she was getting slowly to her feet afraid that if she stayed too close she might do him bodily harm i dont hey he jumped when luna dug her claws into his thighs morgana and her cat exchanged looks of approval you sit in my home and call me a charlatan a liar and a thief no he unhooked himself from the cat and stood thats not what i meant at all i just meant that you can be straight with me straight with you she began to pace the room trying and failing to regain control on one hand he was seducing her without her willing it and on the other he was sneering at her he thought she was a fraud why the insolent jackass was lucky she didnt have him braying and twitching twelveinch ears smiling wickedly she turned you want me to be straight with you the smile relieved him a little hed been afraid shed start throwing things i just want you to know you can relax you give me the facts and ill take care of the fiction relax she said with a nod thats a good idea we should both relax her eyes glowed as she stepped toward him why dont we have a fire nothing like a cozy fire to help you relax good idea and definitely a sexy one ill light it oh no she laid a hand on his arm allow me she whirled away flung out both arms toward the hearth she felt the cool clear knowledge whip through her blood it was an ancient skill one of the first mastered one of the last to be lost with age her eyes then her mind focused on the dry wood in the next moment flames erupted with a roar logs snapped smoke billowed pleased she banked it so that the hearth glowed with the cheerful blaze lowering her arms she turned back it delighted her to see not only that nash was white as a sheet but also that his mouth had yet to close better she asked sweetly he sat on the cat luna howled her disapproval and stalked off despite his muttered apology i think you look like you could use a drink on a roll now morgana held out a hand a decanter hopped off a table five feet away and landed on her palm brandy no he let out a deep breath thanks i believe i will she snapped her fingers a snifter drifted over and hung suspended in midair while she poured it was showing off she knew but it was immensely satisfying sure you dont want some yeah with a shrug she sent the decanter back glass clinked lightly against wood as it landed now she said curling on the couch beside him where were we hallucination he thought hypnosis he opened his mouth but all he could manage was a stutter morgana was still smiling that sleek cat smile at him special effects it was suddenly so clear he laughed at his own stupidity gotta be a wire he said and rose to look for himself hell of a trick babe absolutely firstrate you had me for a minute did i really she murmured i hired some of the f x guys to help me with this party last year you should have seen some of the stuff we pulled off he picked up the decanter looking for trips and levers all he found was old irish crystal and smooth wood with a shrug he walked over to crouch in front of the fire he suspected shed had a small charge set under the wood something she could set off with a small device in the palm of her hand inspired he sprang up how about this we bring this guy into town hes a scientist and he falls for her then drives himself crazy trying to explain everything she does make it logical his mind was leaping ahead maybe he sneaks into one of her ceremonies you ever been to one shed exorcised the temper and she found only humor in its place naturally great you can give me inside stuff we could have him see her do something offthewall levitate or this fire bit was good we could have this bonfire and she lights it without a match but he doesnt know for sure if its a trick or real neither does the audience she let the brandy slide warm into her system temper tantrums were so exhausting whats the point of the story besides some chills and thrills i think its a matter of can this guy this regular guy deal with the fact that hes in love with a witch suddenly sad she stared into her glass you might ask yourself if a witch could deal with the fact that shes in love with an ordinary man thats just what i need you for he sauntered over to drop down beside her not only the witchs angle but the womans too comfortable again he patted her knee now lets talk about casting spells with a shake of her head she set the drink aside and laughed all right nash lets talk magic chapter contents prev next he hadnt been lonely how could he have been when hed spent hours that day poring over books enlivening his mind and his world with facts and fantasies since childhood nash had been content with his own company what had once been a necessity to survive had become a way of life the time hed spent with his grandmother or his aunt or his sporadic stays in foster homes had taught him that he was much better off devising his own entertainment than looking to the adults in his life to devise some for him more often than not that entertainment had equaled chores a lecture solitary confinement or in his grandmothers case a swift backhand since hed never been permitted an abundance of playthings or playmates hed turned his mind into a particularly fine toy hed often thought it had given him an advantage over betterendowed children after all the imagination was portable unbreakable and amazingly malleable it couldnt be taken away from you by an irritated adult when you had committed some infraction it didnt have to be left behind when you were packed off to some other place now that he could afford to buy himself whatever he liked and nash would have been among the first to admit that adult toys were a terrific source of entertainment he was still content with the fluidity of imagination he could happily close himself off from the real world and real people for hours at a stretch it didnt mean he was alone not with all the characters and events racing around in his head his imagination had always been company enough if he occasionally indulged in binges of parties and people it was as much to gather grist for the mill as it was to balance out those solitary times but lonely no that was absurd he had friends now he had control over his own destiny it was his choice his alone whether to stay or to go it delighted him that he had his big house to himself he could eat when he was hungry sleep when he was tired and toss his clothes wherever it suited him most of his friends and associates were unhappily married or bitterly divorced and wasted a great deal of time and effort complaining about their partners not nash kirkland he was a single man a carefree bachelor a lone wolf who was happy as a clam and what he wondered made a clam so damn happy anyway nash knew what made him happy being able to set his laptop out on the patio table and work in the sunlight and fresh air with the drumming of water in the background being able to toy with the treatment for a new screenplay without sweating about time clocks or office politics or a woman who was waiting for him to snap back and pay attention to her did that sound like the lament of a lonely man nash knew hed never been meant for a conventional job or a conventional relationship god knows his grandmother had told him often enough hed never amount to anything remotely respectable and shed mentioned more than once that no decent woman with a grain of sense would have him nash didnt figure that that stiffnecked woman would have considered penning occult tales remotely respectable if she were still alive shed sniff and nod her head smugly at the fact that hed reached the age of thirtythree without taking a wife still hed tried the other way his brief and terrible stint as a desk jockey with an insurance company in kansas city had proven that he would never be a ninetofiver certainly his last attempt at a serious relationship had proven that he wasnt suited to the demands of permanence with a woman as that former lover deedee driscol had sniped during their final battle he was how had she put it again youre nothing but a selfish little boy emotionally retarded you think since youre good in bed you can behave irresponsibly out of it youd rather play with your monsters than have a serious adult relationship with a woman shed said a lot more nash remembered but that had been the gist of it he couldnt really blame her for throwing his irresponsibility at him or the marble ashtray if it came to that hed let her down he wasnt as shed hoped husband material and no matter how much shed altered and stitched during their sixmonth run he just hadnt measured up so deedee was marrying her oral surgeon nash didnt think it was overly snide to chuckle at the idea that an impacted wisdom tooth had led to orange blossoms better you than me he told the nameless dentist deedee was a bright friendly woman with a cuddly body and a great smile and she had the arm of a majorleague outfielder when you ticked her off it certainly didnt make him lonely to think of deedee taking that long slippery walk down the matrimonial aisle he was a free agent a manabouttown unattached unencumbered and pleased as punch whatever the hell that meant so why was he rattling around this big house like the last living cell in a dying body and much more important why had he started to pick up the phone a dozen times to call morgana it wasnt their night to work shed been very firm about giving him only two evenings a week and he had to admit once theyd gotten past those initial rough spots theyd cruised along together smoothly enough as long as he watched the sarcasm she had a nice sense of humor and a nice sense of drama which was great since he wanted both for the story it wasnt exactly a sacrifice to spend a few hours a week in her company true she was adamant about insisting she was a witch but that only made the whole business more interesting he was almost disappointed that she hadnt set up any more special effects hed exercised admirable control in keeping his hands off her mostly nash didnt figure touching her fingers or playing with her hair really counted not when hed resisted that soft sulky mouth that long white throat those high lovely breasts nash cut himself off wishing he had something more satisfying to kick than the side of the sofa it was perfectly normal to want a woman hell it was even enjoyable to imagine what it would be like to tangle up the sheets with her but the way his mind kept veering toward morgana at all hours of the day and night making his work suffer in the process was close to becoming an obsession it was time to get it under control not that hed lost control he reminded himself hed been a saint even when shed answered the door wearing those faded raggedy cutoffs a personal weakness of his hed slapped back his baser instincts it was a bit lowering to admit that his reasoning had had less to do with altruism than with selfpreservation a personal entanglement with her would mess up the professional one in any case a woman who could knock him sideways with a single kiss was best treated with caution he had a feeling that that kind of punch would be a lot more lethal than deedees deadly aim but he wanted to call her to hear her voice to ask if he could see her for just an hour or two damn it he was not lonely or at least he hadnt been until hed shut off his machine and his tired brain to go for a walk on the beach all those people hed seen the families the couples those tight little groups of belonging and hed been alone watching the sun slide down into the water longing for something he was sure he didnt really want something he certainly wouldnt know what to do with if he had it some people werent made to have families that much nash knew from firsthand experience hed decided long ago to avoid the mistake and save some nameless faceless child from being saddled with a lousy father but standing alone and watching those families had made him restless had made the house hed come home to seem too big and much too empty it made him wish hed had morgana with him so that they could have strolled along hand in hand by the water or sat on an old bleached log his arm tucked around her shoulders as they watched the first stars come out on an oath he yanked up the phone and punched out her number his lips curved when he heard her voice but the smile faded the moment he realized it was a recording informing him that she was unavailable he thought about leaving a message but hung up instead what was he supposed to say he asked himself i just wanted to talk to you i need to see you i cant get you out of my mind shaking his head he paced the room again grim beautiful masks from oceania stared down at him from their place on the wall in low cases keenedged knives with ornate handles glinted in the lamplight to relieve some tension nash scooped up a voodoo doll and jammed a pin through its heart see how you like it bub he tossed it aside jammed his hands in his pockets and decided it was time to get out of the house what the hell hed go to the movies its your turn to buy the tickets morgana told sebastian patiently mine to spring for popcorn and anas to choose the movie sebastian scowled as they walked down cannery row i bought the tickets last time no you didnt anastasia smiled when sebastian appealed to her but shook her head i bought them last time she confirmed youre just trying to weasel out again weasel insulted he stopped in the middle of the sidewalk what a disgusting word and i distinctly remember what you want to remember anastasia finished for him tucking her arm through his give it up cousin im not passing on my turn he muttered something but started walking again morgana on one arm anastasia on the other he really wanted to catch the new schwarzenegger flick and he was very much afraid that ana was going to opt for the fluffy romantic comedy in theater two not that he minded romance but hed heard that arnold had outdone himself this time saving the entire planet from a group of evil shapeshifting extraterrestrials dont sulk morgana said lightly you get to pick next time she liked the arrangement very much whenever the mood or their schedules allowed the three cousins would take in a movie years of bickering seething tempers and ruined evenings had resulted in the current system it wasnt without its flaws but it usually prevented a heated argument at the ticket booth and no fair trying to influence anastasia added when she felt sebastian pushing at her mind ive already decided just trying to keep you from wasting my money resigned sebastian glanced down at the smattering of people forming in line his spirits lifted when he spotted the man who was strolling up from the opposite direction well well he said isnt this cozy morgana had already seen nash and wasnt sure whether she was annoyed or pleased shed managed to keep everything on an even keel during their meetings no mean trick she decided considering the sexual sparks that crackled through the air whenever they got within two feet of each other she could handle it she reminded herself and offered nash a smile busmans holiday his gloomy mood vanished she looked like a dark angel her hair flowing around her shoulders the short red dress clinging to each curve more or less i always like falling into someone elses movie when im struggling with one of my own though it took an effort to tear his eyes from morganas he glanced at sebastian and anastasia hi its nice to see you again anastasia stepped into line its funny the last time the three of us hit the movies we saw your play dead oh yeah it was very good shed know sebastian put in ana watched the last thirty minutes with her eyes closed the highest of compliments nash shuffled his way down the line with them so whatre you going to see anastasia shot sebastian a look as he pulled out his wallet the schwarzenegger movie really nash hadnt a clue why sebastian was chuckling but he smiled at morgana me too nash figured his luck was in when he settled down in the theater beside morgana it hardly mattered that hed already seen the movie at its hollywood premiere hed probably have ended up choosing it anyway it was a hell of a show as he recalled fast paced with plenty of humor to leaven the violence along with a nicely twisted coil of suspense and there was a particular scene that had had the celebrity audience on the edge of their seats if his luck held morgana would be cuddled up against him by the second reel as the lights dimmed morgana turned her head and smiled at him nash felt several of his brain cells melt and wished they still ran double features in the normal scheme of things nash took the long step out of reality the moment a movie caught his imagination there was nothing he liked better than diving into the action it rarely mattered whether it was his first shot at a film or he was visiting an old friend for the twentieth time he was always at home in a movie but tonight he kept losing track of the adventure on the screen he was much too aware of the woman beside him to click off reality theaters had their own smell the oily not unpleasant aroma of what the concessions jokingly called butter over the warm fragrance of popcorn the sweet tang of candies the syrupy scent of spilled soft drinks however appealing it was and it had always been appealing to nash he couldnt get beyond the dreamy sexuality of morganas perfume the theater was cool almost chilly it had never made sense to him that the airconditioning was so often turned toward frigid in a place where people would be sitting still for two hours but the scent of morganas skin was hot arousingly hot as if she were sitting in a strong beam of sunlight she didnt gasp or jolt or huddle against him no matter how much mayhem the invaders or the hero wrought instead she kept her gaze fixed intently on the screen nibbling occasionally from a dwindling container of popcorn at one point she did hiss a breath through her teeth and grip the armrest between them gallantly nash covered her hand with his she didnt look toward him but she did turn her hand palm up and link her fingers with his she couldnt help it morgana thought she wasnt made of stone what she was was a fleshandblood woman who found the man beside her outrageously attractive and sweet damn it there was something undeniably sweet about sitting in a darkened theater holding hands and what could it hurt she was being careful when they were alone making sure things didnt move too quickly or in a direction not of her choosing not that shed had to fight him off morgana reminded herself with a touch of resentment hed made no attempt to hold her or kiss her again or to seduce her in any way unless she counted the fact that he always seemed to be touching her in that careless and friendly manner the manner that had her tossing restlessly in bed for several hours after hed left her last her problem she reminded herself and tried to ignore the long slow tug inside as nash ran his thumb lazily up and down the side of her hand the up side was she enjoyed working with him helping him with his research not only because he was an amusing companion with a mind and talent she respected but also because it was giving her the opportunity to explain what she was in her own way of course he didnt believe a word of it not that it mattered morgana told herself and lost track of the film as nashs forearm rubbed warmly over hers he didnt have to believe to incorporate her knowledge and write a good story yet it disappointed her on some deep level having him believe and accept would have been so soothing when the world was saved and the lights came up she slipped her hand from nashs not that it hadnt felt nice keeping it there but morgana wasnt in the mood to risk any of sebastians teasing comments excellent choice ana sebastian told her say that again when my heart rates normal her cousin slipped an arm over her shoulders as they shuffled up the aisle scare you of course not she refused to admit it this time seeing that incredible body stripped to the waist for the best part of two hours is enough to give any woman a rush they moved into the brightly lit noisy lobby pizza sebastian decided he glanced back at nash you up for food im always up for food great sebastian pushed open the door and led them into the night youre buying they were quite a trio nash decided as the four of them devoured slices of pizza dripping with cheese they argued about everything from what kind of pizza to buy to which alien demise had been the most effective in the movie theyd just seen he decided that morgana and sebastian enjoyed sniping at each other as much as they enjoyed the meal with anastasia slipping in and out of the role of referee it was obvious that the bond ran deep for under the bickering and complaining was an inescapable stream of affection when morgana said to sebastian dont be such a jerk love nash sensed that she meant jerk and love in equal measure listening to it nash fought back the same little stab of envy hed felt on the beach at sunset they were each only children as he was yet they were not as he was alone anastasia turned to him something flickered in her eyes for a moment that was so much like sympathy that he felt a wave of embarrassment then it was gone and she was only a lovely woman with an easy smile they dont mean to be rude she said lightly they cant help themselves rude with her hair tucked around to spill over one shoulder morgana swirled her glass of heavy red wine it isnt rude to point out sebastians flaws not when theyre so obvious she slapped his hand away from the slice of pizza on her plate see that she asked nash hes always been greedy generous to a fault sebastian said conceited she said grinning at her cousin while she took a healthy bite of pizza badtempered lies contenting himself with his wine sebastian leaned back in his chair im enviably eventempered its you who have always had the tantrums right ana well actually you both she never grew out of it sebastian interjected as a child when she didnt get her way shed wail like a banshee or sulk in corners control was never her strong point i hate to point this out anastasia told him but at least half the time morgana was driven to wails it was because youd provoked her naturally unrepentant sebastian shrugged it was so easy he winked at morgana still is i should never have let you down from the ceiling all those years ago nash paused over his drink excuse me a particularly nasty little prank sebastian explained it still annoyed him that his cousin had gotten the better of him which you richly deserved morgana was pouting over her wine im not sure ive forgiven you yet anastasia was forced to agree it was lousy of you sebastian outnumbered sebastian relented he could even with an effort dredge up some humor along with the memory i was only eleven years old little boys are entitled to be lousy anyway it wasnt a real snake morgana sniffed it looked real chuckling sebastian leaned forward to tell nash the tale we were all over at aunt brynas and uncle matthews for may day admittedly i was always looking for a way to get a rise out of the brat here and i knew she was terrified of snakes and its just like you to exploit one small phobia morgana muttered the thing was the kid was fearless except for this one thing sebastians eyes tawny as a cats glowed with humor so seeing as boys will be boys i plopped a rubber snake right in the center of her bed while she was in it of course nash couldnt suppress the grin but he did manage to turn the laugh into a cough when he saw morganas arch look it doesnt seem so terrible he made it hiss and wriggle ana put in biting down on her lip to keep it from curving sebastian sighed nostalgically id worked on that charm for weeks magics never been my strong point so it was a pretty weak attempt all in all still he leered at morgana it worked nash discovered he had absolutely no comment to make it appeared he wasnt sitting at a table with three sensible people after all so after i got finished screaming and saw through what was really a very pitiful spell i sent sebastian to the ceiling let him hang there upside down her tone was smug and satisfied how long was it darling two hideous hours she smiled youd still be there if my mother hadnt found you and made me bring you down and for the rest of the summer anastasia put in the two of you tried to outdo each other and you both stayed in trouble sebastian and morgana grinned at each other then morgana tilted her head and sent nash a sidelong glance she could all but hear the wheels turning sure you wont have a glass of wine no thanks im driving they were putting him on he realized he flicked a smile at morgana why should he mind it made him part of the little group and it gave him new angles for the story so you ah played a lot of tricks on each other as kids its difficult when one has certain talents to be content with ordinary games whatever we played sebastian said to morgana you cheated of course i did unoffended she passed him the rest of her pizza i like to win its getting late she rose to kiss each of her cousins on the cheek why dont you give me a ride home nash sure it was exactly what hed had in mind be careful kirkland sebastian said lazily she likes to play with fire so ive noticed he took morganas hand and led her away anastasia gave a little sigh and propped her chin on her hand with all the sparks popping back and forth between the two of them im surprised we didnt have a blaze right here at the table therell be flames soon enough sebastians eyes darkened going fixed and nearly opaque whether she likes it or not instantly concerned ana put a hand on his shell be all right he wasnt seeing as clearly as he would have liked it was always more difficult with family and particularly with morgana shell have a few bumps and bruises and he was sorry for it then his eyes cleared and the easy smile was back in place shell get through it ana as she said morgana likes to win morgana wasnt thinking of battles or victories but of how cool and silky the air felt blowing against her cheeks with her head back she stared up at a black sky haunted by a halfmoon and dazzled by stars it was easy to enjoy the fast open car on the curving road the shadowy moonlight and the seaflavored air and it was easy to enjoy him this man who drove with a natural confident flair who played the radio too loud who smelled of the night and all its secrets turning her head she studied his profile oh she would have enjoyed running her fingers over that angular face testing the shape of the bones brushing a touch over that clever mouth perhaps feeling the slight roughness of his chin she would have enjoyed it very much so why did she hesitate though shed never been promiscuous or seen every attractive man as a potential lover she recognized the deeper desire to be his and she had seen that it was to happen before much longer in any case that was her answer morgana realized she would always rebel against being destinys puppet but surely if she chose him for herself if she kept the power in her own hands it was not the same as being led by fate she was after all her own mistress why did you go into town tonight she asked him i was restless tired of myself she understood the feeling it didnt spring up in her often but when it did it was unbearable the script is going well pretty well i should have a treatment to send to my agent in a few days he glanced toward her then immediately wished he hadnt she looked so beautiful so alluring with the wind in her hair and the moonlight sprinkling over her skin that he didnt want to look away again it wasnt a wise way to operate a moving vehicle youve been a lot of help does that mean youre through with me no morgana i he stopped and swore catching himself a moment after he passed her driveway he backed up and turned in but left the motor running for a moment he sat brooding in silence looking at the house where only a single window glowed gold and the rest were black as pitch if she asked him in he would go with her would have to go something was happening tonight something had been happening since the moment hed turned and looked into her eyes it gave him the unsettling feeling that he was walking through someone elses script and the ending had yet to be written you are restless she murmured out of character for you on impulse she reached over and switched off the ignition the absence of the engines purr had the silence roaring in his head their bodies brushed and the promise of more sizzled hot in his gut do you know what i like to do when im restless her voice had lowered and it seemed liquid enough now to slide over his skin like mulled wine he turned to see those vivid blue eyes glowing with moonlight and his hands were already reaching for her what she eased away slipping from his hands like a ghost after opening her door she walked slowly around to his side leaned down until their lips nearly touched i take a walk with her eyes still on his she straightened and offered a hand come with me ill show you a magic place he could have refused but he knew if there was a man who wouldnt have stepped from the car and taken that offered hand he had yet to be born they crossed the lawn walking away from the house where the single light glowed and entered the mystic shadows and whispering silence of the cyprus grove moonlight flickered down casting eerie silhouettes of the twisted branches on the soft forest floor the faintest of breezes hummed through the leaves and made him think of the harp she kept in her drawing room her hand was warm and firm in his as she moved forward not with hurry but with purpose i like the night she took a deep breath of it the scent and the flavor of night sometimes ill wake in the dark and come to walk here he could hear water on rock a steady heartbeat of sound for reasons he couldnt fathom his own heart was thudding relentlessly in his chest something was happening the trees the sound of his own voice seemed odd and secretive in the shadowy grove i fell in love with them she stopped walking to eye him curiously did you i was up here on vacation last year wanted to get out of the heat i couldnt get enough of the trees he laid a hand on one feeling the rough bark of a trunk that bent dramatically away id never been much of the nature type id always lived in cities or just outside them but i knew i had to live somewhere where i could look out of my window and see these trees sometimes we come back where we belong she began to walk again her footsteps silent on the soft earth some ancient cult worshiped trees like these she smiled i think its enough to love them appreciate them for their age their beauty their tenacity here she stopped again and turned to him this is the center the heart the purest magic is always in the heart he couldnt have said why he understood or why he believed perhaps it was the moon or the moment he knew only that he felt a stirring along the skin a fluttering in his mind and from somewhere deep in memory he knew hed been here before with her lifting a hand he touched her face letting his fingertips trace from cheek to jaw she didnt move not forward or away she only continued to watch him and wait i dont know if i like whats happening to me he said quietly what is happening to you you are unable to resist he lifted his other hand so that her face was framed a captive of his tensed fingers i dream about you even in the middle of the day i dream about you i cant turn it off or switch the scene around as id like it just happens she lifted a hand to his wrist wanting to feel the good strong beat of his pulse is that so bad i dont know im real good at avoiding complications morgana i dont want that to change then well keep it simple he wasnt certain if she had moved or if he had but somehow she was in his arms and his mouth was drinking from hers no dream had ever been so stirring her tongue toyed with his tempting him to plunge deeper she welcomed him with a moan that sizzled in his blood at last he pleasured himself by tasting the long line of her throat sliding his tongue over the pulse that hammered there nibbling the sensitive flesh under her jaw until he felt the first quick helpless shudder pass through her and then he was diving more deeply more desperately when his mouth again met hers how could she have thought she had any choice any control what they were bringing to each other here was as old as time as fresh as spring if only it could be pleasure nothing more she thought weakly as sensations battered against her will but even as her body throbbed with that pleasure she knew it was much much more not once in her years as a woman had she given her heart it had not been jealously guarded because it had always been safe but now with the moon overhead with the silent old trees as witnesses she gave it to him her arms tightened at the swift silvery ache his name tumbled from her lips in that moment she knew why she had needed to bring him there to her most private place where could it be more fitting for her to lose her heart than here for another moment she held him close letting her body absorb what he could give her wishing she could have honored her word and kept it simple but it was not to be simple now not for either of them all she could do was take the time that was still left and prepare them both when she would have drawn back he pulled her in taking her mouth again and again while images and sounds and needs whirled in his brain nash she turned her head to rub her cheek soothingly against his it cant be now her quiet voice slipped through the roaring in his brain he had an urge to drag her to the ground take her then and there prove that she was wrong it had to be now it would be now the wave of violence stunned him appalled he loosened his grip realizing his fingers were digging into her flesh im sorry he dropped his hands to his sides did i hurt you no touched she brought his hand to her lips of course not dont worry he damn well would worry hed never never been anything but gentle with a woman there were some who might say he could be careless with feelings and if it was true he was sorry for it but no one would ever have accused him of being careless physically yet he had nearly pulled her to the ground and taken what he so desperately needed without a thought to her acceptance or agreement shaken he jammed his hands in his pockets i was right i dont like whats happening here thats the second time ive kissed you and the second time ive felt like i had to the same way i have to breathe or eat or sleep she would have to tread carefully here affection is just as necessary for survival he doubted it since hed done without it for most of his life studying her he shook his head you know babe if i believed you were really a witch id say i was spellbound it surprised her that it hurt oh not his words so much as the distance it put between them try as she might she couldnt remember ever having been hurt by a man before perhaps that was what it meant to be in love she hadnt guarded her heart before but she could protect it now then its fortunate you dont believe it was just a kiss nash she smiled hoping the shadows would mask the sadness in her eyes theres nothing to fear in a kiss i want you his voice had roughened and his hands were fisted in his pockets there was a helplessness tangled with this need perhaps that was what had nearly touched off violence that might be dangerous she didnt doubt it when the time comes well find out now im tired im going in this time when she walked through the grove she didnt offer her hand chapter contents prev next morgana had opened the doors of wicca for the first time five years and some months before nash had walked through them looking for a witch the success of the shop was due to morganas insistence on intriguing stock her willingness to put in long hours and her frank enjoyment of the game of buying and selling since her family for longer than anyone could clearly remember had been financially successful she could have spent her time in any number of idle pursuits while drawing from a number of trust funds her decision to become a businesswoman had been a simple one she was ambitious enough and more than proud enough to want to earn her own living the choice of opening a shop had appealed to morgana because it allowed her to surround herself with things she liked and enjoyed she had also from the first sale found pleasure in passing those things along to others who would also enjoy them there were definite advantages to owning your own business a sense of accomplishment the basic pride of ownership the constant variety of people who walked in and out of your life but whenever there was an up side there was also a down if you were blessed with a sense of responsibility it wasnt possible to simply shut the doors and pull down the shades when you were in the mood to be alone among morganas many gifts was an undeniable sense of responsibility at the moment she wished her parents had allowed her to become a flighty selfabsorbed feckless woman if they hadnt done such a good job raising her she might have bolted the door jumped in her car and driven away until this miserable mood passed she wasnt used to feeling unsettled she certainly didnt like the idea that this uncomfortable mood had been brought on by a man as long as she could remember morgana had been able to handle all members of the male species it was she smiled a little at the thought a gift even as a child shed been able to dance her way around her father and her uncles getting her own way with a combination of charm guilt and obstinacy sebastian had been tougher to manage but she felt shed at least broken even there once shed reached adolescence shed learned quickly how to deal with boys what moves to make if she was interested what moves to make if she was not as the years had passed it had been a simple matter of applying the same rules with subtle variations to men her sexuality was a source of joy to her and she was well aware that it equaled another kind of power she would never abuse power her dealings with men whether they led to friendship or to romance had always been successful until now until nash when had she begun to slip morgana wondered as she wrapped and bagged a long slim bottle of ginseng bath balm for a customer when shed followed that little tug on her sixth sense and crossed this very room to speak to him for the first time when shed bowed to that spark of curiosity and attraction and kissed him perhaps she had made her first serious misstep only last night by allowing herself to be led by pure emotion taking him into the grove to that spot where the air hummed and the moon spilled she had taken no other man there before she would take no other man there again at least dreaming back she could almost make herself believe it was the place and the night that had caused her to believe she had fallen in love she didnt want to accept that such a thing could happen to her so quickly or leave her such little choice so she would refuse to accept and put an end to it morgana could almost hear the spirits laughing ignoring the sensation she walked around the counter to help a customer throughout the morning business was slow but steady morgana wasnt sure whether she preferred it when browsers drifted in or when she and luna had the shop to themselves i think i should blame you for the whole thing morgana braced her elbows on the table and leaned down until she was eye to eye with the cat if you hadnt been so friendly i wouldnt have assumed he was harmless luna merely switched her tail and looked wise hes not the least bit harmless morgana continued now its too late to back out oh sure she said when luna blinked i could tell him the deals off i could make up excuses why i couldnt meet with him anymore if i wanted to admit i was a coward she drew in a deep breath and rested her brow on the cats i am not a coward luna gave morganas cheek a playful pat dont try to make up if this business gets any farther out of hand its on your head morgana glanced up when the shop door opened her lips curved in relief when she spotted mindy hi is it two already just about mindy tucked her purse behind the counter then gave luna a quick scratch between the ears so hows it going well enough i see you sold the big rose quartz cluster about an hour ago its going to a good home a young couple from boston ive got it in the back ready to pack for shipping want me to take care of it now no actually i could use a little break from retail ill do it while you mind the shop sure you look a little down morgana she arched a brow do i yep let madame mindy see taking morganas hand she peered steely eyed at the palm aha no doubt about it man trouble despite the accuracy the very annoying accuracy of the statement morganas lips twitched i hate to doubt your expertise in palmistry madame mindy but you always say its man trouble i play the odds mindy pointed out youd be surprised how many people stick their hands in my face just because i work for a witch intrigued morgana tilted her head i suppose i would well lots of them are nervous about approaching you and im safe i guess they figure some of it might rub off but not enough to worry about sort of like catching a touch of the flu or something i guess for the first time in hours a laugh bubbled up in morganas throat i see i suppose it would disappoint them to learn i dont read palms they wont hear it from me mindy lifted a jadeandsilver hand mirror to check her face but ill tell you honey i dont need to be a fortuneteller to see a tall blond man with great buns and eyes to die for she tugged a corkscrew curl toward the middle of her forehead before glancing at morgana he giving you a rough time no nothing i cant handle theyre easy to handle after setting the mirror aside mindy unwrapped a fresh stick of gum until they matter then she flashed morgana a smile just say the word and ill run interference for you amused morgana patted mindys cheek thanks but ill make this play on my own her mood brighter morgana stepped into the back room what was she worried about anyway she could handle it would handle it after all she didnt know nash well enough for him to matter he had plenty to keep him busy nash told himself plenty he was sprawled on the sofa six feet of faded sagging cushions hed bought at a garage sale because it was so obviously fashioned for afternoon naps books were spread over his lap and jumbled on the floor across the room the agonies and pathos of an afternoon soap flickered on the television screen a softdrink bottle stood on the cluttered coffee table should he want to quench his thirst in the next room his computer sat sulking at the lack of attention nash thought he could almost hear it whine it wasnt like he wasnt working idly nash ripped off a sheet of notepaper and began folding it he might have been lying on the sofa he might have spent a great deal of his morning staring into space but he was thinking maybe hed hit a bit of a snag in the treatment but it wasnt like he was blocked or anything he just needed to let it cook awhile giving the paper a last crease he narrowed his eyes then sent the miniature bomber soaring to please himself he added sound effects as the paper airplane glided off crashlanding on the floor in a heap of other models sabotage he said grimly must be a spy on the assembly line shifting for comfort he began to build another plane while his mind drifted interior scene day the big echoing hangar is deserted murky light spills through the front opening and slants over the silver hull of a fighter jet slow footsteps approach as they near there is something familiar about them something feminine stiletto heels on concrete she slips in the entrance from light into shadow the glare and the tippeddown brim of a slouchy hat obscure her face but not the body poured into a short red leather dress long shapely legs cross the hangar floor in one delicate hand she holds a black leather case after one slow glance around she goes to the plane her skirt hikes high on smooth white thighs as she climbs into the cockpit there is purpose efficiency in her movements the way she slips into the pilots seat spins the locks on the leather case inside the case is a small deadly bomb which she secretes under the console she laughs the sound is sultry seductive the camera moves in on her face morganas face swearing nash tossed the plane in the air it did an immediate nosedive what was he doing he asked himself making up stories about her indulging in bad symbolism so sure shed climbed into his cockpit and set off an explosion that was no reason to daydream about her he had work to do didnt he determined to do it nash shifted sending books sliding to the floor using the remote he switched off the television then took up what was left of his notebook he punched the play button on his recorder it took less than five seconds for him to realize his mistake and turn it off again he wasnt in any frame of mind to listen to morganas voice he rose scattering books then stepping over them he was thinking all right he was thinking he had to get the hell out of the house and he knew exactly where he wanted to go it was his choice he assured himself as he snagged his keys he was making a conscious decision when a man had an itch he was a lot better off scratching it her mood had improved enough that morgana could hum along with the radio shed turned on low this was just what shed needed she thought a cup of soothing chamomile an hour of solitude and some pleasant and constructive work after packing up the crystal cluster and labeling it for shipping she pulled out her inventory ledger she could have spent a happy afternoon sipping the soothing tea listening to music and looking over her stock morgana was certain she would have done exactly that if she hadnt been interrupted perhaps if shed been tuned in she would have been prepared to see nash stride through the door but it really didnt matter what she might have planned as he stalked over to the desk hauled her to her feet and planted a long hard kiss on her surprised mouth that he said when he took a moment to breathe was my idea nerve ends sizzling morgana managed a nod i see he let his hands slide down to her hips to hold her still i liked it good for you she glanced over her shoulder and noted that mindy was standing in the open doorway smirking i can handle this mindy oh im sure you can with a quick wink she shut the door well now searching for composure morgana put her hands on his chest to ease him away she preferred that he not detect the fact that her heart was pounding and her bones were doing a fast melt that was no way to keep the upper hand was there something else i think theres a whole lot else his eyes on hers he backed her up against the desk when do you want to get started she had to smile i guess we could call this being direct and to the point well call it whatever you like i figure it this way because she was wearing heels and they were eye to eye nash had only to ease forward to nibble on her full lower lip i want you and i dont see how im going to start thinking straight again until i spend a few nights making love with you all kinds of love with you the stirring started deep and spread she had to curl her fingers over the edge of the desk to keep her balance but when she spoke her voice was low and confident i could say that once we did make love youd never think straight again he cupped her face with one hand and brushed his lips over hers ill take my chances maybe her breath hitched twice before she controlled it i have to decide whether i want to take mine his lips curved over hers hed felt her quick tremor of reaction live dangerously i am she gave herself a moment to enjoy what he brought to her what would you say if i told you it wasnt the right time yet and that wed both know when it was the right time his hands slid up so that his thumbs teased the curves of her breasts id say youre avoiding the issue youd be wrong enchanted his touch was incredibly gentle she pressed her cheek to his believe me youd be wrong the hell with timing come home with me morgana she gave a little sigh as she drew away i will she shook her head when his eyes darkened to help you to work with you not to sleep with you not today grinning he leaned closer to give her earlobe a playful nip that gives me plenty of room to change your mind her eyes were very calm almost sad when she stepped back you may change yours before its done let me ask mindy to take over for the rest of the day she insisted on driving herself following behind him with luna curled in her passenger seat she would give him two hours she promised herself and two hours only before she left him she would do her best to clear his mind so that he could work she liked his house the overgrown yard that shouted for a gardener the sprawling stucco building with arching windows and red tile for the roof it was closer to the sea than hers so the music of the water was at full pitch in the side yard were a pair of cypresses bent close together like lovers reaching for one another it suited him she thought as she stepped out of her car off the drive and into the grass that rose above her ankles how long have you lived here she asked nash couple months he glanced around the yard i need to buy a lawn mower hed need a bush hog before much longer yes you do but i kind of like the natural look youre lazy she felt some sympathy for the daffodils that were struggling to get their heads above the weeds she walked to the front entrance with luna streaming regally behind her i have to get motivated he told her as he pushed open the front door ive mostly lived in apartments and condos this is the first regular house ive had to myself she looked around at the high cool walls of the foyer the rich dark wood of the curving banister that trailed upstairs and along an open balcony at least you chose well where are you working here and there hmm she strolled down the hallway and peeked in the first archway it was a large jumbled living area with wide uncurtained windows and a bare hardwood floor signs morgana thought of a man who had yet to decide if he was going to settle in the furniture was mismatched and heaped with books papers clothes and dishes possibly long forgotten more books were shoved helterskelter into builtin cases along one wall and toys she noted she often thought of her own clutter as toys little things that gave her pleasure soothed her moods passed the time she noted the gorgeous grimfaced masks that hung on the wall an exquisite print of nymphs by maxfield parrish a movie prop one of the wolves claws from shape shifter she imagined he was using it as a paperweight a silver box in the shape of a coffin sat next to the oscar hed won both could have used a proper dusting lips pursed she picked up the voodoo doll the pin still sticking lethally out of its heart anyone i know he grinned pleased to have her there and too used to his own disorder to be embarrassed by it whatever works usually its a producer sometimes a politician once it was this beancounting irs agent ive been meaning to tell you he added as his gaze skimmed over her slim short dress of purple silk you have great taste in clothes glad you approve amused she set the unfortunate doll down patted the mangled head then picked up a tattered deck of tarot cards do you read them no somebody gave them to me theyre supposed to have belonged to houdini or someone hmm she fanned them felt the faint trickle of old power on her fingertips if youre curious where they came from ask sebastian sometime he could tell come here she held out the deck to him shuffle and cut willing to oblige he did what she asked are we going to play she only smiled and took the cards back since the seats are occupied lets use the floor she knelt gesturing for him to join to her after tossing her hair behind her back she dealt out a celtic cross youre preoccupied she said but your creative juices arent dried up or blocked there are changes coming her eyes lifted to his they were that dazzling irish blue that tempted even a sane man to believe anything perhaps the biggest of your life and they wont be easy to accept it was no longer the cards she read but rather the pale light of the seer which burned so much more brightly in sebastian you need to remember that some things are passed through the blood and some are washed out we arent always the total of the people who made us her eyes changed softened as she laid a hand on his and youre not as alone as you think you are you never have been he couldnt joke away what hit too close to home instead he avoided the issue entirely by bringing her hand to his lips i didnt bring you here to tell my fortune i know why you asked me here and it isnt going to happen yet with more than a little regret she drew her hand free and it isnt really your fortune im telling its your present quietly she gathered up the cards again ill help you if i can with what i can tell me about the problem in your story other than the fact that i keep thinking of you when im supposed to be thinking of it yes she curled up her legs other than that i guess its a matter of motivation cassandras thats what i decided to call her is she a witch because she wanted power because she wanted to change things was she looking for revenge or love or the easy way out why would it be any of those things why wouldnt it be a matter of accepting the gifts she was given its too easy morgana shook her head no its not its easier so much easier to be like everyone else once when i was a little girl some of the mothers refused to let their children play with me i was a bad influence odd different it hurt not being a part of the whole understanding he nodded i was always the new kid hardly in one place long enough to be accepted somebody always wants to give the new kid a bloody nose dont ask me why moving around you end up being awkward falling behind in school wishing youd just get old enough to get the hell out annoyed with himself he stopped anyway about cassandra how did you cope she had had anastasia sebastian her family and a keen sense of belonging with a restless movement of his shoulders he reached out to touch her amulet you run away a lot and since that just gets your butt kicked nine times out of ten you learn to run away safe in books in movies or just inside your own head as soon as i was old enough i got a job working the concession stand at a theater that way id get paid for watching movies as troubled memories left his eyes his face cleared i love the flicks i just plain love them she smiled so now you get paid for writing them a perfect way to feed the habit if i can ever get this one whipped into shape in one smooth movement he took a handful of her hair and wrapped it around his wrist what i need is inspiration he murmured tugging her forward for a kiss what you need she told him is concentration im concentrating he nibbled and tugged at her lips believe me im concentrating you dont want to be responsible for hampering creative genius do you indeed not it was time she decided for him to understand exactly what he was getting into and perhaps it would also help him open his mind to his story inspiration she said and slid her hands around his neck coming up and so were they as she met his lips with hers she brought them six inches off the floor he was too busy enjoying the taste to notice sliding over him morgana forgot herself long enough to lose herself in the heat when she broke the kiss they were floating halfway to the ceiling i think wed better stop he nuzzled her neck why she glanced down deliberately i didnt think to ask if you were afraid of heights morgana wished she could have captured the look on his face when he followed her gaze the wideeyed slackjawed comedy of it the string of oaths was a different matter as they ran their course she took them gently down again his knees buckled before he got them under control white faced he gripped her shoulders the muscles in his stomach were twanging like plucked strings how the hell did you do that a childs trick a certain kind of child she was sympathetic enough to stroke his cheek remember the boy who cried wolf nash one day the wolf was real well youve been playing with lets say the paranormal for years this time youve got yourself a real witch very slowly very sure he shook his head from side to side but the fingers on her shoulders trembled lightly thats bull she indulged in a windy sigh all right let me think something simple but elegant she closed her eyes lifted her hands for a moment she was simply a woman a beautiful woman standing in the center of a disordered room with her arms lifted gracefully her palms gently cupped then she changed god he could see her change the beauty deepened a trick of the light he told himself the way she was smiling with those full unpainted lips curved her lashes shadowing her cheeks her hair tumbling wildly to her waist but her hair was moving fluttering gently at first as though teased by a playful breeze then it was flying around her face back from her face in one long gorgeous stream he had an impossible image of a stunning wooden maiden carved on the bow of an ancient ship but there was no wind to blow yet he felt it it chilled along his skin whisked along his cheeks he could hear it whistle as it streaked into the room when he swallowed he heard a click in his throat as well she stood straight and still a faint gold light shivered around her as she began to chant as the sun poured through the high windows soft flakes of snow began to fall from nashs ceiling they swirled around his head danced over his skin as he gaped frozen in shock cut it out he ordered in a ragged voice before he sank to a chair morgana let her arms drop opened her eyes the miniature blizzard stopped as if it had never been the wind silenced and died as shed expected nash was staring at her as if shed grown three heads that might have been a bit overdone she allowed i you he fought to gain control over his tongue what the hell did you do a very basic call to the elements he wasnt as pale as he had been she decided but his eyes still looked too big for the rest of his face i didnt mean to frighten you youre not frightening me baffling yes he admitted he shook himself like a wet dog and ordered his brain to engage if he had seen what he had seen there was a reason there was no way she could have gotten inside his house to set up the trick but there had to be he pushed out of the chair and began to search through the room maybe his movements were a bit jerky maybe his joints felt as though theyd rusted over but he was moving okay babe howd you pull it off its great and im up for a joke as much as the next guy but i like to know the trick nash her voice was quiet and utterly compelling stop look at me he turned and he looked and he knew though it wasnt possible wasnt reasonable he knew he let out a long careful breath my god its true isnt it yes do you want to sit down no but he sat on the coffee table everything youve been telling me you werent making any of it up no i wasnt making any of it up i was born a witch like my mother my father like my mothers mother and hers and back for generations she smiled gently i dont ride on a broomstick except perhaps as a joke or cast spells on young princesses or pass out poisoned apples it wasnt possible really was it do something else a flicker of impatience crossed her face nor am i a trained seal do something else he insisted and cast his mind for options can you disappear or oh really nash he was up again look give me a break im trying to help you out here maybe you could a book flew off the shelf and bopped him smartly in the head wincing he rubbed the spot okay okay never mind this isnt a sideshow she said primly i only demonstrated so obviously in the first place because youre so thickheaded you refused to believe and since we seem to be developing some sort of relationship i prefer that you do she smoothed out the skirt of her dress and now that you do we can take some time to think it all through before we move on move on he repeated maybe the next step is to talk about this not now hed already retreated a step she thought and he didnt even know it damn it morgana you cant drop all this on me then calmly walk out good god youre a witch yes she flicked back her hair i believe weve established that his mind began to spin again reality had taken a long slow curve i have a million questions she picked up her bag youve already asked me several of those million play back your tapes all of the answers i gave you were true ones i dont want to listen to tapes i want to talk to you for now its what i want that matters she opened her bag and took out a small wandshaped emerald on a silver chain she should have known there was a reason shed felt compelled to put it there that morning here moving forward she slipped the chain over his head thanks but im not much on jewelry think of it as a charm then she kissed both of his cheeks warily he eyed it what kind of a charm its for clearing the mind promoting creativity and see the small purple stone above the emerald yeah amethyst her lips curved as they brushed his for protection against witchcraft with the cat already at her heels morgana moved to the archway go sleep for an hour nash your brain is tired when you wake youll work and when the time is right youll find me she slipped out the door frowning nash tilted the slender green stone up to examine it clear thinking okay he could use some of that at the moment his thoughts were as clear as smoke he ran a thumb over the companion stone of amethyst protection against witchcraft he glanced up through the window to see morgana drive away he was pretty sure he could use that as well chapter contents prev next what he needed to do was think not sleep though he wondered that any man could think after what had happened in the last fifteen minutes why any of the parapsychologists hed interviewed over the years would have been wild to have a taste of what morgana had given him but wasnt the first rational step to attempt to disprove what he had seen he wandered back into the living room to squint at the ceiling for a while he couldnt deny what he had seen what he had felt but perhaps with time he could come up with some logical alternatives taking the first step he assumed his favorite thinking position he lay down on the sofa hypnotism he didnt care to think that he could be put in a trance or caused to hallucinate but it was a possibility an easier one to believe now that he was alone again if he didnt believe that or some other logical explanation he would have to accept that morgana was exactly what she had said she was all along a hereditary witch possessing elvish blood nash toed off his shoes and tried to think his mind was full of her the way she looked the way she tasted the dark uncanny light that had been in her eyes before shed closed them and lifted her arms to the ceiling the same light he recalled now that had come into her eyes when shed done the trick with the brandy decanter trick he reminded himself as his heart gave a single unpleasant thud it was wiser to assume they were tricks and try to logic out how she had produced them just how did a woman lift a hundredandsixtyfivepound man six feet off the floor telekinesis nash had always thought there were real possibilities there after his preliminary work on his script the dark gift hed come to believe there were certain people who were able to use their minds or their emotions to move objects a more logical explanation than the existence of poltergeists to nashs way of thinking and scientists had done exhaustive studies of pictures flying across the room books leaping off shelves and so forth young girls were often thought to possess this particular talent girls became women morgana was definitely a woman nash figured a research scientist would need a lot more than his word that morgana had lifted him and herself off the ground still maybe he could he stopped realizing he was thinking reacting the same way the fictional jonathan mcgillis thought and reacted in his story was that what morgana wanted he wondered listen to the tapes shed told him all right then that was what hed do shifting he punched buttons on his recorder until hed reversed the tape inside and started it to play morganas smoky voice flowed from the tiny machine its not necessary to belong to a coven to be a witch any more than its necessary to belong to a mens club to be a man some find joining a group rewarding comforting others simply enjoy the social aspects there was a slight pause then a rustling of silks as she shifted are you a joiner nash nope groups usually have rules somebody else made up and they like to assign chores her light laugh drifted into the room and there are those of us who prefer our own company and our own way the history of covens however is ancient my greatgreatgrandmother was high priestess of her coven in ireland and her daughter after her a sabbat cup a keppen rod and a few other ceremonial items were passed down to me you might have noticed the ritual dish on the wall in the hallway it dates back to before the burning time burning time the active persecution of witches it began in the fourteenth century and continued for the next three hundred years history shows that mankind usually feels the need to persecute someone i suppose it was our turn she continued to speak he to question but nash was having a hard time listening to words her voice itself was so alluring it was a voice meant for moonlight for secrets for hot midnight promises if he closed his eyes he could almost believe she was there with him curled up on the couch beside him those long luscious legs tangled with his her breath warm on his cheek he drifted off to sleep with a smile on his face when he awakened nearly two hours had passed heavyeyed and groggy he scrubbed his hands over his face then swore at the crick in his neck he blinked at his watch as he pushed himself to a halfsitting halfslouching position it shouldnt be a surprise hed slept so heavily he thought hed been burning energy on nothing but catnaps for the last few days automatically he reached out for the liter bottle and gulped down warm soda maybe it had all been a dream nash sat back surprised at how quickly those afternoonnap fuzzies lifted from his brain it could have all been a dream except he fingered the stones resting against his chest shed left those behind as well as a faint lingering scent that was exclusively hers all right then he decided he was going to stop backtracking and doubting his own sanity she had done what she had done he had seen what he had seen it wasnt so complicated really nash thought more a matter of adjusting your thinking and accepting something new at one time people had believed that space travel was the stuff of fantasy on the other hand a few centuries back witchcraft had been accepted without question maybe reality had a lot to do with what century you happened to live in it was a possibility that started his brain ticking he took another swallow grimacing as he capped the bottle again he wasnt just thirsty he realized he was hungry famished and more much more important than his stomach was his mind the entire story seemed to roll out inside it reel by reel he could see it really see it clearly for the first time with the quick thrum of excitement that always came when a story unfolded for him he sprang up and headed for the kitchen he was going to fix himself one monster sandwich brew the strongest pot of coffee on the planet and then get to work morgana sat on anastasias sunny terrace envying and admiring her cousins lush gardens and drinking an excellent glass of iced julep tea from this spot on pescadaro point she could look out over the rich blue water of carmel bay and watch the boats bob and glide in the light spring breeze here she was tucked away from the tourist track seemingly a world away from the bustle of cannery row the crowds and scents of fishermans wharf sheltered on the terrace by trees and flowers she couldnt hear the rumble of a single car only birds bees water and wind she understood why anastasia lived here there was the serenity and the seclusion her younger cousin craved oh there was drama in the meeting of land and sea the twisted trees the high call of the gulls but there was also peace within the tumbling walls that surrounded the estate silent and steady ivy climbed the house splashy flowers and sweetsmelling herbs crowded the beds ana tended so gently morgana never failed to feel at ease here and she was unfailingly drawn here whenever her heart was troubled the spot she thought not for the first time was so much like anastasia lovely welcoming without guile fresh from the oven ana announced as she carried a tray through the open french doors oh god ana fudge cookies my favorite with a chuckle anastasia set the tray on the glass table i had an urge to bake some this morning now i know why more than willing morgana took the first bite her eyes drifted closed as the smooth chocolate melted on her tongue bless you so ana took her seat so that she could look out over the gardens and grass to the bay i was surprised to see you out here in the middle of the day im indulging in a long lunch break she took another bite of cookie mindys got everything under control do you dont i always ana laid a hand over morganas before morgana could attempt to close them off ana felt the little wisps of sadness i cant help feeling how unsettled you are were too close of course you cant just as i couldnt help coming out here today even though i knew i was bringing you problems id like to help well youre the herbalist morgana said lightly how about some essence of helleborus niger ana smiled helleborus more commonly called christmas rose was reputed to have the power to cure madness fearing for your sanity love at least with a shrug she chose another cookie or i could take the easy way out and mix up a blend of rose and angelica a touch of ginseng sprinkled liberally with moondust a love potion ana sampled a cookie herself for anyone i know nash of course of course things arent going well a faint line appeared between morganas brows i dont know how things are going i do know i wish i wasnt so bloody conscientious its really a very basic procedure to bind a man but not very satisfying no morgana admitted i cant imagine it would be so im stuck with the ordinary way as she sipped the reviving tea she watched the snowy sails billowing from the boats on the bay shed always considered herself that free she realized just that free now though she had done no binding she herself was bound to tell the truth ana ive never given much thought to what it would be like to have a man fall in love with me really in love the trouble is this time my hearts too involved for comfort and there was little comfort she could offer anastasia thought for this type of ailment have you told him surprised by the quick aching in her heart morgana closed her eyes i cant tell him what im not entirely sure of myself so i wait moonglow to dawns light she chanted night to day and day to night until his heart is twined with mine no rest or peace can i find she opened her eyes and managed a smile that always seemed overly dramatic before finding loves like finding air we cant survive without it but whats enough this was the question that had troubled her most in the days since she had left nash how do we know whats enough when were happy id think morgana thought the answer was probably true but was it attainable do you think were spoiled ana spoiled in what way in our our expectations i suppose her hand fluttered up in a helpless gesture our parents mine yours sebastians theres always been so much love there support understanding respect the fun of being in love and the generosity its not that way for everyone i dont think that knowing love can run deep and true that it can last means being spoiled but wouldnt it be enough to settle for the temporary for affection and passion she frowned watching a bee court a stalk of columbine i think it might be for some youd have to be sure it would be enough for you morgana rose with a grumble of annoyance its so exasperating i hate not being in charge a smile tugged at anastasias mouth as she joined her cousin im sure you do darling as long as i can remember youve pushed things along your own way just by force of personality morgana slanted her a look i suppose you mean i was a bully not at all sebastian was a bully ana tucked her tongue in her cheek well just say you were are strong willed far from mollified morgana bent to sniff at a heavyheaded peony i suppose i could take that as a compliment but being strong willed isnt helping at the moment she moved along the narrow stone path that wound through tumbling blooms and tangled vines i havent seen him in more than a week ana lord she said that makes me sound like some whiny weakkneed wimp ana had to laugh even as she gave morgana a quick squeeze no it doesnt it sounds as though youre an impatient woman well i am impatient she admitted though i was prepared to avoid him if necessary it hasnt been necessary she shot ana a rueful look a little sting to the pride have you called him no morganas lips formed into a pout at first i didnt because i thought it was best to give us both some time then shed always been able to laugh at herself and she did so now well then i didnt because i was so damn mad he hadnt tried to beat down my door he has called me a few times at the shop or at home he fires off a couple of questions on the craft mutters and grumbles while i answer grunts then hangs up she jammed fisted hands in her skirt pockets i can almost hear the tiny little wheels in his tiny little brain turning so hes working id imagine a writer could become pretty selfabsorbed during a story ana morgana said patiently try to keep with the program youre supposed to feel sorry for me not make excuses for him ana dutifully smothered a grin i dont know what came over me your mushy heart as usual morgana kissed her cheek but i forgive you as they walked on a bright yellow butterfly flitted overhead absently ana lifted a hand and the swallowtail danced shyly into her palm she stopped to stroke the fragile wings why dont you tell me what you intend to do about this selfabsorbed writer who makes you so damn mad with a shrug morgana brushed a finger over a trail of wisteria ive been thinking about going to ireland for a few weeks ana released the butterfly with her best wishes then turned to her cousin id wish you a good trip but id also have to remind you that running away only postpones it doesnt solve which is why i havent packed morgana sighed ana before i left him he believed i am what i am i wanted to give him time to come to terms with it that was the crux of it ana thought she slipped a comforting hand around morganas waist it may take him more than a few days she said carefully he may not be able to come to terms with it at all i know she gazed out over the water to the horizon one never knew exactly what lay beyond the horizon ana well be lovers before morning this i know what i dont know is if this one night will make me happy or miserable nash was ecstatic as far as he could remember hed never had a story flow out of his mind with the speed and clarity of this one the treatment which hed finished in one dazzling allnighter was already on his agents desk with his track record nash wasnt worried about a sale which in a gleeful phone call his agent had told him was imminent the fact was for the first time nash wasnt even thinking about the sale the production the ultimate filming he was too absorbed in the story he wrote at all hours bounding awake at am to attack the keyboard slurping coffee in the middle of the afternoon with the story still humming like a hive of bees in his head he ate whatever came to hand slept when his eyes refused to stay open and lived within the tilted reality of his own imagination if he dreamed it was in surreal snatches with erotic images of himself and morgana sliding through the fictional world he was driven to create he would wake wanting her at times almost unbearably then he would find himself compelled to complete the task that had brought them together in the first place sometimes just before he fell into an exhausted sleep he thought he could hear her voice its not yet time but he sensed the time was coming when the phone rang he ignored it then rarely bothered to return any of the calls on his machine if he felt the need for air he took his laptop out to the patio if he could have figured out a way hed have dragged it into the shower with him in the end he snatched the hard copy from his printer as each page slid out a few adjustments here he thought scrawling notes in the margins a little finetuning there and hed have it but as he read he knew he knew hed never done better work nor had he ever finished a project so quickly from the time hed sat down and begun the screenplay only ten days had passed perhaps hed slept only thirty or forty hours total in those ten days but he didnt feel tired he felt elated after gathering the papers up he searched for an envelope books notes dishes all scattered as he dug through them he only had one thought now and that was to take it to morgana one way or the other she had inspired him to write it and she would be the first person to read it he found a tattered manila envelope covered with notations and doodles after dumping the papers inside he headed out of his office it was fortunate that he caught sight of himself in the mirror in the foyer his hair was standing on end and he had the beginnings of a fairly decent beard which as he rubbed a curious hand over his chin made him wonder if he should give growing a real one a shot all that might not have been too bad but he was standing in the foyer gripping a manila envelope and wearing nothing but the silver neck chain morgana had given him and a pair of red jockey shorts all in all it would probably be best if he took the time to clean up and dress thirty minutes later he rushed back downstairs more conservatively attired in jeans and a navy sweatshirt with only one small hole under the left armpit he had to admit the sight of his bedroom the bathroom and the rest of the house had come as quite a shock even to him it looked as though a particularly ragged army had billeted there for a few weeks hed been lucky to find any clothes at all that werent dirty or crumpled or hadnt been kicked under the bed there certainly hadnt been a clean towel so hed had to make do with a trio of washcloths still hed located his razor his comb and a matching pair of shoes so it hadnt been all that bad it took him another frustrating fifteen minutes to unearth his keys god alone knew why they were on the second shelf of the refrigerator beside a moldy peach but there they were he also noted that that very sad peach and an empty quart container of milk were all that was left after he took the keys there would be time to deal with that later gripping the script he headed out the door it wasnt until the engine sprang to life and the dash lit that nash noticed it was nearly midnight he hesitated considered calling her first or just putting off the visit until morning the hell with it he decided and shot out of the drive he wanted her now only a few miles away morgana was closing the door behind her she stepped out into the silvery light of the full moon as she walked away from the house the ceremonial robe drifted around her body cinched at the waist with a belt of crystals in her arms she carried a simple basket that contained everything she would need to observe the spring equinox it was a night of joy of celebration of thanksgiving for the renewal spring brought to the earth but her eyes were troubled in this night where light and dark were balanced her life would change she knew though she had not looked again there was no need to look when her heart had already told her it was difficult to admit that she had nearly stayed inside a challenge to fate she supposed but that would have been the cowards way she would go on with the rite as she and others like her had gone on for aeons he would come when he was to come and she would accept it twisted shadows stretched over the lawn as she moved toward the grove there was the smell of spring in the night air the nocturnal bloomers the drift of the sea the fragrance of earth she had turned herself for planting she heard the call of an owl low and lonely but she didnt look for the white wings not yet there were other sounds the gentle breath of the wind easing through the trees stroking leaves caressing branches and the murmur of music that only certain ears could hear the song of the faeries a song that was older than man she was not alone here in the shadowy grove with the drift of stars swimming overhead she had never been alone here as she approached the place of magic her mood shifted and the clouds drifted from her eyes setting the basket down she took a moment for herself standing still eyes closed hands cupped loosely at her sides she drew in the flavor and beauty of the night she could see even with her eyes closed the white moon sailing through the black sea of the sky she could see the generous light it spilled onto the trees and through them to her and the power that bloomed inside her was as cool as pure as lovely as the moonlight serenely she opened the basket from it she took a white cloth edged in silver that had been in her family for generations some said it had been a gift to merlin from the young king he had loved once it was spread on the soft ground she knelt a small round of cake a clear flask containing wine candles the witchs knife with its scribed handle the ceremonial dish and cup a small halo woven from gardenia blossoms other blooms larkspur columbine sprigs of rosemary and thyme these she scattered along with rose petals over the cloth this done she rose to cast the circle she felt the power drumming in her fingertips warmer now more urgent when the circle was complete she set candles pure as ice along its edge fourteen in all to symbolize the days between the moons waxing and its waning slowly she walked beside them holding out her hand one by one the candles flickered to flame then glowed steadily morgana stood in the center of the ring of light she unhooked the belt of crystals it slid onto the cloth like a rope of fire she slipped her arms from the thin robe it drifted to her feet like melting snow candlelight gleamed gold on her skin as she began the ancient dance at five to midnight nash pulled up in morganas driveway he swore noting that not a single light glowed in a single window hed have to wake her up he thought philosophically how much sleep did a witch need anyway he grinned to himself hed have to ask her still she was a woman women had a tendency to get ticked off if you dropped by in the middle of the night and got them out of bed it might help to have something to pave the way inspired he tucked the envelope under his arm and began to raid her flower bed he doubted shed notice that hed stolen a few blooms after all it seemed she had hundreds awash in the scent of them he got carried away gathering an overflowing armful of tulips and sweet peas narcissi and wallflowers pleased with himself he adjusted the load and strolled to her front door pan barked twice before nash could knock but no light flicked on at the dogs greeting or at the pounding nash set up he glanced back to the driveway to assure himself her car was there and then pounded again probably sleeps like a stone he thought and felt the first pricklings of annoyance there was something working in him some urgency he had to see her and it had to be tonight refusing to be put off he laid the script on the stoop and tried the knob pan barked again but to nash the dog sounded more amused than aroused finding the door locked nash started around the side he was damn well getting in and getting to her before the night was done a sudden rush of immediacy quickened his step but somewhere between the front of the house and the side terrace he found himself looking toward the grove it was there he needed to go had to go though his brain told him it was utterly foolish to go traipsing into the woods at night he followed his heart perhaps it was the shadows or the sighing of the wind that had him moving so quietly he felt somehow it would be blasphemous to make unnecessary noise there was a quality in the air here tonight and it was almost unbearably lovely yet with every step he took the blood seemed to pound faster in his head then he saw in the distance a ghostly shimmer of white he started to call out but a rustle of movement had him glancing up there on a twisted cypress branch stood a huge white owl as nash watched the bird glided soundlessly from its perch and flew toward the heart of the grove his pulse was drumming in his ears and his heart was rapping hard against his ribs he knew that even if he turned and walked away he would be drawn again to that same center so he moved forward she was there kneeling on a white cloth moonlight poured over her like silver wine again he started to call her name but the sight of her forming a circle of candles jewels at her waist flowers in her hair struck him mute trapped in the shadows he stood as she made the small golden fires spark atop the snowy candles as she disrobed to stand gloriously naked in the center of flames as she moved into a dance so graceful it stopped his breath moonlight slithered over her skin tipped her breasts caressed her thighs her hair rained an ebony waterfall down her back as she lifted her face to the stars and he remembered his dream remembered it so vividly that the fantasy and the reality merged into one potent image with morgana dancing at its center the scent of flowers grew so strong that he was nearly dizzy with it for an instant his vision dimmed he shook his head to clear it and struggled to focus the image had changed she was kneeling again sipping from a silver cup while the flames from the candles rose impossibly high surrounding her like golden bars through them he could see the shimmer of her skin the glint of silver between her breasts at her wrists he could hear her voice softly chanting then rising so that it seemed to be joined by thousands of others for a moment the grove was filled with a soft ethereal glow different from light different from shadow it pulsed and shivered glinting like the edge of a silver sword in the sun he could feel the warmth of it bathing his face then the candle flames ebbed once again to small points and the sound of chanting echoed away into silence she was rising she slipped the white robe on belted it the owl the great white bird he had forgotten in his fascination with the woman called twice before gliding like a cloud through the night she turned her breath rising high in her throat he stepped from the shadows his heart hammering in his breast for a moment she hesitated a warning whispered to her tonight would bring her pleasure more than she had known and its price would be pain more than she would wish then she smiled and stepped from the circle chapter contents prev next thousands of thoughts avalanched into his brain thousands of feelings flooded into his heart as she moved toward him her robe flowing around her like moondust all those thoughts all those feelings shivered down to one down to her he wanted to speak to tell her something anything that would explain how he felt at that moment but his heart stuttered in his throat making words impossible he knew this was more than the simple desire of a man for a woman yet whatever was spiraling through him was so far out of his experience that he was sure he could never describe it never explain it he knew only that in this place of magic at this moment of enchantment there was only one woman some quiet patient voice was whispering inside his heart that there had always been only one woman and he had been waiting all his life for her morgana stopped only an arm span away soft silent shadows waltzed between them she had only to step into that lazy dance to be in his arms he would not turn from her and she was afraid she had gone beyond the point where it was possible for her to turn from him her eyes remained on his though the little fingers of nerves pinched her skin he looked stunned she realized and she could hardly blame him if he was feeling even a fraction of the needs and fears that were skidding through her he had every right to be it would not be easy for them she knew after tonight the bond would be sealed whatever decisions were made in the tomorrows by both of them that bond would not be broken she reached out to trail a hand over the flowers he still cradled in his arms she wondered if he knew by the blossoms he had chosen that he was offering her love passion fidelity and hope blooms picked in moonlight carry the charms and secrets of the night hed forgotten about them like a man waking from a dream he glanced down i stole them from your garden her lips curved beautifully he wouldnt know the language of the flowers she thought yet his hand had been guided that doesnt make their scent less sweet or the gift less thoughtful lifting her hand from them she touched his cheek you knew where to find me i yes he couldnt deny the urge that had brought him into the grove i did why did you come i wanted to he remembered his frantic rush to leave the house his impatience to see her but no it was more basic than that and infinitely more simple i needed you for the first time her gaze wavered she could feel the need radiating from him like heat to warm her and to tempt her it could if she did nothing to stop it bind her to him so firmly that no charm no spell would ever free her her power was not absolute her own wishes were not always granted to take him tonight would be to risk everything including her power to stand alone until tonight freedom had always been her most prized possession lifting her gaze to his again she cast that possession away what i give you tonight i give with a free heart what i take from you i take without regrets her eyes glittered with visions he couldnt see remember that come with me she took his hand and drew him into the circle of light the moment he stepped through the flames he felt the change the air was purer here its scent more vivid as if they had climbed to the top of some high untraveled cliff even the stars seemed closer and he could see the trails of moonlight silveredged white streaks through the sheltering trees but she was the same her hand firm in his what is this place instinctively he lowered his voice to a whisper not in fear but in reverence it seemed to drift off twining with the harp song that filled the air it needs no name she drew her hand from his there are many forms of magic she said and unfastened her belt of crystals well make our own here she smiled again an it harm none slowly she placed the crystal rope on the edge of the cloth then turned to face him with the moonlight silvering her eyes she opened her arms she took him in and the lips she offered were warm and soft he could taste the lingering sweetness of the wine she had drunk as well as her own richer more potent flavor he wondered that any man could survive without that heady drugging taste that any man would choose to his head spun with it as she urged him to drink deeper on a moan that seemed to spring from his soul he dragged her closer crushing the flowers between them so that the night air swelled with their scent his mouth branded hers before moving frantically over her face behind her closed lids she could see the dance of candlelight could see the single shadow her body and nashs made sway she could hear the deep pure resonance of the breeze singing through the leaves the night music that was its own kind of magic and she heard the whisper of her name as it breathed through the lips that once again searched for hers but it was what she felt that was so much more real this deep well of emotion that filled for him as it had never filled for anyone as she gave him her heart for a second time that well brimmed then overflowed in a quiet steady stream for a moment she was afraid she might drown in it and that fear brought on racking shudders murmuring to her nash drew her closer whether it was in need or comfort morgana didnt know but she settled again and accepted the captivator became the captivated he was struggling against some clawing beast prowling in his gut demanding that he take her quickly feed himself he had never never experienced such a violent surge of hunger for anything or anyone as he did for morgana in that glowing circle of light he fisted his hands in her hair to keep them from tearing the robe from her some flicker shadowed by instinct told him she would accept the speed respond to this gnawing appetite but it wasnt the way not here not now pressing his face to the curve of her neck he held her close and fought it back understanding didnt make her heartbeat less erratic his desire to take warred with his desire to give and both were ripe with power his choice would make a difference and though she couldnt see she knew that the texture of their loving tonight would matter to both of them in all the years to come nash i he shook his head then leaned back and framed her face in his hands they werent steady nor was his breathing his eyes were dark intense she wondered that they couldnt see into her and study her heart you scare the hell out of me he managed i scare the hell out of me its different now morgana do you understand yes it matters it matters he let out a long unsteady breath im afraid ill hurt you you will hurt me the certainty of it shivered through her the pain would come no matter what defenses she used but not tonight you wont she kissed him gently no he thought as his cheek rubbed against hers he wouldnt he couldnt though desire continued to beat in his blood its tempo had slowed his hands were steady again as he slipped the robe from her shoulders followed it down her arms until they were both free of it the pleasure of looking at her was like a velvet fist pressed against his heart he had seen her body before when he had watched her dance naked in the circle but that had been like a dream as if she were some beautiful phantom just out of his reach now she was only a woman and his hand would not pass through if he tried to touch her face first he glided his fingertips over her cheeks her lips her jaw and down the slender column of her throat and she was real hadnt he felt her warm breath against his skin wasnt he now feeling the hammerbeat of her pulse when his fingers lingered witch or mortal she was his to cherish to enjoy to pleasure it was meant to be here surrounded by the old silent trees by shadowed light by magic her eyes changed as a womans would when her system was crowded with desire and anticipation he watched them as he trailed those curious fingers over the slope of her shoulders down her arms and back again her breath began to shiver through her parted lips just as lightly just as slowly his touch skimmed down to her breasts now her breath caught on a moan and she swayed but he made no move to possess her only skimming patiently over those soft slopes brushing his thumbs over nipples that hardened and ached in response she couldnt move if the hounds of hell had burst out of the trees jaws snapping she would have stood just as she was body throbbing eyes fixed helplessly on his did he know could he know what a spell he had cast over her with this exquisite tenderness there was nothing else for her but him she could see only his face feel only his hands with each unsteady breath she took she was filled with him he followed the line of her body down her rib cage detouring around to her back where her hair drifted over his hands and her spine trembled under them he wondered why he had thought it necessary to speak when he could tell her so much more with a touch her body was a banquet of slender curves smooth skin subtle muscles but he no longer felt the urge to ravish how much better it was this time to sample to savor to seduce how much more power did a man need than to feel a womans skin singing under his hands he skimmed over her hips let his fingers glide over those long lovely thighs changing the angle on the return journey so that he absorbed all the little bolts of pleasure at finding her already hot and damp for him when her knees buckled he gathered her close lowering her to the cloth so that he could begin the same glorious journey with his lips steeped in sensation she tugged his shirt away so that she could feel the wonder of his flesh sliding over hers his muscles were taut showing her that the gentleness he gave her took more strength than wild passion would have she murmured something and he brought his mouth back to hers so that she could slide the jeans over his hips cast them away and make him as vulnerable as she sweet mindless pleasure long lingering delights the moon showered its fragile light as they offered each other the most precious of gifts the scattered flowers they lay on sent up exotic perfumes to mix with the scent of the night though the breeze rustled the leaves the encircling flames ran straight and true even when passion gripped them sending them rolling over crushed blooms and rumpled silk there was no rush somewhere in the shadows the owl called again and the ring of flames shot up like lances closing them in closing all else out her body was shuddering but there were no longer any nerves or fears her arms encircled him as he slipped inside her with his blood roaring in his head he watched her eyes flutter open saw those gold stars shining against the deep blue as magnificently as those overhead shone in the sky he lowered his mouth to hers as they moved together in a dance older and more powerful than any other she felt the beauty of it the magic that was more potent than anything she could conjure he filled her utterly even when the ache drove them both the tenderness remained two glistening tears slipped from her eyes as she arched for him letting her body fly with that final staggering release she heard him call out her name like a prayer as he poured himself into her when he buried his face in her hair shuddering she saw the flash of a shooting star streaking like a flame through the velvet sky time passed minutes hours it didnt concern him all he knew was that she was as soft as a wish beneath him her body relaxed but still curled into his nash thought it would be delightful for them to stay just like this until sunrise then he thought more practically that he would probably end up smothering her when he started to shift morgana clamped herself around him like a vise uhuh she said sleepily since she insisted he thought he might as well nibble on her neck i may be on the thin side but id guess i have you by a good sixty pounds besides i want to look at you he levered himself onto his elbows and pleased himself her hair was spread out like tangled black silk on the white cloth there were flowers caught in it making him think of gypsies and faeries and witches he let out a long labored breath what happens when a mortal makes love to a witch she had to smile and did so slowly sinuously did you happen to notice the gargoyles on the tower of the house nashs mouth opened then closed again morgana let out a long rich laugh as her fingers danced down his spine i love it when youre gullible he was feeling entirely too good to be annoyed instead he played with her hair it seemed like a reasonable question i mean you are i know you are but its still tough to swallow even after what i saw tonight his eyes came back to hers i watched you she traced his lips with a fingertip i know ive never seen anything more beautiful you the light the music his brows came together there was music for those who know how to hear it for those who are meant to hear it it wasnt so hard to accept after everything else what are you doing here it looked like some kind of ceremony tonights the spring equinox a magic night what happened here with us was magic too because he couldnt resist he kissed her shoulder it sounds like a tired line but its never been like this for me before with anyone no she smiled again not with anyone her pulse leapt as she felt him harden inside her again she murmured when his lips lowered to hers the night moved toward morning before they dressed as nash pulled on his sweatshirt he watched morgana gathering up the crushed and broken flowers i guess we did them in ill have to steal you some more smiling she cradled them in her arms these will do nicely she said nashs eyes widened when he saw that the flowers she held were now as full and fresh as when he had first picked them he passed a hand through his hair i dont think im going to get used to that anytime soon she merely placed them in his hands hold them for me i have to remove the circle she gestured and the candle flames died as she took them from the ground she chanted quietly the circle cast in the moons light is lifted now by my right the work is done with harm to none with love and thanks i set thee free as i will so mote it be she set the last candle in the basket then lifted the cloth when it was folded she put it away thats ah all there is to it she picked up the basket and turned to him things are usually more simple than we believe morgana offered a hand pleased when he curled his fingers around hers and in the spirit of that simplicity will you share my bed for whats left of the night he brought their joined hands to his lips and gave her a simple answer yes she couldnt get enough of him nash thought dreamily during the night they had turned to each other again and again drifting off to sleep drifting into love while the moonlight faded and now when the sun was a pale red glow behind his closed lids she was nuzzling his ear he smiled murmuring to her as he let himself float toward wakefulness her head was a warm welcome weight on his chest the way she was tickling and teasing his ear told him she would not object to some lazy morning loving more than willing to oblige her he lifted a hand to stroke her hair his hand stopped in midair how could her head be on his chest and her mouth be at his ear anatomically speaking it just didnt figure but then again hed seen her do several things that didnt figure in terms of the simple laws of the real world but this was too weird even halfawake his lively imagination bounced would he open his eyes to look and see something so fantastic so out of his realm that it would send him screaming out into the night day he reminded himself it was day but that was hardly the point cautiously he let his hand lower until it touched her hair soft thick but god the shape of her head was wrong shed changed shed shed shifted into when her head moved under his hand nash let out a muffled cry and with his heart skating into his throat opened his eyes the cat lay on his chest staring at him with unblinking and somehow smug amber eyes nash jolted when something cold slid over his cheek he found that pan was standing with his forelegs on the bed his big silver head tilted curiously to one side before nash could speak the dog licked him again oh boy while nash waited for his mind to clear and his pulse to settle luna stood stretched then padded up his chest to peer into his face her muttered purr seemed distinctly like a chuckle okay sure you got me he reached out with each hand to rub a furry head pan took that for a welcome and leapt onto the bed he landed lightfooted fortunately on nashs most vulnerable area with a strangled oof nash sat bolt upright dislodging the cat and making her rap up against pan things looked dicey for a moment with the animals glaring and growling at each other but nash was too concerned with getting his wind back to worry about the prospect of fur flying ah playing with the animals sucking in air nash looked up to see morgana standing in the doorway the moment she was spotted luna flicked her tail in pans face strolled over to a pillow circled sat and began to wash her hindquarters tail thumping pan plopped down nash figured he had about seventy pounds of muscle pinning his legs to the mattress my pets seem very fond of you yeah were one happy family with a steaming mug in one hand she crossed to the bed she was already dressed in a little red number with beads and embroidery on the wide shoulders and tiny snaps running down the front until they ran out at the hem which stopped several inches above her very sexy knees nash wondered if he should undo the snaps one at a time or in one quick yank then he caught a scent that was nearly as exotic and every bit as seductive as her perfume is that coffee morgana sat on the edge of the bed and sniffed the contents of the cup yes i believe it is grinning he reached out to toy with the end of the hair shed woven into an intricate braid that was awfully sweet of you her eyes mirrored surprise what was oh you think i brought this in for you watching him she tapped a fingertip against the mug that i brewed a pot of coffee poured a cup and decided to serve it to you in bed because youre so damn cute properly chastened he sent one last longing look at the mug well i in this case she said interrupting him you happen to be exactly right he took the cup she offered watching her over the rim as he drank he wasnt a coffee snob couldnt afford to be with the mud he usually made for himself but he was sure this was the best cup to be found west of the mississippi thanks morgana he reached up to set one of the complex arrangements of beads and stones at her ears jangling just how damn cute am i she laughed pushing the mug aside so that she could kiss him youll do nash more than do she thought as she kissed him again with that tousled sunstreaked hair tumbled around a sleepy face that surprisingly wellmuscled chest tempting her above the tangle of sheets and that very warm very skilled mouth rubbing against hers he did magnificently she pulled back not without regret i have to go to work today lazily he cupped his hand around the back of her neck to urge her closer dont you know its a national holiday today sure she smelled like night he thought like flowers that bloom only in starlight its national lovein day a tribute to the sixties youre supposed to celebrate it by i get the picture and thats very inventive she said closing her teeth over his bottom lip but i have a shop to run thats very unpatriotic of you morgana im shocked drink your coffee she stood to keep from letting him change her mind theres food in the kitchen if you feel like breakfast you could have gotten me up he snagged her hand before she could retreat i thought you could use the sleep and i didnt want to give you any more time to distract me his eyes slanted up to hers as he nibbled on her knuckles id like to spend several hours distracting you her knees went weak ill give you a chance later we could have dinner we could her blood was beginning to hum but she couldnt make herself pull her hand free why dont i pick something up bring it by why dont you he opened her hand to press a kiss on the palm seventhirty fine youll let pan out wont you sure his teeth grazed her wrist and sent her pulse soaring morgana one more thing her body yearned toward his nash i really cant dont worry but he could see that she was worried and it delighted him im not going to muss you up its going to be too much fun thinking about doing just that for the next few hours i left something for you on the front stoop last night i was hoping youd find time to read it your script youve finished all but some finetuning i think id like your opinion then ill try to have one she leaned over to kiss him again bye see you tonight he settled back with the cooling coffee then swore morgana turned at the doorway what my cars parked behind yours let me get some pants on she laughed nash really with that she strolled away the cat jumped off the bed and followed yeah nash said to the nowsnoozing pan i guess she can take care of it sitting back he prepared to drink his coffee in solitary splendor as he sipped he studied the room this was the first chance hed taken to see what morgana surrounded herself with in her most private place there was drama of course she walked with drama wherever she went here it was typified in the bold jewel colors shed chosen turquoise for the walls emerald for the spread they had kicked aside during the night bleeding hues of both were in the curtains that fluttered at the windows a daybed upholstered in sapphire stretched under one window it was plumped with fat pillows of garnet amethyst and amber arched over it was a slender brass lamp with a globe shaped like a lush purple morning glory the bed itself was magnificent a lake of tumbled sheets bordered by massive curved head and footboards intrigued nash started to get up pan was still pinning his legs but after a couple of friendly nudges he rolled aside obligingly to snore in the center of the bed naked mug in one hand nash began to wander the room a polished silver dragon stood on the nightstand his head back his tail flashing the wick between his open jaws announced that he would breathe fire she had one of those pretty mirrored vanities with a padded stool that nash had always considered intensely feminine he could imagine her sitting there running the jewelcrusted silverbacked brush through her hair or anointing her skin with the creams or lotions from one of the colorful glass pots that stood on it winking in the sunlight unable to resist he picked one up removing the long crystal top and sniffing at that moment she was so much in the room with him he could almost see her that was the complexity and power of a womans magic reluctantly he recapped the bottle and set it aside damn it he didnt want to wait through the day for her he didnt want to wait an hour easy kirkland he lectured himself shed only been gone five minutes he was acting like a man besotted or bewitched that thought set off a niggling little doubt that he frowned over for a moment then shoved aside he wasnt under any kind of spell he knew exactly what he was doing and he was in complete control of his actions it was just that the room held so much of her and being in it made him want frowning he ran his fingers through a pile of smooth colored stones she kept in a bowl if he was obsessing about her that too could be explained she wasnt an ordinary woman after what hed seen with what he knew it was natural for him to think about her more often than he might about someone else after all the supernatural was his forte morgana was living proof that the extraordinary existed in an ordinary world she was an incredible lover generous free outrageously responsive she had humor and wit and brains as well as an agile body that combination alone could make a man sit up and beg when you added the fairy dust she became downright irresistible plus shed helped him with his story the more nash thought about it the more he was certain the script was his best work to date but what if she hated it the idea jumped into his mind like a warty toad and had him staring into space just because they had shared a bed and something else too intangible for him to name didnt mean she would understand or appreciate his work what the hell had he been thinking of giving it to her to read before hed polished it terrific he thought in disgust and bent to snatch up his jeans now he had that to worry about for the next several hours as he strode off to shower nash wondered how he had gotten in so deep that a woman could drive him crazy in so many ways chapter contents prev next it was more than four hours later before morgana had a chance for a cup of tea and a moment alone customers phone calls arriving shipments had kept her busy enough that shed had time enough only to glance at the first page or two of nashs script what she saw intrigued her enough to have her resenting each interruption now she heated water and nibbled on tart green grapes mindy was in the shop waiting on two college students since both students were male morgana knew mindy wouldnt need any help with a sigh she brewed the tea set it to steep then settled down with nashs script an hour later shed forgotten the tea that grew cold in the pot fascinated she flipped back to page one and began all over again it was brilliant she thought and felt a surge of pride that the man she loved could create something so rich so clever so absorbing talented yes shed known he was talented his movies had always entertained and impressed her but shed never read a screenplay before somehow shed thought it would be no more than an outline the bare bones that a director actors technicians would flesh out for an audience but this was so rich in texture so full of life and spirit that it didnt seem like words on paper at all she could already see and hear and feel she imagined that when those extra layers were added by the actors the camera the director nash might very well have the film of the decade on his hands it stunned her that the man she thought of as charming a bit cocky and often full of himself had something like this inside him then again it had rocked her the night before to discover that he had such deep wells of tenderness setting the script aside she leaned back in her chair and she had always considered herself so astute she thought with a little smile just how many more surprises did nash kirkland have up his sleeve he was working on the next one as hard as he could inspiration had struck and nash had never been one to let a good idea slip away hed had a moments twinge at the notion of leaving morganas back door unlocked but hed figured that with her reputation and with the wolfdog roaming the grounds nobody would dare break in for all he knew shed cast some sort of protective spell over the house in any case it was going to be perfect he told himself as he struggled to arrange an armload of flowers purchased this time in a vase they seemed to take on a life of their own stems jamming heads drooping after several tries the arrangement still looked as though the flowers had been shoved into the container by a careless tenyearold by the time hed finished hed filled three vases and was happy to admit hed never be a set director but they smelled good a glance at his watch warned him that time was running short crouching in front of the hearth he built a fire it took him longer and he imagined it took considerably more effort than it would have taken morgana but at last the flames were licking cheerfully at the wood a fire was hardly necessary but he liked the effect satisfied he rose to check the scene hed so carefully set the table for two was laid with a white cloth hed found in the drawer of the sideboard in morganas dining room though that room had had possibilities with its soaring ceiling and its huge fireplace he thought the drawing room more intimate the china was hers too and looked old and lovely with little rosebuds hugging the edges of gleaming white plates hed arranged the heavy silverware and the crystal champagne glasses all hers as well and folded the deep rose damask napkins into neat triangles perfect he decided then swore music how could he have forgotten the music and the candlelight he made a dash to the stereo and fumbled through a wide selection of cds chopin he decided though he was more in tune with the rolling stones than with classical music he switched it on and slipped the disc in then nodded his approval after the first few bars then he went on a treasure hunt for candles ten minutes later he had over a dozen ranged throughout the room glowing and wafting out the fragrances of vanilla jasmine sandalwood hed barely had time to pat himself on the back when he heard her car he beat pan to the door by inches outside morgana lifted a brow when she spotted nashs car but the fact that he was nearly a half hour early didnt annoy her not in the least she was smiling as she crossed to the door his script under one arm a bottle of champagne in the other he opened the door and scooped her up into a long luxurious kiss wanting his own greeting pan did his best to crowbar between them hi nash said when he freed her mouth hello she handed nash both bottle and envelope so that she could ruffle pans fur before closing the door youre early i know he glanced at the label on the bottle well well are we celebrating i thought we should as she straightened her braid slid over her shoulder actually its a little congratulatory gift for you but id hoped youd share be glad to what am i being congratulated for she nodded toward the envelope in his hand for that your story he felt the little knot that had remained tight in his stomach all day loosen you liked it no i loved it and once i sit down and take my shoes off ill tell you why lets go in here after shifting the bottle and envelope to one arm he tucked the other around her how was business oh its ticking right along in fact i may see if mindy can squeak out another hour or two a day for me weve been her words trailed off as she stepped into the drawing room the candleglow was as mystic and romantic as moonbeams it glinted on silver tossed rainbows from crystal everywhere was the perfume of flowers and candle wax and the haunting strains of violins the fire smoldered gently it wasnt often she was thrown off balance so completely now she felt the sting of tears in the back of her throat tears that sprang from an emotion so pure and bright she could hardly bear it she looked at him and the flickering light tossed dozens of stars into her eyes did you do this for me a little off balance himself he skimmed his knuckles over her cheek mustve been elves her curving lips brushed his im very very fond of elves he shifted until their bodies met how do you feel about screenwriters her arms slid comfortably around his waist im learning to like them good as he settled into the kiss nash realized his arms were too encumbered to allow him to give it his best shot why dont i get rid of this stuff open the champagne that sounds like an excellent idea with a long contented sigh she slipped out of her shoes while he walked over to pluck out a bottle already nestled in the ice bucket he turned both hers and his around to show the identical labels telepathy moving toward him she smiled anythings possible he tossed the envelope aside snuggled the second bottle in the ice then opened the first with a cheerful pop and fizz he poured and then after handing her a glass rang his against it to magic always she murmured and sipped taking his hand she led him to the couch where she could curl up close and watch the fire so what did you do today besides call up some elves i wanted to show you my cary grant side with a chuckle she brushed her lips over his cheek i like all of your sides contented he propped his feet on the coffee table well i spent a lot of time trying to get those flowers to look like they do in the movies she glanced over well concede that your talents dont run to floral arranging i love them i figured the effort was worth something he entertained himself by toying with her earring i did a little finetuning on the script thought about you a lot took a call from my very excited agent thought about you some more she chuckled and laid her head on his shoulder home she was home completely sounds like a very productive day what was your agent excited about well it seems hed taken a call from a very interested producer delight shimmered from her eyes as she sat up again your screenplay right the first time it felt a little odd no nash thought it felt wonderfully odd to have someone so obviously excited for him actually its the treatment but since my lucks been running pretty well weve got a deal in the works im going to let the script cook a couple of days and take another look then ill ship it off to him its not luck she tapped her glass to his again youve got magic up there she laid a finger on his temple and in here and on his heart or wherever imagination comes from for the first time in his adult life he thought he might blush so he kissed her instead thanks i couldnt have done it without you with a light laugh she settled back id hate to disagree with you so i wont he ran an idle hand down the braid on her shoulder it felt tremendously good he realized just to sit here like this at the end of the day with someone who was important to him why dont you stroke my ego and tell me what you liked about it she held out her glass so that he could top off her champagne i doubt your ego needs stroking but ill tell you anyway take your time i wouldnt want you to leave anything out all of your movies have texture even when theres blood splashing around or something awful scratching at the window theres a quality that goes beyond being spooked or shocked in this though youre bound to set some hearts pumping with that graveyard scene and that business in the attic you go a step further she shifted to face him its not just a story of witchcraft and power or of conjuring forces good and bad its about people their basic humanity of believing in wonderful things and trusting your heart its a kind of funny celebration of being different even when its difficult in the end even though theres terror and pain and heartbreak there is love thats what we all want you didnt mind that i had cassandra casting spells with graveyard dirt or chanting over a cauldron artistic license morgana said with a lifted brow i suppose i found it possible to overlook your creativity even when she was prepared to sell her soul to the devil to save jonathan with a shrug he drained his glass if cassandra had the power of good the story would hardly have enough punch if she didnt have at least one match with the power of evil you see there are some basic commandments of horror even though thats not exactly what this turned out to be i think they still apply ultimate good against ultimate evil she suggested thats one the innocent must suffer he added then theres the rite of passage that same innocent must spill blood a manhood thing morgana said dryly or womanhood im no sexist and good must through great sacrifice triumph seems fair theres one more my personal favorite he skimmed a fingertip up her neck chills chased it the audience should wonder and keep wondering if whatever evil thats been vanquished slinked free again after the final fadeout she pursed her lips we all know evils always slinking free exactly he grinned the same way we all wonder from time to time if there really is something drooling in the closet at night after the lights go out and were alone he nipped at her earlobe or whats really rustling the bushes outside the cellar window or skulking in the shadows ready waiting to ooze out and when the doorbell rang she jolted nash laughed morgana swore why dont i get it he suggested she made a stab at dignity and smoothed down her skirt why dont you when he walked out she let go with a quick shudder he was good she admitted so damn good that she who knew better had been sucked right in she was still deciding whether to forgive him or not when nash came back with a tall gangly man hefting a huge tray the man wore a white tux and a red bow tie stitched over his chest pocket was chez maurice set it right on the table maurice its george sir the man said in a sorrowful voice right nash winked at morgana just dish everything right on up im afraid this will take me a moment or two weve got time the mocha mousse should remain chilled sir george pointed out nash realized that the poor man had a permanent apology stuck in his throat ill take it into the kitchen morgana rose to take the container as she left them she heard george murmuring sadly that the radicchio had been off today and theyd had to make do with endive he lives for food nash explained when morgana returned a few moments later it makes him weep to think how careless some of the new delivery boys are with the stuffed mushrooms bruising them heedlessly heathens exactly what i said it seemed to put george in a better frame of mind or maybe it was the tip so what has george brought us she wandered over to the table endive salad the radicchio was off i heard mmm lobster tails a la maurice naturally she smiled over her shoulder as nash pulled out her chair is there a maurice george was sorry to report that hes been dead for three years but his spirit lives on she laughed and began to enjoy her food this is very inventive takeout id considered a bucket of chicken but i thought this would impress you more it does she dipped a bite of lobster in melted butter watching him as she slipped it between her lips you set a very attractive stage her hand brushed lightly over his thank you anytime the fact was he was hoping thered be dozens of other times dozens of other stages with the two of them just the two of them as the only players he caught himself annoyed that he was thinking such serious thoughts such permanent thoughts to lighten the mood he poured more champagne morgana yes theres something ive been wanting to ask you he brought her hand to his lips finding her skin much more alluring than the food is mrs littletons niece going to the prom she blinked first then threw her head back with a rich laugh my god nash youre a romantic just curious because he couldnt resist the way her eyes danced he grinned okay okay i like happilyeverafter as well as the next guy did she get her man morgana sampled another bite it seems jessie worked up the courage to ask matthew if hed like to go to the prom with her good for her and well i have this all secondhand from mrs littleton so it may not be precisely accurate nash leaned forward to flick a finger down her nose listen babe im the writer you dont have to pause for dramatic effect spill it my information is that he blushed stuttered a bit pushed up these cute hornrim glasses he wears and said he guessed so solemnly nash raised his glass to jessie and matthew morgana lifted her own to first love its the sweetest he wasnt sure about that since hed been so successful in avoiding the experience what happened to your high school sweetheart what makes you think i had one doesnt everyone morgana acknowledged that with a faint cock of her brow actually there was one boy his name was joe and he played on the basketball team a jock im afraid joe was secondstring but he was tall height was important to me in those days as i loomed over half the boys in my class we dated on and off through senior year she sipped her wine and did a lot of necking in his pinto hatchback nash asked between bites i believe so i like to get a clear visual he grinned dont stop now i can see it exterior scene night the parked car on a dark lonely road the two sweethearts entwined stealing desperate kisses as the radio sings out with the theme from a summer place i believe it was hotel california she corrected okay then the last guitar riff fades im afraid thats about it he went to berkeley in the fall and i went to radcliffe height and a nice pair of lips just wasnt enough to keep my heart involved at a distance of three thousand miles nash sighed for all men frailty thy name is woman i believe joe recovered admirably he married an economics major and moved to st louis at last count theyd produced threefifths of their own basketball team good old joe this time morgana refilled the glasses how about you i never played much ball i was talking about high school sweethearts oh he leaned back enjoying the moment the fire crackling at his back the woman smiling at him through the candlelight the goodnatured fizz of champagne in his head she was vicki with an i a cheerleader what else morgana agreed i mooned over her for nearly two months before i worked up the courage to ask her out i was shy morgana smiled over the rim of her glass tell me something i can believe no really id transferred in the middle of junior year by that time all the groups and cliques are so firmly established it took a crowbar to break them up youre odd man out so you spend a lot of time watching and imagining she felt a stirring of sympathy but she wasnt sure hed welcome it and you spent time watching vicki with an i i spent a whole lot of time watching vicki felt like decades the first time i saw her do a c jump i was in love he paused to study morgana were you a cheerleader no sorry too bad i still get palpitations watching c jumps anyway i finally sweated up the nerve to ask her to the movies it was friday the th the movie not the date while jason was hacking away at the very unhappy campers i made a fumbling pass vicki received we were an item for the rest of the school year then she dumped me for this hood with a motorcycle and a tattoo the hussy shrugging philosophically he polished off his lobster i heard she eloped with him and they went to live in a trailer park in el paso which is no more than she deserved after breaking my heart tilting her head morgana gave him a narrowed look i think you made it up only part of it he didnt like to talk about his past not with anyone to distract her he rose and changed the music now it was slow dreamy gershwin coming back to the table he took her hand to draw her to her feet i want to hold you he said simply morgana moved easily into his arms and let him lead at first they merely swayed to the music his arms around her waist hers around his neck their eyes on each others then he guided her into a dance so that their bodies flowed together to the low throb of the music he wondered if he would always think of her in candlelight it suited her so well that creamy irish skin glowed as fragilely as the rosetipped china her hair black as the night that deepened beyond the windows was showered with little stars of light there were more stars in her eyes sprinkled like moondust over the deep midnight blue the first kiss was quiet a soft meeting of lips that promised more that promised anything that could be wished he felt the champagne spin in his head as he lowered his mouth to hers again as her lips parted beneath his like the petals of a rose her fingers glided silkily along his neck teasing nerves to the surface a low moan sounded in her throat a moan that had his blood humming in response her body moved against his as she deepened the kiss her eyes remained open drawing him in he slid his hands up her back aroused by her quick shudder of response watching her wanting her he tugged the band from the end of her braid combing tensed fingers through to loosen the intricate coils he could hear her breath catch see her eyes darken as he dragged her head back and plundered that wide unpainted mouth she tasted danger and delight and desperation the combination swirled inside her a headier brew than any wine his muscles were wire taut under her hands and she shivered with a mixture of fear and pleasure at the thought of what would happen when they sprang free desire took many forms tonight she knew it would not come as the patient reverent exploration they had known before tonight there were fires raging something snapped he could all but hear the chains on his control break he pulled away his hands still gripping her arms his body a mass of aches and needs she said nothing only stood her lips soft and swollen from his her hair tumbled like restless night around her shoulders her eyes full of smoke and secret promises he dragged her back again even as his mouth was devouring hers he lifted her off her feet shed never believed she would allow herself to be swept away shed been wrong as he strode from the room and up the stairs both her mind and her body went willingly with him reckless and ready she let her lips race over his face down his throat and back up to meet his avid mouth he didnt pause at the bedroom door not even when he saw that shed brought the candles and music with them the bed was centered in their glow beckoning he tumbled onto it with her impatient hands hungry mouths desperate words he couldnt get enough there couldnt be enough to fill this gnawing need he knew she was with him flame for flame demand for demand but he wanted to push her further and faster until there was nothing but blazing heat and wild wind she couldnt get her breath the air was too heavy and hot so hot she wondered that her skin didnt burst into flames she reached for him thinking she would ask beg for a moment to stop and catch her sanity then his mouth crushed hers again and even the wish for reason was lost in a mindless haze of greed he yanked his hand down the front of her dress snaps burst open like tiny explosions to reveal flushed skin and seductive black lace with a breathless oath he ripped the flimsy cloth aside so that her breasts spilled into his restless hands she cried out not in fear or in pain but in wonder as his greedy mouth scorched her skin he was ruthless relentless reckless need sliced through him hot knives of desire that cut all ties to the civilized his hands moved over her leaving aches and trembles in their wake her response was not submission not surrender but rather a greed that swelled as ripely as his own she took she tormented she tantalized they went tumbling over the bed caught up in a war of passion wild hands tugging and tearing at clothes seeking the pleasure of flesh slicked from the heat he did as he chose releasing every dark fantasy that had spun in his mind touching tasting devouring she crested hard clinging to him as the wave shot her up and left her wrecked his name was a mindless chant through her trembling lips a chant that ended on a sob when he sent her soaring again dazed she rose above him he could see the candlelight shivering over her skin and her eyes dark and glazed with what he had given her he knew he would die if he didnt have her tonight tomorrow a thousand tomorrows he pressed her back into the mattress clamping his hands on hers breath heaving he held on long enough for their eyes to meet was it challenge he saw in hers was it triumph then he plunged deep her hands fisted beneath his and her body rose up to meet him speed power glory they raced together stroke for stroke with a strength born of shattering needs his mouth sought hers again in a bruising kiss her arms vised around him those short neat nails raking desperately down his back he felt her agile body convulse heard her broken gasp of stunned pleasure then his mind went dim as he leapt off the razors edge to follow her a long time later he clawed his way back to reason hed rolled off her wanting to let her breathe now she lay on her stomach sprawled across the bed catching his own breath he stared into the shadows flipping back through his mind what had passed between them he wasnt sure whether to be appalled or delighted hed well he supposed plundered would be an apt word he certainly hadnt been worried about the niceties however much pleasure hed found in making love with a woman before hed never slipped over the edge into madness it had its points he realized but he wasnt sure how morgana might feel about having had her clothes ripped off her nash laid a tentative hand on her shoulder she shuddered wincing he took it away again morgana are you all right she made some sound something between a whimper and a moan he felt a quick stab of fear at the thought that she might be crying good going kirkland he thought furiously then tried again he stroked a hand down her hair babe morgana im sorry if i he let his words trail off not certain what to say slowly she turned her head managed to lift up a limp hand far enough to rake the tangled hair out of her eyes she blinked at him did you say something i was just are you okay she sighed it was a long catlike sound that made his treacherous body twang okay she seemed to roll the word around testing it with her tongue i dont think so ask me again when i find the energy to move she slid her hand over the tangled sheets to take his are you am i what okay i wasnt the one being plundered the word had a smile spreading lazily over her face no i thought i did a pretty good job she stretched and was pleased to see that her body was nearly in working order again give me an hour and ill try again relief began to trickle through youre not upset do i look upset he thought it over she looked like a cat whod happily gorged on a gallon of cream he didnt even realize hed started to grin no i guess not pleased with yourself arent you maybe i am he started to reach out to drag her closer and found his fingers tangled in what was left of her bra are you she wondered that the grin didnt split his face he was watching her all but whistling a tune as he spun the tattered lace on one finger morgana pushed up to her knees noted his very satisfied eyes skimmed over her do you know what nash no what im going to have to wipe that grin off your face yeah how tossing her hair back she planted herself over him slowly sinuously she slid down watch me chapter contents prev next as far as nash was concerned life was a pretty good deal he spent his days doing something he loved and he was paid very well to do it he had his health a new home and an interesting deal in the works best of all he was enjoying an incredible affair with a fascinating woman a woman who hed discovered in the past weeks he was not only desperately attracted to but considered a friend nash had learned through trial and error that a lover you couldnt enjoy out of bed satisfied the body but left the spirit wanting with morgana hed found a woman he could laugh with talk with argue with and make love with all with a sense of intimacy hed never experienced before a sense of intimacy he hadnt realized he wanted before there were even times he forgot she was something more than a woman now as he finished the series of pushups he forced himself to perform three times a week he thought over their last few days together theyd taken a long leisurely drive up to big sur to stand at an overlook wind whipping their hair as they looked out over the staggering view of hills and water and cliffs like tourists theyd taken snapshots with her camera videos with his though hed felt a little foolish hed even scooped up a few pebbles when she wasnt looking to slip into his pocket as a souvenir of the day hed tagged along while shed poked around in the shops in carmel and had been goodnaturedly resigned when she piled packages into his arms lunch on the terrace of some pretty cafe surrounded by flowers sunset picnics on the beach sitting with his arm around her her head on his shoulder while the great red orb bled fire into the sky and then sank into the indigo sea quiet kisses at dusk easy laughter intimate looks in crowded places it was almost as if he was courting her with a grunt nash let his arms relax courting no that wasnt what it was at all he assured himself rolling over on his back they simply enjoyed each others company a great deal but it wasnt courtship courtship had a sneaky habit of leading to marriage and marriage nash had decided long ago was one experience he could do without a niggling doubt worked into his mind as he stood to flex the muscles hed toned over the past half hour had he done anything to make her think that what they had together might lead to something well something legal and permanent with deedee he had spelled out everything from the getgo and still shed been smugly certain she could change his mind but with morgana hed said nothing hed been too busy falling for her to be practical the last thing he wanted to do was hurt her she was too important she meant too much she was slow down kirkland he warned himself uneasily sure she was important he cared about her but that didnt mean he was going to start thinking about love love also had a nasty habit of leading to marriage frowning he stood in the middle of the room hed set up with benches and weights sweat trickled unnoticed down his face as he cautiously took a peek at what was in his heart okay yes he cared about her maybe more than hed ever cared about anyone but that was a long way from orange blossoms station wagons and a cozy cottage for two rubbing a hand over his heart he geared himself up for a closer look why did he think about her so often he couldnt remember another woman intruding on his daily routine the way morgana did there were times when he stopped whatever he was doing just to wonder what she was doing it had gotten so that he didnt sleep well unless she was with him if he awakened in the morning and she wasnt there he started the day with a nagging sense of disappointment it was a bad sign he thought as he grabbed a towel to wipe his face a sign he should have picked up on long before this how come thered been no warning bells he wondered no quiet little voice whispering in his ear that it was time to take a long casual step in retreat instead hed been moving forward in a headlong rush but he hadnt gone over the edge not nash kirkland he took a deep breath and tossed the towel aside it was just the novelty he decided soon the immediacy of the feelings she brought out in him would fade as he walked off to shower he assured himself like any addict that he was still in control he could back off anytime but like fingers reaching for an itch his mind kept worrying the problem maybe he was fine maybe he was in control but what about morgana was she getting in too deep if she was as tied up as he was she could be imagining what a life in the burbs monogrammed towels a riding lawn mower the cool spray of water blasted his face nash found himself grinning and hed said he wasnt sexist here he was worrying that morgana was harboring delusions of marriage and family just because she was a woman ridiculous she was no more interested in taking that deadly leap then he but as he let the water sluice over his head he began to imagine interior scene day the room is a jumbled heap of toys clothes overflowing out of plastic hampers dirty dishes in a playpen dumped in the center of the room a toddler squalls our hero walks in a bulging briefcase in his hand he wears a dark suit and a strangling tie wing tips there is a weary cast to his face a man who has faced problems all day and has come home to more honey he says with an attempt at cheer im home the baby howls and rattles his cage resigned our hero sets his briefcase aside and goes to pick up the screaming baby the childs wet diaper sags youre late again the wife shuffles in her hair is a tangled mess around a face set in stern angry lines she wears a ratty bathrobe and a pair of fuzzy slippers as our hero bounces the wet screaming baby the wife slaps her hands on her hips and begins to rattle off a list of all of his shortcomings punctuated by announcements that the washing machine has overflowed the sink is clogged and shes pregnant again just as the scene he was creating began to ease both nashs conscience and mind it faded out to be replaced by a new one coming home with the scent of flowers and the sea in the air smiling because you were almost where you wanted to be needed to be starting up the walk carrying a bouquet of tulips the door opens and she stands there her hair pulled back in a sleek ponytail her lips curved in welcome she cradles a pretty darkhaired child on her hip a child who giggles and holds out its pudgy arms he cuddles the child smelling talc and baby and his wifes subtle perfume we missed you she says and lifts her face for a kiss nash blinked with a wrench of his wrist he shut off the water then shook his head he had it bad he admitted but since he knew that second scene was more of a fantasy than anything hed ever written he was still in control when he stepped out of the shower he wondered how soon she would be there morgana punched down on the accelerator and leaned the car into a curve if felt good no it felt fabulous to be buzzing along the treelined road with the windows down and the sea breeze blowing through her hair what made it fabulous was that she was going somewhere to be with someone who had made a difference in her life shed been content without him perhaps she would have gone on being content if she had never met him but she had and nothing was ever going to be the same again she wondered if he knew how much it meant that he accepted her for what she was she doubted it she hadnt known how much it could mean until it had happened and as for nash he had a habit of looking at things at a skewed angle and seeing the humor in them she imagined he saw her talents as some kind of great joke on science and perhaps they were in a way but the important thing to her was that he knew and accepted he didnt look at her as if he expected her to grow a second head at any moment he looked at her as a woman it was easy to be in love with him though she had never considered herself a romantic she had come to appreciate all the books the songs the poetry written to celebrate the caprices of the heart it was true that when you were in love the air smelled clearer the flowers sweeter on a whim she wished a rose into her hand smiling as she sniffed the delicate closed bloom her world felt like that she realized like a rose that was just about to open it made her feel foolish to think like that giddy lightheaded but her thoughts were her own she reminded herself until she made them someone elses it occurred to her that sooner or later she would have to share them with nash she couldnt be sure how long it would be before complications set in but for now it was glorious simply to enjoy the soft spread of emotion glowing inside her as she pulled into his driveway she was smiling she had a few surprises for nash starting with her plan for this balmy saturday night she reached for the bag on the seat beside her and pan stuck his head over her shoulder just give me a minute she told him and you can get out and see whats what luna will show you around from her perch on the floor of the passenger seat luna glanced up eyes slitted if you dont behave ill dump you both back home youll have only yourselves for company until monday as she stepped from the car she felt a flicker like a curtain fluttering over her mind she stood one hand resting on the door absorbing a wash of wind a whisper of sound the air thickened grayed there was no dizziness it was as if she had stepped from sunshine into shadows shadows where mysteries waited to be solved she strained to see beyond that mist but it lay heavy teasing her with hints and glimpses only then the sun was back and there was only the sound of water rushing against rock though she hadnt sebastians gift for precognition or anastasias empathetic tendencies she understood things were about to change and soon morgana also understood that those changes might not be something she would have wished for shaking off the mood she started up the walk tomorrow could always be changed she reminded herself especially if one concentrated on now since now equaled nash she was willing to fight to keep it he opened the door before she reached it and stood hands tucked in his pockets smiling at her hi babe hi dangling the bag from one hand she linked an arm around his neck and curved her body to his for a kiss do you know how i feel yeah he skimmed his hands down her sides to her hips i know exactly how you feel fantastic she chuckled and pushed the last lingering doubts aside as it happens youre right riding on pure emotion she handed him the rose for me he wasnt exactly sure what a mans response should be when a woman gave him a rosebud absolutely for you she kissed him again while luna strolled territorially into the house how would you like to spend an evening she moved her mouth seductively to his ear an entire evening doing something voice breathy she walked her fingers up his chest decadent his blood leapt in his veins and roared in the ear she was tormenting when do we get started well she rubbed against him tilting her head back just enough to look into his eyes why waste time god i love an aggressive woman good because ive got big plans for you she caught from now ten years and still setting off that stirring in his blood my god his hand slid bonelessly from the dogs head he was in love with her really in love totally caught in the big scary l word and what the hell was he going to do about it in control he thought dazed able to back off anytime what a crock he rose on unsteady legs the clutching in his stomach was plain fear and it was for both of them she glanced over tipping the cap down so that the brim shaded her eyes something wrong no no i i was going to go in and get us something cold he all but ran into the house leaving morgana staring after him coward wimp idiot all the way into the kitchen he cursed himself after filling a glass with water he gulped it down maybe it was a touch of sun a lack of sleep an overactive libido slowly he set the glass aside like hell it was love step right up ladies and gentlemen step right up and see an average man transformed into a puddle of nerves and terror by the love of a good woman he bent over the sink and splashed water on his face he didnt know how it had happened but he was going to have to deal with it as far as he could see there was no place to run he was a grown man nash reminded himself so he would do the adult thing and face it maybe he should just tell her straight out morgana im crazy about you blowing out a breath he dashed more water onto his face too weak too ambivalent morgana ive come to realize that what i feel for you is more than attraction even more than affection this time his breath hissed out too wordy too damn stupid morgana i love you simple to the point and scary as hell he majored in scary he reminded himself he ought to be able to pull this off straightening his shoulders bracing his system he started out of the kitchen the wall phone shrilled and nearly had him jumping out of his shoes easy boy he muttered nash morgana stood in the kitchen doorway eyes full of curiosity and concern are you all right me yeah yeah im great he dragged a nervous hand through his hair how about you fine she said slowly are you going to answer the phone the phone while his mind scattered in a thousand directions he glanced at the ringing phone sure good ill fix us that cold drink while you do still frowning at him she walked to the refrigerator nash didnt notice that his palms were wet until he picked up the receiver forcing a grin he wiped his free hand on his jeans hello the excuse for a smile faded instantly stunned morgana paused with one hand on a softdrink bottle and the other on the refrigerator door shed never seen him look like this cold his eyes had frosted over ice over velvet even as he leaned back against the counter there was tension in every line of his body morgana felt a shudder rush down her spine shed known he could be dangerous and the man she was staring at now had stripped off all the easygoing charm and goodnatured humor like one of the characters nash might have conjured out of his imagination this man was capable of quick and bloodless violence whoever was on the other end of the telephone should have been grateful for the distance between them leeanne he said the name in a flat gelid tone the voice rattling brightly in his ear set his teeth on edge old memories old wounds swam to the surface he let her ramble for a moment until he was sure he had himself under control just cut to the chase leeanne how much he listened to the wheedling the whining the recriminations his responsibilities he was reminded his obligations his family no i dont give a damn its not my fault you got hung up with another loser his lips curved in a humorless smile yeah right bad luck how much he repeated barely lifting a brow at the requested amount resigned he pulled open a drawer and rummaged until he found a tattered scrap of paper and the stub of an old pencil where do i send it he scribbled yes ive got it tomorrow he tossed the paper onto the counter i said i would didnt i just drop it ive got things to do sure you bet he hung up and started to let loose with a stream of oaths then he focused on morgana hed forgotten she was there when she started to speak he shook his head im going for a walk he said abruptly and slammed out of the screen door carefully morgana set the bottle she still held on the counter whoever had called had done more than anger him she realized she had seen more than anger in his eyes she had seen grief too one had been as vicious as the other because of it she blocked her first inclination to go after him she would give him a few minutes alone first his long strides ate up the ground quickly he stalked over the grass that had given him so much pleasure when he had mowed it only an hour before passed without noticing the flowers that were already lapping up the sun now that they were free of choking weeds automatically he headed for the tumble of rocks at the edge of his property that separated his land from the bay this was another reason hed been drawn to this place the combination of wildness and serenity it suited him he supposed as he dug his hands deep in his pockets on the surface he was a relaxed contented man those qualities usually extended deeper but often maybe too often there was a recklessness swarming inside him now he dropped down on a rock and stared out over the water he would watch the gulls the waves the boats and he would wait until he felt that contentment again he drew a deep breath cleansing thank god was all he could think thank god he hadnt spoken of his feelings to morgana all it had taken was one phone call from the past to remind him that there was no place for love in his life he would have told her he realized he would have gone with the impulse of the moment and told her he loved her maybe probably he would have started to make plans then he would have messed it up no doubt he would have messed it up sabotaging relationships was in his blood his hands curled and uncurled as he struggled to level again leeanne he thought with a short bitter bark of laughter well he would send her the money and she would fade out of his life again until the money ran out and that pattern would repeat itself over and over again for the rest of his life its beautiful here morgana said quietly from behind him he didnt jolt he just sighed nash supposed he should have expected her to follow him and he supposed she would expect some sort of explanation he wondered how creative he might be should he tell her leeanne was an old lover someone hed pushed aside who wouldnt stay aside or maybe hed weave some amusing tale about being blackmailed by the wife of a mafia don with whom hed had a brief torrid affair that had a nice ring or he could work on her sympathies and tell her leeanne was a destitute widow his best friends widow who tapped him for cash now and again hell he could tell her it had been a call for the policemens fund anything anything but the bitter truth her hand brushed his shoulder as she settled on the rock beside him and demanded nothing said nothing she only looked out over the bay as he did waiting smelling of night of smoke and roses he had a terrible urge to simply turn and bury his face at her breast just to hold her and be held until all this helpless anger faded away and he knew that no matter how clever he was how glib she would believe nothing but the truth i like it here he said as if several long silent minutes hadnt passed between her observation and his response in la i looked out of my condo and saw another condo i guess i didnt realize i was feeling hemmed in until i moved here everyone feels hemmed in from time to time no matter where they live she laid a hand on his thigh when im feeling that way i go to ireland walk along an empty beach when i do i think of all the people who have walked there before and will walk there again then it occurs to me that nothing is forever no matter how bad or how good everything passes and moves on to another level all things change nothing perishes he mumbled she smiled yes id say that sums it up perfectly reaching over she cupped his face in her hands her eyes were soft and clear and her voice was full of comfort ready to be offered talk to me nash i may not be able to help but i can listen theres nothing to say something else flicked into her eyes nash cursed himself when he recognized it as hurt so im welcome in your bed but not into your mind damn it one has nothing to do with the other he wouldnt be pushed wouldnt be prodded or maneuvered into revealing parts of himself he chose to keep hidden i see her hands dropped away from his face for a moment she was tempted to help him to spin a simple charm that would give him peace of mind but it wasnt right it wouldnt be real and she knew using magic to change his feelings would only hurt them both all right then im going to go finish the marigolds she rose no recriminations no heated words he would have preferred them to this cool acceptance as she took a step away he grabbed her hand she saw the war on his face but offered nothing but silence leeannes my mother chapter contents prev next his mother it was the anguish in his eyes that had morgana masking her shock she remembered how cold his voice had been when he spoke to leeanne how his face had fallen into hard rigid lines yet the woman on the other end of the telephone line had been his mother what could make a man feel such distaste and dislike for the woman he owed his life to but the man was nash because of that she worked past her own deeply ingrained loyalty to family as she studied him hurt she realized there had been as much hurt as anger in his voice in his face then and now she could see it plainly now that all the layers of arrogance confidence and ease had been stripped away her heart ached for him but she knew mat wouldnt lessen his hurt she wished she had anastasias talent and could take on some of his pain instead she kept his hand in hers and sat beside him again no she was not an empath but she could offer support and love tell me where did he begin nash wondered how could he explain to her what he had never been able to explain to himself he looked down at their joined hands at the way her strong fingers entwined with his she was offering support understanding when he hadnt thought he needed any the feelings hed always been reluctant to voice refused to share flowed out i guess youd have to know my grandmother she was he searched for a polite way of putting it a straight arrow and she expected everyone to fly that same narrow course if i had to choose one adjective id go with intolerant shed been widowed when leeanne was about ten my grandfatherd had this insurance business so shed been left pretty well off but she liked to scrape pennies she was one of those people who didnt have it in her to enjoy life he fell silent watching the gulls sweep over the water when his hand moved restlessly in hers morgana said nothing and waited anyway it might sound kind of sad and poignant the widow with two young girls to raise alone until you understand that she liked being in charge being the widow kirkland and having no one to answer to but herself i have to figure she was pretty rough on her daughters holding holiness and sex over their heads like lightning bolts it didnt work very well with leeanne at seventeen she was pregnant and didnt have a clue who the father might have been he said it with a shrug in his voice but morgana saw beneath it you blame her for that for that he looked at her his eyes dark no not for that the old lady must have made her life hell for the best part of nine months depending on who you get it from leeanne was a poor lonely girl punished ruthlessly for one little slip or my grandmother was this longsuffering saint who took her sinful daughter in my own personal opinion is that we had two selfish women who didnt give a damn about anyone but themselves she was only seventeen nash morgana said quietly anger carved his face into hard unyielding lines thats supposed to make it okay she was only seventeen so its okay that she bounced around so many guys she didnt know who got her pregnant she was only seventeen so its okay that two days after she had me she took off left me with that bitter old woman without a word without a call or even a thought for twentysix years the raw emotion in his voice squeezed her heart she wanted to gather him close hold him until the worst of it passed but when she reached out he jerked away then stood i need to walk she made her decision quickly she could either leave him to work off his pain alone or she could share it with him before he could take three strides she was beside him taking his hand again im sorry nash he shook his head violently the air he gulped in was as sweet as spring and yet it burned like bile in his throat im sorry no reason to take it out on you she touched his cheek i can handle it but he wasnt sure he could hed never talked the whole business through before not with anyone saying it all out loud left an ugly taste in his mouth one he was afraid hed never be rid of he took another careful breath and started again i stayed with my grandmother until i was five my aunt carolyn had married he was in the army a lifer for the next few years i moved around with them from base to base he was a hardnosed bastard only tolerated me because carolyn would cry and carry on when he got drunk and threatened to send me back morgana could imagine it all too clearly the little boy in the empty middle controlled by everyone belonging to no one you hated it yeah i guess that hits the center i didnt know why exactly but i hated it looking back i realize that carolyn was as unstable as leeanne in her own way one minute shed fawn all over me the next shed ignore me she wasnt having any luck getting pregnant herself then when i was about eight or nine she found out she was going to have a kid of her own so i got shipped back to my grandmother carolyn didnt need a substitute anymore morgana felt her eyes fill with angry tears at the image of the child helpless innocent being shuffled back and forth between people who knew nothing of love she never looked at me like a person you know i was a mistake that was the worst of it he said as if to himself the way she drummed that point home that every breath i took every beat of my heart was only possible because some careless rebellious girl had made a mistake no morgana said appalled she was wrong yeah maybe but things like that stick with you i heard a lot about the sins of the father the evils of the flesh i was lazy intractable and wicked one of her favorite words he sent morgana a grim little smile but that was no more than she expected seeing as how id been conceived she was a horrible woman morgana bit out she didnt deserve you well shed have agreed with you on the second part and she made me understand just how grateful i should be that she put food in my belly and a roof over my head but i wasnt feeling very grateful and i ran away a lot by the time i was twelve i got slipped into the system foster homes his shoulders moved restlessly in a small outward showing of the turmoil within he was pacing back and forth over the grounds his stride lengthening as the memories worked on him some of them were okay the ones that really wanted you others just wanted the check you brought in every month but sometimes you got lucky and ended up in a real home i spent one christmas with this family the hendersons his voice changed took on a hint of wonder they were great treated me just like they treated their own kids you could always smell cookies baking they had the tree the presents under it all that colored paper and ribbon stockings hanging from the mantel it really blew me away to see one with my name on it they gave me a bike he said quietly mr henderson bought it secondhand and took it down to the basement to fix it up he painted it red bugeyed fireengine red and hed polished all the chrome he put a lot of time into making that bike something special he showed me how to hook baseball cards on the spokes he sent her a sheepish look that had morgana tilting her head what well it was a really great bike but i didnt know how to ride id never had a bike here i was nearly twelve years old and that bike might as well have been a harley hog for all i knew morgana came staunchly to his defense thats nothing to be ashamed of nash sent her an arch look obviously youve never been an elevenyearold boy its pretty tough to handle the passage into manhood when you cant handle a twowheeler so i mooned over it made excuses not to ride it i had homework id twisted my ankle it looked like rain thought i was pretty clever but she mrs henderson saw right through me one day she got me up early before anyone else was awake and took me out she taught me held the back of the seat ran along beside me made me laugh when i took a spill and when i managed to wobble down the sidewalk on my own she cried nobodyd ever he let his words trail off embarrassed by the scope of emotion that memory evoked tears burned the back of her throat they must have been wonderful people yeah they were i had six months with them probably the best six months of my life he shook off the memory and went on anyway whenever id get too comfortable my grandmother would yank the chain and pull me back so i started counting the days until i was eighteen when nobody could tell me where to live or how when i got free i was damn well going to stay that way what did you do i wanted to eat so i tried a couple of regular jobs he glanced at her this time with a hint of humor in his eyes i sold insurance for a while for the first time since hed begun she smiled i cant picture it neither could i it didnt last i guess when it comes right down to it ive got the old lady to thank for trying writing as a career she used to whack me good whenever she caught me scribbling excuse me morgana was certain she must have misunderstood she hit you for writing she didnt exactly understand the moral scope of vampire hunters he said dryly so figuring it was the last thing shed want me to do i kept right on doing it i moved to la managed to finesse a lowlevel job with the specialeffects guys then i worked as a script doctor met the right people finally managed to sell shape shifter my grandmother died while that was in production i didnt go to the funeral if you expect me to criticize you for that ill have to disappoint you i dont know what i expect he muttered stopping beneath a cypress he turned to her i was twentysix when the movie hit it was well well risk a bad pun and call it a howling success suddenly i was riding the wave my next script was picked up i got myself nominated for a golden globe then i started getting calls my aunt she just needed a few bills to tide her over her husband had never risen above sergeant and she had three kids she wanted to send to college then leeanne he scrubbed his hands over his face wishing he could scrub away the layers of resentment of hurt of memory she called you morgana prompted nope she popped up on my doorstep one day it would have been ludicrous if it hadnt been so pathetic this stranger painted up like a kewpie doll standing at my front door telling me she was my mother the worst part was that i could see me in her the whole time she was standing there pouring out the sad story of her life i wanted to shut that door in her face bolt it i could hear her telling me that i owed her how having me had screwed up her life how she was divorced for the second time and running on empty so i wrote her out a check tired he slid down the tree and sat on the soft ground beneath the sun was hanging low the shadows stretching long morgana knelt beside him why did you give her money nash it was what she wanted i didnt have anything else for her anyway the first payment lasted her almost a year in between id get calls from my aunt or one of my cousins he tapped a fisted hand on his thigh months will go by and youll think youve got your life pretty well set but they dont let you forget what youve come from if the price for thats a few thousand now and again its not a bad bargain morganas eyes heated they have no right no right to take pieces of you ive got plenty of money im not talking about dollars im talking about you his gaze locked on hers they remind me who what i am they dont even know you she said furiously no and i dont know them but that doesnt mean a hell of a lot you know about legacies morgana about what comes down in the blood your inheritance is magic mines selfinterest she shook her head whatever we inherit we have the choice of using it or discarding it youre nothing like the people you came from he took her by the shoulders then his fingers tense more than you think ive made my choices maybe i stopped running away because it never got me anywhere but i know who i am thats someone who does best alone theres no henderson family in my future morgana because i dont want it now and again i write out a check then i can close that all off so its just me again thats the way i want it no ties no obligations no commitments she wouldnt argue with him not when the pain was so close to the surface another time she could show him how wrong he was the man holding her now was capable of tenderness of generosity of sweetness none of which had been given to him all of which hed found for himself but she could give him something if only for a short time you dont have to tell me who you are nash gently she brushed his hair from his face i know theres nothing you cant give that ill ask for nothing you dont want to give that ill take she lifted her amulet closed his hand over it and hers over his her eyes deepened as they stared into his thats an oath he felt the metal grow warm in his hand baffled he looked down to see it pulsing with light i dont an oath she repeated one i cant break theres something i want you to take that i can give will you trust me something was stealing over him like a shadow cast by a cloud it was cool and soft and weightless his tensed muscles relaxed his eyes grew pleasantly heavy as from a great distance he heard himself speak her name then he glided into sleep when he awakened the sun was warm and bright he could hear birdsong and the babbling music of water running over rock disoriented he sat up he was in a wide rolling meadow of wildflowers and dancing butterflies a few feet away a gentleeyed deer stopped her peaceful walk to study him there was the lazy drone of bees and the whisper of wind through the high green grass with a half laugh he rubbed a hand over his chin half expecting to find a beard like rip van winkles but there was no beard and he didnt feel like an old man he felt incredible standing he looked out over the acres of flowers and waving grass above the sky was a rich blue bowl the deep blue of high spring something stirred in him as gently as the wind stirred the grass after a moment he recognized it serenity he was utterly at peace with himself he heard the music the heartbreaking beauty of harp song the smile was already curving his lips as he followed it wading through the meadow grass and flowers startling butterflies he found her on the banks of the brook sun flashed off the water as it tumbled over smooth jewelcolored rocks the full white skirts of her dress pooled over the grass her face was shaded by a widebrimmed hat tipped flirtatiously over one eye in her lap was a small golden harp her fingers caressed the strings coaxing out music that floated over the air she turned her head smiled at him continued to play what are you doing he asked her waiting for you did you rest well he crouched beside her then lifted a hesitant hand to her shoulder she was real he could feel the warmth of her skin through the silk morgana her eyes laughed up at his nash where are we she stroked the harp again music soared spreading like the wings of a bird in dreams she told him yours and mine after setting the harp aside she took his hands if you want to be here we can stay awhile if you want to be somewhere else we can go there she made it sound so easy so natural why because you need it she brought his hand to her lips because i love you he didnt feel the scrabble of panic her words slid easily into his heart making him smile is it real she rubbed her cheek over his hand then kissed it again it can be if you want it her teeth grazed lightly over his skin sparking desire if you want me he drew the hat from her head tossing it aside as her hair rained down over her shoulders and back am i spellbound morgana no more than i she cupped his face in her hands to bring his lips to hers i want you she murmured against his mouth love me here nash as though it were the first time the last time the only time how could he resist if it was a dream so be it all that mattered was that her arms welcomed him her mouth tempted him she was everything a man could want all silk and honey melting against him her body seemed boneless as he laid her back on the soft green grass there was no time here and he found himself pleased to linger over little things the velvet flow of her hair under his hands the teasing flavors at the corners of her mouth the scent of her skin along her jaw she yielded to him a malleable fantasy of silks and scents and seduction her quiet sigh sweetened the air he couldnt know how easy it had been morgana thought as his mouth drank from hers as different as they were their dreams were the same for this hour or two they could share each other and the peace she had wrapped them in when he lifted his head she smiled at him his eyes darkened as he traced the shape of her face with a fingertip i want it to be real he said it can be whatever you take from here whatever you want for us can be testing he brought his lips to hers again it was real as was the feeling that flooded him when those lips parted for his he sank deep into that long luxurious melding of lips and tongues beneath his her heart beat fast and true when his hand covered it he felt its rhythm leap slowly wanting to spin out the moment he unfastened the tiny pearls that ranged down her bodice beneath she was all warm soft skin in fascination he explored the textures as her breath quickened satin and silk the color of rich cream his eyes flicked back to hers as his fingertips skimmed through the fringe of dark lashes her irises had deepened hazed lightly he brushed his lips over the soft slopes of her breasts honey and rose petals with a murmur of approval he teased her flesh with lazy openmouthed kisses circling in until he could roll his tongue over the aching peaks he nipped knowing by her gasp that he was holding her at that dazzling point between pleasure and pain he drew her in driving them both quietly mad with teeth and tongue her hands were in his hair gripping hard and he felt her body arch go taut then shudder into pliancy when he lifted his head to look at her her eyes were glazed with shock and delight how she shivered again throbbing with the aftermath of that fast unexpected crest magic he said pressing his lips to her heated flesh again let me show you he took her places shed never seen as she gloried in each dizzying journey her hands and lips moved freely over him when she trembled so did he a mixing of sighs a melding of bodies a murmured request a breathless answer fired by need she pulled his shirt away to taste the hot damp flesh of his heaving chest where there was fire there was joy in feeling his blood leap for her his pulse quicken within the small slice of paradise she had conjured they made their own each time his mouth came to hers the spell grew stronger possessive persuasive her hands streaked over him and she rejoiced in the way his muscles bunched and quivered at her touch he wanted needed her to be as desperate as he with his heart pounding in his ears he began a torturous journey down her torso streaking toward the center of her heat his teeth scraped the sensitive skin of her thigh dragging a broken moan from her her hands fisted in the grass as his tongue pleasured and plundered blind with need she cried out as he drove her from peak to shattering peak as her body writhed and arched he steeped himself in her damp flesh slid over damp flesh as he began the return journey when his mouth crushed down on hers he sheathed himself in her and his vision dimmed as he felt her open for him surround him welcome him fighting back the grinding need he moved slowly savoring watching the flickers of pleasure on her face feeling her pulse throb as she rose to meet him the breath sighed out between her lips her eyes fluttered open they stayed on his while her hands slid down his arms with their fingers locked they tumbled past reason together when she felt his body shatter when his muscles went to water he rested his head between her breasts lulled by the beat of her heart he let his eyes close he began to sense the world beyond morgana the warm sun on his back the call of birds the scent of flowers growing wild on the banks of the rushing brook beneath him she sighed and lifted a hand to stroke his hair she had given him peace and she had found pleasure and she had broken one of her firmest rules by manipulating his emotions perhaps it had been a mistake but she wouldnt regret it morgana she smiled at the husky murmur sleep now she told him in the dark he reached for her and found the bed empty groggy he forced his heavy eyes open he was in bed his own bed and the house held the heavy hush of predawn morgana he didnt know why he said her name when he knew she wasnt there dreaming fumbling with the sheets he pushed himself out of bed had he been dreaming if it had been only a dream nothing in the waking world had ever seemed more real more vivid more important to clear his head he walked to the window and breathed deeply of the cool air theyd made love incredible love in a meadow beside a stream no that was impossible leaning on the sill he gulped in air like water the last thing he remembered clearly they had been sitting under the tree in the side yard talking about he jolted back hed told her everything the whole ugly business about his family had come pouring out of him why the hell had he done that dragging a hand through his hair he paced the room that damned phone call he thought but then he recalled abruptly that the phone call had stopped him from making an even bigger mistake it would have been worse if hed told morgana he loved her a lot worse than telling her about his parentage and upbringing at least now she wouldnt get any ideas about where their relationship was headed in any case it was done and it couldnt be taken back hed just have to live with the fact that it embarrassed the hell out of him but after that after they had been sitting in the yard had he fallen asleep the dream or had it been a dream it was so clear in his mind he could almost smell the flowers and he could certainly remember the way her body had flowed like water under his hands more much more he could remember feeling as though everything he had done up to that point in his life had been leading to that moment to the moment when he could lie on the grass with the woman he loved and feel the peace of belonging illusions just illusions he assured himself as panic began to set in hed just fallen asleep under the tree that was all but what the hell was he doing back in his room in the middle of the night alone shed done it giving in to unsteady legs he lowered to the bed all of it then shed left him she wasnt getting away with it he started to rise then dropped down again he could remember the peace the utter serenity of waking with the sun on his face of walking through the grass and seeing her playing the harp and smiling at him and when hed asked her why shed said shed said she loved him because his head was reeling nash clamped it between his hands maybe hed imagined it all of it morgana included maybe he was back in his condo in la and hed just awakened from the granddaddy of all dreams after all he didnt really believe in witches and spells gingerly he lowered one hand and closed it around the stone that hung from a chain around his neck the hell he didnt morgana was real and she loved him the worst part was he loved her right back he didnt want to it was crazy but he was in love with her so wildly in love that he couldnt get through an hour without thinking about her without wishing for her without imagining that maybe just maybe it could work and that was the most irrational thought in the whole irrational business he needed to think it all through step by step giving in to fatigue he lay back to stare at the dark infatuated that was what he was infatuation was a long way from love a long safe way she was after all a captivating woman a man could live a long happy life being infatuated by a captivating woman hed wake up every morning with a smile on his face knowing she belonged to him nash began to weave a pretty fantasy and brought himself up short what the hell was he thinking of her he thought grimly he was always thinking of her maybe the best thing to do would be to take a little vacation a quick trip to anywhere to shake her out of his system if he could the niggling doubt lay in his gut like a stone how did he know even before he began that he wouldnt be able to shake her out because it wasnt infatuation he admitted slowly it wasnt even close to infatuation it was the big fourletter word he wasnt in lust hed taken the big leap he was in love shed made him fall in love with her that thought had him sitting straight up shed made him she was a witch why hadnt it ever occurred to him that she could cast her spells snap her fingers and have him groveling at her feet part of him rejected the notion as absurd but another part the part that had grown out of fear and selfdoubt plucked at the idea the longer he considered it the darker his thoughts became in the morning he told himself he was going to face off with a witch when he was done hed clear the decks and nash kirkland would be exactly where he wanted to be in control chapter contents prev next it felt odd not going in to open the shop monday morning it also felt necessary not just for her weary body but also for her mind a call to mindy eased morganas conscience mindy would pick up the slack and open the shop at noon it didnt bother her too much to take a day off but she would have preferred to steal a day when she felt better now she walked downstairs wrapped in her robe feeling lightheaded and queasy with the restless night weighing heavily on her the die had been cast matters had been taken out of her hands with a weary sigh morgana wandered into the kitchen to brew some tea it had never really been in her hands the awkward thing about power she mused was that you could never let yourself become so used to wielding it that you forgot there were bigger more vital powers than your own pressing a gentle hand to her stomach she walked to the window while the kettle heated she wondered if she sensed a storm in the air or if it was merely her own unsettled thoughts luna curled in and out of her legs for a moment then sensed her mistresss mood and padded off she hadnt chosen to be in love she certainly hadnt chosen to have this avalanche of emotion barrel down on her and sweep her away to have her life changed it was nothing less than that now there was always a choice of course and she had made hers it wouldnt be easy the most important things rarely were heavylimbed she turned to the stove to make the tea it had barely had tune to cool in her cup before she heard the front door open morgana resigned morgana poured two more cups just as her cousins came into the kitchen there anastasia shot sebastian a look as she hurried to morgana i told you she wasnt feeling well morgana kissed her cheek im fine i said you were fine sebastian put in digging a cookie out of the jar on the counter just grumpy you were sending out signals loud enough and cranky enough to drag me out of bed sorry she offered him a cup i guess i didnt want to be alone youre not well ana insisted before she could probe deeper morgana stepped away i had a restless night and im paying for it this morning sebastian sipped his tea hed already taken in the pale cheeks and shadowed eyes and he was getting a flicker of something else something morgana was working hard to block patient and always willing to match his will against hers he settled back trouble in paradise he said just dryly enough to make her eyes flash i can handle my own problems thanks dont tease her sebastian anastasia set a warning hand on his shoulder have you argued with nash morgana no she sat she was too tired not to no she said again but it is nash who worries me i learned a few things about him yesterday about his family because she trusted them as much as she loved them morgana told them everything from the call from leeanne to the moment beneath the cypress what had happened after that because it belonged only to her and to nash she kept to herself poor little boy anastasia murmured how awful to feel unwanted and unloved and unable to love morgana added who could blame him for being afraid to trust his feelings you do her gaze shot up to meet sebastians it was no use cursing him for being so perceptive or so right not really blame it hurts and it saddens but i dont blame him for it im just not sure how to love someone who cant or wont love me back he needs time ana told her i know im trying to figure out how much time i can give him i made a vow not to take more than he wanted to give her voice thickened and she swallowed to clear it i wont break it her defenses slipped quick as a whip sebastian snatched her hand he looked deep and then his fingers went lax on hers my god morgana youre pregnant furious at the intrusion and at her own wavering emotions for permitting it she sprang to her feet but even as she started to spew at him she saw the concern and the worry in his eyes damn it sebastian thats an announcement a woman particularly likes to make for herself sit down he ordered and he would have carried her to a chair himself if anastasia hadnt waved him off how long ana demanded morgana only sighed since the spring equinox ive only been sure for a few days are you well before morgana could answer ana spread a hand over morganas belly let me with her eyes on morganas anastasia searched she felt the warm flesh beneath the robe the throb of pulse the flow of blood and the life not yet formed sleeping her lips curved youre fine she said both of you just a little sluggish this morning morgana laid a hand over hers i dont want you to worry i still say she should sit down or lie down until her colors back sebastian scowled at both of them the idea of his cousin his favorite sparring partner being fragile and with child made him uneasy with a light laugh morgana bent over to kiss him are you going to fuss over me cousin pleased she kissed him again then sat i hope so with the rest of the family in ireland its up to ana and me to take care of you morgana murmured an absent thankyou as ana refilled her cup and what makes you think i need to be taken care of sebastian shrugged the question away im the eldest here he reminded her and as such i want to know what kirklands intentions are ana grinned over her cup lord sebastian how medieval do you intend to run him through for trifling with your cousin i dont find this whole situation quite the hoot you do his eyes darkened when his cousins rolled theirs lets clear it up shall we morgana do you want to be pregnant i am pregnant he pressed a hand on hers until she looked at him again you know very well what i mean of course she did she let out another sigh ive only had a day or two to think of it but i have thought of it carefully i realize that i can undo whats been done without shame i know the idea upsets you ana ana shook her head the choice has to be yours yes it does i took precautions against conception and fate chose to ignore them ive searched my heart and i believe i was meant to have the child this child she said with a faint curve of the lips at this time and with this man however unsettled i feel however afraid i am i cant shake that belief so yes i want to be pregnant satisfied sebastian nodded and nash how does he feel about it he didnt wait for her to speak it only took a heartbeat for him to know his voice thundered to the roof what in the name of finn do you mean you havent told him her glare was sharp enough to cut ten men off at the knees keep out of my head or i swear ill turn you into a slug he merely lifted a brow just answer the question ive only just come to be certain myself tossing back her hair she rose and after yesterday i couldnt simply drop the news on him he has a right to know ana said quietly all right her temper bubbled until she clenched her hands into fists im going to tell him when im ready to tell him do you think i want to bind him this way it shocked her to feel a tear slip down her cheek she brushed it away impatiently thats a choice he has to make for himself sebastian had already decided that if nash chose incorrectly he would take great pleasure in breaking several vital bones the conventional way sebastians right morgana concerned but firm ana rose again to wrap her arms around her cousin its his choice to make as it was yours he cant make it if he doesnt know the choice exists i know to comfort herself morgana laid her head on anas shoulder ill go this morning and tell him sebastian rose to stroke a hand down morganas hair well be close she was able to smile with a trace of her usual verve not too close nash rolled over in bed and muttered into his pillow dreams he was having so many dreams they were flitting in and out of his head like movie scenes morgana always morgana smiling at him beckoning to him promising him the incredible and the wonderful making him feel whole and strong and hopeful his grandmother her eyes bright with anger whacking him with her ubiquitous wooden spoon telling him over and over again that he was worthless riding a bright red bike down a suburban sidewalk the wind in his hair and the sound of flipping flapping baseball cards thrumming in the spokes leeanne standing close too close with her hand out reminding him that they were blood that he owed her owed her owed her morgana laughing that wild wicked laugh her hair billowing back like a cloud while she streaked over the dark waters of the bay on her broomstick himself plunged into a steaming cauldron with his grandmother stirring the stew with that damned spoon and morganas voice his mothers voice cackling like one of the weird sisters from shakespeare double double toil and trouble he sat up with a jolt breathing fast and blinking against the streaming sunlight he lifted shaking hands to his face and rubbed hard great just dandy in addition to everything else he was losing his mind had she done that to him as well he wondered had she insinuated herself into his mind to make him think what she wanted him to think well she wasnt going to get away with it nash stumbled out of bed and tripped over his own shoes swearing he kicked them aside and headed blindly for the shower as soon as hed pulled himself together he and the gorgeous witch of the west were going to have a little chat while nash was holding his head under the shower morgana pulled up in his driveway shed come alone when shed refused to let luna accompany her the cat had stalked off tail twitching in indignation sighing morgana promised herself shed make it up to her maybe shed run by fishermans wharf and pick up a seafood feast to soften the cats heart in the meantime she had her own heart to worry about tilting down the rearview mirror she took a careful study of her face with a sound of disgust she leaned back what had made her think she could cover the signs of strain and worry with simple cosmetics she pressed her lips together and looked toward his house she wasnt going to let him see her like this she wasnt going to go to him with this kind of news when she appeared vulnerable and needy he had enough people pulling his strings she remembered that shed once thought he was a completely carefree man perhaps for long periods of time he was hed certainly made himself believe so if nash was entitled to his front then so was she after taking a long soothing breath morgana crooned a quiet chant the shadows vanished from under her eyes the color crept back into her cheeks as she stepped out of the car all signs of a restless night had been erased if her heart was beating too quickly she would deal with it but she would not let him see that she was miserably in love and terrified there was an easy smile on her face as she rapped on his door a slick sweaty fist was lodged in her gut cursing nash jammed one leg then the other into jeans just a damn minute he mumbled as he yanked them up he stalked down the steps barefoot and bare chested all but growling at the thought of a visitor before coffee what he demanded as he flung open the door then he stopped dead staring she looked as fresh and beautiful as the morning as sultry and sexy as midnight nash wondered how it was that the damp still clinging to his skin didnt turn to steam hi she leaned in to brush his lips with hers did i get you out of the shower just about off balance he slicked his fingers through his dripping hair why arent you at the shop im taking the day off she sauntered in willing herself to keep her voice natural and her muscles relaxed did you sleep well you should know at the mild surprise in her eyes his temper strained what did you do to me morgana do to you i did nothing to you she made the effort to smile again if im not mistaken youre in dire need of coffee why dont i fix some he grabbed her arm before she could turn toward the kitchen ill fix it myself she measured the anger in his eyes and nodded slowly all right would you rather i came back later no well settle this now when he strode down the hallway morgana squeezed her eyes tight settle it she thought with a vivid premonition of disaster why did that phrase sound so much like end it bracing she started to follow him into the kitchen but found her courage fading instead she turned into the living room and sat on the edge of a chair he needed his coffee she told herself and she needed a moment to regroup she hadnt expected to find him so angry so cold the way hed looked when hed spoken to leeanne the day before nor had she had any idea how much it would hurt to have him look at her with that iceedged and somehow aloof fury she rose to wander the room one hand placed protectively over the life beginning in her womb she would protect that life she promised herself at all costs when he came back a steaming cup in his hand she was standing by the window her eyes looked wistful if he hadnt known better he would have said she looked hurt even vulnerable but he did know better surely being a witch was the next thing to being invulnerable your flowers need water she said to him it isnt enough just to plant them again her hand lay quietly over her stomach they need care he gulped down coffee and scalded his tongue the pain helped block the sudden need to go to her and take her into his arms to whisk away the sadness he heard in her voice im not much in the mood to talk about flowers no she turned and the traces of vulnerability were gone i can see that what are you in the mood to talk about nash i want the truth all of it she gave him a small amused smile turning her palms up questioningly where would you like me to begin dont play games with me morgana im tired of it he began to pace the room his muscles taut enough to snap his head came up if she had been fainter of heart the look in his eyes would have had her stumbling back in defense this whole business has been one long lark for you hasnt it right from the beginning from the minute i walked into your shop you decided i was a likely candidate god it hurt he realized it hurt to think of everything hed felt everything hed begun to wish for my attitude toward your talents irritated you so you just had to strut your stuff her heart quivered in her breast but her voice was strong why dont you tell me what you mean if youre saying i showed you what i am i cant deny it i cant be ashamed of it he slapped the mug down so that coffee sloshed over the sides and onto the table the sense of betrayal was so huge it overwhelmed everything damn it he loved her shed made him love her now that he was calling her on it she just stood there looking calm and lovely i want to know what you did to me he said again then i want you to undo it i told you i didnt i want you to look me in the eye on a wave of panic and fury he grabbed her arms look me in the eye morgana and tell me you didnt wave your wand or chant your charm and make me feel this way what way damn you im in love with you i cant get through an hour without wanting you i cant think about a year from now ten years from now without seeing you with me her heart melted nash he jerked back from the hand she lifted to his cheek stunned morgana let it fall back to her side how did you do it he demanded how did you get inside me like this to make me start thinking of marriage and family what was the point to play around with the mortal until you got tired of him im as mortal as you she said steadily i eat and sleep i bleed when im cut i grow old i feel youre not like me he bit off the words morgana felt her charm slipping the color washing out of her cheeks no youre right im different and theres nothing i can do to change it nothing i would do if youre finding that too difficult to accept then let me go youre not going to walk out of here and leave me like this fix it he gave her a brisk shake undo the spell the illusion fell away so that she stared at him with shadowed eyes what spell whatever one you used you got me to tell you things ive never told anyone you stripped me bare morgana didnt you think id figure out that id never have told you about my family my background if id been in my right mind that was mine he released her and turned away to keep from doing something drastic you tricked it out of me just like you tricked all the rest you used my feelings i never used your feelings she began furiously then stopped paling even more when he noted the look his lips thinned really all right i used them yesterday after your mother called after youd told me all those things i wanted to give you some peace of mind so it was a spell though her chin came up he wavered she looked so damn fragile just then like glass that would shatter at his touch i let my emotions rule my judgment if i was wrong as its obvious now i was i apologize oh fine sorry i took you for a ride nash he jammed his hands into his pockets what about the rest she lifted a shaky hand to her hair the rest of what are you going to stand there and tell me you didnt cause all of this manipulate my feelings make me think i was in love with you that i wanted to start a life with you god have children with you because he still wanted it still his anger grew i know damn well it wasnt my idea no way in hell the hurt sliced deep but as it cut it freed something his anger his sense of betrayal and confusion was nothing compared to what bubbled inside her she reined it in with a light hand as she studied him are you saying that i bound you to me with magic that i used my gifts for my own gain charmed you into loving me thats just what im saying morgana released the reins color flooded back into her face had her eyes gleaming like suns power and the strength it brought filled her you brainless ass indignant he started to snap back his words came out like the bray of a donkey eyes wide he tried again while she swooped around the room so you think youre under a spell she muttered her fury making books fly through the room like literary missiles nash ducked and scrambled but he didnt managed to avoid all of them as one rapped the bridge of his nose he swore he felt a moments dizzy relief when he realized he had his own voice back look babe no you look babe on a roll now she had a gust of wind tossing his furniture into a heap do you think id waste my gifts captivating someone like you you conceited arrogant jerk give me one reason i shouldnt turn you into the snake you are eyes narrowed he started toward her im not going to play along with this then watch with a flick of her hand she had him shooting back across the room two feet above the floor to land hard in a chair he thought about getting up but decided it was wiser to get his breath back first to satisfy herself she sent the dishes soaring in the kitchen nash listened to the crashing with a resigned sigh you should know better than to anger a witch she told him the logs in his fireplace began to spit and crackle with flame dont you know what someone like me someone without integrity without scruples might do all right morgana he started to rise she slapped him back in the chair so hard his teeth rattled dont come near me not now not ever again her breath was heaving though she was struggling to even it i swear if you do ill turn you into something that runs on four legs and howls at the moon he let out an uneasy breath he didnt think shed do it not really and it was better to take a stand than to whimper his living room was a shambles hell his life was a shambles they were going to have to deal with it cut it out morgana his voice was admirably calm and firm this isnt proving anything the fury drained out of her leaving her empty and aching and miserable youre quite right it isnt my temper like my feelings sometimes clouds my judgment no she waved a hand before he could rise stay where you are i cant trust myself yet as she turned away the fire guttered out the wind died quietly nash breathed a sigh of relief the storm it appeared was over he was very wrong so you dont want to be in love with me something in her voice had his brows drawing together he wanted her to turn around so that he could see her face but she stood with her back to him looking out the window i dont want to be in love with anyone he said carefully willing himself to believe it nothing personal nothing personal she repeated look morgana im a bad bet i like my life the way it was the way it was before you met me when she said it like that he felt like something slimy that slithered through the grass he checked his hands to make certain he wasnt its not you its me and i damn it im not going to sit here and apologize because i dont like being spellbound he got to his feet gingerly youre a beautiful woman and oh please dont strain yourself with a clever brushoff the words choked out of her as she turned nash felt as though shed stuck a lance in his heart she was crying tears were streaming out of her brimming eyes and flowing down her pale cheeks there was nothing nothing he wanted more at that moment than to take her in his arms and kiss them away morgana dont i never meant to his words were cut off as he rapped into a wall he couldnt see it but shed thrown it up between them and it was as solid as bricks and mortar stop it his voice rose on a combination of panic and selfdisgust as he rammed a hand against the shield that separated them this isnt the answer her heart was bleeding she could feel it itll do until i find the right one she wanted to hate him desperately wanted to hate him for making her humiliate herself as the tears continued to fall she laid both hands on her stomach she had more than herself to protect he spread his own impotent hands against the wall odd he thought he felt as though it was he who had been closed off not her i cant stand to see you cry youll have to for a moment dont worry a witchs tears are like any womans weak and useless she steadied herself blinking them away until she could see clearly you want your freedom nash if he could have hed have clawed and kicked his way through to her damn it cant you see i dont know what i want whatever it is it isnt me or what weve made together i promised i wouldnt take more than you wanted to give me and i never go back on my word he felt a new kind of fear a rippling panic at the thought that what he did want was about to slip through his fingers let me touch you if you thought of me as a woman first i would for herself she laid a hand on the wall opposite his do you think because of what i am that i dont need to be loved as any man loves any woman he shoved and strained against the wall take this damn thing down it was all she had a poor defense we crossed purposes somewhere along the line nash no ones fault i suppose that i came to love you so much morgana please she shook her head studying him drawing his image inside her head her heart where she could keep it maybe because i did i somehow drew you in ive never been in love before so i cant be sure but i swear to you it wasnt intentional it wasnt done to harm furious that the tears were threatening again she backed away for a moment she stood straight proud powerful ill give you this and you can trust what i say whatever hold i have on you is broken as of this instant whatever feelings ive caused in you through my art i cast away youre free of me and of all we made she closed her eyes lifted her hands love conjured is love false i will not take nor will i make such cast away is nothing lost your heart and mind be free of me as i will so mote it be her eyes opened glittered with fresh tears you are more than you think she said quietly less than you could be his heart was thudding in his throat morgana dont go like this she smiled oh i think im entitled to at least a dramatic exit dont you though she was several feet away he would have sworn he felt her lips touch him blessed be nash she said and then she was gone chapter contents prev next he had no doubt he was going out of his mind day after day he prowled the house and the grounds night after night he tossed restlessly in bed shed said he was free of her hadnt she then why wasnt he why hadnt he stopped thinking about her wishing for her why could he still see the way she had looked at him that last time with hurt in her eyes and tears on her cheeks he tried to tell himself shed left him charmed but he knew it was a lie after a week he gave up and drove by her house it was empty he went to the shop and was told by a very cool and unfriendly mindy that morgana was away but she wouldnt tell him where or when she would be back he should have felt relief that was what he told himself doggedly he pushed thoughts of her aside and picked up the life hed led before her but when he walked the beach he imagined what it would be like to stroll there with her a toddler scampering between them that image sent him driving down to la for a few days he wanted to think he felt better there with the rush and the crowds and the noise he took a lunch with his agent at the polo lounge and discussed the casting for his screenplay he went alone to clubs and fed himself on music and laughter and he wondered if hed made a mistake in moving north maybe he belonged in the heart of the city surrounded by strangers and distractions but after three days his heart yearned for home for the rustle of wind and the whoosh of water and for her he went back to the shop interrogating mindy ruthlessly enough to have customers backing off and murmuring she wouldnt budge at his wits end he took to parking in her driveway and brooding at her house it had been nearly a month and he comforted himself with the thought that she had to come back sometime her home was here her business damn it he was here waiting for her as the sun set he braced his elbows on the steering wheel and rested his head in his hands that was just what he was doing he admitted waiting for her and he wasnt waiting to have a rational conversation as hed tried to convince himself he was over the past weeks he was waiting to beg to promise to fight to do whatever it took to put things right again to put morgana back in his life again he closed his hand over the stones he still wore around his neck and wondered if he could will her back it was worth a shot a better idea than putting an ad in the personals he thought grimly shutting his eyes he focused all his concentration on her damn it i know you can hear me if you want to youre not going to shut me out this way youre not just because i was an idiot is no reason to he felt a presence actually felt it he opened his eyes cautiously turned his head and looked up into sebastians amused face what is this sebastian mused amateur night before he could think nash was shoving the car door open where is she he demanded taking sebastians shirt in his fists you know and one way or the other youre going to tell me sebastians eyes darkened dangerously careful friend ive been wanting to go oneonone with you for weeks the notion of a good nasty fight appealed to nash enormously then well just behave anastasia commanded both of you with delicate hands she pushed the men apart im sure youd enjoy giving each other bloody noses and black eyes but im not going to tolerate it nash fisted his frustrated hands at his sides i want to know where she is with a shrug sebastian leaned on the hood of the car your wants dont carry much weight around here he crossed his feet at the ankles when anastasia stepped between them again youre looking a little ragged around the edges nash old boy and it pleased him no end conscience stabbing at you sebastian anas quiet voice held both censure and compassion dont snipe cant you see hes unhappy my heart bleeds ana laid a hand on nashs arm and that hes in love with her sebastians response was a short laugh dont let the hangdog look twist your feelings ana she shot sebastian an impatient glare for heavens sake you only have to look reluctantly he did as his eyes darkened he clamped a hand on nashs shoulder before nash could shrug it angrily away sebastian laughed again by all thats holy he is he shook his head at nash why the devil did you make such a mess of it i dont have to explain myself to you nash muttered absently he rubbed a hand over his shoulder it felt as though it had been sunburned what i have to say ill say to morgana sebastian was softening but he didnt see any reason to make it easy i believe shes under the impression that youve already had your say i dont know that shes in any condition to listen to your outrageous accusations again condition nashs heart froze is she sick he grabbed sebastian by the shirtfront again but the strength had left his hands whats wrong with her a look passed between the cousins so brief so subtle that it went unnoticed shes not ill ana said and tried not to be furious with morgana for not telling nash about the child in fact shes quite well sebastian meant that she was upset by what happened between you the last time nashs fingers loosened when he had his breath back he nodded all right you want me to beg ill beg i have to see her if after ive finished crawling she boots me out of her life ill live with it shes in ireland ana told him with our family her smile curved beautifully do you have a passport morgana was glad shed come the air in ireland was soothing whether it was the balmy breeze that rolled down from the hills or the wild wind that whipped across the channel though she knew it would soon be time to go back and pick up her life again she was grateful for the weeks shed had to heal and for her family stretched out on the window seat in her mothers sitting room she was as much at home and at peace as she could be anywhere in the world she felt the sun on her face that luminous sun that seemed to belong only to ireland if she looked through the diamond panes of glass she could see the cliffs that hacked their way down to the rugged beach and the beach narrow and rough stretching out to the waves by changing the angle she could see the terraced lawn the green green grass scattered with a profusion of flowers that stirred in the wind across the room her mother sat sketching it was a cozy moment one that reminded morgana sweetly of childhood and her mother had changed so little in the years between her hair was as dark and thick as her daughters though she wore it short and sleek around her face her skin was smooth with the beautiful luster of her irish heritage the cobalt eyes were often dreamier than morganas but they saw as clearly when morgana looked at her she was washed by an intense flood of love youre so beautiful mother bryna glanced up smiled i wont argue since it feels so good to hear that from a grown daughter her voice carried the charming lilt of her homeland do you know how wonderful it is to have you here darling for all of us morgana raised a knee and linked her hands around it i know how good its been for me and how grateful i am you havent asked me all the questions i know you want to and so you should be ive all but had to strike your father mute to keep him from badgering you her eyes softened he adores you so i know morgana felt weak tears fill her eyes again and she tried to blink them away im sorry my moods with a shake of her head she rose i dont seem to be able to control them darling bryna held out both hands waiting until morgana had crossed the room to link hers with them you know you can tell me anything anything at all when youre ready mother seeking comfort morgana knelt down to rest her head in brynas lap she gave a watery smile as her hair was stroked ive come to realize recently how very lucky i am to have had you all of you to love me to want me to care about what happens to me i havent told you before how grateful i am for you puzzled bryna cradled her daughter families are meant to love and want and care but all families dont morgana lifted her head her eyes dry now and intense do they the loss is theirs whats hurting you morgana she gripped her mothers hands again ive thought about how it must feel not to be wanted or loved to be taught from childhood that you were a mistake a burden something only to be tolerated through duty can anything be colder than that no nothings colder than living without love her tone gentled are you in love she didnt have to answer hes been hurt so you see he never had what you what all of you gave me what i took for granted and despite it all hes made himself into a wonderful man oh youd like him she rested her cheek on her mothers palm hes funny and sweet his mind is so well fluid so ready to test new ideas but theres a part of him thats closed off he didnt do it it was done to him and no matter what my powers i cant break that lock she sat back on her heels he doesnt want to love me and i cant wont take what he doesnt want to give no brynas heart broke a little as she looked at her daughter youre too strong too proud and too wise for that but people change morgana in time there isnt time ill have his child by christmas all the soothing words bryna had prepared slipped away down her throat all she could think was that her baby was carrying a baby are you well she managed morgana smiled pleased that this should be the first question yes and certain very certain oh love bryna rose to her feet to rock morgana against her my little girl i wont be little much longer they laughed together as they broke apart im happy for you and sad i know i want the child believe me no child has ever been wanted so much not only because its all i might ever have of the father but for itself and you feel odd morgana said strong one moment terrifyingly fragile the next not ill but sometimes lightheaded understanding bryna nodded and you say the father is a good man yes hes a good man then when you told him he was just surprised unprepared she noted the way morgana glanced away morgana even when you were a child you would stare past my shoulder when you were preparing to evade wincing at the tone morgana met her mothers eyes again i didnt tell him dont she pleaded before bryna could launch into a lecture i had intended to but it all fell apart i know it was wrong not to tell him but it was just as wrong to hold him to me by the telling i made a choice the wrong choice morganas chin angled as her mothers had my choice right or wrong i wont ask you to approve but i will ask you to respect and ill also ask you not to tell anyone else just yet including father including father what matthew demanded as he strode into the room the wolf that was pans sire close at his heels girl talk morgana said smoothly and moved over to kiss his cheeks hello handsome he tweaked her nose i know when my women are keeping secrets no peeking morgana said knowing matthew was nearly as skilled at reading thoughts as sebastian now wheres everyone else he wasnt satisfied but he was patient if she didnt tell him soon he would look for himself he was after all her father douglas and maureen are in the kitchen arguing over whos fixing what for lunch camillas rousting padrick at gin matthew grinned wickedly and hes not taking it well accused her of charming the cards bryna managed a smile of her own and did she of course matthew stroked the wolfs silver fur your sisters a born cheat bryna sent him a mild look your brothers a poor loser morgana laughed and linked arms with them both and how the six of you managed to live in this place together and not be struck by lightning is a mystery to me lets go down and make some more trouble there was nothing like a group meal with the donovans to lift her mood and a mood lift was precisely what morgana needed watching with affection the squabbling the interplay between siblings and spouses was better than frontrow seats at a threering circus she was well aware that they didnt always get along just as she was aware that whatever the friction they would merge together like sun and light in the face of a family crisis she didnt intend to be a crisis she only wanted to spend some time being with them they might have been two sets of triplets but there was little physical resemblance between the siblings her father was tall and lean with a shock of steelgray hair and a dignified bearing padrick anastasias father stood no higher than morgana with the husky build of a boxer and the heart of a prankster douglas was nearly sixfour with a receding hairline that swept back dramatically into a widows peak eccentricity was his hobby at the moment he was sporting a magnifying glass around his neck that he peered through when the whim took him hed only removed his deerstalker hat and cape because his wife camilla had refused to eat with him otherwise camilla often thought of as the baby of the brood was pretty and plump as a pigeon and she had a will of iron she matched her husbands eccentricities with her own this morning she was trying out a new hairstyle of blazing orange curls that corkscrewed around her head a long eagle feather dangled from one ear maureen as skilled a medium as morgana had ever known was tall and stately and had an infectious bawdy laugh that could rattle the rafters together with morganas serene mother and dignified father they made a motley crew witches all as she listened to them bicker around her morgana was nearly swamped with love your cats been climbing the curtains in my room again camilla told maureen with a wave of her fork pooh maureen shrugged her sturdy shoulders just hunting mice thats all camillas massive curls jiggled you know very well theres not a mouse in this house douglas cast them out and did a halfbaked job matthew muttered halfbaked camilla huffed in her husbands defense the only thing halfbaked is this pie aye and doug made that as well padrick interjected and grinned but i like my apples crunchy its a new recipe douglas peered owlishly through his magnifying glass healthy the cat camilla insisted knowing very well shed lose control of the conversation cats healthy as a horse padrick said cheerfully isnt that right lamb chop he sent his wife a lusty wink maureen responded with an equally lusty giggle i dont give a tinkers damn about the cats health camilla began oh now now douglas patted her chubby hand we dont want a sick cat around do we reenie will brew him up a nice remedy the cats not sick camilla said in a strangled voice douglas for heavens sake keep up keep up with what he demanded indignant if the cats not sick what in finns name is the problem morgana lass youre not eating your pie she was too busy grinning its wonderful douglas im saving it she sprang up dancing around the table to smack kisses on every cheek i love you all of you morgana bryna called as her daughter spun out of the room where are you going for a walk on the beach for a long long walk on the beach douglas scowled through his glass girls acting odd he pronounced since the meal was nearly over he plucked up his hat and dropped it on his head dont you think nash was feeling odd perhaps it had something to do with the fact that he hadnt slept in two days traveling steadily for approximately twenty hours in planes trains cabs and shuttle buses might have contributed to the dazed dreamlike state he was currently enjoying still hed managed to get from the west coast to the east to catch another plane in new york and snatch a little twilight sleep crossing the atlantic then thered been the train south from dublin and a frantic search for a car he could buy rent or steal to carry him the last jarring miles from waterford to castle donovan he knew it was important to stay on the right side of the road or rather the wrong side he wondered why the devil it should matter when the rutted ditchlined dirt track he was currently bouncing along couldnt remotely be considered a road of any kind and the car which hed managed to procure for the equivalent of twelve hundred american dollars nobody could say the irish werent shrewd bargainers was threatening to break apart on him at every bump hed already lost the poor excuse for a muffler and was making enough noise to wake the sleeping dead it wasnt that the land didnt have style and grace with its towering cliffs and its lush green fields it was that he was afraid hed end up staggering up the final hill with nothing but a steering wheel in his hands those were the knockmealdown mountains to the west he knew because the same slippery horse trader whod sold him the car had been expansive enough to offer directions the mountains to the west st georges channel to the east and youll trip right over the donovans before teatime nash was beginning to believe hed find himself buried in a peat bog before teatime if i live nash mumbled if i find her and i live im going to kill her slowly he said with relish so she knows i mean it then he was going to carry her off to some dark quiet place and make love with her for a week then he was going to sleep for a week wake up and start all over again if he reminded himself he lived the car sputtered and bucked and jolted his bones he wondered how many of his internal organs had been shifted gritting his teeth nash cursed and cajoled and threatened the stuttering car up a rise when his mouth fell open he slammed on the brakes the act managed to slow his descent as he slid down the hill he didnt notice the smell of rubber burning or see the smoke beginning to pour out of the hood his eyes were all for the castle he hadnt really expected a castle despite the name but this was the real mccoy perched high on the cliffs facing the arrogant sea gray stone glittered in the sun with flashing chips of quartz and mica towers lanced into the pearly sky from the topmost a white flag flew nash saw with awe and amazement that it was a pentagram he blinked his eyes but the structure remained as fanciful as something from one of his movies if a mounted knight had burst across the drawbridge by god there was a drawbridge nash wouldnt have turned a hair he started to laugh as delighted as he had been stunned recklessly he punched the gas and when the steering locked drove straight into a ditch calling up every oath he knew nash climbed out of what was left of the car then he kicked it and watched the rusted fender clatter off he squinted against the sun and judged that he was about to add a good threemile hike to his travel arrangements resigned he snagged his duffel bag out of the rear seat and started to walk when he saw the white horse gallop across the bridge he set himself to the task of deciding whether he was hallucinating or whether it was real though the horseman wasnt wearing armor he was striking lean and masculine with a waving silver mane and nash was not surprised to note the hawk clamped to the leather glove of his left arm matthew took one look at the man staggering up the road and shook his head pitiful aye ulysses pitiful wouldnt even make you a decent meal the hawk merely blinked in agreement at first glimpse matthew saw a disheveled unshaven blearyeyed man with a knot forming on his forehead and a line of blood trickling down his temple since hed seen the fool drive into the ditch he felt honorbound to set him right again he pulled up his mount and stared haughtily down at nash lost are you lad no i know just where im going there he lifted a hand and gestured matthew lifted a brow castle donovan dont you know the place is lousy with witches yeah thats just why im going matthew shifted in the saddle to reassess the man he might be disheveled but he wasnt a vagrant his eyes might be bleary with fatigue but there was a steely glint of determination behind them if youll pardon my saying so matthew continued you dont look to be in any shape to battle witches at the moment just one nash said between his teeth just one particular witch hmm did you know youre bleeding where nash lifted a hand gingerly looked at his smeared fingers in disgust figures she probably cursed the car and who might you be speaking of morgana morgana donovan nash wiped his fingers on his grimy jeans ive come a long way to get my hands on her mind your step matthew said mildly its my daughter youre speaking of tired aching and at the end of his tether nash stared back into the slategray eyes maybe hed find himself turned into a squashed beetle but he was taking his stand my names kirkland mr donovan ive come for your daughter and thats that is it amused matthew tilted his head well then climb up and well go see about that he sent the hawk soaring then offered his gloved hand its pleased i am to meet you kirkland yeah nash winced as he hauled himself onto the horse likewise the journey took less time on horseback than it would have on foot particularly since matthew shot off at a gallop the moment they were across the drawbridge and into the courtyard a tall darkhaired woman rushed out of a doorway grinding his teeth nash jumped down and started toward her youve got a lot to answer for babe you cut your hair what the hell do you he skidded to a halt as the woman stood her ground watching him with bemused eyes i thought you were im sorry im flattered bryna countered with a laugh she looked toward her husband matthew what have you brought me a young man who drove into a ditch and seems to want morgana brynas eyes sharpened as she took another step toward nash and do you want my daughter i yes maam a smile flirted around her lips and did she make you unhappy yes no he let out a heavy sigh i did that all by myself please is she here come inside bryna gently took his arm ill fix your head then send you to her if you could just he broke off when he saw a huge eye peering at him from the doorway douglas dropped his magnifying glass and stepped out of the shadows who the devil is this a friend of morganas bryna told him nudging nash inside ah the girls acting odd douglas said giving nash a hearty clap on the back let me tell you morgana let the brisk chill wind slap her face and sneak through the heavy knit of her sweater it was so cleansing so healing in a few more days she would be ready to go back and face reality again with a small helpless sound she sat on a rock here alone she could admit it had to admit it she would never be healed she would never be whole she would go on and make a good life for herself and the child because she was strong because she was proud but something would always be missing but she was through with tears through with selfpity ireland had done that for her shed needed to come here to walk this beach and remember that nothing no matter how painful lasts forever except love rising she started back watching the water spray on rocks she would brew some tea perhaps read camillas tarot cards or listen to one of padricks long involved stories then she would tell them as she should have told them all along about the baby and being her family they would stand behind her how sorry she was that nash would never experience that kind of union she sensed him before she saw him but she thought her mind was playing tricks on her teasing her because she was pretending to be so fearless very slowly her pulse hammering in a hundred places she turned he was coming down the beach in long hurried strides the spray had showered his hair and droplets of water were gleaming on it his face was shadowed with a twoday beard and there was a neat white bandage at his temple and a look in his eyes that had her heart screaming into her throat in defense she took a step back the action stopped him cold she looked the way she looked at him oh her eyes were dry there were no tears to tear up his gut but there was a glint in them as if as if she was afraid of him how much easier it would have been if shed leapt at him clawing and scratching and cursing morgana giddy she pressed a hand over the secret she held inside what happened to you youre hurt its he touched his fingers to the bandage nothing really i had a car fall apart on me your mother put something on it on my head i mean my mother her gaze flickered over his shoulder toward the towers of the castle youve seen my mother and the rest of them he managed a quick smile theyre something actually i ditched the car a couple of miles from the castle literally thats how i met your father he knew he was babbling but he couldnt stop then they were taking me in the kitchen and pouring tea into me and hell morgana i didnt know where you were i should have you told me you came to ireland to walk the beach i should have known i should have known a lot of things she braced a hand on the rock for balance she was deathly afraid she was about to have a new experience and faint at his feet youve come a long way she said dully i would have been here sooner but hey he jumped forward as she swayed the shock came first that she felt so frighteningly fragile in his arms but her arms were strong enough as she pushed at him dont ignoring her nash pulled her close and buried his face in her hair he drew in her scent like breath god morgana just give me a minute let me hold you she shook her head but her arms her treacherous arms were already wrapping hard around him her moan was not of protest but of need when his mouth rushed to hers and took he sank into her like a parched man into a clear cool lake dont say anything he murmured as he rained kisses over her face dont say anything until ive told you what i have to tell you remembering what he had told her before she struggled against him i cant go through this again nash i wont no he caught her hands by the wrists his eyes burning into hers no walls this time morgana on either side your word she opened her mouth to refuse but there was something in his eyes she was powerless against you have it she said briefly i want to sit down okay he let her go thinking it might be best if he wasnt touching her while he was struggling to fight his way clear of the morass hed made of things when she sat on the rock folded her hands in her lap and lifted her chin he remembered hed given serious thought to murdering her no matter how bad things were you shouldnt have run away her eyes widened and gleamed i yes you he shot back maybe i was an idiot but thats no reason for making me suffer the way you did when you werent there when i came to my senses so its my fault that ive been going out of my mind for the last month yeah it is he blew out a breath between his teeth everything else all the rest of its on my head he took a chance and touched a hand to her cheek im sorry she had to look away or weep i cant accept your apology until i know what its for i knew youd make me crawl he said in disgust fine then im sorry for all the stupid things i said her lips curved a little all of them out of patience now he hauled her back to her feet look at me damn it i want you to look at me when i tell you i love you that i know it has nothing to do with charms or spells that it never did that all it has to do with is you and me when she closed her eyes he felt panic skitter up his spine dont shut me out morgana i know thats what i did to you i know it was stupid i was scared hell i was terrified please he cupped her face in his hands open your eyes and look at me when she did he let out a shudder of relief he could see it wasnt too late this is a first for me he said carefully first i have to ask you to forgive me for the things i said i can tell you that i didnt mean them that i was just using them to push you way but thats not the point i did say them i understand being afraid she touched her hand to his wrist if its forgiveness you want you have it theres no need to hold it back from you just like that he pressed his lips to her brow her cheeks you dont want to maybe turn me into a flounder for three or four years not for a first offense she drew back praying they could find some light and friendly plane to walk on for a little while youve had a long trip and youre tired why dont we go back in the winds picking up and its nearly teatime morgana he held her still i said i loved you ive never said that to anyone before not to anyone in my life before you it was hard the first time but i think it might get easier as we go she looked away again her mother would have recognized it as evasion nash saw it as dismissal you said you loved me his voice tightened and so did his grip yes i did she met his eyes again and i do he gathered her close again to rest his brow on hers it feels good he said in a wondering voice i didnt know how damn good it would feel to love someone to have her love me back we can go from here morgana i know im not a prize and ill probably mess up im not used to having someone there for me or for being there for someone else but ill give it all ive got thats a promise she went very still what are you saying he stepped back nervous all over again and stuck his hands in his pockets im asking you to marry me sort of sort of he swore look i want you to marry me im not doing a good job of asking if you want to wait until ive set the stage gotten down on one knee with a ring in my pocket okay its just i love you so much and i didnt know i could feel this way be this way i want a chance to show you i dont need a stage nash and i wish it could be simple his fingers clenched you dont want to marry me i want a life with you oh yes i want that very much but it isnt only myself youd be taking for a moment he was baffled then his face cleared with a smile you mean your family and the ah donovan legacy babe youre everything i want and more the fact that the woman i love is a witch just adds some interest to the situation touched she lifted a hand to his cheek nash youre perfect absolutely perfect for me but its not only that youd be taking on her eyes stayed level on his im carrying your child his face went utterly blank what she didnt need to repeat it she watched as he staggered back and dropped onto the rock where she had sat earlier he gulped in air before he managed to speak again a baby youre pregnant youre having a child outwardly calm she nodded that about sums it up she gave him a moment to speak when he didnt she forced herself to go on you were very clear about not wanting a family so i realize this changes things and you knew he had to swallow to make his voice rise above the sound of wind and sea that day the last day you knew youd come to tell me yes i knew id come to tell you on unsteady legs he got up to walk to the verge of the water he remembered the way shed looked the things hed said hed remember for a long time was it any wonder shed left him that way keeping the secret inside her you think i dont want the baby morgana moistened her lips i understand youd have doubts this wasnt planned by either of us she stopped appalled i didnt plan it eyes fierce he whipped back to her i dont often make the same mistake twice and certainly not with you when she folded her hands over her belly before christmas the child was conceived that first night on the spring equinox christmas he repeated and thought of a red bike of cookies baking of laughter and a family that had nearly been his a family that could be his she was offering something hed never had something hed wished for only in secret you said i was free he said carefully free of you and everything wed made together you meant the baby her eyes darkened and her voice was strong and beautiful this child is loved is wanted this child is not a mistake but a gift i would rather it be mine alone than to risk that for one instant of its life it would not feel cherished he wasnt sure he could speak at all but when he did the words came straight from the heart i want the baby and you and everything we made together through a mist of tears she studied him then you have only to ask he walked back to her laid his hand over where hers rested give me a chance was all he said her lips curved when his moved to meet them weve been waiting for you a long time im going to be a father he said it slowly testingly then let out a whoop and scooped her off her feet we made a baby she threw her arms around his neck and laughed yes were a family yes he kissed her long and hard before he began to walk if we do a good job with the first we can have more right absolutely where are we going im taking you back and putting you to bed with me sounds like a delightful idea but you dont have to carry me every bloody step youre having a baby my baby i can see it interior scene day a sunny room with pale blue walls yellow okay with bright yellow walls under the window stands a gleaming antique crib with one of those funny mobiles hanging over it theres a sound of gurgling and a tiny pudgy hand lifts up to grab at one of the circling he stopped his face whipping around to morganas oh boy what what is it it just hit me what are the chances i mean how likely is it that the baby will you know inherit your talent smiling she curled a lock of his hair around her finger you mean what are the chances of the baby being a witch very high the donovan genes are very strong chuckling she nuzzled his neck but i bet she has your eyes yeah he took another step and found himself grinning i bet she does captivated prologue contents prev next he understood his power early what coursed through his blood and made him what he was did not have to be explained to him nor did he have to be told that this gift was one not possessed by everyone he could see the visions were not always pleasant but they were always fascinating when they came even when they came to a small child whose legs were still unsteady he accepted them as easily as he accepted the suns rising each morning often his mother would crouch on the floor with him her face close to his her eyes searching his eyes mixed with her great love was a hope that he would always accept the gift and that he would never be hurt by it though she knew better on both counts who are you he could hear her thoughts as clearly as if she had spoken aloud who will you be they were questions he couldnt answer even then he understood that it was more difficult to see into yourself than to see into others as time passed the gift did not prevent him from racing and running and teasing his young cousins though often quite often he strained against its limitations and tried for more it did not keep him from enjoying an icecream cone on a summer afternoon or from laughing at cartoons on a saturday morning he was a normal active mischievous boy with a sharp sometimes devious mind a strikingly handsome face set off by hypnotic grayblue eyes and a full mouth that was quick to smile he went through all the stages that lead a boy toward manhood the scraped knees and the broken bones the rebellions large and small the first jumpy heartbeat at the smile of a pretty girl like all children he grew into an adult moved away from his parents domain and chose his own and the power grew as he did he considered his life a welladjusted and comfortable one and he accepted as he always had the simple fact that he was a witch chapter contents prev next she dreamed of a man who was dreaming of her but he wasnt sleeping she could see with a perfect clarity that was extremely undreamlike that he was standing by a wide dark window with his arms relaxed by his sides but his face was very tense very purposeful and his eyes they were so deep so unrelenting gray she thought as she twisted in sleep but not quite gray there were hints of blue as well the color of them reminded her of rocks hacked out of a high cliff one moment and of the soft calm waters of a lake the next strange how strange she knew that his face was taut and tensed but she couldnt see it just those eyes those fascinating disturbing eyes and she knew he was thinking of her not just thinking of her but somehow seeing her as if she had walked up to the other side of that glass stood there looking back at him through the wide windowpane somehow she was certain that if she lifted a hand to that glass her fingers would pass right through it until they found his if she chose to instead she thrashed tangling the sheets and muttering in her sleep even in dreams mel sutherland didnt care for the illogical life had rules very basic rules she firmly believed you were better off following them so she didnt reach for the glass or for him she rolled almost violently knocking a pillow to the floor and willing the dream away it faded and both relieved and disappointed she dropped deeper into a dreamless sleep a few hours later with the night vision tucked away in her subconscious she snapped awake at the clattering bell of the mickey mouse alarm clock at her bedside one expert slap silenced it there was no danger that she would snuggle down in the bed and slide back into sleep mels mind was as regulated as her body she sat up indulging in one huge yawn as she dragged her fingers through her tousled cap of dark blond hair her eyes a rich mossy green shed inherited from a father she couldnt remember were blurry for only a moment then they focused on the twisted sheets rough night she thought kicking her legs free of them and why not it could hardly have been expected that shed sleep like a baby not with what she had to do today after blowing out one long breath she plucked a pair of gym shorts from the floor and yanked them on under the tshirt shed slept in five minutes later she was stepping out into the softaired morning for her daily threemile jog as she went out she kissed the tips of her fingers and tapped them against the front door because it was her place hers and even after four years she didnt take it for granted it wasnt much she thought as she limbered up with a few stretches just a little stucco building tucked between a laundromat and a struggling accounting firm but then she didnt need much mel ignored the whistle from the car that passed its driver grinning appreciatively at her long leanly muscled legs she didnt jog for her looks she jogged because routine exercise disciplined the mind and the body a private investigator who allowed either to become sluggish would find herself in trouble or unemployed mel didnt intend to be either she started out at an easy pace enjoying the way her shoes slapped the sidewalk delighted by the pearly glow in the eastern sky that signaled the start of a beautiful day it was august and she thought of how miserably hot it would be down in la but here in monterey there was perpetual spring no matter what the calendar said the air was as fresh as a rosebud it was too early for there to be much traffic here in the downtown area it would be a rare thing for her to pass another jogger if shed chosen any of the beaches it would have been a different matter but mel preferred to run alone her muscles began to warm a thin layer of sweat gleamed healthily on her skin she increased her pace slightly falling into a familiar rhythm that had become as automatic as breathing for the first mile she kept her mind empty letting herself observe a car with a faulty muffler rattled by with no more than a token hesitation at a stop sign an plymouth sedan dark blue the mental list was just to keep in practice dented drivers door california license able charlie robert someone was lying facedown on the grass of the park even as mel broke her stride he sat up stretched and switched on a portable radio college student hitchhiking crosscountry she decided picking up her pace again even as she made a note of his backpack blue with an american flag on the flap and his hair color brown and name that tune she thought as the music began to fade behind her bruce springsteen cover me not too shabby mel thought with a grin as she rounded a corner she could smell bread from the bakery a fine yeasty goodmorning scent and roses she drew them in though she would have suffered torture before admitting she had a weakness for flowers trees moved gently in the early breeze and if she concentrated really concentrated she could just scent the sea and it was good so very good to feel strong and aware and alone it was good to know these streets and to know she belonged here that she could stay here that there would be no midnight rambles in a battered station wagon at her mothers whim time to go mary ellen time to head out ive just got a feeling we should head north for a while and so they would go she and the mother she adored the mother who would always be more of a child than the daughter who huddled on the ripped and taped front seat beside her the headlights would cut down the road leading the way to a new place a new school new people but they would never settle never have time to become a part of anything but the road soon her mother would get what she always called those itchy feet and off they would go again why had it always felt as if they were running away not running to that of course was all over alice sutherland had herself a cozy travel trailer which would take mel another twentysix months to pay off and she was happy as a clam bopping from state to state and adventure to adventure as for mel she was sticking true la hadnt worked out but shed gotten a taste of what it was like to put down roots and shed had two very frustrating and very educational years on the lapd two years that had taught her that law enforcement was just her cup of tea even if writing parking tickets and filling out forms was not so she had moved north and opened sutherland investigations she still filled out forms often by the truckload but they were her forms shed reached the halfway point of her run and was circling back as always she felt that quick rush of satisfaction at the knowledge that her body responded so automatically it hadnt always been so not when she was a child too tall too gangly with elbows and knees that just begged to be banged and scraped it had taken time and discipline but she was twentyeight now and shed gotten her body under control yes sir it had never been a disappointment to mel that she hadnt bloomed and rounded slim and sleek was more efficient and the long coltish legs that had once invited names like stretch and beanpole were now strong athletic and she could admit privately worth a second look it was then that she heard the baby crying it was a fussy impatient sound that bounded through an open window of the apartment building beside her her mood buoyed by the run plummeted the baby roses baby sweet pudgycheeked david mel continued to run the habit was too ingrained to be broken but her mind filled with images rose harmless slightly dippy rose with her fuzzy red hair and her easy smile even with mels natural reserve it had been impossible to refuse her friendship rose worked as a waitress in the little italian restaurant two blocks from mels office it had been easy to fall into a casual conversation particularly since rose did most of the talking over a plate of spaghetti or a cup of cappuccino mel remembered admiring the way rose hustled trays even though her pregnant belly strained against her apron and she remembered rose telling her how happy she and her stan were to be expecting their first child mel had even been invited to the baby shower and though shed been certain she would feel awkward and out of place at such a gathering shed enjoyed listening to the oohs and aahs over the tiny clothes and the stuffed animals shed taken a liking to stan too with his shy eyes and slow smiles when david had been born eight months ago shed gone to the hospital to visit as shed stared at the babies sleeping bawling or wriggling in their clearsided cribs shed understood why people prayed and struggled and sacrificed to have children they were so perfect so perfectly lovely when shed left she was happy for rose and stan and lonelier than shed ever been in her life it had become a habit for her to drop by their apartment from time to time with a little toy for david as an excuse of course an excuse to play with him for an hour shed fallen more than a little in love with him so she hadnt felt foolish exclaiming over his first tooth or being astounded when he learned to crawl then that frantic phone call two months before roses voice shrill and nearly incoherent hes gone hes gone hes gone mel had made the mile from her office to the merrick home in record time the police had already been there stan and rose had been clutched together on the sofa like two lost souls in a choppy sea both of them crying david was gone snatched off his playpen mat as he napped in the shade on the little patch of grass just outside the rear door of their firstfloor apartment now two months had passed and the playpen was still empty everything mel had learned everything shed been trained to do and her instincts had taught her hadnt helped get david back now rose wanted to try something else something so absurd that mel would have laughed if not for the hard glint of determination in roses usually soft eyes rose didnt care what stan said what the police said what mel said she would try anything anything to get her child back even if that meant going to a psychic as they swept down the coast to big sur in mels cranky primercoated mg she took one last shot at talking sense to rose rose theres no use trying to talk me out of this though roses voice was low there was steel in it that had only surfaced over the last two months stans already tried thats because we both care about you neither one of us want to see you hurt by another dead end she was only twentythree but rose felt as old as the sea that spread out beneath them as old as the sea and as hard as the rocks jutting out from cliffs beside them hurt nothing can come close to hurting me now i know you care mel and i know its asking a lot for you to go with me today its not it is roses eyes always so bright and cheery before were shadowed with a grief and a fear that never ended i know you think its nonsense and maybe its even insulting since youre doing all you can do to find david but i have to try i have to try just anything mel kept her silence for a moment because it shamed her to realize that she was insulted she was trained she was a professional and here they were cruising down the coast to see some witch doctor but she wasnt the one who had lost a child she wasnt the one who had to face that empty crib day after day were going to find david rose mel took her hand off the rattling gearshift long enough to squeeze roses chilled fingers i swear it instead of answering rose merely nodded and turned her head to stare out over the dizzying cliffs if they didnt find her baby and find him soon it would be all too easy just to step out over one of those cliffs and let go of the world he knew they were coming it had nothing to do with power hed taken the phone call from the shakyvoiced pleading woman himself and he was still cursing himself for it wasnt that why he had an unlisted number wasnt that why he had one of those handy machines to answer his calls whenever anyone dug deep enough to unearth that unlisted number but hed answered that call because hed felt he had to known he had to so he knew they were coming and hed braced himself to refuse whatever they would ask of him damn it he was tired hed barely gotten back to his home to his life after three grueling weeks in chicago helping the police track down what the press had so cleverly dubbed the south side slicer and hed seen things things he hoped hed never see again sebastian moved to the window the wide window that looked out over a rolling expanse of lawn a colorful rockery and then a dizzying spill of cliffs dropping down to the deep sea he liked the drama of the view that dangerous drop the churning water even the ribbon of road that sliced through the stone to prove mans wiliness his determination to move on most of all he liked the distance the distance that provided him relief from those who would intrude not only on his space but also on his thoughts but someone had bridged that distance had already intruded and he was still wondering what it meant hed had a dream the night before a dream that hed been standing here just here but there had been a woman on the other side of the glass a woman he wanted very badly but hed been so tired so used up that he hadnt gathered up the force to focus his concentration and shed faded away which at the moment was just fine with him all he really wanted was sleep a few lazy days to tend his horses toy with his business interfere in the lives of his cousins he missed his family it had been too long this time since hed been to ireland to see his parents his aunts and uncles his cousins were closer only a few miles down that winding cliff road but it felt like years rather than weeks since hed seen them morgana was getting so round with the child she carried no children he grinned to himself wondering if she knew there were twins anastasia would know his gentler cousin knew all there was to know about healing and folk medicines but ana would say nothing unless morgana asked her directly he wanted to see them now he even had a hankering to spend some time with his brotherinlaw though he knew nash was hipdeep in his new screenplay sebastian wanted to hop on his bike rev it up and whoosh up to monterey and surround himself with family and the familiar he wanted at all costs to avoid the two women who were even now heading up the hill toward him coming to him with needs and pleas and hopelessness but he wouldnt he wasnt an unselfish man and he never claimed he was he did however understand the responsibilities that went hand in hand with his gift you couldnt say yes to everyone if you did youd go quietly mad there were times when you said yes then found your way blocked that was destiny there were times when you wanted to say no wanted desperately to say no for reasons you might not understand and there were times when what you wanted meant nothing compared to what you were meant to do that too was destiny he was afraid uncomfortably afraid that this was one of those times when his desires meant nothing he heard the car straining its way up his hill before he saw it and nearly smiled sebastian had built high and built solitary and the narrow rutted lane leading up to his home was not welcoming even a seer was entitled to some privacy he spotted the car a smudge of dull gray and sighed they were here the quicker he turned them back the better he started out of the bedroom and down the steps a tall man nearly sixfive in his booted feet lean of hip and wide of shoulder his black hair swept dramatically back from his forehead and fell over the collar of his denim shirt curling a bit there his face was set in what he hoped were polite but inaccessible lines the strong prominent bones gifted to him by his celtic ancestors jutted against skin made dusky by his love of the sun as he walked down he trailed a hand along the silky wood of the banister he had a love for texture as well the smooth and the rough the amethyst he wore on one hand winked richly by the time the car had chugged its way to the top of the drive and mel had gotten over her first astonishment at the sight of the eccentric and somehow fluid structure of wood and glass he called home sebastian was standing on the porch it was as if a child had tossed down a handful of blocks and they had landed by chance in a fascinating pattern of ledges that had then fused together that was what she thought as she stepped out of the car and was assaulted by the scents of flowers horses and the trailing wind from the sea sebastians gaze flicked over mel and lingered a moment as his eyes narrowed with the faintest of frowns he looked away and focused on rose mrs merrick yes mr donovan rose felt a bubble rise to her throat that threatened to boil into a sob its so kind of you to see me i dont know if its kind or not he hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans as he studied them rose merrick wore a plain painfully neat blue dress that hung a bit on her hips as if shed recently lost weight shed taken some care with her makeup but judging by the way her eyes were shining it wouldnt last long he struggled against sympathy the other woman hadnt bothered overmuch with appearances which made her all the more intriguing like sebastian she was wearing jeans and boots both well used the tshirt shed tucked into the waistband of her jeans had probably been a bright red at one time but was now faded with many washings she wore no jewelry no cosmetics what she did wear and sebastian saw it as clearly as he did the color of her hair and eyes was attitude bad attitude youre a tough one arent you he scanned for her name and was thudded by a whirl of feeling a kind of mental static that told him this one was in as much emotional turmoil as rose merrick terrific rose was already moving forward sebastian was trying to stand aside to remain dispassionate but he knew he was losing she was fighting those tears the ones he could feel burning out of her heart there was nothing on earth that weakened a man like a courageous woman mr donovan i wont take up much of your time i just need even as her words trailed off mel was by her side the look she shot at sebastian was anything but friendly are you going to let us come in and sit down or are we just going to now she was the one whose words trailed off it wasnt threatening tears that robbed her of her voice it was utter shock his eyes it was all she could think for an instant and indeed she thought it so clearly so violently that sebastian heard the words echo in his own mind ridiculous she told herself regaining control it was a dream that was all some silly dream she was mixing up with reality it was just that he had the most beautiful eyes the most uncomfortably beautiful eyes he studied her for a moment more and though curious he didnt look beyond her face she was even in the harsh sunlight quite attractive perhaps it was the defiance he saw so clearly in her steady green eyes or the lift of her chin with its faint and oddly sexy cleft attractive yes he decided even if she did wear her hair inches shorter than his own even if it did look as though she hacked at it herself with a pair of kitchen shears he turned away from her and offered rose a smile please come in he said and gave her his hand he left mel to follow she did and he might have been amused to see the way she swaggered up those steps and into the highceilinged great room with its skylights and open balcony she frowned a bit wishing she didnt find it so appealing those warm honeytoned walls that made the light so soft and sexy there was a low wide couch long as a river done in a lustrous royal blue he led rose to it over a lakesized rug of bleeding pastels while mel checked out his living quarters it was neat as a pin without appearing viciously organized modern sculptures of marble wood and bronze were interspersed with what were surely valuable antiques everything was large scale with the result that despite its size the room was cozy here and there set with apparent casualness on those polished antiques were clusters of crystals some large enough to strain a mans back lifting them others tiny enough to fit in a childs palm mel found herself charmed by them the way they winked and gleamed shaped like ancient cities slender wands smooth globes or rough mountains she found sebastian watching her with a kind of patient amusement and she shrugged some digs his lips curved joining the humor in his eyes thanks have a seat the couch might be as long as a river but she chose a chair across the island of an ornately carved coffee table his eyes stayed on mel another moment and then he turned to rose can i get you some coffee mrs merrick something cold no no please dont bother the kindness was worse somehow undermining her desperate control i know this is an imposition mr donovan ive read about you and my neighbor mrs ott she said how you were so helpful to the police last year when that boy went missing the runaway joe cougar sebastian sat beside her yes he thought hed give san francisco a try and drive his parents crazy i suppose youth enjoys risks but he was fifteen roses voice broke and pressing her lips together she shored it up again i i dont mean his parents wouldnt have been frightened but he was fifteen my davids only a baby he was in his playpen she sent sebastian a look of desperate pleading i only left him for a minute when the phone rang and he was right by the door sleeping it wasnt as if he was out on the street or left in a car he was right by the open door and i was only gone a minute rose though her personal preference was to keep her distance from sebastian mel got up to sit beside her friend its not your fault everyone understands that i left him rose said flatly i left my baby and now hes gone mrs merrick rose were you a bad mother sebastian asked the question casually and saw the horror bloom in roses eyes and the fury light in mels no no i love david i only wanted to do my best for him i only then dont do this he took her hand and his touch was so gentle so comforting that the threatening tears retreated a little youre not to blame for this trying to make it so you are wont help find david mels fury fizzled out like a wet firecracker hed said exactly the right thing in exactly the right way will you help me rose murmured the police are trying and mel mels doing everything she can but davids still gone mel he mused an interesting name for a long slim blond with a chip on her shoulder were going to get david back agitated mel sprang up again we have leads they may be slim but we sebastian interrupted he got a quick image here then gone of her with a gun gripped in both hands her eyes as cold as frozen emeralds are you with the police miss sutherland private she snapped the words at him arent you supposed to know things like that mel rose said with quiet warning thats all right he patted roses hand i can look or i can ask with relative strangers its more polite to ask than to intrude dont you think right with what was certainly a snort mel dropped into a chair again your friends a cynic sebastian commented cynicism can be very valuable as well as very rude he started to steel himself to tell rose he couldnt help he simply couldnt open himself to the trauma and risk of looking for another lost little boy mel changed everything just he supposed as she was meant to i dont consider it cynicism to recognize a charlatan masquerading as a samaritan her eyes were hot when she leaned forward this psychic business is as phony as a tendollar magician in a shiny suit pulling rabbits out of his hat his brow quirked it was the only sign of interest or irritation is that so a seams a scam mr donovan a young childs future is at stake and i wont have you playing your mumbojumbo games to get your name in the papers im sorry rose she stood almost vibrating with anger i care about you and i care about david i just cant stand by and watch this guy hose you hes my baby the tears rose had been battling spilled over i have to know where he is i have to know if hes all right if hes scared or happy he doesnt even have his teddy bear rose buried her face in her hands he doesnt even have his teddy bear mel cursed herself cursed her temper cursed sebastian donovan cursed the world in general but when she knelt beside rose both her hands and voice were gentle im sorry honey im sorry i know how scared you are im scared too if you want mr donovan to she almost choked on the word to help then hell help she raised her furious defiant face to sebastians wont you yes he nodded slowly feeling fate take his hands i will he managed to persuade rose to drink some water and dry her eyes while mel stared grimly out the window rose took a small yellow teddy bear out of her bag this is davids his favorite and this she fumbled with a wallet sized snapshot this is his picture i thought mrs ott said you might need something it helps he took the toy and felt a vicious pull in his gut that he recognized as roses grief he would have to go through and beyond that but he didnt look at the photograph not yet leave it with me ill be in touch he helped her to her feet you have my word ill do what i can i dont know how to thank you for trying just knowing you are well it gives me something else to hope for we stan and me weve got some money saved well talk about it later rose wait in the car for me mel said it quietly but sebastian could see that she was feeling anything but quiet ill pass on what information i have to mr donovan it may help him all right a smile ghosted around roses mouth thank you mel waited until rose was out of earshot then turned and fired how much do you think you can squeeze out of her for this kind of a con shes a waitress her husbands a mechanic he leaned lazily against the doorjamb ms sutherland does it appear i need money she made another derisive sound no youve got just buckets dont you its all just a game for you he curled his fingers around her arm with a steely strength that caught her off guard its not a game his voice was so low so filled with suppressed violence that she blinked what i have what i am is no game and stealing children from their playpens is no game either i wont see her hurt again we can agree on that if youre so against this why did you bring her because shes my friend because she asked me to he accepted that with a slight nod loyalty was something else he could feel pumping out of her and my private number you dug that up as well her lip curled in something close to a sneer thats my job and are you good at it damn right fine im also good at mine and were going to be working together what makes you think because you care and if theres a chance oh even the slimmest chance that im what i claim to be you wont want to risk ignoring it she could feel the heat from his fingers it seemed to sizzle right through the skin to her bones it occurred to her that she was afraid not physically it was deeper than that she was afraid because shed never felt this kind of power before i work alone so do i he said calmly as a rule were going to break the rules he reached in quick as a snake he wanted one thing one small thing to rub her nose in finding it he smiled ill be in touch very soon mary ellen he had the pleasure of seeing her mouth fall open of seeing her eyes narrow as she thought back struggling to remember if rose had used her full name but she couldnt remember couldnt be sure shaken she jerked away dont waste my time donovan and dont call me that with a toss of her head she strode to the car she might not be psychic but she knew he was grinning chapter contents prev next sebastian didnt go back inside not even after he had watched the little gray car trail down the ribbon of highway he stood on the porch both amused and faintly irritated by the sizzles of anger and frustration mel had left behind to spark in the air strongwilled he mused and just brimming with energy a woman like that would exhaust a peaceful man sebastian considered himself a peaceful man not that he wouldnt mind poking at her a bit the way a young boy pokes at glowing embers to see how often he can get a flame to shoot up it was often worth the risk of a few minor burns to make fire at the moment however he was just too tired to enjoy it he was already angry with himself for having agreed to become involved it was the combination of the two women that had done it to him he thought now the one with her face so full of fears and desperate hope the other so vivid with fury and sneering disbelief he could have handled one or the other he thought as he descended the steps but being caught in the middle of all that conflicting emotion the sheer depth of it had defeated him so he would look though he had promised himself a long quiet break before taking on another case he would look and he would pray to whatever god was listening that he could live with what he might see but for now he would take some time one long lazy morning to heal his fatigued mind and ragged soul there was a paddock behind the house attached to a low gleaming white stable even as he approached he heard the whicker of greeting the sound was so ordinary so simple and welcoming that he smiled there they were the sleek black stallion and the proud white mare standing so still that he thought of two elegantly carved chess pieces one ebony one alabaster then the mare flicked her tail in a flirtatious gesture and pranced to the fence they could leap it he knew both had done so more than once with him in the saddle but there was a trust between them an understanding that the fence was not a cage but a home theres a beauty sebastian lifted a hand to stroke her cheek her long graceful neck have you been keeping your man in line psyche she blew into his hand in her dark eyes he saw pleasure and what he liked to think was humor she whinnied softly when he swung over the fence then she stood patiently while he passed his hands over her flanks down over her swollen belly only a few more weeks he murmured he could almost feel the life inside her sleeping again he thought of morgana though he doubted his cousin would care to be compared to a pregnant horse even as fine an arabian as psyche has ana been taking good care of you he nuzzled against the mares neck comforted by her quiet good nature of course she has he murmured and stroked for a while giving her the attention they had both missed while hed been away then he turned and looked at the stallion who stood alert his handsome head high and you eros have you been tending to your lady at the sound of his name the horse reared to paw the air trumpeting a cry that was rich in power and almost human the display of pride had sebastian laughing as he crossed to the stallion youve missed me you gorgeous beast admit it or not still laughing sebastian slapped the gleaming flank and sent eros dancing around the paddock on the second trip around sebastian grabbed a handful of mane and swung onto the restless mount giving them what they both wanted a fast reckless ride as they soared over the fence psyche watched them her eyes as indulgent and as superior as a mother watching little boys wrestling sebastian felt better by the afternoon the hollowness hed brought back from chicago was gradually being filled but he continued to avoid the little yellow teddy bear sitting lonely on the long empty sofa and he had yet to look at the photograph in the library with its coffered ceiling and its walls of books he sat at a massive mahogany desk and toyed with some paperwork at any given time sebastian might have between five and ten businesses of which he was either sole owner or majority partner they were hobbies to him real estate importexport firms magazines a catfish farm in mississippi that amused him and his current pet a minorleague baseball team in nebraska he was shrewd enough to make a healthy profit wise enough to leave daytoday management in the hands of experts and capricious enough to buy and sell on a whim he enjoyed what money could give him and he often used those profits lavishly but he had grown up with wealth and amounts of money that would have startled many were hardly more than numbers on paper to him the simple game of mathematics the increasing or decreasing was a neverending source of entertainment he was generous with pet charities because he believed in them his donations were a matter not of tax breaks or philanthropy but of morals it would probably have embarrassed him and it would certainly have irritated him to be thought of as an unshakably moral man he pleased himself until sunset working reading toying with a new spell he hoped to perfect magic was his cousin morganas speciality sebastian could never hope to equal her power there but his innate competitive streak kept him struggling to try oh he could make fire but that was a witchs first and last skill he could levitate but that too was an elementary talent beyond that and a few hat tricks that was mel sneaking back into his mind again he was no magician his gift was one of sight in much the same way that a brilliant actor might yearn to sing and dance sebastian yearned to cast spells after two hours with little success he gave up in disgust he fixed himself an elaborate meal for one put some irish ballads on the stereo and uncorked a threehundreddollar bottle of wine with the same casualness another man might show in popping open a can of beer he indulged in a lengthy whirlpool his eyes closed his mind a blessed blank as the water jetted around him after slipping into a silk pajama bottoms he pleased himself by watching the sun set in bleeding reds and then he waited for night to steal across the sky it couldnt be put off any longer with some reluctance sebastian went downstairs again rather than flick on lights he lit candles he didnt need the trappings of the art but there was comfort in tradition there was the scent of sandalwood and vanilla because they reminded him of his mothers room at castle donovan they never failed to soothe him the light was shadowy inviting power for several long moments he stood by the sofa with a sigh very like a laborer might make on hefting a pick he looked at the photograph of david merrick it was a charming happy face one that would have made sebastian smile if his concentration hadnt been focused words gathered in his head ancient words secret words when he was sure he set the picture aside and lifted the sadeyed yellow bear all right david he murmured and his voice echoed hollowly through the empty rooms let me see it didnt happen with a blaze of light or a flash of understanding though it could it could he simply drifted his eyes changed from smoke to slate to the color of storm clouds they were fixed unblinking beyond the room beyond the walls beyond the night images images forming and melting like wax through his mind his fingers were gentle on the childs toy but his body had stiffened like stone his breathing remained steady slowing evening out as it would in sleep to begin he had to fight past the grief and fear that shimmered through the toy without losing concentration he had to slip past the visions of the weeping mother clutching the bear of a dazedeyed father holding them both oh but these were strong these emotions of sorrow and terror and fury but strongest of all as always was the love even that faded as he skimmed past going deeper going back he saw with a childs eyes and a childs wonder a pretty face roses face leaning over the crib a smile soft words soft hands great love then another a mans face young simple hesitant fingers rough and callused here too was love slightly different from the mother love but just as deep this was tinted with a kind of dazed awe and sebastians lips curved and a wish to play catch in a nice backyard the images slid one into the other fussy crying at night formless fears soon soothed by strong caring hands nagging hungers sated by warm mothers milk from a willing breast and pleasures such delight in colors in sounds in the warmth of sunlight health robust health in a body straining to grow as a babes did in that first dazzling year of life then heat and a surprising baffling pain aching throbbing in the gums the comfort of being walked rocked sung to and another face soft with a different kind of love mary ellen making the yellow bear dance in front of his eyes laughing her hands tender and hesitant as she gathered him up holding him high in the air and pressing tickling kisses to his belly from her a longing too unformed in her own mind to be seen clearly all emotion and confusion what is it you want sebastian wanted to ask her what is it youre afraid you cant have then she faded away from him like a chalk portrait washed away in a shower of rain sleeping dreaming easy dreams with a slash of sunlight just beyond your fisted hand and the shade cool and soft as a kiss peace utter peace when it was broken there was sleepy irritation small healthy lungs filled to cry but the sound was cut off by a hand unfamiliar hands unfamiliar smell and then irritation turned to fear the face there was only a glimpse and sebastian struggled to freeze that image in his mind for later being carried held too tightly and bundled in a car the car smells of old food and spilled coffee and the sweat of the man sebastian saw it felt it as one image stuttered into the next he lost whole patches as the childs terror and tears exhausted him into sleep but he saw and he knew where to begin morgana opened the shop promptly at ten luna her big white cat slinked in between her feet then settled down in the center of the room to groom her tail knowing the summer trade morgana went directly behind the counter to check the cash register her belly bumped gently against the glass and she chuckled she was getting as big as a house and she loved it loved the full weighted sensation of carrying life the life she and nash had created between them she remembered how just that morning her husband had pressed kisses to that growing mound then jerked back eyes wide as whoever was sleeping inside kicked jeez morgana a foot hed cupped a hand over the lump grinning i can practically count the toes as long as theres five to each foot she thought now and she was smiling when her door jingled open sebastian fresh pleasure filled her face as she held out both arms to him youre back a couple of days ago he took her hands kissed them soundly then drew back wiggling his brows as he studied her my my arent we huge arent we just she patted her belly as she skirted around the counter toward him pregnancy hadnt dimmed her sexuality if anything it had enhanced it she as they say about brides and expectant mothers glowed her fall of black curling hair rained down the back of an unapologetically red dress that showed off excellent legs i dont have to ask if youre well he commented i can see that for myself then ill ask you ive already heard you helped clean up chicago she said it with a smile but there was quiet concern in her eyes was it difficult yes but its done before he could say more before he was certain he wanted to a trio of customers strolled in to explore the crystals and herbs and statuary youre not working here alone no mindy will be here any minute mindy is here her assistant announced bounding into the shop wearing a white catsuit and a flirtatious smile for sebastian hello handsome hi gorgeous instead of heading out of the shop or ducking into the back room as was his habit when customers filed in sebastian prowled around fiddling restlessly with crystals sniffing at candles morgana took advantage of the first lull to join him again looking for some magic he frowned a smooth obsidian ball in his hand i dont need visual aids morgana tucked her tongue in her cheek having trouble with another spell darling though he was very taken with it sebastian set the ball down hed be damned if hed give her the satisfaction i leave the casting to you oh if only you would she picked up the ball and handed it to him morgan knew her cousin too well here a gift theres nothing like obsidian for blocking out those bad vibrations he let the globe run from palm to fingertips and back i suppose being a shop owner youd be up on whos who in town at the moment more or less why what do you know about sutherland investigations sutherland her brow creased in thought its familiar what is it a detective agency apparently i think i mindy didnt your boyfriend have some business with sutherland investigations mindy barely glanced up from ringing a sale which boyfriend the intellectuallooking one with the hair insurance oh you mean gary mindy beamed at her customer i hope you enjoy it please come back garys an exboyfriend she added much too possessive sutherland does a lot of stuff for the insurance company he works for gary says shes as good as they get she morgana glanced back at sebastian with a cool smile ah theres no ah he tweaked her nose ive agreed to help someone and sutherland is involved hmm is she pretty no he said with perfect sincerity ugly then no shes unusual the very best kind what are you helping her with a kidnapping the teasing light went out of his eyes a baby oh automatically she covered her own with her hands im sorry the baby is the baby do you know hes alive and well thank god even as she closed her eyes in relief she remembered the baby is it the one who was taken from his playpen from his own backyard just a couple of months ago thats right she took his hands youll find him sebastian youll find him soon he nodded im counting on it it just so happened that mel was at that very moment in the process of typing up a bill for underwriters insurance they had her on a monthly retainer which kept the wolf from the door but in the previous few months she had had some additional billable expenses she also had a fading bruise on her left shoulder where a man supposedly suffering from whiplash and slipped discs had popped her a good one when hed discovered her taking pictures of him changing a flat tire a tire she had herself discreetly deflated bruises aside it had been a good weeks work if only everything were so simple david she simply couldnt get david out of her head she knew better had been trained better personal involvements meant you messed up thus far shed only proven that rule shed canvassed roses neighborhood questioning people who had already been interviewed by the police and like the police shed come up with three different descriptions of a car that had been parked half a block from roses apartment she also had four markedly different descriptions of a suspicious character the term made her smile a little it was so detectivenovel shed certainly learned that life was much blander than fiction in reality investigative work consisted of mountains of paperwork hours of sitting in a parked car fighting boredom while you waited for something to happen making phone call after phone call talking to people who didnt want to talk or often worse people who talked too much and had nothing to say and occasionally there was the extra added excitement of being pushed around by a twohundredpound gorilla in a neck brace mel wouldnt have traded it for a mountain of gold dust but what good was it she wondered what good was making a living doing what you loved and having the talent to do a good job of it if you couldnt help a friend there hadnt been so many friends in her life that she could take rose and stan for granted they had given her something just by being there by sharing david with her the connection to family that shed always done without she would have walked through fire to bring david back to them after tossing the billing aside she picked up a file that hadnt been off her desk in two months it was neatly labeled david merrick and its contents were miserably thin all his vital statistics were there his height and weight and coloring she had his footprints and his fingerprints she knew his blood type and was aware of the tiny dimple on the left side of his mouth but the reports didnt say that the dimple deepened so sweetly when he laughed it couldnt describe the engaging sound of that laughter or how it felt when he pressed that soft damp mouth to yours in a kiss it didnt say how his pretty brown eyes sparkled when you lifted him high over your head to play airplane she knew how empty she felt how sad and frightened just as she knew that if she multiplied those emotions by a thousand it wouldnt come close to what rose was living with every hour of every day mel opened the folder and drew out the formal studio shot of david at six months it had been taken only a week before the kidnapping he was grinning at the camera his pudgy chin creased in a smile as he clutched the yellow bear she had bought for him on the day hed come home from the hospital his hair had begun to thicken and it was the shade of ripening strawberries were going to find you baby were going to find you and bring you home real soon i swear it she put the picture away again quickly she had to if she was to have any hope of proceeding in a calm and professional manner mooning over his picture wouldnt help david any more than hiring a psychic with a pirates mouth and spooky eyes would oh the man irritated her irritated her from the top of her head down to the soles of her feet and every possible inch between that look on his face that notquiteasmirk notquiteagrin set to his mouth made her want to plant her fist there and his voice smooth with just a whisper of an irish brogue set her teeth on edge there was such cool superiority in it except when hed spoken to rose she remembered then it had been gentle and kind and unflaggingly patient just setting her up mel told herself and stepped over a pile of phone books to get to the doorway where a refrigerator held a monstrous supply of soft drinks all loaded with caffeine he had just been setting rose up offering her hope when he had no right to david would be found but he would be found by logical meticulous police work not by some crackpot visionary in sixhundreddollar boots she was just taking an angry swig when those boots walked through her door she said nothing just continued to lean in the doorway the bottle to her lips and her eyes shooting tiny green darts sebastian closed the door marked sutherland investigations behind him and took a lazy look around as offices went hed seen worse and hed certainly seen better her desk was armysurplus gray steel functional and tough but far from aesthetically pleasing two metal file cabinets were shoved against a wall that would have benefited from a coat of paint there were two chairs one in a lurid purple the other a faded print on either side of a skinny table that held ancient magazines and was scarred with sundry cigarette burns on the wall behind them as out of place as an elegant woman in a waterfront dive was a lovely watercolor of monterey bay the room smelled inexplicably like a spring meadow he caught a glimpse of the room behind her and saw that it was a tiny and unbelievably disordered kitchen he couldnt resist tucking his hands in his pockets he smiled at her some digs she took another drink then dangled the bottle between two fingers have you got business with me donovan have you got another bottle of that after a moment she shrugged then stepped over the phone books again to snatch one out of the refrigerator i dont think you came down off your mountain for a drink but i rarely turn one down he twisted off the top after she handed him the bottle he skimmed his gaze over her taking in the snug jeans and the scarred boots then moving back up to the tippedup chin with its fascinating little center dip all the way to the distrustful dark green eyes you certainly look fetching this morning mary ellen dont call me that though shed meant merely to sound firm the words gritted out between her teeth such a lovely oldfashioned name he tilted his head baiting her then again i suppose mel suits you better what do you want donovan the teasing light faded to find david merrick she was almost fooled almost the simple statement sounded so sincere so keenly honest that she nearly reached out snapping herself back she sat on the corner of her desk and studied him its just you and me now pal so lets cut to the chase you dont have any stake in this i humored rose because i couldnt find a way to talk her out of going to you and because it gave her some temporary comfort but i know your kind maybe youre too slick for the obvious con you know the sort send me twenty bucks and ill change your life let me help you obtain money power and great sex for only a small monetary contribution she gestured with the bottle then drank again youre not the smallchange sort more the beluga and dom perignon type i suppose you get your jollies by going into trances around crime scenes and spouting out clues maybe you even hit a few from time to time so good for you but youre not going to get your jollies out of rose and stans unhappiness youre not going to use their little boy as an ego boost he was only mildly annoyed sebastian assured himself that he didnt give a tinkers dam what this smartmouthed greeneyed bimbo thought of him the bottom line was david merrick but his fingers had tightened on the bottle and his voice when he spoke was entirely too soft have me all figured out do you sutherland you bet your buns i do arrogance came off her in waves as she sat on the corner of the desk so lets not waste each others time if you feel youre owed something for hearing rose out yesterday bill me ill see you get whats coming to you he said nothing for a moment it occurred to him that hed never had the urge to throttle a woman before excepting his cousin morgana but now he imagined closing his hands around mels long tanned throat and he imagined very well its a wonder you dont stagger with that chip on your shoulder he set the halfempty bottle down then pushing impatiently through the chaos on her desk he unearthed a pencil and a sheet of paper whatre you doing she asked when he cleared a small space and began to sketch drawing you a picture you seem like the kind who needs visuals she frowned watching the careless way his hand streaked over the paper she frowned deeper shed always envied and resented people who could draw so effortlessly she continued to drink telling herself she wasnt interested but her gaze continued to be pulled back to the face emerging from the lines and curves he made despite herself she leaned closer somewhere in the back of her mind it registered that he smelled like horses and leather sleek groomed horses and oiled leather the deep purple of his amethyst caught her eye she stared at it halfhypnotized by the way it glinted in that twist of gold on his little finger artists hands she thought dimly strong and capable and elegant she reminded herself they would probably be soft as well accustomed to opening champagne or undoing a ladys fancy buttons i often do both at the same time what more than a little dazed she looked up and saw that he had stopped drawing he was simply standing closer than shed realized and watching nothing his lips curved but he was annoyed with himself for probing hed simply been curious as to why shed been staring at his hands sometimes its best not to think too loudly while she was chewing that over he handed her the sketch this is the man who took david she wanted to dismiss the drawing and the artist but there was something eerily right about it saying nothing she walked behind her desk and opened davids folder inside were four police sketches she chose one comparing it to sebastians work his was more detailed certainly the witness hadnt noticed that little cshaped scar under the left eye or the chipped front tooth the police artist hadnt captured that expression of glittery panic but essentially they were the same man the shape of the face the set of the eyes the springy hair beginning to recede so he has a connection on the force she told herself trying to settle her jumping nerves he got hold of a copy of the sketch then embellished it a bit she tossed the sketch down then settled in her chair it squeaked rustily when she leaned back why this one because thats the one i saw he was driving a brown mercury an or beige interior the back seats ripped on the left side he likes country music at least thats what he had playing on the car radio when he drove off with the child east he murmured and his eyes sharpened to a knife edge for just a heartbeat southeast one of the witnesses had reported a brown car nondescript but unfamiliar parked near roses apartment several days running hed said and sebastian could have gotten that information from the police as well mel reminded herself shed called his bluff and he was just pushing buttons but if he wasnt if there was the slightest chance a face and a car she tried to sound disinterested but the faintest of tremors in her voice betrayed her no name address and serial number youre a tough sell sutherland it would be easy to dislike her he thought if he couldnt see feel how desperately she cared what the hell hed dislike her on principle a childs life is at stake hes safe sebastian said safe and well cared for a little confused and he cries more than he did but no ones hurt him she felt the breath clog up in her lungs she wanted to believe that that much if nothing more youre not going to talk to rose about this she said steadily itll drive her crazy ignoring her sebastian went on the man who took him was afraid you could smell it he took him to a woman somewhere east it would come and she dressed him in oshkosh overalls and a red striped shirt he was in a car seat and had a ring of plastic keys to play with they drove most of the day then stopped at a motel it had a dinosaur out front she fed him bathed him and when he cried she walked him until he fell asleep where she asked utah he frowned a little arizona maybe but probably utah the next day they drove still southeast shes not afraid its just business they go to a mall someplace in texas east texas its crowded she sits on a bench a man sits beside her he leaves an envelope on the bench and pushes david away in his stroller the same routine the following day davids tired of traveling and bewildered by all the strange faces he wants home hes taken to a house a big stone house with old leafy trees in the yard south it feels like georgia hes given to a woman who holds him and cries a little and a man who holds them both he has a room there with blue sailboats on the wall and a mobile over the crib of circus animals they call him eric now mel was very pale when she managed to speak i dont believe you no but theres a part of you that wonders if you should forget what you think of me mel think of david i am thinking of david she sprang to her feet the sketch clutched in her hand give me a name then give me a damn name do you think it works like that he tossed back demand and answer its an art not a pop quiz she let the sketch float back to the desk right listen to me he slapped his hands down on the desk hard enough to make her jolt in reaction ive been in chicago for three weeks watching some monster slice people to ribbons in my head feeling his glee while he did it using up everything i am everything i have to find him before he could do it again if im not working fast enough to suit you on this sutherland thats too damn bad she backed off not because she was afraid of this sudden burst of temper because she saw something in his face some trace of his weary horror at what hed been through okay she took a deep breath here are the facts i dont believe in psychics or witches or things that go bump in the night he had to smile youll have to meet my family sometime but she continued as if he hadnt spoken ill use anything any resource hell we can use a ouija board if itll help get david back she picked up the sketch again ive got a face ill start with that well start with that before she could come up with a suitable response the phone rang sutherland investigations yeah its mel whats going down rico sebastian watched her attention sharpen saw a slight smile tug at her lips why she is pretty he realized with a kind of annoyed surprise hey babe you can trust me she began to write on a pad in messy hurried scribbles yeah i know where it is isnt that dandy she listened again nodding to herself and muttering now and then come on come on i know the drill i never heard of you never saw that pretty face of yours ill leave your fee at orileys she paused and laughed in your dreams baby when she hung up sebastian could feel the excitement shooting off her in sparks take a walk donovan ive got to go to work ill go with you it was said on impulse and almost immediately regretted he would have taken it back if her reaction had been less scathing she laughed again listen pal this isnt amateur hour i dont need the extra baggage were going to be working together for a hopefully brief duration i know what i can handle sutherland i havent got a clue about you id like to see you in action you want action she nodded slowly all right hotshot wait here ive got to change first chapter contents prev next shed changed all right sebastian thought less than ten minutes later the woman who walked in from the back room in a pumpkincolored leather skirt the length of a place mat was a sharp left turn away from the one whod walked out those legs were well just short of miraculous shed done something to her face as well her eyes seemed huge and heavy slumberous he supposed was the word her mouth was dark and slick shed fluffled and fiddled with her hair now rather than looking careless it was tousled in a way that suggested shed just gotten out of bed and would be more than willing to tumble back in two glittery gold balls hung from her ears nearly touching the shoulders of a snug black tank top snug enough sebastian thought to make any man not currently in a coma realize there was nothing beneath it but woman sex the word steamed into his mind in big bold letters this was wild uninhibited and casually available sex he was certain he was about to make some snide comment or perhaps say something rudely suggestive but that wasnt what came out of his mouth where in the name of finn do you think youre going dressed like that mel cocked one penciled eyebrow in the name of who he made a dismissive gesture and tried to keep his eyes off her legs whatever fragrance shed dumped all over herself made his tongue want to hang out you look like a yeah pleased she grinned and turned in a saucy circle its my floozy look works like a charm most guys dont care if youre pretty or not if you show enough skin and cover the rest with something tight he shook his head he didnt want to try to decipher that why are you dressed like that tools of the trade donovan she shifted the oversize purse on her shoulder inside it she carried another tool of the trade if youre going with me lets hit it ill fill you in on the way it wasnt excitement he felt from her now that she had banked as she climbed into her car and lord her skirt slithered up another inch he caught bolts of anticipation quicksilver streaks of fun the kind sebastian imagined another kind of woman might feel embarking on a shopping spree but mel wasnt like any kind of woman hed ever before encountered okay she said as he settled into the passenger seat heres the deal she shot away from the curb and her driving was as quick and competent as her explanation there had been a rash of local robberies over the past six weeks all electronics televisions vcrs stereo equipment a good many of the victims had been insured by underwriters the police had a few leads but nothing solid and since no single home had been hit for more than a few hundred at a shot it wasnt exactly number one on their hit list underwriters is your average happy insurance company she commented as she winked through an amber light which means they really hate to pay claims so ive been working on it for the last few weeks your car needs a tuneup sebastian told her when the engine made a gagging sound yeah anyway i did some poking around and what do you know turns out theres a couple of guys selling tvs and such out of the back of a van oh not around here they bop over to salinas or down to soledad how did you find out she shot him a mild smile legwork donovan miles and miles of legwork despite his better judgment his gaze dropped down to those long tanned thighs ill bet so ive got this snitch hes had a few unfortunate runins with the cops and hes a little leery but he kind of took to me because im private i guess sebastian coughed cleared his throat oh yeah im sure thats it hes got connections she went on seeing as he did some time for b and e breaking and entering she explained and some petty larceny you have fascinating friends its a good life she said with a laugh in her voice he passes me some information i pass him a few bills mostly it keeps him from picking locks he hangs down at the docks strictly nontourist areas theres a bar down there where he happened to be tossing back a few last night got chummy with this guy who was already soused my friend likes a drink better if somebody else is paying for it they got intimate in that happy way drunks do and he finds out this guys flush because he just hauled a load of electronic entertainment down to king city now because theyre the best of friends he takes my snitch around the back of the bar to this dump of a warehouse and what do you suppose is inside previously owned electronics at a discount price amused she chuckled you catch on donovan so why dont you just call the cops hey these guys might not be the james gang but its a pretty good bust her lips were curved as she downshifted my bust i suppose its occurred to you that they might be uncooperative when she smiled again something hot and beautiful leapt into her eyes dont worry donovan ill protect you now heres what i want you to do when they pulled up in front of the bar a few minutes later sebastian had the game plan he didnt like it but he had it a fastidious man he looked dubiously at the lowslung windowless establishment seedy he thought but supposed that a good many bars looked seedy in the light of day he had a feeling this one would look equally seedy in the dead of night it was built of cinder blocks that some enterprising soul had painted green the paint a particularly hideous shade was peeling badly and showed the gray beneath the way an old peeling scab shows the pasty skin underneath it was barely noon but there were nearly a dozen cars in the gravel lot mel dropped her keys in her purse while she frowned at sebastian try to look less human he suggested elegant was the word shed had in mind but shed be damned if shed use it less gentlemans quarterly and for gods sake dont order any white wine ill restrain myself just follow the bouncing ball donovan and youll do fine what he followed were her swaying hips and he wasnt sure hed do fine at all the smell of the place assaulted him the moment mel pulled open the door stale smoke stale beer stale sweat there was a rumbling sound from the jukebox and though sebastian had very eclectic tastes in music he hoped he wouldnt be subjected to that surly sound for long men were lined up at the bar the kind of men with burly forearms littered with tattoos this particular artwork ran heavily in favor of snakes and skulls there was a clatter as four oilylooking characters shot nine ball some glanced up their gazes sliding over sebastian with a kind of smirking derision and lingering on mel longer and with more affection he picked up on scattered thoughts easy enough since the average iq of the patrons hovered below three digits his lips twitched once he hadnt realized there were so many ways to describe a lady the lady in question one of three currently enjoying the atmosphere sauntered up to the bar and wiggled her leatherclad bottom onto a stool that wide slicked mouth was pursed in a sexy pout least you can do is buy me a beer she said to sebastian in a breathy little voice that caught him off guard her eyes narrowed briefly in warning and he remembered his cue listen sweetcakes i told you it wasnt my fault sweetcakes mel stopped herself from rolling her eyes sure nothing is you get canned its not your fault you lose a hundred bucks playing poker with your slimy friends its not your fault give me a beer will you she called to the bartender and crossed those long lovely legs trying to hulk a bit sebastian held up two fingers then slid onto the stool beside her i told you didnt i tell you that creep had it in for me at work and why dont you get off my back oh sure she sniffed as the beers were slapped down in front of them when sebastian reached for his back pocket it occurred to her that his wallet was probably worth more than the combined liquid assets of the bars patrons and that it was likely filled with plenty of the green stuff along with a few flashy gold credit cards she hissed at him he understood instantly and that would give her some food for thought later his hand hesitated then dropped away tapped out again she said a sneer in her voice isnt that just swell with obvious reluctance she dug into her bag and unearthed two ragged dollar bills youre such a loser harry harry sebastians frown was entirely authentic ill have some coming in i got ten on the game oh sure sure youll be rolling in it she gave him her back and sipping at the mug of beer scanned the room she had ricos description it took her less than two minutes to zero in on the man ricos pal had called eddie eddie was a real fun guy according to ricos drinking partner he was the day man the one who doled the merchandise out for transport and sale and according to rico he had a real soft spot for the ladies mel swung her leg in time with the music and made sure she caught eddies eye she smiled fluttered and sent out conflicting signals to eddie her smile said hey there big guy ive been looking for someone just like you all my life to sebastian who had tuned in to her just enough to keep her from surprising him it was fat hairless jerk he turned and took a look for himself hairless true sebastian thought but it wasnt all fat stuffed into that sleeveless tshirt there was plenty of muscle mixed in listen honey sebastian put a hand on mels shoulder and had it shrugged off im tired of excuses harry sick and damn tired theyre all just a crock you got no money you lose all of mine you cant even put fifty together to get the tv fixed and you know how much i like my shows you watch the tube too much anyway oh fine she was fired up now and she swung around to face him i work my butt off waiting tables half the night and you give me grief because i like to sit down put my feet up and watch a little tv it dont cost nothing to watch its going to cost fifty bucks she shoved him sliding off the stool as she did you just lost twice that in a damn card game and some of it was mine i said get off my back he was getting into it now almost enjoying it maybe it was because he remembered hed been instructed to push her around a little whine and bitch thats all you do he grabbed her trying to make a good show of it her head fell back and her eyes were bright with defiance thatsexy oh yes very sexy mouth moved into a pout and he had to struggle to stay in character she saw something in his eyes very briefly very powerfully mels heart tripped right up to her throat and beat there like a big brass drum i dont have to take this crap from you he gave her a good shake as much to settle himself as for effect if you dont like the way things are you can try the door you better take your hands off me she made her voice tremble it was embarrassing but necessary i told you what would happen if you ever hit me again hit her good lord just get your butt outside crystal he started to push her toward the door and found his face pressed against a beefy chest covered in a sweaty tshirt that announced that its owner was a hard driving man the little lady wants hands off jerkface sebastian looked up into eddies wide smile mel was sniffling beside him really laying it on hoping for more even ground sebastian rose from the stool so that he and the knight errant were eyetoeye mind your own business eddie knocked him back on the stool with one blow sebastian was certain he was going to feel the imprint of the heel of that sledgehammer hand on his chest for years to come you want i should take him out and mess him up sweetheart mel dried her lashes and seemed to consider it she hesitated just long enough to make sebastian sweat no she laid a trembling hand on eddies arm he aint worth it fluttering she turned her admiring face up to his youre awfully nice theres hardly any gentlemen left in this world a girl can count on why dont you come on and sit down at my table he put a treetrunk arm around her waist ill buy you a drink and you can take a load off thats real sweet she sauntered off with him wanting to put on a good show sebastian made as if to follow them one of the contestants at the pool table grinned and slapped a cue on his palm suitably warned sebastian skulked down to the end of the bar and nursed his beer she made him wait an hour and a half he couldnt even order a second beer without breaking his cover and was enduring nasty looks from the bartender as he nibbled on peanuts and made the last half inch of his drink last forever hed just about had it his idea of a good time was not sitting in a smelly bar watching some sumo wrestler paw the woman hed come with even if he didnt have any emotional investment and even he thought darkly if that woman giggled with every appearance of enjoyment every time one of those hamsized hands rubbed her leg it would serve her right if he just strolled out caught himself a cab and left her to it in mels opinion everything was going just fine fine and dandy sir eddie as she called him much to his delight was getting slowly and steadily drunk not pieeyed just nice and vulnerable and he was doing plenty of talking men just loved to brag to an eager woman especially when they were juiced hed just come into a nice chunk of change so eddie said and maybe shed like to help him spend a little of it shed love to of course she had to get to work in a couple of hours and she didnt finish her shift until one but after that when she had him softened up she gave him a sob story how she and harry had been together for almost six whole months how he ran through money like water and kept her from having a good time she didnt ask for much just some pretty clothes and a few laughs and now it was really bad just plain awful because her tv had broken down here shed been saving up for a vcr so she could tape shows while she worked and now the tv was on the fritz worse harry had blown his money and hers on cards so now she didnt even have the fifty to fix the set i really like to watch you know she toyed with her second beer eddie was working on number seven in the afternoon they got these shows and all the women have these pretty clothes then they switch me to the day shift and i miss out i can never catch up with whats happening and you know she leaned forward confidentially so that her breasts rubbed against his forearm they got these love scenes on them watching them just gets me so hot eddie watched her tongue peek out and run around her lips he plainly thought hed died and gone to heaven i guess its not much fun watching something like that all alone be more fun with somebody she gave him a look that told him he was the only possible somebody if i had a set that worked it might be nice i like daytime you know when everybody else is working or shopping and you can be in bed sighing she ran her fingertip around her mug its daytime now yeah but i havent got a tv she giggled as if it were a great joke i might be able to help you with that baby she let her eyes widen then brought her lashes coyly down aw gee thats really sweet of you eddie i couldnt let you give me the fifty it wouldnt be right what do you want to toss money at an old set for anyway you can have a new one oh yeah she snorted into her beer and i could have me a diamond tiara too cant help you on that but i can get you a set come on she shot him a disbelieving look and let her hand rest on his knee how he puffed out his massive chest just so happens im in the business you sell tvs she cocked her head and had her eyes blinking in fascination youre pulling my leg not now he winked maybe later mel laughed heartily oh youre a card sir eddie she drank again sighed again i wish you werent fooling if you could get me one id be awfully grateful he leaned closer she could smell the beer and smoke on his breath how grateful mel wiggled toward him put her mouth to his ear and whispered a suggestion that would have made the worldly sebastian stutter short of breath eddie finished off his beer in one gulp and grabbed her hand come on sweet thing i got something to show you mel went along not bothering to glance in sebastians direction she sincerely hoped that what eddie was about to show her was a television wherere we going she asked as he led her to the back of the building my office babe a sly wink me and my partners got a little business back here he took her over a rubble of broken bottles trash and piles of gravel to another concrete building perhaps half the size of the bar after three raps on the door it was opened by a skinny man of about twenty wearing hornrims and carrying a clipboard whats the deal eddie the lady needs a tv he swung his arm over mels shoulder and squeezed crystal honey this is bobby meetcha bobby said with a bounce of his head look eddie i dont think this is a good idea franks going to be mad as hell hey i got as much right as frank eddie bulled his way in ah mel thought and sighed for real the fluorescent bulbs overhead shone down on the blank single eyes of more than a dozen televisions they sat cheek by jowl with cd players vcrs stereo systems tossed in for good measure were several boom boxes personal computers telephone answering machines and one lonely microwave oven wow she clapped her hands together oh wow eddie look at all this its like a regular department store full of confidence and swaying only a little eddie winked at the nervous bobby were what you call suppliers we dont do any retail out of here this is just like our warehouse go ahead look around still playing her role mel walked over to the televisions running her hands over their screens as if her fingers were walking in mink franks not going to like this bobby hissed so what he dont know he dont have to not like right bobby bobby who was outweighed by a hundred pounds nodded sure eddie but bringing a broad in here shes okay great legs but not much brains im going to give her a set and then im going to get lucky he moved past eddie to join mel see one you like baby oh theyre great really great do you mean i can really have one just pick one out and have it why sure he gave her a quick intimate squeeze we got this breakage insurance so ill just have old bobby there put down like one got busted thats all there is to it really she tossed her head moving just far enough out of reach that she could easily slip a hand into her bag thats great eddie but it looks to me like youre the one whos busted she pulled out a nickelplated a cop bobby nearly screeched the words while eddies face settled into a thoughtful frown jeez eddie shes a cop there you go dont she warned as bobby edged to the door just have a seat bobby on the floor there and sit on your hands will you you bitch eddie said in a considering voice that put mel on guard i shouldve smelled cop im private she told him that might be the reason she gestured with the gun lets take it outside eddie no womans going to doublecross me gun or no gun he lunged she didnt want to shoot him she really didnt he wasnt anything more than a fat secondrate thief and he didnt deserve a bullet instead she twisted veering left and counting on her speed and agility and his beerinduced sluggishness he missed and rammed headlong into a twentyfive inch screen mel wasnt sure who was the victor but the screen cracked like an egg and eddie went down hard there was a sound behind her when she whirled she had time to see sebastian wrap an arm around bobbys throat one quick squeeze had him dropping the hammer hed been lifting over mels head it probably wouldnt have made a dent sebastian said between his teeth as bobby crumpled bonelessly to the concrete floor you didnt tell me you had a gun i didnt think i had to youre supposed to be psychic sebastian picked up the hammer tapping it gently against his palm keep it up sutherland she merely shrugged and took another look at the loot nice haul why dont you go call the cops ill keep an eye on these two fine he was sure it was too much to expect her to thank him for saving her from a concussion or worse the best he could do was slam the door behind him it was nearly an hour later when sebastian stood by and watched mel sitting on the hood of her car she was going over the fine details with what appeared to be a very disgruntled detective haverman sebastian remembered hed run into him once or twice then he dismissed the cop and concentrated on mel shed pulled off the earrings and was still rubbing her lobes from time to time most of the goo on her face had been wiped off with tissue her unpainted mouth and naturally flushed cheeks made a devastating contrast with the big heavylidded eyes pretty had he granted her pretty sebastian wondered hell she was gorgeous in the right light at the right angle she was dropdead gorgeous then she might turn and be merely mildly attractive again that held an odd and disturbing sort of magic but he didnt care how she looked he reminded himself he didnt care because he was plenty peeved shed dragged him into this it didnt matter that hed volunteered to come along once he had shed set the rules and hed had plenty of time to decide he didnt like them shed gone alone into that storage building with a man built like two fullbacks and shed had a gun no little peashooter either but a regular cannon what the hell would she have done if shed had to use it or lord if that mountain of betrayed lust had gotten it away from her look mel was saying to haverman youve got your sources ive got mine i got a tip i followed it up she was moving her shoulders carelessly but oh she was enjoying this youve got no beef with me lieutenant i want to know who put you on to this sutherland it was a matter of principle for him he was a cop after all a real cop not only was she a pi she was a female pi it just plain grated on him and i dont have to tell you then her lips quirked because the idea was so beautiful so inspired but since were pals ill clue you in she jerked her thumb toward sebastian he did sutherland sebastian began come on donovan what does it hurt this time she smiled and brought him in on the joke this is lieutenant haverman weve met sure now haverman was not only piqued but deflated women pis and psychics what was law enforcement coming to i didnt think missing tvs was your gig a visions a vision sebastian said complacently and had mel hooting so how come you passed it to her it didnt sit right with him you always come to the cops yeah sebastian shot a glittering look at mel over his shoulder but shes got better legs mel laughed so hard she nearly fell off the car haverman grumbled a little more and then stalked off after all he thought he had two suspects in hand and if he tried to shake donovan hed have the chief on his case good going slick still chuckling mel gave sebastian a friendly bop on the shoulder i didnt think you had it in you he merely lifted a brow there are a great many things you might be surprised i have in me yeah right she twisted her head to watch haverman climb in his car the lieutenants not such a bad guy he just figures pis belong in the pages of a book and women belong one step away from the oven because the sun was warm and the deed had been done well she was content to sit on the car for few minutes and enjoy the small triumph you did good harry thanks crystal he said and tried not to let his lips twitch into a smile now id appreciate it if next time you filled me in on the entire plan before we start oh i dont think theres a next time coming soon but this was fun fun he said the word slowly understanding that that was precisely what she meant you really enjoyed it dressing up like a tart making a scene having that musclebound throwback drool on you she offered a bland smile im entitled to some onthejob benefits arent i and it was fun i suppose to nearly have your head cracked open nearlys the key feeling more kindly toward him she patted his arm come on donovan loosen up i said you did good that i take it is your way of thanking me for saving your thick skull hey i couldve handled bobby fine but i appreciate the backup okay no he slapped his hands down on the hood on either side of her hips it is not okay if this is a taste of how you do business you and i are going to set some rules ive got rules my rules his eyes were the color of smoke now she thought not the kind that had hung listlessly at the ceiling of the bar but the sort that plumes up into the night from a crackling good bonfire now back off donovan make me he hated no detested the fact that the childish taunting phrase was the first thing to pop into his head he wasnt a child and neither was she sitting there daring him with that insolent lift to her chin and that half smirk on her beautiful mouth his right hand fisted it was tempting to give her one good pop on that damnably arrogant chin but her mouth seemed a better notion and he had a much more satisfying idea about what could be done with it he snatched her off the hood of the car so quickly that she didnt think to use any of the defensive countermoves that were second nature to her she was still blinking when his arms came around her when one hand cupped firmly on the back of her head fingers spread what the hell do you think that was it the words clicked off as completely as her brain the moment his mouth clamped over hers she didnt break away or shift her body to one side to toss him over her shoulder she didnt bring her knee up in a way that would have had him dropping to his and gasping she simply stood there and let his lips grind her mind to mush he was sorry shed pushed him beyond his own rules grabbing unwilling women was not on sebastians list of things to do and he was sorry desperately sorry because she didnt taste the way hed been certain she would a woman with a personality like mels should have had a vinegary flavor she should have tasted prickly and tart oh but she was sweet it wasnt sugar he thought of or the kind of gooey candy that came wrapped in gold foil it was honey rich thick wild honey that you were compelled to lick off your finger the kind that even as a child hed never been able to resist when her lips opened for his he dived in wanting more his hands werent soft that was the first wayward thought that stumbled into her brain they were hard and strong and just a little rough she could feel those fingers pressed against the back of her neck the skin there seemed to be on fire he pulled her closer so that their bodies made one long shadow on the littered gravel as sensations swarmed through her system she threw her arms around him and gave him back desire for desire it was different now she thought she heard him curse before he changed the angle of the kiss his teeth scraping over her lips and nearly making her cry out from the bolt of pleasure her heart was beating in her head echoing in her ears like a train picking up speed in a tunnel it would break through any moment break out of the dark and into the light and then she would hey the shout didnt even register the movement of sebastians lips on hers did a movement that was at first her name and then another oath hey sebastian heard the shout and the crunch of footsteps on gravel he could cheerfully have committed murder he kept one arm around mels waist and his hand firm on her neck as he turned his head and stared into a grizzled face under a dodgers baseball cap go away the order was close to a snarl go very far away listen bud i just wanna know how come the bars closed they ran out of vodka he could already feel mel retreating from him and would have sworn again if it would have done any good well hell all i wants a lousy beer having successfully destroyed the mood the dodgers fan clumped back to his pickup and drove off mel had crossed her arms over her breasts and was cupping her elbows as if she were warding off a brisk wind mary ellen sebastian began dont call me that staggered she jerked back and came up hard against her car her lips were vibrating she wanted to press her hand against them to make it stop but she didnt dare her pulse was beating in her throat in a quick jumpy rhythm she wanted that to stop too to slow and even out until it was normal and as it should be god good god shed been all over him practically climbing on him letting him touch her he wasnt touching her now but he looked like he might pride prevented her from shifting away but she braced ready to block another assault on her senses why did you do that he resisted the urge to dip in and see what she was really feeling to compare it to what was going on inside him but hed already taken unfair advantage i havent the vaguest idea well dont get any more ideas she was surprised that his answer hurt what had she expected she asked herself did she think he might have said hed been unable to resist her that hed been overwhelmed with passion she lifted her chin i can handle being pawed on the job but not on my own time clear his eyes flashed once then with more restraint than she could have imagined he lifted his hands palms out clear he repeated hands off all right then she wasnt going to make a big deal out of it she decided as she dug in her bag for her keys it was over and it hadnt meant a thing to either of them ive got to get back make some calls when he took a step forward her head snapped up as if she were a deer scenting a wolf im just opening your door sebastian said though he discovered he wasnt the least bit displeased by her reaction thanks she climbed in and slammed it herself she had to clear her throat to be certain her voice would be careless climb aboard donovan ive got places to go question he said after he slipped in beside her do you eat mostly when im hungry why there was a wariness in her eyes that he was enjoying a great deal seeing as all ive had since this morning was bar nuts i was thinking late lunch early dinner why dont you stop off somewhere ill buy you a burger she frowned over that for a moment poking the suggestion for pitfalls i could use a burger she decided but well go dutch he smiled and settled back his seat whatever you say sutherland chapter contents prev next mel spent most of the morning doing doortodoors in roses neighborhood with sebastians sketch in her hand by that afternoon the score was three positive ids four offers of coffee and one lewd proposition one of the positive ids also corroborated sebastians description of the car right down to the dented door and that gave mel a very uncomfortable feeling it didnt stop her from backtracking there was a name on her list that continued to nag at her mel had a hunch mrs odell in apartment knew more than she was saying for the second time that day mel knocked on the dull brown door wiped her feet on the grassgreen welcome mat with the white daisy in the corner from inside she could hear the whining of children and the bright applause of a television game show as it had before the door opened a few inches and mel looked down into the chocolatesmeared face of a young boy hi is your mom home she dont let me say to strangers right maybe you could go get her bumping a sneakered foot against the doorjamb the boy seemed to consider if i had a gun i could shoot you then it looks like this is my lucky day she crouched down until they were eyetoeye chocolate pudding right she said studying the smears around his mouth did you get that from licking the spoon after your mom made it yeah he shifted his feet and began to eye her with more interest howd you know that elementary my dear puddingface the smears are pretty fresh and its too close to lunch for your mom to let you have a whole bowl the boy tilted his head maybe i snuck it maybe mel agreed but then youd be pretty dumb not to wash off the evidence he started to grin when his mother swooped down from behind billy didnt i tell you not to answer the door she hauled him back onehanded the other arm was full of a wiggling girl with teary eyes mrs odell sent mel one impatient look what are you doing back around here i told you everything i could already you were a big help mrs odell its my fault really im just trying to put everything in order mel continued slipping into the cluttered living room as she spoke i hate to bother you again especially since you were so helpful before mel almost choked on that mrs odell had been suspicious unfriendly and curt just mel thought as she warmed up her apologetic smile as the lady was going to be now i looked at your picture mrs odell jiggled her daughter on her hip i told you everything i know just like i told the police i know and im sure its inconvenient to have your busy day constantly interrupted mel stepped over a platoon of gi joes that had been overrun by a miniature fire truck but you see your living room windows look right down on where the perpetrator was allegedly parked mrs odell set her daughter down and the little girl toddled toward the tv and sat down hard on her diapered bottom so well i couldnt help but notice how clean your windows are the cleanest ones in the entire building you know if you look up here from down on the street they shine like diamonds the flattery smoothed away mrs odells frown i take pride in my home i dont mind clutter with two kids youre going to have plenty of that but i dont tolerate dirt yes maam it seems to me that to have windows looking like that youd have to keep after them youre telling me living this close to the water you get that salt scum with a mothers radar she shot a look over her shoulder billy dont let the baby put those dirty soldiers in her mouth give her your truck but mom just for a little while satisfied that she would be obeyed mrs odell glanced back where was i salt scum mel prompted sure and the dust and dirt that comes from having cars going up and down the road fingerprints she nearly smiled seems im always chasing somebodys fingerprints yeah mel thought me too i know it must take a lot of work to keep your place up like this raising two kids not everyone thinks so some people figure if you dont carry a briefcase and commute to some office every day youre not working ive always thought holding together a home and family is the most important career there is mrs odell took the dust rag that was hanging out of the back pocket of her shorts and rubbed at the surface of a table well and the windows mel said gently leading her back i was wondering how often you have to wash them every month like clockwork youd have a real good view of the neighborhood i dont have time to spy on my neighbors no maam but you might notice things casually well im not blind i saw that man hanging around i told you that yes you did i was thinking if you happened to be washing the windows you might have noticed him down there i imagine it would take you about an hour to do the job fortyfive minutes uhhuh well if he was down there that long sitting in his car it would have struck you as unusual wouldnt it he got out and walked around oh mel wondered if she dared take out her notepad better to talk now and write it all down later she decided both days mrs odell added both days the day i did the windows and the day i washed the curtains i really didnt think anything of it i dont poke around into other peoples business no im sure you dont but i do mel thought her heart hammering i do and i just need a little more do you remember which days you noticed him did the windows the first of the month like always a couple days later i noticed the curtains were looking a little dingy so i took them down and washed them saw him across the street then walking down the sidewalk david merrick was taken on the fourth of may mrs odell frowned again then glanced at her children when she was satisfied they were squabbling and not paying any attention she nodded i know and like i told you before it just breaks my heart a little baby like that stolen practically out of his mothers arms i havent let billy go out alone all summer mel laid a hand on her arm to make a connection woman to woman you dont have to know rose merrick to understand what shes going through youre a mother it got through to her mel could see it in the way moisture sprang to mrs odells eyes i wish i could help i just didnt see anything more than that all i remember is thinking that this neighborhood should be safe that you shouldnt have to be afraid to let your children walk across the street to play with a friend you shouldnt have to worry every day that someones going to come back and pick out your child and drive away with him no you shouldnt rose and stan merrick shouldnt be wondering if theyll ever see their son again someone drove away with david mrs odell someone who was parked right under your window maybe you werent paying attention at the time but if youd clear your mind for a minute and think back you might have noticed his car some little thing about his car that beatup old thing i didnt pay any mind to it it was black red mrs odell shrugged dirty is what it was might have been brown might have been green under all that grime mel took a leap of faith outofstate plates i imagine after a moments consideration mrs odell shook her head nope i guess i might have wondered why he was just sitting down there sometimes your mind wanders when youre working and i was thinking he might have been visiting someone waiting for them to get home then i was figuring he hadnt come all that far cause he had state plates mel banked down her excitement and mentally crossed her fingers i always used to play this game when i was a kid my mom and i traveled a lot and she tried to give me things to do i guess you know how car trips are with kids mrs odell rolled her eyes for the first time there was a trace of humor in them oh do i i always tried to make words out of the letters on plates or come up with funny names for what the initials stood for we do the same thing with billy hes old enough but the baby maybe you noticed the license number casually while you were working without even thinking about it if you know what i mean and mel could see that she did try for a minute her lips pursed her eyes narrowed then she made an impatient movement with her dust rag and closed down ive got a lot of more important things on my mind i saw it was a california plate like i said but i didnt stand there and play games with it no of course not but sometimes you pick up things without even knowing it then when you think back miss sutherland mel told her id like to help you really my heart goes out to that poor woman and her husband but i make a habit of minding my own business and keeping to my own now theres nothing else i can tell you and im falling behind schedule recognizing the wall shed just hit mel took out a business card if you remember anything about the plate anything at all would you call me billy piped up said cat billy dont interrupt when people are talking he shrugged and drove his fire truck up his sisters leg to make her giggle what said cat mel asked the car did billy made engine noises kat that spells cat he chanted and had his mother sighing you dont spell cat with a k its cat i cant believe youll be going into the second grade and mel put a hand on mrs odells arm please she murmured then squatted down in front of billy did you see the car down there billy the dirty brown car sure when i came home from school it was there freddys mom had the pool car pool mrs odell said quietly she let me off right behind it i dont like riding with freddy cause he pinches did you play the license plate game with the brown car mel asked i like it when they make words like cat youre sure it was that brown car not some other car you saw on the drive home from school no cause it was parked just out front the whole week freddys mom drove me sometimes it was on the other side of the street then it wasnt there anymore when mom had the pool do you remember the numbers billy i dont like numbers letters are better kat he repeated then he looked up at his mother if it doesnt spell cat what does it spell with a grin mel kissed him right on the chocolatesmeared mouth this time it spells thanks thanks a lot mel was practically singing when she walked back into sutherland investigations she had something maybe it was only half of a license plate and maybe the information had come from a sixyearold but she had something she switched her answering machine to playback then nipped into the kitchen for a soft drink her selfsatisfied smile remained as she jotted down the messages good solid investigative work she told herself that was the way you got things done persistence didnt hurt she didnt imagine the police had managed to get anywhere near billy odell or that they would have considered him a viable witness solid investigative work persistence and hunches mel believed in hunches just as she believed they were part of an investigators makeup but that was a far cry from psychic visions her smile tilted toward a smirk as she thought of sebastian maybe he had gotten lucky with the sketch and the car but maybe it was just as shed thought before a connection on the force could have given him that data she wouldnt mind rubbing his nose in this new information not that he was all bad she thought feeling charitable hed been okay when theyd shared a burger the evening before no more comeons which shed been positive she would have nipped in the bud and he hadnt gotten spooky on her either actually she remembered theyd talked mostly books and movies those old conversational standbys but he had been interesting when he wasnt irritating her his voice was rather pleasant with that whisper of a brogue a brogue that had deepened when hed murmured to her his lips sliding over hers annoyed she shook herself she wasnt going to think about that shed been kissed before and she wasnt against the practice she simply preferred to choose her own time and place and if she hadnt had a reaction quite like that before it was because hed taken her so completely by surprise that wouldnt happen again either in fact the way things were going she wasnt going to need sebastian donovan and his hocuspocus any longer she had a few contacts at the department of motor vehicles and once she called in with the partial plate she would her thoughts trailed off as sebastians voice flowed out of her answering machine ah sutherland sorry i missed you out sleuthing i suppose she made a face at the machine an immature reaction she readily admitted but the laughter in his voice demanded it i thought you might be interested in some new information ive been working on the car the left rear tires nearly bald which could give our man a great deal of trouble since his spare is flat give me a break donovan she muttered she rose deciding to turn off the machine and the voice oh by the way the car has california plates kat mels mouth fell open as her finger hesitated on the button i thought you might be able to work your detective magic with that tidbit let me know what you come up with wont you love ill be home this evening good hunting mary ellen son of a she gritted her teeth and switched the machine off she didnt like it she didnt like it one damn bit but she downshifted and started up the narrow bumpy lane to sebastians house not for a minute did she believe hed dreamed the plate number or whatever term he would use but since hed given her the tip she felt obliged to do a followup when she reached the top of his lane she was torn between elation at the progress shed made and irritation at having to deal with him again shed be professional she promised herself as she pulled between a muscularlooking harley and a latemodel minivan after climbing the steps she gave a brisk knock on the door the knocker she used was a brass figure of a snarling wolf intrigued mel played with it for a moment while she waited when there was no response mel did what came naturally she peeked in the windows she saw no one only the lofty living room on one side and a very impressive library on the other if her conscience had allowed she would have turned away and gone home but to do so would be both cowardly and petty instead she went back down the steps and started around the house mel spotted him standing inside a paddock his arm intimately around a slim blonde in snug jeans they were laughing and the sound they made together was as intimate as their stance the quick bolt of heat baffled her she didnt give a hang if he had a lady she didnt care if he had a bloody harem this was business but the fact that he would kiss a woman senseless one day and be snuggled up to another the next told mel just what kind of a man sebastian donovan was a creep despite it she would be professional digging her hands into her pockets she strode across the lawn toward the weathered fence hey donovan they both turned man and woman mel could see that the female was not only slim and blond but lovely too absolutely lovely with calm gray eyes and a soft full mouth that was already curved in a half smile mel felt like a big mongrel dog faced with a glossy purebred as she scowled mel saw him murmur something to the woman kiss her smooth temple then come over to lean against the fence how you doing sutherland i got your message i assumed you did ana this is mel sutherland a private investigator mel anastasia donovan my cousin its nice to meet you ana held out a hand as mel approached the fence sebastians told me about the case youre working on i hope you find the child quickly thanks mel accepted the hand there was something so soothing about the voice about the touch that she felt half of her tension dissolve im making some progress the boys parents must be frantic theyre scared but theyre holding up im sure it helps them having someone who cares so much trying to help anastasia stepped back wishing she could do something to help but like sebastian she had learned she couldnt be all things to all people im sure you have business she continued i dont want to interrupt mel flicked a glance at sebastian then looked over his shoulder to where the horses stood the quick pleasure showed in her face before she looked away again i only need a minute no take your time graceful as a doe ana vaulted over the fence i was just leaving will you make the movies tomorrow night sebastian whose turn is it its morganas she said she felt like murder so were going to see a thriller ill meet you he leaned over the fence to give her another kiss thanks for the tansy my pleasure welcome home nice to meet you mel yeah nice to meet you mel pushed her hair out of her eyes and watched anastasia cross the lawn yes she is lovely isnt she sebastian said lightly and as lovely inside as out you seemed pretty close for cousins his lips curved yes we are ana morgana and i spent a great deal of our childhood together here and in ireland and of course when you have something in common something that separates you from whats termed the norm you tend to stick together lifting a brow mel turned back to him you want me to believe shes psychic too not precisely ana has a different talent he reached out to brush at mels bangs himself but you didnt come here to talk about my family no she shifted slightly just out of reach and tried to decide on the least humiliating way to thank him i checked out the plate i already had half of it myself when i got the message oh i turned up a witness no way was she going to admit how hard shed worked to come up with those three little letters so anyway i called my contact at the dmv had it checked out and and the cars registered to a james t parkland the address is in jamesburg propping one booted foot on a low rail she leaned on the fence while the breeze ruffled her hair she liked the smell of horses just watching them relaxed her i took a ride down there hed skipped landlady was pretty talkative since hed ducked two months rent the mare walked over to the fence and bumped mels shoulder automatically she lifted a hand to stroke down the smooth white cheek i got an earful on jimmy he was the kind of guy who just invited trouble not a badlooking boy and i quote but always had his pockets turned out always seemed to scrape up enough for a sixpack though the landlady claims to have taken a motherly interest in him but i have a hunch it wasnt quite so platonic otherwise she wouldnt be so steamed two months rent sebastian reminded her watching the way mels hand rubbed over the horse uhuh this was personal she had that bitter tone a woman gets when shes been dumped sebastian tilted his head trusting mels intuition which made her more talkative to a sympathetic ear you bet she said he liked to gamble mostly on sports but any game would do hed gotten in pretty deep over the last few months started having visitors she flicked sebastian a glance the kind who have broken noses and lumps under their suit coats where their guns ruin the line he tried to hit her for some quick cash but she claimed she was tapped out then he said how he had a line on how to get himself out of it once and for all last few days he was there he was real nervous jumpy hyped up then he split the last time she saw him was a week before davids kidnapping an interesting story it gives me something to work with i figured youd want to know whats the next step well it hurts but i turned over what i had to the local cops the more people we have looking for old jimmy the better sebastian ran a hand over psyches flank hes about as far away from monterey as you can get and still stay in the country yeah i figure hes i dont figure sebastian turned those compelling eyes of his on her i know hes traveling in new england too nervous to settle yet look donovan when you searched his room did you notice that the second drawer down on his dresser had a loose pull she had but she said nothing im not playing parlor games with you mel sebastian said impatiently i want to get that boy back and quickly rose is losing hope once she loses it completely she may very well do something drastic instant fear it gripped mel by the throat with vicious fingers what do you mean you know what i mean use what influence you have see that the vermont and new hampshire police look for him hes driving a toyota now red the plates are the same she wanted to dismiss it but she couldnt im going to go see rose before she could back away from the fence sebastian laid a hand over hers i called rose a couple of hours ago shell be all right for a while longer i told you i didnt want you to feed her any of this business you work your way ill work mine his hand tightened on mels she needed something a little something to hold on to to get her through another night when she goes in and looks at an empty crib i gave it to her she felt something from him something so akin to her own fear and frustration that she relented all right maybe it was the thing to do i cant secondguess you there but if youre right about parkland being in new england you wont get first shot at him sebastian smiled relaxed now and that just burns the hell right out of you you hit that one dead on she hesitated then let out a long breath and decided to tell it all i got hold of an associate in georgia you have farreaching connections sutherland i spent about twenty years knocking around the country anyway theres a lawyer there and he put me on to an investigator he trusts as a professional courtesy hes going to do some checking does that mean youre accepting the fact that davids in georgia it means im not taking any chances if i was sure id go myself when you are and when you do ill go with you right and there would be reports of frost in hell there was nothing else she could do tonight mel thought but she had a good beginning which was more she was forced to admit than shed had before sebastian had come along is this head business of yours this esp like what they study at columbia places like that he had to smile it was simply her nature to try to logic out the intangible no not quite what youre referring to is that added sense most people have to some extent and usually chose to ignore those little flashes of insight premonition deja vu what i am is both less and more she wanted something more tangible more logical but she doubted shed get it seems pretty weird to me people are often frightened by what they consider weird there have been times throughout history when people have been frightened enough to hang or burn or drown those who seemed different he studied her carefully his hand still over hers on the rail but you arent frightened are you of you her laugh was quick no im not scared of you donovan you may be before its done he said half to himself but i often feel its best to live in the present no matter what you know about tomorrow mel flexed her fingers nearly gasping at a sudden flash of heat that seemed to jump from his palm into her hand his face remained calm you like horses what uneasy she pulled her hand free yeah sure whats not to like do you ride she moved her shoulders the heat was gone but her hand felt as though shed held it too close to a candle flame ive been on one before not in the last few years though sebastian said nothing but the stallions head came up as if hed heard a signal he trotted over to the fence pawing the ground this one looks like hes got a temper but even as she said it mel was laughing and reaching out to touch you know youre beautiful dont you he can be a handful sebastian commented but he can also be gentle if he chooses psychell be foaling in a few weeks so she cant be ridden but if youd like you can take a turn on eros sometime maybe she dropped her hand before the temptation to take him up on it here and now proved too much to resist id better get going he nodded before the temptation to ask her to stay to stay with him proved too much to resist tracking down parkland that quickly was good work she was surprised enough to flush a little at the compliment it was routine if i can trace the route to david thatll be good work well start in the desert and soon he thought very soon sutherland how about the movies she blinked excuse me i said how about the movies he shifted his body toward hers only the slightest bit mel couldnt have said why the movement seemed so much like a threat or why the threat seemed so exciting tomorrow night he continued my cousins and i are going i think you might find my family interesting im not much on socializing this would be worth your while he vaulted the fence as gracefully as ana had but this time mel didnt think of a deer she thought of a wolf now without the fence between them the threat and the excitement ripened a couple of hours of entertainment to clear your mind afterward i think you and i might have somewhere to go if youre going to talk in riddles we wont get anywhere trust me on this he cupped a hand on her cheek his fingers lay there as lightly as butterfly wings but she found it impossible to brush them away an evening with the donovans will be good for both of us she knew her voice would be breathless before she spoke and she damned him for it he only had his hand on her face ive pretty well decided nothing about you could be good for me he smiled then thinking how flattering the evening light was to her skin how caution added an odd attraction to her eyes its a invitation to the movies mel not a proposition at least not precisely like the one you dodged this morning from the lonely man on the third floor of roses building wary she stepped back it could have been a good guess a remarkably good one how did you know about that ill pick you up in time for the nineoclock show maybe ill explain it to you he held up a hand before she could refuse you said you werent afraid of me sutherland prove it it was a perfect ploy she understood that they both knew it i pay my own way this isnt a date no indeed okay then tomorrow night she took a backward step then turned it was easier to think she realized when she wasnt facing him or staring into those patient amused eyes see you yes he murmured you certainly will as he watched her walk away his smile slowly faded no it wasnt a date he doubted there would be anything as simple as a date in their relationship and though he was far from comfortable with the idea he already knew they would have a relationship when hed had his hand over mels just before she yanked it away from that sudden flare of heat hed seen he hadnt looked not voluntarily but hed seen the two of them in the last rosy light of dusk her skin like ripe peaches under his hands fear in her eyes fear and something stronger than fear through the open windows the first stirrings of the night creatures those secret songs of the dark and hed seen where they had been where they would be however each of them tried to refuse it frowning sebastian turned his head and looked up to the wide window glinting now in the lowering sunlight beyond the window was the bed where he slept where he dreamed the bed he would share with mel before the summer was over chapter contents prev next mel had plenty to keep her occupied throughout the day there was the mopping up of a missingpersons case the groundwork for a possible insurance fraud for underwriters and the little boy who had stopped by to hire her to find his lost dog shed agreed to take the case of the missing pooch for a retainer of two dollars and seven cents mostly pennies it did her heart good to see the boy go off assured the matter was in professional hands she ate what passed for dinner at her desk munching on potato chips and a fat dill pickle she made followup calls to the local police and to the authorities in vermont and new hampshire she touched base with her counterpart in georgia and hung up dissatisfied everybody was looking for james t parkland everybody was looking for david merrick and nobody was finding them after a check of her watch she called the local pound with a description of the missing mutt and her young clients name and phone number too restless to stay inside she took the polaroid snapshot the boy had given her of his canine best friend and made the rounds three hours later she located kong an aptly named mixed breed of astonishing proportions snoozing in the storeroom of a shop on fishermans wharf using a length of twine donated by the shopkeeper mel managed to lead kong to her car and stuff him into the passenger seat worried that the dog might leap out during the drive back to her office mel strapped him in with the seat belt and had her face bathed with a big wet tongue lot of nerve youve got she muttered as she climbed in beside him dont you think i figured out you went awol to cruise chicks that kid of yours is worried sick about you and where do i find you cozied up in a shell shop with pastrami on your breath rather than appearing chastised the dog seemed to grin his tongue lolling out of the corner of his mouth his head lifted to the wind as mel maneuvered through the parking lot dont you know the meaning of loyalty she asked him kong shifted his bulky body laid his massive head on her shoulder and moaned sure sure i know your kind buster love the one youre with well you can forget about me im on to you but she lifted a hand from the gearshift to scratch his ears sebastian was just parking his motorcycle when mel pulled up in front of her office he took one look at her and at the hundred and fifty pounds of muscle and fur riding beside her in the tiny car and grinned just like a woman here i think were going out and youve picked yourself up another date hes more my type she fingercombed her hair away from her face used her arm to wipe the dog kisses off her cheek then located the end of the twine what are you doing here anyway oh she said before he could answer movies right i forgot you sure know how to flatter a man sutherland he moved out of her way when she unbuckled the dogs seat belt nice dog i guess come on kong rides over she tugged and pulled but the dog merely sat there panting and grinning and she noted shedding dusty yellow hairs on her seat enjoying the performance sebastian leaned on the hood of her car ever consider obedience school reform school she muttered but hes not mine mel gritted her teeth and put her back into it belongs to a client damn it kong get your butt out as if hed merely been waiting for her to ask the dog responded by jumping out ramming mel back into sebastian he caught her neatly around the waist as she lost her footing while she worked on getting her breath back mel scowled at the dog who now sat placidly on the sidewalk youre a real jerk you know that she said to kong as if he agreed wholeheartedly the dog went through his repertoire of tricks lying down rolling over then sitting up again with one paw lifted to shake she laughed before she realized her back was still nestled against sebastians chest his very hard chest automatically she brought her hands down to his and pried them off let go sebastian ran his hands up her arms once before she managed to break away you sure are touchy sutherland she tossed her head depends on whos doing the touching wanting to wait until her heartbeat leveled she swiped halfheartedly at the dog hairs clinging to her jeans look do me a favor and stay out here with furface while i make a call theres a kid who for reasons that escape me actually wants this mutt back go ahead sebastian crouched down and ran his elegant hands over the dusty fur only minutes after mel came back out a young boy rushed down the sidewalk a red leash trailing behind him oh wow kong oh wow in response the dog leapt to his feet barking happily he rushed the boy like a fullback blocking a tight end they went down on the sidewalk in a delighted rolling heap with one arm hooked over kongs massive neck the boy grinned up at mel gee lady you sure are a real detective and all just like on tv thanks thanks a lot you did real good thanks mel held out a hand to accept the boys formal handshake do i owe you anymore no were square you ought to get him one of those tags with his name and your phone number on it in case he decides to hit the road again okay yeah okay he hooked the red leash onto kings collar wait till mom sees come on kong lets go home they went off at a dash the dog pulling the boy behind him thanks he called out again and his laughter echoed on the evening air hes right sebastian murmured not bothering to resist the urge to run his fingers through her hair you did good she shrugged wishing she werent so moved by the tone of his voice by the touch of his hand i earn my keep i bet you made a bundle on that one laughing a little she turned her head hey i made two dollars and seven cents that ought to buy me some popcorn at the flicks he cut off her laughter by touching his lips to hers it wasnt a kiss really she thought it was friendlier what did you do that for just one of those things sebastian straddled his bike then tossed her a helmet climb on sutherland i hate to be late for the movies all in all it wasnt a bad way to unwind mel had always enjoyed the movies they had been one of her favorite recreations as a child it didnt matter if you were the new kid in school once the lights went out and the screen flickered into life movie theaters were comfortingly familiar anywhere in the country the smell of popcorn and candy the sticky floors the shufflings people made as they settled down to watch whatever movie was playing in el paso was probably entertaining patrons in tallahassee too mel had been drawn back to them time and time again during her mothers wanderings stealing a couple of hours a week where it didnt matter where she was or who she was she felt the same sense of anonymity here with the moody music and shadowy suspense on the screen a killer was stalking the streets and mel along with the other viewers was content to sit back and watch the ancient duel of good against evil she sat between sebastian and his cousin morgana his gorgeous cousin morgana mel had noted shed heard the rumors about morgana donovan kirkland the rumors that whispered she was a witch mel had found them laughable and only found them more so now morgana was anything but a cackling crone ready to jump on board a broomstick still she imagined the rumors added to the business morgana pulled in at her shop on the other side of morgana was her husband nash mel knew he was a successful and highly respected screenwriter one who specialized in horror scripts his work had certainly scared a few muffled screams from mel and made her laugh at herself nash kirkland didnt seem the hollywood type to her he struck her as open and easygoing and very much in love with his wife they held hands during the movies but not with the sloppy sort of mush that would have made mel uncomfortable instead there was a quiet steady bond of affection in the gesture that she envied on the other side of sebastian was anastasia mel wondered why a woman as hauntingly lovely as ana didnt have a date then she reminded herself that such a thought was sexist and stupid not every woman herself included found it necessary to go everywhere hanging on to the arm of a man mel dug into her popcorn and settled into the movie you going to eat all that hmm distracted she turned her head then jerked it back quickly shed practically been liptolip with sebastian what you going to share or what she stared a moment wasnt it odd how his eyes seemed to glow in the dark when he tapped a finger on the box of popcorn in her lap she blinked oh yeah help yourself he did enjoying her reaction to him every bit as much as the buttery popcorn she smelledfresh sebastian kept part of his mind on the twists and turns of the plot and let the rest wander at will he found it pleasant to be able to scent her soapandwater skin over the aromas of the theater if he let himself he could hear her pulse beating steady very steady and strong and then a quick jerk and flutter when the action heated up onscreen what would her pulse do if he touched her now if he were to shift his body and take that wide unpainted mouth with his own he thought he knew he thought he could wait and see but he couldnt quite resist a gentle poke into her own thoughts idiot if she knows somebodys after her why is she bopping down the street in the dark how come they always have to make women either dumb or helpless there she goes running into the park oh sure it makes perfect sense to haul her butt into the bushes where he can slit her throat ten to one she trips yep oh well that one deserves to get iced she crunched on more popcorn and sebastian heard her wish absently that shed added more salt her thoughts stuttered to a halt then tangled into confusion what he was reading in her head he could see on her face she sensed him she didnt understand what it was but she sensed an intrusion and was instinctively blocking it the fact that she did the fact that she could intrigued him it was very rare for anyone outside his family to feel his scannings there was some power here he mused untapped and certainly denied he toyed with the idea of pushing a little deeper beside him ana stirred dont be rude sebastian she said gently relenting reluctantly he gave himself over to the movie he reached for some popcorn and his fingers brushed mels she flinched he grinned pizza morgana said when they stepped outside with the works nash ran a hand down her hair i thought you said you wanted mexican she smiled patting her belly we changed our minds pizza ana agreed no anchovies she smiled at mel how about it mel felt herself linked in this ring of good fellowship sure that sounds we cant sebastian interrupted laying a hand on her shoulder curious morgana pursed her lips ive never known you to turn down food darling she shot a quick humorous look at mel cousin sebastian has outrageous appetites youd be amazed mels much too practicalminded to be amazed sebastian said coolly what astonishes she merely dismisses hes only baiting you ana gave sebastian a quick dig in the ribs weve seen so little of you lately cant you spare another hour sebastian not tonight well i can mel began ill see the lady home nash winked at mel i dont have any problem taking on three beautiful women alone youre such a generous man darling morgana patted her husbands cheek but i think sebastian has other plans for his lady im not his exactly he tightened his grip on mels shoulder well do it next time he kissed both of his cousins blessed be and he propelled mel down the sidewalk toward his bike listen donovan we said this wasnt a date and maybe id have liked to go along with them im hungry he unsnapped a helmet then dropped it on her head ill feed you eventually im not a horse mel muttered fastening the helmet i can feed myself pouting only a little she glanced over her shoulder at the retreating trio as she climbed behind sebastian onto the bike it wasnt all that often that she went out with a group and particularly a group she felt so comfortable with but if she was annoyed with sebastian for breaking it up early she had to be grateful to him for including her in the first place dont sulk i never sulk she rested her hands lightly on his hips for balance as he drove away from the curb she enjoyed the feeling of the bike the freedom of it and the risk perhaps when her cash flow was a little more fluid shed look into getting one for herself of course it would be more practical to have her car painted and tuned first also there was that leak in the bathroom that needed to be dealt with and she really wanted some new surveillance equipment the hightech stuff cost the earth but she might be able to swing it in another year or so the way things were going her books ended nearly every month in the black breaking up that burglary ring and saving underwriters a hefty chunk in claims might just shake a bonus loose she let her mind drift in that direction her body automatically leaning with sebastians in the curves mel wasnt aware that her hands had slid more truly around his waist but sebastian was she liked the sensation of the wind in her face on her skin and though she wasnt proud of it she enjoyed the way her body fit snug to his with the bike vibrating seductively beneath them he had a very interesting body it was difficult not to notice mel thought since they were sharing such a small space his back was muscled beneath the buttersmooth leather jacket his shoulders were quite wide or maybe they only seemed so because his hips were lean and narrow there were muscles in his arms as well not that she was overly impressed with that sort of thing she reminded herself it was just that it surprised her that someone in his line of work so to speak was so well built more like a tennis player than an oracle then again she supposed he had plenty of time for working out or riding his horses or whatever form of exercise he preferred between visions she began to wonder what it might be like to own her own horse it wasnt until she realized he was swinging onto the eastbound ramp of that she came to attention hey she rapped her fingers on his helmet hey daniel boone the trails back that way he heard her clearly enough but shook his head what did you say something yeah i said something but she did precisely as hed hoped she would she wiggled closer on the seat and leaned against him he felt every curve i said youre going the wrong way my place is back there about ten miles back there i know where you live she huffed and kept her voice lifted over the purr of the engine then what are we doing out here nice night for a drive yeah maybe it was but nobody had asked her i dont want to go for a drive youll want to go on this one oh yeah well where are we going sebastian zipped around a sedan and punched it up to sixty utah it was a good ten miles before mel managed to close her mouth three oclock in the morning in the ghastly light of the parking lot of a combination convenience store and gas station mels bottom felt as though it had been shot full of novocaine but her mind wasnt numb she might have been tired cranky and sore after riding on the back of a bike for four hours but her mind was functioning just fine right now she was using it to develop ways of murdering sebastian donovan and making it the perfect crime it was a damn shame she hadnt brought her gun then she could just shoot him clean and quick on some of the roads theyd been traveling she could dump the body into a gully where it might not be found for weeks possibly years still it would be more satisfying to beat him to death he had her by a few inches and maybe fifty pounds but she thought she could take him then she could ditch the bike hop a bus and be back in her office bright and early the next morning mel stretched her legs by pacing the parking lot occasionally a semi rattled by using the back roads to avoid weighing stations apart from that it was dark and quiet once she heard something mat sounded suspiciously like a coyote but she dismissed it even out here in the boonies she assured herself people had dogs oh hed been clever she thought now kicking an empty soda can out of her way he hadnt stopped the bike until theyd been past fresno not exactly walking distance back to monterey and when shed hopped off punched him and let loose with a string of curses that should have turned his ears blue hed simply waited her out waited her out and then gone on to explain that hed wanted to follow james t parklands trail hed needed to see the motel where david had stayed with the first woman hed been passed to as if there were a motel mel kicked the hapless can again did he really expect her to believe they would drive up to some dumb motel with a dinosaur out front right so here she was tired hungry and numb from the waist down stuck on some back road with a crazy psychic she was two hundred and fifty miles from home and she had eleven dollars and eightysix cents on her person sutherland mel whirled and caught the candy bar he tossed her she would have cursed him then but she had to snag the soft drink can that came looping after it look donovan since he was busy with the gas pump she stalked over ripping the wrapper off the candy bar as she went ive got a business to run i have clients i cant be running around half the night with you chasing wild geese you ever done any camping what no ive done some up in the sierra nevadas not far from here very peaceful if you dont turn this bike around and take me back youre going to have an eternity of peace starting now when he looked at her really looked she saw that he didnt appear tired at all oh no rather than suffering from four hours of traveling he looked as if hed just spent a week at some exclusive spa under the relaxation the calm was a drumming excitement that took hold of her pulse and set it hopping resenting every minute of it mel took a healthy bite of chocolate youre crazy certifiable we cant go to utah do you know how far it is to utah he realized the temperature had dropped considerably sebastian peeled off his jacket and handed it to her to the place we want from monterey about five hundred miles he clicked off the pump replaced the nozzle cheer up sutherland were more than halfway there she gave up there must be a bus depot around here she muttered tugging on his jacket as she headed toward the harshly lit store this is where he stopped off with david sebastian spoke quietly and she stopped in her tracks where they made the first switch he didnt make the kind of time we did what with traffic nerves and watching the rearview mirror for cops the meet was set for eight this is bull mel said but her throat was tight the night man recognized him from the sketch he noticed him because jimmy parked all the way across the lot even though there were spaces just out front and he was nervous so the night man kept an eye on him thinking he might try to shoplift but jimmy paid mel watched sebastian carefully as he spoke when he was finished she held out a hand give me the sketch with his eyes on hers sebastian reached in the top pocket of the jacket through the lining his hand brushed lightly over her breast lingering for a heartbeat before he lifted the folded sketch out she knew she was breathing too fast she knew she was feeling more than that brief meaningless contact warranted to compensate she snatched the paper out of his hand and strode toward the store as she went inside to verify what he had just told her sebastian secured his gas cap and rolled the bike away from the pumps it took her less than five minutes she was pale when she returned her eyes burning dark in her face but her hand was steady when she tucked the sketch away again she didnt want to think not yet sometimes it was better to act all right she told him lets go she didnt doze that could be suicide on a bike but she did find her mind wandering with old images passing over new it was all so familiar this middleofthenight traveling never being quite sure where you were going or what you would do when you got there her mother had always been so happy driving down nameless roads with the radio blaring mel could remember the comfort of stretching out on the front seat her head in her mothers lap and the simplicity of trusting that somehow they would find a home again heavy with fatigue her head dropped to sebastians back she jerked up forcing her eyes wide want to stop for a while he called to her take a break no keep going toward dawn he did stop refueling himself with coffee mel opted for a caffeineladen soft drink and wolfed down a sugarspiked pastry i feel i owe you a decent meal sebastian commented while they took a fiveminute breather somewhere near devils playground this is my idea of a decent meal content she licked sugar and frosting off her fingers you can keep the pheasant under glass her eyes were shadowed he was sorry for that but hed acted on instinct an instinct hed known was right when he slipped an arm around her she stiffened but only for a moment perhaps she recognized that the gesture was one of friendly support and nothing more well be there soon he told her another hour she nodded she had no choice but to trust him now to trust him and the feeling inside her what mel would have called a gut hunch i just want to know its worth it that its going to make a difference well have that answer too i hope so i hope the answers yes she turned her face into him her lips brushing over his throat there was a flare of warmth of flavor before her gritty eyes widened im sorry im punchy she would have moved away far away but his arm merely tightened around her relax mel look suns coming up they watched the dawn bloom together his arm around her and her head resting lightly against his shoulder over the desert the colors rose up from the horizon bleeding into the sky and tinting the lowhanging clouds dull sand blushed pink then deepened to rose before it slowly became gilded in another hour the baking sun would leech the color out of the landscape but for now for just this single hushed moment it was as lovely as any painting she felt something here watching this ageless transition with his arm around her a communion the first gentle fingers of a bond that needed no words for understanding this time when he kissed her his mouth soft and seeking she didnt resist and she didnt question the moment itself justified it she was too tired to fight whatever was growing inside her she was too dazed by the magic of dawn over the desert to refuse what he asked of her he wanted to ask for more knew that at this moment in this place he could ask but he could sense her fatigue her confusion and her nagging fears for a friends child so he kept kiss easy a comfort to both of them when he released her understood that what they had begun would not be broken without a word they mounted the bike again and headed east toward the sun in southern utah not far from the arizona border and near enough to vegas for an easy trip to lose a paycheck was a hot little huddle of storefronts the town such as it was had a gas station a tiny cafe that offered corn tortillas and a twentyfive unit motel with a plaster brontosaurus in the center of the gravel lot oh mel whispered as she stared at the sadly chipped dinosaur oh sweet lord as she eased off the bike her legs were trembling from more than travel fatigue lets go see if anyones awake sebastian took her arm to pull her toward the checkin desk you did see it didnt you it seems that way doesnt it when she swayed he wrapped a supporting arm around her waist odd that she would suddenly seem so fragile well get you a bed while were at it im all right shed go into shock later mel promised herself right now she needed to keep moving together they walked through the door and into the fancooled lobby sebastian rang the bell on the desk moments later they heard the shuffle of slippered feet behind a faded flowered curtain a man in a white athletic shirt and baggy jeans wandered out his eyes puffy with sleep his face unshaven help you yes sebastian reached for his wallet we need a room unit he laid down crisp green cash happens its empty the clerk reached for a key from the pegboard behind him twentyeight a night cafe down the road there serves breakfast twentyfour hours you want to sign here after he had sebastian laid another twenty on the counter with davids picture on top of it have you see this boy it would have been three months ago the clerk looked longingly at the twenty davids picture might have been a sheet of glass cant remember everybody comes through he was with a woman attractive early thirties a redhead driving a midsize chevy maybe they was through i mind my business and nobody elses mel nudged sebastian aside you look like a pretty sharp guy to me id think if a goodlooking lady like that came through here with a cute little baby youd notice maybe youd tell her where she could buy spare diapers or get fresh milk he shrugged his shoulders and scratched i dont look into anybody elses trouble youll look to your own though mels voice had toughened enough for the clerk to look up warily now when agent donovan i mean mr donovan the clerks eyes widened when he asked you if youd seen that little boy i think you were going to think it over werent you the clerk licked his lips you cops fbi or something mel only smiled well say or something and keep everything mellow i run a quiet place here i can see that thats why i know if that woman stopped off here with the kid youd remember i dont guess you get all that much traffic look she only spent one night she paid cash in advance kept the kid pretty quiet through the night and went on her way first thing in the morning mel fought back the ragged edge of hope and kept her voice cool give me a name pal hells bells howm i supposed to remember names you keep records mel put a fingertip on the twenty and inched it across the counter records of registered guests and any phone calls they might make from their rooms why dont you dig it up for us my partner might even give you a bonus muttering oaths the clerk pulled a cardboard box from behind the desk got phone records here you can look through the register yourself mel reached for the registration book then put her hands behind her back and let sebastian do it she was ready to admit hed find what they were looking for quicker than she would sebastian homed in on the name susan white i dont suppose she showed you any id paid cash the clerk mumbled jeezie peezie you expect me to frisk her or something one longdistance call he announced went through the operator mel dug in her purse for her notepad date and time she scribbled them down now listen friend and this is the bonus question no jive would you state under oath that this child and look carefully she held up davids picture this child was brought into this motel last may the clerk shifted uncomfortably if i had to i would i dont want to go to court or nothing but she brought him i remember he had that dimple there and that funny reddish hair good job she wasnt going to cry oh no she wasnt but she walked outside while sebastian replaced the photo and passed the clerk another twenty okay he asked when he joined her sure fine i need to see the room mel you can wait out here if you want no lets go she didnt speak again not when they walked down the broken sidewalk not when he unlocked the door and stepped inside its stuffy walls she sat on the bed clearing her mind while sebastian used his for what he did best he could see the baby sleeping on a pallet on the floor whimpering a bit in his confusing dreams shed left the light on in the bathroom so that she could see easily if the child woke and began to cry shed watched a little television made her call but her name wasnt susan white shed used so many over the years that it was difficult for sebastian to pick up on the true one he thought it was linda but it wasnt linda now and it wasnt susan either and it hadnt been more than a few weeks before that when she had transported still another baby he would have to tell mel about that once shed rested when he sat on the bed beside her put a hand on her shoulder she continued to stare straight ahead i dont want to know right now how you did it i might sometime but not now okay okay she had him here in this room yes and he isnt hurt no mel wet her lips where did she take him texas but she doesnt know where he was taken from there shes only one leg of the trip mel took two deep careful breaths georgia are you sure its georgia yes her hands fisted on her lap where do you know where he was tired more tired than he wanted to admit and it would drain him even more to look now but she needed him to not in here he thought there was too much interference in here too many sad stories in this sad little room i have to go outside leave me alone for a minute she just nodded and he left her time passed and she was relieved to find that the need to cry went with it mel didnt see tears as weak particularly she saw them as useless so her eyes were dry when sebastian came back into the room she thought he looked pale and suddenly tired odd that she hadnt noticed the fatigue around his eyes a few moments ago then again she reminded herself she hadnt been looking at him very carefully she did so now and because she did she felt compelled to rise and go to him perhaps the lack of roots and family had made her a person wary of outward displays of affection shed never been a toucher but she reached out now taking both his hands in hers you look like you need the bed more than i do why dont you sack out for an hour then well figure out what to do next he didnt answer only turned her hands over and stared at her palms would she believe how many things he could see there tough shells arent necessarily thick ones he said quietly lifting his gaze to hers youve got a soft center mel its very attractive then he did something that left her both shaken and speechless he lifted her hands to his lips no one had ever done that before and she discovered that what shed assumed was a silly affectation was both moving and seductive hes in a place called forest park a suburb a little south of atlanta her fingers tightened on his then relaxed if she had never taken anything in her life on faith before she would take this stretch out on the bed her voice was brisk her hands firm as she nudged him over to it im going to call the fbi and the nearest airport chapter contents prev next she slept like a stone sebastian sipped a little more wine kicked back in his chair and watched mel she was stretched out on the sofa across from him in the main cabin of his private plane she hadnt argued when hed suggested having his pilot fly to utah to pick them up for the trip east shed simply nodded distractedly and continued to scribble notes on her everpresent pad the moment theyd hit cruising height shed ranged her long body out on the couch closed her eyes and gone under as quickly and easily as an exhausted infant he understood that energy like any power had to be recharged and hed left her alone sebastian had indulged in a long shower and changed into some of the spare clothes he kept aboard the lear while he enjoyed a light lunch he made a few phone calls and waited it was an odd journey to say the least himself and the sleeping woman hurtling away from the sun after a night of racing toward it when it was over there would be broken hearts and mended ones fate always charged a fee and he would have crossed a continent with a woman he found annoying desirable and incomprehensible she stirred murmured something then opened her eyes he watched the cloudy green sharpen and focus as she pushed past the disorientation she stretched once it was a brisk businesslike movement and it was incredibly sexy then rolled herself to a sitting position how much longer her voice was still husky with sleep but he could see the energy pouring back less than an hour good after running a hand through her hair she lifted her head scenting the air do i smell food he had to smile in the galley theres a shower to starboard if you want to wash up thanks she chose the shower first it wasnt easy but she didnt want to act unduly impressed that the man could snap his fingers and call up his own plane a plane fitted out with deep pile carpeting its own cozy bedroom and a galley that made her kitchen at home look like someones closet obviously the psychic business paid well she should have checked his background mel thought now as she wrapped herself in a robe and tiptoed into the bedroom but shed been so sure that she would be able to talk rose out of using him that she hadnt bothered now here she was some thirty thousand feet up with a man she knew much too little about shed remedy that the moment they touched down in monterey again though of course if things went as she hoped there would be no need to once david was back where he belonged her association with sebastian donovan would be over still she might run a background check on him just out of curiosity lips pursed mel poked into his closet he liked silk and cashmere and linen she discovered spotting a denim shirt she yanked it out at least he had something practical and she sure could use some fresh clothes she tugged it on then whipped around to the doorway for a moment she had thought he was there had been sure of it then she realized it was his scent clinging still to the shirt that was now brushing softly against her skin what was that fragrance exactly experimentally she lifted her arm to sniff the sleeve nothing she could quite pinpoint something wild erotic something youd expect to catch just a whiff of in the forest in the dark of the moon annoyed with herself she pulled on her jeans if this kept up shed actually start believing in witches after rolling the sleeves of the borrowed shirt up to her elbows she went to investigate the galley she helped herself to a banana ignored a jar of caviar and tossed some ham and cheese on a piece of bread got any mustard she called out then swallowed a gasp when she felt his body bump against hers hed made no more sound than a ghost he reached over her head for a jar and handed it to her want some wine i guess she slathered mustard on the bread wishing there was a little more room to maneuver away from him in the small space i borrowed a shirt okay sure he poured her wine and topped off his own glass you rested well yeah well it helps the time pass the plane danced in some turbulence his hand came down to steady her and stayed on her arm the pilot said thered be a few bumps testing both of them he rubbed his thumb over the inside of her elbow the pulse there was fast and steady well be starting our descent soon she lifted her face to his studying him she felt what she had felt in the desert the beginning of something mel wondered if shed be less restless if she were able to see the end as well then wed better sit down and strap in ill take your wine with a long breath of relief she picked up her plate and followed him as she dug happily into the sandwich she noticed him smiling at her problem i was just thinking that i really do owe you an actual meal you dont owe me she took a sip of wine and then because it was so different so delightfully different from what she was used to she sipped again i like paying my own way ive noticed mel tilted her head some guys are intimidated by that really a smile played around his lips im not still after were finished maybe youd agree to dinner a celebration of a job well done maybe she said over a mouthful of sandwich we can flip to see who buys lord you are charming he chuckled and stretched out his legs pleased shed chosen the seat facing him rather than the one beside him now he could look his fill when she was awake why private investigations hmmm his lips curved again its time i asked dont you think what made you choose your profession i like to figure things out she moved her shoulders and started to rise to take her empty plate away but he stood up and took it into the galley himself its that simple i believe in the rules the seats were roomy so she tucked her legs up and crossed them she was comfortable she realized refreshed from the nap and from a surge of hope that had yet to fade easy in his company well she supposed anything was possible and i think when you break the rules somebody should make you pay for it she felt the subtle shift and change in the cabin as the plane began its descent into atlanta i also like to figure things out by myself thats why i only made a pretty good cop but i make a really good pi so youre not a team player nope she cocked her head are you no he smiled into his wine i suppose not then abruptly his eyes were intense again focused on her into her she thought but rules often change mel the lines between right and wrong sometimes blur when that happens how do you choose by knowing what things shouldnt change what lines cant be blurred or crossed you just feel it yeah with that sudden flash of power banked again he nodded you just feel it it has nothing to do with being psychic she thought she understood just where he was leading her she wasnt ready to give him quite that much rope i dont go in for visions second sight or whatever you call it he lifted his glass in toast but youre here arent you her eyes remained level if he expected her to squirm hed be disappointed yeah im here donovan im here because i wont risk not following up any lead no matter how slim or how weird he continued smiling and and because maybe im willing to consider that you might have seen or felt something or maybe you just had a good gut hunch i believe in hunches so do i mel the plane bumped down on the runaway so do i it was always difficult to turn over the reins to another mel didnt mind cooperating with local authorities or the fbi but she preferred doing it on her own terms for davids sake she had to bite her tongue a dozen times during the interview with federal agent thomas a devereaux i have reports on you mr donovan several in fact from associates of mine who consider you not only trustworthy but something of a wonder mel thought sebastian sat in the small beigetoned office like a king at his court he responded to devereauxs statement with a slight nod ive been involved in a few federal investigations most recently in chicago devereaux said flipping through a file a bad mess up there a pity we couldnt stop it sooner yes it was all sebastian would say not all of those images had faded and you ms sutherland devereaux rubbed his round bald head then poked a finger at the nosepiece of his glasses the local authorities in california seem to find you competent enough i can sleep easy now she ignored sebastians warning glance and leaned forward can we bypass the introductions agent devereaux i have friends back in california who are desperate david merricks only a few miles away thats yet to be determined devereaux set one file aside and picked up another we had all pertinent information faxed in after your call a federal investigator has already interviewed your witness at the dunes motel in utah he pushed his glasses up again he positively identified david merricks picture were working on iding the woman then why are we sitting here devereaux peered over the rims of his glasses which had already slid down his nose again do you expect us to knock on every door in forest park and ask if theyve recently stolen a baby anticipating her he held up a pudgy finger we have data coming in right now on male children between the ages of six and nine months adoption records birth certificates were looking into who has moved into the area with a child within the last three months i have no doubt that by morning well have narrowed it down to a manageable few morning listen devereaux weve just spent the best part of twentyfour hours getting here now youre going to tell us to wait until morning devereaux leveled a look at mel yes if you give us the name of your hotel well contact you with any further developments mel popped out of her chair i know david i can identify him if i did a sweep of the area set up some surveillance devereaux cut her off this is a federal case we may very well want you to identify the boy however we have copies of his prints to substantiate while mel bit her tongue devereaux shifted his gaze from her to sebastian im moving on this under the advice of special agent tucker in chicago who ive known for more than twenty years because he puts some stock in this psychic business and because i have a grandson about davids age im not going to advise the two of you to go back to california and leave this alone we appreciate your help agent devereaux sebastian rose and took mel by the elbow squeezing hard before she could hurl whatever insult was in her mind ive made reservations at the doubletree well wait for your call satisfied devereaux stood and offered a hand i should have spit in it mel grumbled a few moments later when they walked out into the torrid atlanta evening the feebies always treat pis like mongrel dogs hell do his job right she was distracted enough to let him open the door of the car theyd rented at the airport because some pal of his took a shine to you in chicago what did you do up there anyway not enough sebastian shut her door and rounded the hood i dont suppose you feel like a quiet drink in the hotel bar and a leisurely dinner not on your life she snapped her seat belt into place i need a pair of binoculars must be a sporting goods store around here someplace i imagine i could find one a longrange camera she said to herself pushing up the sleeves of her borrowed shirt a federal case she muttered well theres no law that says i cant take a nice drive through the burbs is there i dont believe there is sebastian said as he pulled into traffic perhaps a walk as well nothing quite like a walk in a nice neighborhood on a summer evening she turned her head to beam a smile at him youre all right donovan that kind of flattery will last me a lifetime can you mel bit her lip and swallowed the question as they drove slowly down the treelined streets of forest park can i tell which house sebastian finished for her oh eventually how she cut that thought off as well and lifted the binoculars how does it work he smiled and turned left in what appeared to mel to be an unstudied decision thats a bit complicated to explain perhaps sometime if youre still interested ill try when he pulled over to the curb and stopped she frowned what are you doing they often walk him here after dinner what they like to take him out in the stroller after dinner before his bath before she realized what she meant to do mel reached out put a hand on his cheek to turn his face to hers she blinked once stunned by the flash of power in his eyes how dark they were she thought nearly black when she managed to speak her voice was barely a whisper where is he in the house across the street the one with the blue shutters and the big tree in the front yard he grabbed her wrist before she could reach for the doorhandle no if hes in there im going in and getting him damn it let go of me think because he understood that she would feel long before she would think he pressed her back against the seat with both hands on her shoulders no easy task he thought grimly she might be as slim as a wand but she was strong hellfire mel listen to me hes safe davids safe youll only complicate and confuse things by bursting in there and trying to take him from them her eyes blazed as she strained against him he thought she looked like a goddess ready to fling lightning from her fingertips they stole him no no they didnt they dont know he was stolen they think he was given away or theyve convinced themselves he was because they were desperate for a child havent you ever been desperate enough to take a shortcut to overlook that blurred line and grab what you wanted furious she could only shake her head hes not their child no his voice gentled as did his hold but for three months he has been hes eric to them and they love him very much enough to pretend he was meant to be theirs she struggled to control her breathing how can you ask me to leave him with them only for a little while longer he stroked a hand over her cheek i swear rose will have him back before tomorrow night she swallowed nodded let go of me when he did she picked up the binoculars with unsteady hands you were right to stop me its important to be sure she focused on the wide bay window seeing pastel walls through gauzy curtains she saw a baby swing and a maroon couch with a clutter of toys scattered over it with her lips pressed together mel watched a woman walk into view a trim brunette in walking shorts and a cotton blouse the womans hair swung prettily as she turned her head to laugh at someone out of sight then she held out her arms oh god david mels knuckles whitened on the field glasses as she saw a man pass david to the womans waiting arms behind the filmy curtains she saw davids smile lets take a walk sebastian said quietly but she shook her head i need some pictures hands steady again mel set the glasses aside and took up the camera with its telescopic lens if we cant convince devereaux to move maybe these will patiently she took half a roll waiting when they moved out of view snapping when they walked in front of the window again her chest hurt there was such terrible pressure there that she rubbed the heel of her hand against it lets walk she set the camera down on the floor of the car they may bring him out soon if you try to snatch him im not stupid she told him sharply i wasnt thinking before i know how it needs to be done they got out on opposite sides then rejoined on the sidewalk it might look less conspicuous if you held my hand sebastian held his out to hers she studied it dubiously then shrugged wouldnt hurt i guess you have such a romantic heart sutherland he swung their joined hands up to his lips and kissed her fingers the rude name she called him only made him smile ive always enjoyed neighborhoods like this without ever wanting to live in one tidy lawns a neighbor pruning roses over the fence he inclined his head toward a young boy speeding down the street on a bike kids out playing barbecue smoke and childrens laughter in the air shed always longed for a niche in such a place not wanting to admit it to him or to herself she shrugged crabgrass nosy neighbors spying through the front blinds badtempered dogs as if shed called it up one came barreling across a lawn barking deep in its throat sebastian merely turned his head and stared the dog stumbled to a halt whimpered a little then skulked away with his tail between his legs impressed mel pursed her lips nice trick its a gift sebastian released her hand and put an arm around her shoulders relax he murmured you dont have to worry about him im fine youre tight as a drum here he shifted his hand moving it to the base of her neck when mel felt his fingertips prod gently she tried to shake him off look donovan shhh its another gift he did something even with her wiggling away she felt the tensed muscles of her shoulders go fluid oh she managed better he tucked her under his arm again if i had more time god knows if i had you naked id work all the kinks out he grinned down into her astonished face it seems only fair to let you in on some of my thoughts from time to time and i have been thinking about getting you naked quite a bit flustered mortally afraid she might blush she looked straight ahead well think about something else its hard particularly when you look so fetching in my shirt i dont like flirtations she said under her breath my dear mary ellen theres a world of difference between a flirtation and a direct statement of desire now if i were to tell you what lovely eyes you have how they remind me of the hills in my homeland that would be flirting or if i mentioned that your hair is like the gold in a botticelli painting or that your skin is as soft as the clouds that drift over my mountain some evenings that could be construed as fluting there was an odd distinctly uncomfortable fluttering in her stomach she wanted it to stop if you said any of those things id think youd lost your mind which is exactly why i opted for the direct approach i want you in bed my bed under one of the spreading oaks he stopped turning her into his arms before she could so much as sputter i want to undress you touch you i want to watch you come alive when im inside you he leaned down to catch her lower lip between his teeth and then i want to do it all over again he felt her shudder and turned the nip into a long searching kiss direct enough her hands were against his chest fingers spread she had no idea how theyd gotten there her mouth felt swollen and stung and hungry i think but of course she couldnt think at all and that was the problem her blood was pounding so hard that she wondered people didnt come out of their houses to see what the racket was about youre crazy for wanting you or for saying it for for thinking id be interested in a quick tumble with you i hardly know you he caught her chin with his fingers you know me he kissed her again and i didnt say anything about quick before she could speak again he tensed theyre coming out he said without turning around over his shoulder she could see the door open and the brunette pushing out a stroller lets cross the street you can get a good look as they walk by shed tensed up again sebastian kept an arm around her shoulders as much in warning as in support she could hear the man and woman talking to each other it was the light happy conversation of two young parents with a healthy baby their words were nothing but a blur without thinking she slipped an arm around sebastians waist and held on oh hed grown she felt tears rush stinging to her eyes and willed them back he was moving quickly beyond baby to toddler there were little red hightops on his feet scuffed as if he might have been walking already his hair was longer curling around his round rosy face and his eyes she stopped had to bite back his name he was looking at her as he rolled along in the bright blue stroller looking right at her and there was a smile a smile of recognition in his eyes he squealed held out his arms my boy likes pretty women the man said with a proud grin as they rolled david past rooted to the spot mel watched david crane his neck around the stroller saw his lips move into a pout he let out a wail of protest that had the woman crooning to him he knew me mel whispered he remembered me yes he did its difficult to forget love he caught her as she took a stumbling step forward not now mel well go call devereaux he knew me she found her voice muffled against a cool linen shirt im all right she insisted but she didnt try to break away i know you are he pressed his lips to her temple stroked a hand over her hair and waited for her tremors to pass it was one of the most difficult things shed ever done standing on the sidewalk in front of the house with the blue shutters and the big tree in the yard devereaux and a female agent were inside shed watched them go in through the door opened by the young brunette shed still been in her robe mel remembered and there had been a flicker of fear or perhaps knowledge in her eyes as she bent to retrieve the morning paper she could hear weeping now deep grieving tears her heart wanted to hold rock hard against it but it couldnt when would they come out stuffing her hands in her pockets she paced the sidewalk it had already been too long devereaux had still insisted that they wait until morning and shed had hardly a wink of sleep at the hotel it was well over an hour since theyd gone inside why dont you sit in the car sebastian suggested i couldnt sit they wont let us take him yet devereaux explained the procedure itll take hours to do the blood test and the print checks theyll let me stay with him theyll damn well let me stay with him hes not going to be with strangers she pressed her lips together tell me about them she blurted out please hed expected her to ask and he turned away from the house to look into mels eyes as he told her she was a teacher she resigned when david came to them it was important to her to spend as much time with him as possible her husband is an engineer theyve been married eight years and have been trying to have a child almost since the start theyre good people very loving to each other and with room in their hearts for a family they were easy prey mel he could see in her face the war between compassion and fury between right and wrong im sorry for them she whispered im sorry to know that anyone would exploit that kind of love that kind of need i hate whats been done to everyone involved life isnt always fair life isnt usually fair she corrected she paced some more casting dark desperate looks at the bay window when the door opened she shifted to her toes ready to dash devereaux strode toward her the boy knows you yes i told you he recognized me when he saw me yesterday he nodded hes upset wailing pretty good making himself halfsick what with mr and mrs frost carrying on weve got the woman calming down like i told you well have to take the boy in until we can check the matches and clear up the paperwork might be easier for him if you went in for him drove along with agent barker sure her heart began to pound in her throat donovan ill follow you she went inside fighting to shield her heart and mind from the hopeless weeping beyond a bedroom door she walked down a hallway stepping over a plastic rocking horse and into the nursery where the walls were pale blue and painted with sailboats where the crib by the window held a circus mobile just as hed said she thought as her mouth went dry exactly as hed said then she tossed all that aside and reached down for the crying david oh baby she pressed her face to his drying his cheeks with her own david sweet little david she soothed him brushing his damp hair back from his face grateful the agents back was to her so that he couldnt see her own eyes fill hey big guy she kissed his trembling lips he hiccuped rubbed his eyes with his fists then let out a tired sigh as his head dropped to her shoulder thats my boy lets go home huh lets go home and see mom and dad chapter contents prev next ill never be able to thank you never rose stood looking out her kitchen window in the courtyard beyond her husband and son sat in a patch of sunlight rolling a bright orange ball around just looking at them makes me i know mel slipped an arm around her shoulders as they watched in silence listening to david laugh rose brought her hand up to mels and squeezed tight they look real good out there dont they perfect rose dabbed her eyes with a tissue and sighed just perfect when i think how afraid i was that id never see david again then dont think davids back where he belongs thanks to you and mr donovan rose moved away from the window but her gaze kept going back to it again and again mel wondered how long it would be before rose would feel comfortable with david out of her sight can you tell me anything about the people who had him mel the fbi were very sympathetic and kind but tightlipped mel finished they were good people rose good people who wanted a family they made a mistake trusted someone they shouldnt have trusted but they took good care of david hes grown so and hes been trying to take a few steps there was a bitterness a sharp tang of bitterness in the back of her throat at having missed those three precious months of her sons life but with it was a sorrow for another mother in another city with an empty crib to face i know they loved him and i know how hurt and afraid she must be now but its worse for her than it was for me she knows shell never have him back she laid her fisted hands on the counter who did this to us mel who did this to all of us i dont know but im working on it will you work with mr donovan i know how concerned he is sebastian we talked about it a little when he stopped by oh mel thought she did nonchalance very well he came by roses face softened she looked almost as she had in those carefree days before davids abduction he brought david his teddy bear and this cute little blue sailboat a sailboat mel mused yes he would have thought of that that was nice of him he just seemed to understand both sides of it you know what stan and i went through what those people in atlanta are going through right now all because theres someone out there who doesnt care about people at all not about babies or mothers or families he only wants to make money on them her lips trembled then finned i guess thats why mr donovan wouldnt let me and stan pay him anything he didnt take a fee mel asked struggling to sound disinterested no he wouldnt take a dime recalling other duties rose opened the oven to check on her meat loaf he said stan and i should send what we thought we could afford to one of the homeless shelters i see and he said he was going to think about following up on the case the case he said something like it wasnt right for babies to be stolen out of cribs and sold off like puppies that there were some lines you couldnt cross yes there are mel snatched up her bag i have to go rose surprised rose shut the oven door cant you stay for dinner i really cant she hesitated then did something she rarely did something she wished she could do with more ease she kissed roses cheek theres something i have to take care of she supposed she should have done it before but theyd been back in monterey for only a couple of days mel skimmed through a lowlying cloud on her way up the mountain it wasnt as if hed gone out of his way to come and see her she thought hed gone by roses apartment but he hadnt driven a few more blocks to hers obviously he hadnt meant any of that nonsense hed been spouting about finding her attractive about wanting her all that stuff about her eyes and her hair and her skin mel drummed her fingers on the gearshift if hed meant any of it hed have made a move by now she wished he had how could she decide if she would block it or not if he didnt bother to make a move so shed beard the wolf in his den there were obligations to fulfill statements to be made and questions to be answered certain she was ready for all of that mel turned into sebastians bumpy lane halfway up she hit the brakes as a horse and rider leapt in front of her the black stallion and the dark man on his back bounded across the gravel track in a flash of muscle and speed at the sight of the gleaming horse and the goldenskinned man with his ebony hair flying in the wind she was tossed back centuries to when there were dragons to be slain and magic sung in the air mel sat openmouthed as they thundered up the rocky slope through a pocket of mist and back into the stream of sun no centaur had ever looked more magnificent as the echoes of hoofbeats died away she nudged her car up the lane this was reality she reminded herself the engine groaned and complained at the incline coughed sputtered then finally crept its way up to the house as she expected sebastian was in the paddock rubbing eros down dismounted he looked no less magnificent no less mystical energy and life vibrated from him the excitement of the ride was still on his face in his eyes the strength of it was in the rippling muscles of his back and forearms as he cooled down his mount mel thought that if she touched him now her fingers would burn nice day for a ride i guess sebastian looked over eross withers and smiled most are im sorry i didnt greet you but i hate to stop eros when he has his head its all right she was glad he hadnt mel was dead certain she wouldnt have managed more than a stutter if hed spoken to her astride that horse i just stopped by to see if you had a few minutes to clear things up i think i could find some time for you he patted the stallions left flank and then resting the horses knee on his thigh began to clean the hoof youve seen rose yes ive just come from there she said youd been by you brought david a sailboat sebastian glanced up then moved to the next hoof i thought it might help ease some of his confusion to have something familiar from those weeks he was away it was very kind he straightened then moved on to the front leg i have my moments on more solid ground now mel braced a boot on the lowest rung of the fence rose said you wouldnt take a fee i believe i pointed out before that i dont need the money im aware of that mel leaned on the fence running her fingers down eross neck nothing magical there she assured herself just a magnificent beast in his prime much like his master i did some checking you have your fingers in a lot of pies donovan thats one way of putting it i guess its easier to make money when youve got a bundle behind you to start with he examined the last hoof i suppose and it would follow it would be easier to lose money under the same conditions you got me there she tilted her head as he straightened again that business in chicago it was rough she saw the change in his face and was sorry for it this wasnt something he took lightly or brushed off in a matter of days it was difficult yes failure is but you helped them find him stop him five lives lost isnt what i term a success he gave eros a slap on the rump to send him trotting off why dont you come inside while i clean up sebastian he knew it was the first time shed used his given name it surprised him enough to have him pausing one hand on the fence his body poised to vault five lives lost she said quietly her eyes were dark with understanding do you know how many saved no he came over the fence landing lightly in front of her no i dont but it helps that youd ask he took her arm his fingers sliding from shoulder to elbow to wrist come inside she liked it out here where there was plenty of room to maneuver should maneuvering be necessary but it seemed foolish and undeniably weak not to go in the house with him there is something i want to talk with you about i assumed there was have you had dinner no good well talk while we eat they went in through the side of the house climbing onto a redwood deck flanked with pots spilling over with impatiens and going through a wide glass door directly into the kitchen it was all royal blue and white and as sleek and glossy as a page out of a highfashion magazine sebastian went directly to a small glassfronted refrigerator and chose a chilled bottle of wine from a rack inside have a seat he gestured to a stool at the tiled work island after uncorking the wine he poured her a glass i need to clean up he said setting the wine on the counter in front of her be at home sure the moment he was out of the room she was off the stool mel didnt consider it rude it was innate curiosity there was no better way to find out what made people tick than by poking around their personal space and she desperately wanted to know what made sebastian donovan tick the kitchen was meticulously neat spotless counters and appliances the dishes in their glassfronted cupboards arranged according to size the room didnt smell of detergent or disinfectant but of air she decided fresh faintly herbscented there were several clusters of herbs hanging upside down in front of the window over the sink mel sniffed at them finding their aroma pleasant and vaguely mysterious she opened a drawer at random and found baking utensils she tried another and found more kitchen gadgets neatly stacked where was the clutter she wondered as she frowned around the room and the secrets one always found jumbled with it not so much discouraged as intrigued she slipped back onto the stool and picked up her wine a moment before he came into the room again he wore black now snug coalcolored jeans and a black shirt rolled up to his elbows his feet were bare when he picked up the wine to pour his own glass mel realized he looked like what he claimed to be a wizard smiling he tapped his glass to hers leaning close to stare into her eyes will you trust me huh his smile widened to choose the menu she blinked took a hasty sip of wine sure ill eat most anything as he began gathering ingredients and pots and pans she let out a slow relieved breath youre going to cook yes why i figured youd just call out for something her brows drew together as he poured oil in a skillet its an awful lot of trouble i enjoy it sebastian snipped some herbs into a bowl it relaxes me mel scratched her knee and gave the mixture he was making a doubtful look you want me to help you you dont cook she lifted a brow how do you know i got a glimpse of your kitchen garlic sure sebastian crushed the clove with the flat of his knife what did you want to talk to me about mel a couple of things she shifted in her chair then rested her chin on her hand odd she hadnt realized she would enjoy watching him cook things turned out the way they were supposed to for rose and stan and david whats that youre putting in there rosemary it smells good so did he she thought gone was the sexy leatherandsweat scent hed carried with him after the ride it had been replaced by that equally sexy forest fragrance that was both wild and utterly male she sipped her wine again relaxing enough to toe off her boots for mr and mrs frost back in georgia things are pretty awful right now sebastian scooped tomato and garlic and herbs into a skillet when someone wins someone usually loses i know how it works we did what we had to do but we didnt finish he coated boneless chicken breasts before laying them in a pan he liked the way she sat there swinging one leg lazily and watching his culinary preparations with a careful eye go on we didnt get the one who matters donovan the one who arranged the whole thing we got david back and that was the most important thing but we didnt finish hes not the only baby whos been stolen how do you know its logical an operation that slick that pat it wasnt just a oneshot deal no he topped off their glasses then poured some of the wine onto the chicken its not so heres the way i see it she pushed off the stool mel felt she thought better on her feet the frosts had a contact now they might have been able to turn the feds onto him or he could be long gone id go with long gone she stopped pacing to tilt her head sebastian nodded continue okay its a national thing a real company got to have a lawyer someone to handle the adoption papers maybe a doctor too or at least someone with connections in the fertility business the frosts had all kinds of fertility tests i checked sebastian stirred and sniffed and checked but he was listening i imagine the fbi checked as well sure they did our pal devereauxs right on top of things but i like to finish what i start youve got all these couples trying to start a family theyll try anything regulate their sex lives their diets dance naked under the full moon and pay pay all kinds of money for tests for operations for drugs and if none of it works theyll pay for a baby she came back to the island to sniff at one of the pots herself good she murmured i know its usually on the upandup a reputable adoption agency a reputable lawyer and in most cases its the right thing the baby gets a loving home the biological mother gets a second chance and the adoptive parents get their miracle but then you have the slime factor the sleazeball who always finds a way to make a buck off someone elses tragedy why dont you put a couple of plates on the table by the window im listening okay she puttered around the kitchen following his instructions for china for flatware for napkins as she continued to theorize but this isnt just any pennyante sleaze this is a smart one slick enough to pull together an organization that can snatch a kid from one coast pass him along like a football crosscountry and bounce him into a nice affluent home thousands of miles away i havent found anything to argue about yet well hes the one we have to get to they havent picked up parkland yet but i figure they will hes not a pro hes just some jerk who tried to find a quick way to pay off a debt and keep his kneecaps intact he wont be much of a lead when they find him but hell be something i have to figure the feds will keep him under wraps so far your figuring seems flawless take the bottle and sit she did curling her legs under her on the corner bench by the window its not likely the feds would cut a pi much of a break no sebastian set platters down on the table pasta curls tanged with tomatoes and herbs the winebraised chicken thick slabs of crusty bread theyd cut you one they owe you sebastian served mel himself perhaps theyd give you a copy of parklands statement when they nab him maybe even let you talk to him if you said you were still interested in the case theyd feed you information yes they might sebastian sampled the meal and found it excellent but am i still interested she clamped a hand over his wrist before he could slice off another bite of tender chicken dont you like to finish what you start he lifted his eyes to hers and looked deep so deep that her fingers trembled once before they slid away yes i do uneasy she broke a piece of bread well then ill help you ill use whatever connections i may have i appreciate it though she was careful not to touch him again her lips curved her eyes warmed really ill owe you for this no i dont think so nor will you when you hear my conditions well work together she dropped the bread look donovan i appreciate the offer but i work alone anyway your style the visions and stuff it makes me nervous fair enough your style guns and stuff makes me nervous so we compromise work together deal with each others eccentricities after all its the goal thats important isnt it she mulled it over poking at the food on her plate maybe i did have an idea that would work better as a couple a childless couple still wary she glanced up at him but if we did agree to compromise for this one time wed have to have rules oh absolutely dont smirk when you say that with her mind clicking away she dug into the meal this is good she scooped up another bite really good it didnt look like all that much trouble you flatter me no i mean she laughed and shrugged and ate some more i guess i thought fancy food meant fancy work my mother worked as a waitress a lot and shed bring home all this food from the kitchen but it was mostly in diners and fastfood joints nothing like this your mothers well oh sure i got a postcard last week from nebraska she travels around a lot itchy feet your father the faintest of hesitations the briefest shadow of sadness i dont remember him how does your mother feel about your profession she thinks its exciting but then she watches a lot of tv what about yours mel lifted her glass and gestured how do your parents feel about you being the wizard of monterey i dont think id term it quite that way sebastian said after a moment but if they think of it i imagine theyre pleased that im carrying on the family tradition mel huffed into her wine what are you like a coven no he said gently unoffended were like a family you know i wouldnt have believed any of it if i hadnt well i was there but that doesnt mean i swallow the whole deal her eyes flashed up to his careful and calculating i did some reading up about tests and research and that kind of thing a lot of reputable scientists believe theres something to psychic phenomena thats comforting dont be snide she said shifting in her seat what i mean is they know they dont completely understand the human mind thats logical they look at eeg patterns and emgs and stuff you know they study people who can guess whats on the face of a card without lifting it up things like that but that doesnt mean they go in for witchcraft or prophesies or fairy dust a little fairy dust wouldnt hurt you sebastian murmured ill have to speak to morgana about it seriously mel began seriously he took her hand i was born with elvin blood i am a hereditary witch who can trace his roots back to finn of the celts my gift is of sight it was not asked for or demanded but given this has nothing to do with logic or science or dancing naked in the moonlight it is my legacy it is my destiny well mel said after a long moment and again well she moistened her lips and cleared her throat in these studies they tested things like telekinesis telepathy you want proof mel no yes i mean if we are going to work together on this thing id like to know the extent of your talent fair think of a number from one to ten six he said before she could open her mouth i wasnt ready but that was the first number that popped into your mind it was but she shook her head i wasnt ready she closed her eyes now she was good he thought very good right now she was using all her will to block him out to distract her he nibbled on the knuckle of the hand he still held three she opened her eyes all right how from your mind to mine he rubbed his lips over her fingers sometimes in words sometimes in pictures sometimes only in feelings that are impossible to describe now youre wondering if you had too much wine because your hearts beating too fast your skin is warm your heads light my heads fine she jerked her hand from his or it would be if youd stay out of it i can feel yes content he sat back and lifted his glass i know you can its very rare without a blood connection for anyone to feel me particularly on such a light scan you have potential sutherland if you care to explore it id be happy to assist you she couldnt quite mask the quick shudder that passed through her no thanks i like my head just the way it is experimentally she put a hand to it while watching sebastian i dont like the idea of anybody being able to read my mind if were going to go through with this temporary partnership thats the number one rule agreed i wont look inside your mind unless you ask me to noting the doubt in her eyes he smiled i dont lie mel witchs creed if you like she didnt but she would take him at his word okay next we share all information no holding back his smile was both charming and dangerous im more than willing to agree weve held back long enough were professional we keep it professional when appropriate he touched the rim of his glass to hers is sharing a meal considered professional we dont have to be ridiculous what i mean is if were going to go under posing as a married couple wanting a child we dont let the act blur those lines of yours he finished for her i understand do you have a plan well it would help if we had the cooperation of the fbi leave that to me she grinned it was exactly what shed hoped for with them backing us up we can establish a solid identity papers backgrounds irs files the works we need to come to the attention of the organization so well have to be affluent but not so highprofile as to scare them off we should be new in the community we choose no ties no family well have to be put on the waiting list of several reputable adoption agencies have records from fertility clinics and doctors once theyve gotten to parkland or one of the others well have a better idea where to set up and how there might be an easier way what he waved her aside ill get to it this could take quite a lot of time it could it would be worth it we compromise i work out where we begin when and how you handle the procedure from there she hesitated aware shed never be any good at compromise if you pick the when where and how it has to be for solid reasons and i have to accept them all right all right it seemed simple enough if there was a frisson of excitement working through her it was the anticipation of an interesting and rewarding job i guess i could help you deal with all these dishes she rose started to stack the delicate china with the competence her waitress mother had taught her sebastian put a hand on her arm the frisson erupted into a flare leave them you cooked she said and strode quickly to the sink a little room she thought a little room and some busywork was all she needed to stay on an even keel and from the looks of this kitchen youre not the type who leaves dirty dishes hanging around he was behind her when she turned and his hands came to her shoulders to prevent her from dodging away so ill be unpredictable or you could hire some elves to scrub up she muttered i dont employ any elves in california when her look sharpened he began to knead her shoulders youre tensing up on me mel during dinner you were quite relaxed you even smiled at me several times which i found a very pleasant change i dont like people touching me but she didnt move away after all there was nowhere to go why not its merely another form of communication there are many voices eyes hands his slid over her shoulders turning the muscles there to water minds a touch doesnt have to be dangerous it can be his lips curved as his fingers skimmed down her back but youre no coward a woman like you meets a dangerous situation headon her chin came up as hed known it would i came here to talk to you and weve talked he nudged her closer so that he had only to bend his head to press his lips to the faint cleft in the center of that strong chin i enjoyed it she would not be seduced she was a grown woman with a mind of her own and seduction was always had been out of the question she lifted a hand to his chest where it lay fingers spread neither resisting or inviting i didnt come to play games pity his lips hovered a breath from hers before he tilted his head and brushed them under her jaw i also enjoy games but we can save them for another time it was becoming very difficult to breathe look maybe im attracted to you but that doesnt mean anything of course not your skins unbelievably delicate just here mary ellen its as if your pulse would bruise the flesh if it continued to beat so hard thats ridiculous but when he tugged her shirt free of her waistband to let his hands roam up her back she felt as delicate as a dandelion puff with a sound that was somewhere between a moan and a sigh she arched back against him id nearly lost my patience he murmured against her throat waiting for you to come to me i didnt i havent but her arms had wound around him and her fingers were tangled in his hair this isnt why im here but hadnt she known somewhere inside hadnt she known i have to think this could be a mistake but even as she said it her mouth was moving hungrily over his i hate to make mistakes mmm who doesnt he cupped his hands under her hips with a murmur of acceptance she scooted up wrapping her legs around his waist this isnt one ill figure it out later she said as he carried her out of the kitchen i really dont want this to mess up the other business its too important i want that to work i really want that to work and id hate myself if i messed it up just because on a groan she pressed her mouth to his throat i want you i want you so much her words started a drumbeat in his head slow rhythmic seductive he dragged her head back with one hand so that he could plunder her mouth one has nothing to do with the other it could she rocked against him as he started up the steps her breath was already coming in pants as her eyes met his it should then so be it he kicked open the door to the bedroom lets break some rules chapter contents prev next she had never been one to throw caution to the winds to take risks certainly but always knowing the consequences there was no way to figure the odds now not with him again it was up to instinct although her head told her to cut her losses and run something else something closer to the bone urged her to stay to trust she was still wrapped around him throbbing at every point a pulse could beat it wasnt shyness that had her hesitating she had never considered herself overly sexual or more than average in looks so she felt she had nothing to be shy about it was a sudden certainty that this was vital that had her taking one last long look at him and what she saw was exactly what she wanted her lips curved slowly when she started to slide down him he braced her back against the bedpost so that when her feet touched the floor she was trapped between the smooth carved wood and his body his eyes stayed on hers as his hands moved slowly upward fingertips sliding over thighs hips the sides of her breasts her throat temples she shuddered once before his fists closed viselike in her hair and his mouth crushed down on hers his body was pressed against her so truly that she felt every line and curve she sensed that the power inside it was that of a wolf on a leash ready to tear free but it was his mouth that drove her mind to the edge of reason insatiable and possessive it drew from hers every nuance of emotion desires and doubts fears and longings she felt her will being passed to him like a gift he felt that instant of surrender when her body was both limp and firm against his when her lips trembled then sought more of what he wanted to give the hunger sliced through him like a silver blade cleaving the civilized from the desperate and leaving him quivering like a stallion that scents his mate he reared his head back and she saw that his eyes were dark as midnight full of reckless needs and heedless wants and power she trembled first in fear then again in glorious delight it was that answer he saw and it was that answer he took with one violent swipe he tore her shirt to tatters her gasp was muffled against his mouth even as they tumbled onto the bed his hands were everywhere bruising and stroking taking and tormenting in answer she dragged at his shirt popping buttons rending seams as they rolled over the sheets when she felt his flesh against hers she let out a long breathless sigh of approval he gave her little time to think and none to question he was riding her into a storm filled with thunderclaps and flashing lights and howling winds she knew it was physical there was nothing magical about the skill of his hands the drugging taste of his mouth but oh it seemed like magic to be whisked away beyond the ordinary beyond even the simple beauty of a rosy dusk and the stirrings of night birds just waking where he took her was all dazzling speed and unspeakable pleasure a whisper of some language she couldnt understand an incantation some lovers promise the sound alone was enough to seduce her a touch rough or gentle was accepted with delight the taste of him hot and salty on her lips cool and soothing on her tongue was enough to make her ravenous for more so generous his hazy mind thought so strong so giving in the lowering light her skin was gilded like a warrior goddesss prepared for battle she was slim and straight agile as a fantasy responsive as a wish he felt her strangled gasp against his ear the sudden convulsive dig of her nails into his back as her body shuddered from the climax he gave her even as her limp hand slid from his damp shoulder he was racing over her again wild to taste crazed to make her blood pump hot again until he could hear her breath rasping out his name he braced over her shaking his head until his vision cleared until he could see her face her eyes halfclosed and drugged with pleasure her lips swollen from his and trembling on each breath come with me he told her as her arms encircled he drove himself inside her and he knew as they raced together that some spells require nothing more than a willing heart she thought she heard music lovely soothing heart music mel didnt know where the phrase had come from but she smiled at the thought of it and turned there was no one to turn to instantly awake she sat up in the dark though the night was ink black she knew she was alone in the room sebastians room being with him had been no dream nor was being alone now a dream she groped for the light beside the bed and shielded her eyes until they had adjusted she didnt call out his name it would have made her feel foolish to speak it in an empty bed in a shadowy room instead she scrambled up found his shirt crumpled on the floor tugging her arms through the sleeves she followed the music it came from no real direction though soft as a whisper it seemed to surround her odd no matter how she strained to hear she couldnt be sure if she was hearing voices raised in song or strings flutes horns it was simply sound a lovely vibration on the air that was both eerie and beautiful she flowed with it following instinct the sound grew no louder no softer but it did seem to become more fluid washing over her skin sliding into her mind as she followed a corridor that snaked left then climbed a short flight of stairs she saw the glow of candlelight an ethereal flicker that built to a golden flood as she approached a room at the end of the hallway there was a scent of warm wax of sandalwood of pungent smoke she wasnt aware she was holding her breath when she stopped in the doorway and looked the room wasnt large she thought the word chamber would be more appropriate but she wasnt sure why such a quaint term came to mind the walls were a pale warmtoned wood burnished now with the mystical lights of dozens of slim white candles there were windows three in the shape of crescent moons she remembered seeing them from the outside and realized that the room was at the topmost part of the house facing the cliffs and the sea above a twinkling of stars could be seen through the skylights hed opened to the night and the air there were chairs and tables and stands all of them looking as if they belonged in some medieval castle rather than a modern home in big sur on them she saw orbs of crystal colorful bowls scribed silver mirrors slender wands of clear glass and goblets encrusted with glittering stones she didnt believe in magic mel knew there was always a false drawer in the magicians chest and an ace of hearts up his sleeve but standing there in the doorway of that room she felt the air pulse and throb as if it were alive with a thousand hearts and she knew that there was more here in this world she thought she knew than she had ever dreamed of sebastian sat in the center of the room in the center of a silver pentagram inlaid in the wooden floor his back was to her and he was very still her curiosity had always been strong but she discovered something stronger her need to give him his privacy but even as she stepped back from the doorway he spoke to her i didnt mean to wake you you didnt she toyed with one of the few buttons left on his shirt the music did or i woke up and heard it and wondered she looked around baffled she could see no recording device no stereo i wondered where it was coming from the night he rose though shed never considered herself a prude she found herself flushing when he stood naked in the candlelight holding a hand out for her im naturally nosy but i didnt mean to intrude you didnt her hesitation had him lifting a brow then stepping forward to take her hand i needed to clear my mind i couldnt do it beside you he brought her palm to his lips pressing them at the center too many thoughts clouding the issue i guess i shouldve gone home no he leaned down to kiss her lightly sweetly no indeed well the thing is she backed away a little wishing she had something to do with her hands i dont usually do this sort of thing she looked so young he thought and so frail standing there in his shirt with her hair mussed from love and sleep and her eyes too wide should i say that since you decided to make an exception with me you do this sort of thing very well you dont have to then her lips turned up she had done well they had done incredibly well but i dont guess it hurts do you usually sit naked on the floor in candlelight when the spirit moves me more comfortable now she began moving around the room picking up objects lips pursed she examined a centuriesold scrying mirror is this supposed to be magic stuff in that moment watching her peer suspiciously at the priceless he adored her that was said to belong to ninian who ah sutherland your education is sadly lacking ninian was a sorceress reputed to have imprisoned merlin in his cave of crystal yeah she took a closer look found it a pretty piece then set it down to study a globe of smoky quartz so what do you use this stuff for enjoyment he had no need for scrying mirrors or crystal balls in order to see he kept them around him out of an appreciation of tradition and a sense of aesthetics it amused him to see her frown and squint at the tools of power there was something he wanted to give her a small gift he hadnt forgotten the fleeting sadness hed seen in her eyes when shed told him she didnt remember her father would you like to see see what to see he said gently and walked to her come he took the globe in one hand her fingers in the other and drew her back to the center of the room i dont really think kneel he nudged her down with him past or future mel which would you like with a nervous laugh she settled back on her heels arent you supposed to be wearing a turban use your imagination he touched a hand to her cheek the past i think you prefer taking care of your own future you got that right but put your hands on the globe mel theres nothing to be afraid of im not afraid she squirmed a little let out a long breath its just a piece of glass its weird thats all she muttered as she took the crystal sebastian put his hands under hers and smiled my aunt bryna morganas mother gave me this ball as a christening gift it was for me somewhat like training wheels on a bicycle it was cool in her hands smooth and as cool as lake water i had this ball when i was a kid a black plastic one you were supposed to ask it questions then you could shake it and this writing would float up toward this opening it usually said something like answer unclear try again again he smiled finding her nerves endearing the power was flowing into him sweet as wine easy as a spring breeze this was a simple thing he would show her look inside he said and his voice echoed oddly in the small room and see she was compelled to do so at first she saw only a pretty ball with internal fractures glinting rainbows back at her then there were shadows shadows within shadows forms shifting colors bleeding oh she murmured for the glass was no longer cool but as warm as a sunbeam look he said again and it seemed his voice was inside her head with your heart she saw her mother first but young so young and brightly pretty despite the heavy use of eyeliner and a lipstick several shades too pale it was the laughter in her face that brought the prettiness through the cosmetics her hair was blond shoulderlength and straight as a pin she was laughing at a young man in a white uniform a sailors cap perched jauntily on his head the man was holding a child of about two who was dressed in a frilly pink dress with black strapped shoes and lacy white socks not just any child mel thought as her heart thudded in her throat me the child is me in the background was a ship a big gray naval vessel there was a band playing something rousingly military and there were people milling about talking all at once she couldnt hear the words only the sounds she saw the man toss her in the air toss her high in the candlelit room her stomach leaped and dropped giddily and here was love and trust and innocence his eyes beaming up at her with pride and humor and excitement strong hands around her a whiff of aftershave a giggly laugh tickling her throat as she was caught close she watched the images shift saw her parents kiss oh the sweetness of it then the boy who had been her father gave them a jaunty salute tossed his duffel bag over his shoulder and walked toward the ship the ball in her hand was only pretty glass with inner fractures glinting rainbows back at her my father mel might have dropped the globe if sebastians hands hadnt held firm it was my father he he was in the navy he wanted to see the world he left that day from norfolk i was only two i dont remember my mother said we went down to see him off and that hed been excited her voice broke and she gave herself a minute a few months later there was a storm in the mediterranean and he was lost at sea he was only twentytwo just a boy really she has pictures but you cant tell from pictures mel stared into the globe again then slowly looked up at sebastian i have his eyes i never realized i have his eyes she closed them a moment waiting until her system leveled a bit i did see it didnt i yes he lifted a hand to her hair i didnt show you to make you sad mary ellen it didnt it made me sorry on a sigh she opened her eyes again sorry i cant remember him sorry that my mother remembers too much and that i never understood that before and it made me happy to have seen him and them together all of us together even once she slipped her hands away leaving the ball in his thank you it was a small thing after what you brought me tonight what i brought she asked as he rose to replace the ball yourself oh well clearing her throat she got to her feet i dont know if id put it like that how would you put it she looked back at him and felt that new helpless fluttering in her stomach i dont know exactly were both adults yes he started toward her and she surprised herself by edging back unattached so it seems responsible admirably he danced his fingers over her hair ive wanted to see you in candlelight mary ellen dont start that she brushed his hand away what dont call me mary ellen and dont start that violinandcandlelight business his eyes stayed on hers as he trailed a finger down her throat you object to romance not object exactly her emotions were too close to the surface much too close after what she had seen in the globe she needed to make certain they had their ground rules i just dont need it i dont know what to do with it and i think well deal better if we know where we stand where do we stand he asked slipping his hands around her waist like i said were responsible unattached adults and were attracted to each other he touched his lips to her temple so far i find nothing to argue about and as long as we handle this relationship sensibly oh we may run into trouble there i dont see why he skimmed his hands up her rib cage until his thumbs circled her nipples i dont feel particularly sensible her knees buckled her head fell back its just a matter of establishing priorities i have my priorities he teased her lips apart with his tongue top of the list is making love with you until were both a puddle of useless flesh good she went willingly when he pulled her to the floor good start she really worked better with lists by the following evening mel was huddled at her desk doing her best to put one together it was the first free hour shed had since speeding away from sebastians house at am already frazzled and behind schedule she was never behind schedule of course shed never had an affair with a witch before it was obviously a month for firsts if she hadnt had an appointment paperwork and a court appearance waiting she might not have left his house at all hed certainly done everything in his power to discourage her she remembered tapping her pencil against her smiling lips the man definitely had a lot of power but work was work she reminded herself she had a business to run the best news of the day was that the new hampshire state police had picked up james t parkland and there was a certain sergeant grateful for her tip and annoyed with the federal takeover who was being very cooperative hed faxed mel a copy of parklands statement on the sly it was a start she had the name of the high roller whod held parklands iou and she intended to put it to good use with any luck shed be spending a few days in lake tahoe she needed to bring devereaux around hed want to use his own agents on any kind of a sting and she had to come up with several solid reasons why she and sebastian would make better bait her assistance and cooperation in the merrick case would work in her favor but mel didnt think it would swing the deal her record was good she didnt do flashy work and she sensed that devereaux would disapprove of a hotdogging pi her partnership with sebastian was in her favor as well and the fact that she was perfectly willing to let the feds take the lions share of credit for the collar would add a little weight to her side of the scales open for business sebastian asked as he pushed open the door she struggled to ignore the quick giddy fluttering in her stomach and she smiled actually im closing for the day in five minutes then my timings good whats this taking her hand he pulled her to her feet to examine the trim peachcolored suit she wore court appearance late this afternoon she moved her shoulders restlessly as he toyed with the pearls at her throat divorce case kind of nasty so you want to go in looking as much like a lady as possible you succeeded easy for you to say it takes twice as much time and trouble to dress like a lady as it does to dress like a normal person she rested a hip on the desk and handed him a sheet of paper i got a copy of parklands statement quick work as you can see hes a pretty pathetic type he was desperate he didnt mean to hurt anybody he was over his head gambling problem afraid for his life she gave a quick unladylike opinion of his excuses im surprised he didnt toss out how his father had traumatized him by not giving him a little red wagon for christmas hell pay sebastian said pathetic or not right because he was also stupid taking david across the state line really upped the ante she kicked off her shoes and rubbed her calf with her foot now he claims he got the offer of the job over the phone sounds reasonable sure want a drink mmm sebastian read over the statement again while she moved into the kitchen five thousand dollars for snatching a kid pretty paltry compared with the sentence hes facing so she turned found sebastian in the doorway and offered him a soft drink he owes thirtyfive hundred to this casino up in tahoe and he knows if he doesnt make a payment soon hes going to have his face rearranged in a way that might not be pleasing so he scouts out a kid he was following her but sebastian was also interested in her personal habitat why david he asked as he walked past her into the adjoining room i looked into that stan worked on his car about five months ago stanll show off pictures of david to anyone who doesnt run for cover so when parkland figured snatching a kid was better than plastic surgery the hard way he figured a mechanics kid might be the ticket davids cute even a sleaze like parkland would have realized a pretty baby makes an impression on a buyer umhmm sebastian rubbed a hand over his chin as he studied her bedroom he assumed it was a bedroom as there was a narrow unmade bed in the center of it it also appeared to be a living room as there was an overstuffed chair piled with books and magazines a portable tv on a wobbly plant stand and a lamp in the shape of a trout is this where you live yeah she kicked a pair of boots out of the way maids year off and so she continued dropping down on a chest decorated with stickers of most if not all of the fifty states he took the job got all his instructions from mr x over the phone met the redhead at the prearranged drop and exchanged david for an envelope of cash whats this mel glanced over its a bullwinkle bank didnt you ever watch bullwinkle i believe i did sebastian mused shaking the moose before setting it aside again hokey smokes thats the one anyway and this he gestured to a poster tacked to the wall underdog wally cox used to do the voice are you paying attention to me he turned and smiled im riveted do you know it takes a bold soul to mix purple and orange in one room i like bright colors and red striped sheets they were on sale she said impatiently you turn the light off when you sleep anyway look donovan how long are we going to discuss my decor only a moment or two he picked up a bowl shaped like the cheshire cat shed tossed odds and ends into it a straight pin a safety pin a couple of loose buttons a bullet a coupon for the soft drinks she seemed to live on and what looked to sebastian to be a lock pick youre not the tidy sort are you i use up my organizational talents in business umhmm he set the bowl down and picked up a book the psychic handbook research she said and scowled i got it out of the library a couple of weeks ago what did you think i think it has very little to do with you im sure youre right he set it aside again this room has very much to do with you just as that streamlined office out there does your mind is very disciplined like your file cabinet she wasnt sure if it was a compliment or not but she recognized the look in his eye look donovan but your emotions he continued moving toward her are very chaotic very colorful she batted his hand away when he toyed with her pearls im trying to have a professional conversation you closed up shop for the day remember i dont have regular hours neither do i he flipped open a button of her suit jacket ive been thinking about making love with you ever since i finished making love with you this morning her skin was going hot and she knew her attempts to stop him from undoing her jacket were halfhearted at best you must not have enough on your mind oh youre quite enough i have started on some arrangements that should please you professionally she turned her head just in time to avoid his mouth what arrangements a long conversation with agent devereaux and his superior her eyes flew open again as she struggled away from his hands when what did they say you could say the stews simmering itll take a couple of days youll have to be patient i want to talk to him myself i think he should youll have your shot at him tomorrow the next day at the latest he drew her hands behind her back handcuffing her wrists with his fingers whats going to happen will happen soon enough i know the when i know the where then tonight its just you and me tell me im going to show you he murmured show you just how easy it is to think of nothing else to feel nothing else to want nothing else with his eyes on hers he teased her mouth i wasnt gentle with you before it doesnt matter i dont regret it he nipped lightly at her lower lip then soothed the small pain with his tongue its just that seeing you tonight in your quiet little suit makes me want to treat you like a lady until it drives you crazy her laugh was breathless as his tongue danced up her throat i think you already are i havent even started with his free hand he nudged the jacket from her shoulder she wore a sheer pastel blouse underneath that made him think of summer teas and formal garden parties while his mouth roamed over her face and throat he traced his fingers over the sheer cloth and the lace beneath her body was already quivering she thought it ridiculous that he held her arms captive that she allowed it but there was a dreamy excitement at having him touch her this way slowly experimentally thoroughly she felt his breath against her flesh as he opened her blouse and the moist warmth of his tongue cruising over the tops of her breast just above then just beneath the chemise she knew she was still standing her feet on the floor her legs pressed back against the bed but it felt like floating floating while he lazily savored her as if she were a banquet to be sampled at his whim her skirt slithered down her legs his hand trailed up her murmur of approval was low and long as his fingers toyed seductively with the hook of her garter so unexpected mary ellen with one expert flick he unsnapped the front practical she said on a gasp as his fingers skimmed up toward the heat cheaper this way because im always running them delightfully practical struggling against the need to rush he laid her back on the bed in the name of finn how could he have known that the sight of that strong angular body in bits of lace would rip his selfcontrol to shreds he wanted to devour to conquer to possess but he had promised her some tenderness he knelt over her lowered his mouth to hers and kept his word and he was right in mere moments she understood he was so very right it was easy to think of nothing but him to feel nothing but him to want nothing but him she was rocked in the cradle of his gentleness her body as alive as it had been the night before certainly as desired as it had been but with the added aspect of being treasured for a femininity she so often forgot he savored her and sent her gliding he explored and showed her new secrets of herself all the rush and fury they had indulged in the night before had shifted focus now the world was slow the air was soft and passion was languid and when she felt his heart thudding wildly against hers when his murmurs became urgent breathless she understood that he was as seduced as she by what they made together she opened for him drawing him in heat to heat pulse to pulse when his body shuddered it was she who cradled him chapter contents prev next were wasting time on the contrary sebastian said pausing at a shop window to examine an outfit on a stylized faceless mannequin what were doing is basic even intricate groundwork for the operation shopping she made a disgusted sound and hooked her thumbs in her front pockets shopping for an entire day my dear sutherland im quite fond of the way you look in jeans but as the wife of an affluent businessman you need a more extensive wardrobe ive already tried on enough stuff to clothe three women for a year itll take a tractortrailer to deliver it all to your house he gave her a bland look it was easier to convince the fbi to cooperate than it is you because that made her feel ungrateful and petty she squirmed im cooperating ive been cooperating for hours i just think we have enough not quite he gestured toward the dress in the display now this would make a statement mel chewed on her lower lip as she studied it it has sequins you have religious or political objections to sequins no its just that im not the glittery type id feel like a jerk and theres hardly anything to it she flicked her gaze over the tiny strapless black dress which left the mannequins white legs bare to midthigh i dont see how you could sit down in it i seem to recall a little number you wore to go to a bar a few weeks ago that was different i was working at his patient amused look she grimaced okay okay donovan you made your point be a good soldier he said and patted her cheek go in and try it on she grumbled and muttered and swore under her breath but she was a good soldier sebastian roamed the boutique selecting accessories and thinking of her she didnt give a hang for fashion he mused and was more embarrassed than pleased that she could now lay claim to a wardrobe most woman would envy she would play her part and play it well she would wear the clothes hed selected and be totally oblivious to the fact that she looked spectacular in them as soon as it was possible she would slip back into her jeans and boots and faded shirts and be equally oblivious to the fact that she looked equally spectacular in them by merlins beard you have it bad donovan he thought as he chose a silver evening bag with an emerald clasp his mother had once told him that love was more painful more delightful and more unstoppable when it came unexpectedly how right she had been the last thing hed expected was to feel anything more than an amused attraction for a woman like mel she was tough argumentative prickly and radically independent hardly seductive qualities in a woman she was also warm and generous loyal and brave and honest what man could resist an acidtongued woman with a caring heart and a questing mind certainly not sebastian donovan it would take time and patience to win her over completely he didnt have to look to know she was much too cautious and despite her cocky exterior too insecure to hand over her heart with both hands until she was sure of its reception he had time and he had patience if he didnt look to be sure it was because he felt it would be unfair to both of them and because in a deep secret chamber of his own heart he was afraid he would look and see her walking away well i got it on mel griped behind him but i dont see how its going to stay up for long he turned and stared what is it alarmed she slapped a hand to the slight swell of her breasts above the glittery sequins and looked down do i have it on backwards or something the laugh did the trick of starting his heart again no you wear it very well theres nothing that raises a mans blood pressure as quickly as a long slim woman in a black dress she snorted give me a break perfect perfect the saleswoman came over to pluck and peck mel rolled her eyes at sebastian it fits like a dream yes he agreed like a dream i have some red silk evening pants that would be just darling on her donovan mel began a plea in her voice but he was already following the eager clerk thirty minutes later mel strode out of the store thats it case closed one more stop donovan im not trying on any more clothes id rather be staked to an anthill no more clothes he promised good i could be undercover on this case for a decade and not wear everything two weeks he told her it wont take longer than two weeks and by the time weve made the rounds at the casinos the clubs attended a few parties youll have made good use of the wardrobe two weeks she felt excitement begin to percolate through the boredom are you sure call it a hunch he patted her hand i have a feeling that what we do in tahoe will be enough to set the dominoes tumbling on this blackmarket operation you never told me exactly how you convinced the feds to let us go with this had been but with the added aspect of being treasured for a femininity she so often forgot he savored her and sent her gliding he explored and showed her new

with this i have a history with them you could say i called in a few favors made some promises she stopped to look in another store window not to peruse the wares but because she needed a moment to chose her words i know i couldnt have gotten them to back me without you and i know that you dont really have a stake in any of this i have the same stake as you he turned her to face him you dont have a client sutherland no retainer no fee that doesnt matter no he smiled and kissed her brow it doesnt sometimes youre involved simply because theres a chance you can make a difference i thought it was because of rose mel said slowly and it is but its also because of mrs frost i can still hear the way she was crying when we took david away i know its not that im a dogooder she said suddenly embarrassed he kissed her once more i know there are rules he took her hand and they began to walk again she took her time keeping her voice light as she touched on something that had been nagging at her brain for days if we can really get set up by the end of the week well be sort of living together for a while does that bother you well no if it doesnt bother you she was beginning to feel like a fool but it was important she make him understand she wasnt the kind of woman who mixed fantasy with reality well be pretending that were married that were in love and everything its convenient to be in love when youre married right she let out a huff of breath i just want you to know that i can play the game i can be good at it so you shouldnt think that he toyed with her fingers as they walked shouldnt think what well i know that some people can get carried away or mix up the way things are with the way theyre pretending they are i just dont want you to get nervous that id do that oh i think my nerves can stand the pretense of you being in love with me he said it so lightly that she scowled down at the sidewalk well good fine just so we know where we stand i think we should practice he whipped her around so that she collided with him what practice he repeated so we can be sure you can pull off the role of the loving wife he held her a little closer kiss me mary ellen were out on the street were in public all the more reason it hardly matters how we behave privately youre blushing i am not you certainly are and youll have to watch that i dont think it would embarrass you to kiss a man youve been married to for what is it five years and according to our established cover we lived together a full year before that you were twentytwo when you fell in love with me i can add she muttered you wash my socks her lips quirked the hell i do we have a modern marriage you do the laundry ah but youve given up your career as an ad executive to make a home i hate that part she slipped her arms around his neck what am i supposed to do all day putter he grinned initially well be on vacation establishing our new home well spend a lot of time in bed well all right she grinned back since its for a good cause she did kiss him then long and deep dancing her tongue over his feeling his heart pick up its beat and race with hers then slowly she inched away maybe i wouldnt kiss you like that after five years she mused oh yes you will he took her arm and steered her into his cousins shop well well morgana set down a malachite egg shed been polishing shed had an excellent view of the show through her display window another few minutes of that and youd have stopped traffic an experiment sebastian told her morgana knows about the case even as mels brows drew together he was continuing i dont keep secrets from my family theres no need to worry morgana touched sebastians arm but her eyes were on mel we dont keep secrets from each other but weve had plenty of experience in being discrete with outsiders im sorry im not used to taking people into my confidence its a risky business morgana agreed sebastian nash is in the back grumbling about unloading a shipment run along and keep him company for a minute will you if you like as sebastian went into the back room morgana moved to the door and turned the closed sign over she wanted a moment of privacy nash has gotten very protective she said turning back he worries about me handling boxes and lifting inventory i guess thats natural in your condition im strong as an ox she smiled and shrugged besides there are other ways of maneuvering heavy merchandise hmm was all mel could think of to say we dont make a habit of flaunting what we are sebastian uses his gift publicly but people think of it as something one might read about in a supermarket tabloid they dont really understand what he is or what he has as for me the whispers and rumors are good business and ana ana has her own way of dealing with her talents i really dont know what im supposed to say mel lifted her hands then dropped them again i dont know if ill ever take all this in i never even bought into the tooth fairy thats a pity then again it seems to me that a very practical mind would be unable to deny what it sees what it knows i cant deny that hes different that he has abilities gifts and that frustrated she let her words trail off again ive never met anyone like him before morgana gave a low laugh even among the different sebastian is unique one day perhaps well have time for me to tell you stories he was always competitive it continues to infuriate him that he cant cast a decent spell with any real finesse fascinated mel stepped closer really oh yes of course i dont tell him just how frustrating it is for me to have to go through all manner of stages to get even a glimpse of the things he can see simply by looking she waved it away but those are old family rivalries i wanted a moment with you because i realize that sebastian trusts you enough obviously cares for you enough to have opened that part of his life to you i mel blew out a breath what next were working together she said carefully and you could say that we have a kind of relationship a personal relationship im not going to intrude overmuch in that personal relationship but he is family and i love him very much so i have to tell you dont use this power you have to hurt him mel was flabbergasted but youre the witch she blurted out then she blinked what i mean is you said what you meant aptly yes i am a witch but im also a woman who understands power better mel shook her head i dont know what you mean and i certainly dont know how you think i could possibly hurt sebastian if you think ive put him in any danger by involving him in this case no eyes thoughtful morgana lifted a hand you really dont understand morganas lips curved as her eyes cleared it was obvious beautifully obvious that mel hadnt a clue that sebastian was in love with her how fascinating she murmured and how delightful morgana if youd just make yourself clear oh no id hate to do that she took both of mels hands forgive me for confusing you we donovans tend to be protective of each other i like you she said with a charming smile very much i hope well be good friends she gave mels hands a squeeze id like to give you something it isnt necessary of course not morgana agreed moving toward a display case but when i chose this stone i knew that i would want it to belong to just the right person here she took a slender blue wand attached to a thin silver chain out of the case i cant take that it must be valuable values relative you dont wear jewelry morgana slipped the chain over mels head but think of this as a talisman or a tool if you like though shed never been particularly attracted to the things people hung from their ears or crowded on their fingers she lifted the blue stone to eye level it wasnt clear but she could see hints of light through it in length it was no longer than her thumbnail but the hues in the stone ranged from pale blue to indigo what is it its a blue tourmaline its an excellent aid for stress and it was also an excellent channel for joining love with wisdom but morgana said nothing of that i imagine you have plenty of that in your work my share i guess thanks its nice morgana nash poked his head out of the storeroom door oh hi mel hello babe theres this nut on the phone who wants to know something about green dioptaste on the fourth chakra customer morgana corrected wearily its a customer nash yeah right well this customer wants to expand his heart center nash winked at mel sounds pretty desperate to me ill take it she gestured for mel to follow know anything about chakras nash murmured to mel as she walked through the doorway do you eat it or dance to it he grinned and patted her on the back i like you there seems to be a lot of that going around morgana walked into a room beyond mel studied the kitchenette where sebastian had made himself at home at a wooden table with a beer want one you bet there was the smell of herbs again from little pots growing on the windowsill morganas voice rose and fell from the next room its an interesting shop sebastian handed her a bottle i see you picked up a trinket already oh she fingered the stone morgana gave it to me its pretty isnt it very so she turned to nash i really didnt get a chance to tell you before i love your movies especially shape shifter it blew me away yeah he was rooting around in the cupboards for cookies it has a special place in my heart nothing like a sexy lycanthrope with a conscience i like the way you make the illogical logical she took a sip of beer i mean you make the rules they might be really weird rules but then you follow them mels big on rules sebastian put in sorry morgana stepped back in a slight emergency nash you ate all the cookies already all disappointed he closed the cupboard door every crumb she turned to sebastian i imagine youre wondering if the package came in yes she reached into her pocket and took out a small box of hammered silver i think youll find it quite suitable he rose to take it from her their eyes met held i trust your judgment and i yours she took his face in her hands and kissed him blessed be cousin in a brisk change of mood she reached for nash darling come out in the shop with me i want to move some things but mel was just feeding my ego heavy things she said and gave his hand a tug well see you soon i hope mel yes thanks again the moment the door closed behind them she looked at sebastian what was that all about morgana understood that i preferred to do this alone he rubbed his thumb over the box as he watched her mels smile went a little nervous around the edges its not going to hurt is it painless he promised at least for her he opened the box and offered it she peeked in and would have taken a quick step away if she hadnt been standing with her back to the counter inside the ornate little box was a ring like the necklace morgana had given her it was silver thin glistening wires woven into an intricate pattern around a center stone of delicate pink with a green rind rim what is it its also tourmaline he told her whats called watermelon tourmaline because of its colors he took it out held it to the light some say it can transfer energy between two people who are important to each other on a practical level which im sure will interest you theyre used in industry for electrical tuning circuits they dont shatter at high frequencies like other crystals thats interesting her throat was very dry but whats it for though it was not quite the way he might have liked it it would have to do for now a wedding ring he said and put it into her hand excuse me we would hardly have been married five years without you having a ring oh surely she was just imagining that the ring was vibrating in her palm that makes sense sure but why not a plain gold band because i prefer this with his first show of impatience he plucked the ring out of her hand and shoved it on her finger okay okay dont get testy it just seems like a lot of trouble when we could have gone by any department store and picked up shut up shed been busy playing with the ring as she spoke but now she looked up narroweyed look donovan for once he lifted her to her toes for once do something my way without arguing without questioning without making me want to strangle you her eyes heated i was stating my opinion and if this is going to work wed better get one thing clear right now theres no your way theres no my way there can only be our way since no amount of searching helped him come up with an argument he released her i have a remarkably even temper he said half to himself it very rarely flares because power and temper are a dangerous mix pouting a bit she rubbed her arms where his fingers had dug in yeah right theres one rule one unbreakable rule that we live by in my world sutherland an it harm none i take that very seriously and for the first time in my life ive come across someone who tempts me to whip up a spell that would have her suffering from all manner of unpleasant discomforts she sniffed and picked up her beer again youre all wind donovan your cousin told me youre lousy at spells oh there are one or two ive had some luck with he waited until shed taken a good swallow of beer then concentrated hard mel choked gasped and grabbed for her throat it felt as though shed just swallowed a slug of pure kentucky moonshine particularly spells that involve the mind sebastian said smugly while she fought for breath cute real cute though the burning had faded she set the beer aside there was no point in taking chances i dont know what youre all bent out of shape about donovan and id really appreciate it if youd hold the tricks for halloween or april fools day or whenever you all break out for a few laughs laughs he said it much too quietly taking a step forward mel took one to meet him but whatever they might have done was postponed as the side door swung open oh anastasia with her hair blowing into her eyes held the door open with a hip as she balanced a tray of dried flowers excuse me she didnt need to go any closer to feel the tempers rattling like sabers in the air ill come back later dont be silly sebastian nudged mel aside none too gently and took the tray from his cousin morganas in the shop hastily ana brushed her wayward hair away from her face ill just go tell her im here nice to see you again mel ingrained manners had her offering a smile then her gaze fixed on the ring oh how beautiful it looks like she hesitated flicking a glance at sebastian it looks like it was made for you im just kind of borrowing it for a few weeks ana looked at mel again and her eyes were kind i see i doubt if i could bear to give something that wonderful back may i gently ana took mels fingertips and lifted her hand she recognized the stone as one sebastian had owned and treasured most of his life yes she said it looks perfect on you thanks well i only have a few minutes so id better let you finish your argument she tossed sebastian a quick smile and went out into the shop mel sat on the edge of the table and tilted her head wanna fight he picked up her halffinished beer there doesnt seem to be much point in it no theres not because im not mad at you im nervous ive never done anything this big before not that im afraid i cant handle it he sat on the table beside her then what i guess its the most important thing ive ever done and i really i really care about making it work then theres this other thing what other thing this youandme thing its important too he took her hand in his yes it is and i dont want the lines between these two important things to be blurred or mixed up because i really care about i really care she finished he brought her fingers to his lips so do i sensing that the mood was friendly again she smiled you know what i like about you donovan what you can do stuff like that kissingmyhand stuff and not look goofy doing it you humble me sutherland he said in a strained voice you positively humble me hours later when the night was quiet and the moonlight dim she turned to him in sleep and in sleep her arms slid around him her body curved to his he brushed the hair back from her temples as she nestled her head on his shoulder he rubbed his thumb over the stone on her finger if he left it there let his mind drift he could join her in whatever dream her heart was weaving it was tempting almost as tempting as waking her before he could decide which to choose he had a flash of the stables the smell of hay and sweat and the distressed whicker of the mare mel blinked awake as she felt him pull away what what go back to sleep he ordered reaching for a shirt where are you going psyches ready to foal im going to the stables oh without thinking she climbed out to search for her clothes ill go with you should we call the vet ana will come oh she fumbled with her buttons in the dark should i call her ana will come he said again and left her to finish dressing mel hurried after him pulling on boots on the run should i like boil water or something halfway down the stairs he stopped and kissed her for coffee thanks they always boil water she mumbled trudging into the kitchen by the time the coffee was scenting the room she heard the sound of a car three cups mel decided figuring it was useless to question how anastasia had known to come she found both cousins in the stables ana was kneeling beside the mare murmuring beside her were two leather pouches and a rolled cloth shes all right isnt she mel asked i mean shes healthy yes ana stroked psyches neck shes fine just fine her voice was as soothing as a cool breeze in the desert the mare responded to it with a quiet whinny it wont take long relax sebastian its not the first foal to be born in the world its her first he shot back feeling foolish he knew it would be all right he could have told them what sex the foal would be but that didnt make it any easier to wait while his beloved psyche suffered through the pangs mel offered him a mug have some coffee papa you could always go pace in the next stall with eros you might keep him calm sebastian ana tossed over her shoulder itll help all right coffee mel eased into the stall to offer ana a mug yes a little she sat back on her heels to sip sorry mel said when she saw anas eyes go wide i tend to make it strong its all right itll last me for the next couple of weeks she opened a pouch and shook some dried leaves and petals into her hand whats that just some herbs ana said as she fed them to the mare to help her with the contractions she chose three crystals from the other pouch and placed them on the mares quivering side she was murmuring now in gaelic the crystals should slide off mel thought staring at them it was gravity basic physics but they remained steady even as the laboring horse shuddered you have good hands ana said stroke her head mel complied i really dont know anything about birthing well i had to learn the basics when i was a cop but i never maybe i should just stroke her head ana repeated gently the rest is the most natural thing in the world perhaps it was natural mel thought later as she sebastian ana and the mare labored to bring the foal into the world but it was also miraculous she was slick with sweat her own and the horses wired from coffee and giddy with the idea of helping life into the light a dozen times throughout the hours they worked she saw the changes in anas eyes from cool calm gray to smoky concern from warm amusement to such deep depthless compassion that mels own eyes stung in response once shed been sure she saw pain in them a wild terrified pain that faded only after sebastian spoke sharply to his cousin only to give her a moments relief shed said and sebastian had shaken his head after that it had happened quickly and mel had scrambled to help oh wow was the best she could do as she stared at the mare going about the business of cleaning her new son i cant believe it there he is just like that its always a fresh amazement ana picked up her pouches and her medical instruments psyches fine she continued as she rolled the instruments in the apron shed put on before the birthing the colt too ill come back around this evening for another look but id say mother and son are perfect thank you ana sebastian pulled her against him for a hug my pleasure you did very well for your first foaling mel it was incredible well im going to get cleaned up and head home i think ill sleep till noon ana kissed sebastians cheek and then just as casually kissed mels congratulations what a way to spend the night mel murmured and leaned her head against sebastians shoulder im glad you were here so am i i never saw anything born before it makes you realize just how fantastic the whole business is she yawned hugely and exhausting i wish i could sleep till noon why dont you he tilted his head to kiss her why dont we i have a business to run and since im going to be away from it for a couple of weeks i have a lot of loose ends to tie up you have one to tie up here i do absolutely he swung her up stained shirt grubby hands and all a few hours ago i was lying in bed thinking about sneaking into one of your dreams with you or just waking you up sneaking into one of my dreams she gave him a hand by pushing open the door can you do that oh sutherland have some faith in any case he continued carrying her straight through the kitchen and into the hall before i did either we were distracted so before you go in to work to tie up loose ends well tie some of our own right here interesting thought you may not have noticed however that were both a mess ive noticed he marched through the master bedroom into the bath were going to have a shower good idea i think sebastian she shrieked with laughter as he stepped into the shower stall fully dressed and turned on the water idiot i still have my boots on he grinned not for long chapter contents prev next mel wasnt sure how she felt about being mrs donovan ryan it certainly seemed to her that mary ellen ryan her cover persona was a singularly boring individual more interested in fashion and manicures than in anything of real importance she had to agree it was a good setup damn good she mused as she stepped out onto the deck of the house and studied the glimmer of lake tahoe under the moonlight the house itself was nothing to sneeze at two sprawling levels of contemporary comfort it was tastefully furnished decorated with bold colors to reflect the style of its owners mary ellen and donovan ryan formerly of seattle were a modern couple who knew what they wanted what they wanted most of course was a child shed been impressed with the house when theyd arrived the day before impressed enough to comment on the fact that she hadnt expected the fbi to be able to provide such cozy digs so quickly it was then that sebastian had casually mentioned that it was one of his properties something hed had a whim to pick up about six months before coincidence or witchcraft mel thought with a grimace you be the judge ready for a night on the town sweetheart her grimace turned into a scowl as she turned to sebastian youre not going to start calling me all those dopey names just because were supposed to be married heaven forbid he stepped out on the deck looking mel was forced to admit about as gorgeous as a man could get in his black dinner suit lets have a look at you i put it all on she said struggling not to grumble right down to the underwear you set out youre such a good sport the sarcasm was light and friendly and made her lips twitch into a reluctant smile taking her hand he turned her in a circle yes he thought the red evening pants had been an excellent choice the fitted silver jacket went quite well with them as did the ruby drops at her ears you look wonderful try to act like you believe it i hate wearing heels and do you know what they did to my hair his lips curved as he flicked a finger over it it was sleeked back in a sassy sideparted bob very chic easy for you to say you didnt have some maniacal woman with a french accent glopping up your head with god knows what spraying stuff on it snipping and crimping and whatnot until you wanted to scream hard day huh thats not the half of it i had to get my nails done you have no idea what thats like they come at you with these little scissors and probes and files and smelly bottles and they talk to you about their boyfriends and ask personal questions about your sex life and you have to act like youre just enjoying the hell out of it i almost had to have a facial she shuddered with complete sincerity i dont know what theyd have done to me but i said i had to get home and fix dinner a narrow escape if i really had to go to a beauty parlor once a week for the rest of my life i think id slit my throat buck up sutherland right she sighed feeling better well it wasnt hard to start spreading it around how i had this wonderful husband and this great new house and how wed been trying for years to have a baby they just lap that kind of stuff up i went on about how wed had all these tests and had been trying these fertility drugs and how long the lists were at adoption agencies they were very sympathetic good job better i got the name of two lawyers and a doctor the doctors supposed to be some miracle gynecologist one of the lawyers was the manicurists cousin and the other was supposed to have helped the sisterinlaw of this lady getting a permanent to adopt two romanian babies last year i believe i follow that sebastian said after a moment i figured we should check it out tomorrow im going to the health club while theyre pummeling me i can go through the routine theres no law that says you cant enjoy a sauna and massage while youre at it she hesitated and was grateful that the roomy pockets of the evening pants made a home for her hands it makes me feel i know youre putting a lot of your money into this i have plenty he tipped a finger under her chin if i didnt want to use it this way i wouldnt i remember how rose looked when you brought her to me mel and i remember mrs frost were in this together i know she curled her fingers around his wrist i should be thanking you instead of complaining but you complain so well when she grinned he kissed her come on sutherland lets gamble im feeling lucky the silver palace was one of tahoes newest and most opulent hotel casinos white swans glided in the silvery waters of the lobby pool and mansized urns exploded with exotic flowers the staff was dressed in spiffy tuxedos with trademark silver ties and cummerbunds they passed a number of elegant shops displaying everything from diamonds and furs to tshirts mel figured theyd aligned them close enough to the casino to tempt any winners to put their money back into the hotel the casino itself was crowded with sound the chinkchink of coins pouring out of slots echoing from the high ceilings there was the hubbub of voices the clatter of the roulette wheels the smell of smoke and liquor and perfumes and of course of money some joint mel commented taking a gander at the knights and fair ladies painted on the windowless walls whats your game she shrugged theyre all suckers games trying to win against the house is like trying to row upstream with one oar you might make some progress but the currents going to carry you down sooner or later he nipped lightly at her ear youre not here to be practical were on our second honeymoon remember sweetie pie yuck she said distinctly through a bright loving smile okay lets buy some chips she opted to start off with the slots deciding they were mindless enough to allow her to play while still absorbing her surroundings they were there to make contact with jasper gumm the man whod held parklands iou mel was well aware it could take several nights to reach that next step she lost steadily then won back a few dollars automatically feeding the coins back into the machine she found there was something oddly appealing about the whoosh and jingle the occasional squeal from another player the bells and lights that rang and flashed when someone hit the jackpot it was relaxing she realized and tossed a smile over her shoulder to sebastian i dont guess the house has to worry about me breaking the bank perhaps if you went at it less aggressively he put a hand over hers as she pulled the lever lights whirled bells clanged oh her eyes went huge as coins began to shoot into the basket oh wow thats five hundred she did a little dance then threw her arms around him i won five hundred dollars she gave him a big smacking kiss then froze with her mouth an inch from his oh god donovan you cheated what a thing to say outwitting a machine isnt cheating he could see her sense of fair play warring with her elation come on you can lose it back at blackjack i guess its okay its for a higher cause absolutely laughing she began to scoop the coins into the bucket beside the machine i like to win so do i they scoped out the tables sipping champagne and playing the part of an affectionate couple on a night out she tried not to take it too seriously the attention he paid her the fact that his hand was always there when she reached for it they were lovers yes but they werent in love they cared for and respected each other but that was a long way from happilyeverafter the ring on her finger was only a prop the house they shared only a cover one day she would have to give the ring back and move out of the house they might continue to see each other at least for a time until his work and hers took them in different directions people didnt last in her life shed come to accept that or always had before now when she thought of heading off in that different direction alone without him there was an emptiness inside her that was almost unbearable what is it instinctively he put a hand at the base of her neck to rub youre tensing up nothing nothing even with the rule about him not looking into her mind he was much too perceptive i guess im impatient to move lets try this table see what happens he didnt press though he was quite certain that something more than the case was troubling her when they took their seats at a fivedollar table he slipped an arm around her shoulders so that they played the cards together she played well he noted her practical nature and quick wits keeping her even with the house for the first hour he could see by the casual way she scanned the room that she was taking everything in the security guards the cameras the twoway glass on the second level sebastian ordered more champagne and began to do his own probing the man next to him was sweating over a seventeen and worrying that his wife suspected he was having an affair his wife sat next to him chainsmoking and trying to imagine how the dealer would look naked sebastian fastidiously left her to it next to mel was a cowboy type tossing back bourbon and branch water while he won at a slow but steady pace his mind was a jumble of thoughts about treasury bonds livestock and the spread of cards he was also wishing that the little filly beside him had come to the table alone sebastian smiled to himself wondering how mel would feel about being called a little filly as he mentally roamed the table sebastian got impressions of boredom excitement desperation and greed he found what he wanted in the young couple directly across from him they were from columbus on the third night of their honeymoon they were barely old enough to be at the tables they were deliriously in love and they had decided after much calculation that the excitement of gambling was worth the hundreddollar stake they were down to fifty now and they were having the time of their lives sebastian saw the husband jerry was his name hesitating over hitting fifteen he gave him a little push jerry signaled for another card and went popeyed when he pulled a six with a subtle and enjoyable magic sebastian had young jerry doubling his stake then tripling it while the young couple gasped and giggled over their astonishing luck theyre sure raking it in mel commented mmm sebastian sipped his wine oblivious to the gentle persuasion jerry began to up his bets word spread as it does in such places that there was a winner at table three people began to mill around applauding and slapping the baffled jerry on the shoulder as his winnings piled up to three thousand oh jerry his new wife karen clung to him maybe we should stop its almost enough for a down payment on a house maybe we should just stop sorry sebastian thought and gave her a little mental nudge karen bit her lip no keep going she buried her face against his shoulder and laughed its like magic the comment had mel looking up from her own cards and sending sebastian a narroweyed look donovan shh he patted her hand i have my reasons mel began to understand them as the nearly delirious jerry hovered at the tenthousand dollar mark a husky man in a tuxedo approached the table he had a dignified bearing to go with smoothly tanned skin a suntipped mustache and expertly styled hair mel was certain he was the kind of man most women would look at more than twice but she took an instant dislike to his eyes they were pale blue and though they were smiling she felt a quick chill race up her spine bad business she muttered and felt sebastians hand close over hers the crowd that had gathered cheered again as the dealer lost to jerry on nineteen this seems to be your lucky night boy ill say jerry looked up at the newcomer with dazed eyes ive never won anything before in my life are you staying at the hotel yeah me and my wife he gave karen a squeeze this is the first night we tried the tables then allow me to congratulate you personally im jasper gumm this is my hotel mel slanted sebastian a look pretty sneaky way to get a look at him a roundabout route he agreed but an enjoyable one hmm have your young hero and heroine finished for the evening oh yes theyre quite finished excuse me a minute taking her glass mel got up to stroll around the table sebastian had been right the young couple were already making noises about cashing in and were busily thanking gumm be sure to come back gumm told them we like to think that everyone at the silver palace walks away a winner when gumm turned mel made certain she was directly in his path a quick movement and her champagne splattered oh i beg your pardon she brushed at his damp sleeve how clumsy of me not at all it was my fault easing away from the dispersing crowd he took out a handkerchief to dry her hand im afraid i was distracted he glanced at her empty glass and i owe you a drink no thats kind of you but it was nearly empty she flashed him a smile fortunately for your suit i suppose i was a little curious about all those chips my husband and i were across the table from that young couple and not having nearly their luck then i definitely owe you a drink gumm took her arm just as sebastian walked up darling youre supposed to drink the champagne not pour it on people as if she were flustered she laughed and ran a hand down his arm ive already apologized no harm done gumm assured them as he offered sebastian a hand jasper gumm donovan ryan my wife mary ellen a pleasure are you guests of the hotel no actually weve just moved to tahoe sebastian sent an affectionate glance to mel were taking a few days as a kind of second honeymoon before we get back to business welcome to the community now i definitely must replace that champagne he signaled to a roving waitress its very kind of you mel glanced around approvingly you have a wonderful place here now that were neighbors i hope youll enjoy the facilities we have an excellent dining room as he spoke gumm took stock the womans jewelry was discreet and expensive the mans dinner suit was expertly tailored both of them showed the panache of quiet affluence just the type of clientele he preferred when the waitress returned with a fresh bottle and glasses gumm poured the wine himself what business are you in mr donovan real estate mary ellen and i spent the last few years in seattle and we decided it was time for a change my business allows me to be flexible and yours gumm asked mel ive recently retired at least for a while i thought id like keeping a home ah and children no her smile wobbled as she looked down at her glass no not yet but i think the weather here the sun the lake would be a wonderful place to raise a family there was a trace just a hint of desperation in her voice im sure please enjoy the silver palace dont be strangers oh im sure well be back sebastian assured him nicely done he murmured to mel when they were alone i thought so do you think we should go back to the tables for a while or just wander about looking mooneyed at each other he chuckled started to pull her close for a kiss then stopped his hand on her shoulder well well sometimes things just fall neatly into place what drink your champagne my love and smile he turned her gently keeping his arm around her as they wandered toward the roulette table now look over there to the woman gumm is speaking with the redhead by the staircase i see her mel leaned her head against sebastians shoulder fivefive a hundred and ten light complexion twentyeight maybe thirty years old her names linda or it is now it was susan when she checked into the motel with david shes mel nearly took a step forward before she stopped herself whats she doing here sleeping with gumm i imagine waiting for the next job we have to find out how much they know how close they are to the top grimly she finished off the champagne you work your way ill work mine agreed when mel saw that linda was heading for the ladies lounge she shoved her empty glass into sebastians hand hold this of course darling he murmured to her retreating back mel bided her time sitting at one of the curvy dressing tables freshening her lipstick powdering her nose when linda sat at the table next to hers she began the process all over again shoot mel said in disgust examining her fingers i chipped a nail linda sent her a sympathetic glance dont you hate that ill say especially since i just had them done this morning i have the worst luck with them she searched through her bag for the nail file she knew wasnt there your nails are gorgeous thank you the redhead held up a hand to examine i have a marvelous manicurist do you mel shifted and crossed her legs i wonder my husband and i just moved here from seattle i really need to find the right beautician health club that sort of thing you cant do better than right here at the hotel for either nonguest membership fees for the health club are a bit pricey but believe me its well worth it she fluffed at her luxuriant mane and the beauty shop is topnotch i appreciate that ill look into it just tell them linda sent you linda glass i will mel said as she rose thanks a lot no problem linda slicked on lip gloss if the woman joined the club she thought shed get a nice commission business was business a few hours later mel was flopped on her stomach in the center of the bed making a list she wore a baggy pajama top her favored lounging choice and had already disarranged her sleek coiffure into tousled spikes with restless fingers shed be using the silver palaces facilities all right she thought starting tomorrow she would join their health club check out their beauty parlor and lord help her make an appointment for a facial or whatever other torture they had in mind with any luck she could be cozied up to linda glass and exchanging girl talk within twentyfour hours what are you up to sutherland plan b she said absently i like to have a plan b in reserve in case plan a bombs do you think leg waxing hurts i wouldnt hazard a guess he ran a fingertip down her calf however yours feel smooth enough to me well i have to be prepared to spend half my day in this place so i have to have something for them to do to me she cocked her head to look up at him he was standing beside the bed wearing the bottoms of the baggy pajamas and swirling a brandy i guess we look like a unit she thought like an actual couple having a little chat before bedtime the idea had her doodling on the pad do you really like that stuff which stuff that brandy it always tastes like medicine to me perhaps youve never had the right kind he handed her the snifter mel braced up on her elbows to sample it while he straddled her and sat back on his heels youre still tense he commented and began to rub her shoulders a little wired maybe i guess im starting to think this really may work the job i mean its going to work while youre having your incredibly long and lovely legs waxed im going to be playing golf at the same club gumm belongs to far from convinced the brandy had anything going for it she looked back over her shoulder then well see who finds out more wont we we will indeed theres this spot on my shoulder blade she arched like a cat yeah thats it i wanted to ask you about that couple tonight the big winners what about them he pushed the shirt up out of his way and pleased himself by exploring the long narrow span of her back i know it was your way of getting gumm to the table but it doesnt seem exactly straight you know making him win ten thousand i merely influenced his decisions and i imagine gumms taken in much more than that by selling children yeah yeah and i can sort of see the justice in that but that couple what if they try to do it again and lose their shirts maybe they wont be able to stop and he chuckled pressing his lips to the center of her back im more subtle than that young jerry and karen will put a down payment on a nice house in the suburbs astonish their friends with their good fortune theyll both agree that theyve used up all of their luck on this one shot and rarely gamble again theyll have three children and theyll have a spot of fairly serious marital trouble in their sixth year but theyll work it well mel wondered if shed ever get used to it in that case in that case he murmured running his lips down her spine why dont you put it out of your mind and concentrate on smiling to herself she set the brandy on the chest at the foot of the bed maybe i could she flipped then twisted getting a solid grip before shoving him back on the bed with her hands clamped on his she leaned down until they were nosetonose gotcha he grinned then nipped her lower lip yes you do and i might just keep you a while she kissed the tip of his nose then his cheek his chin his lips the brandy tastes better on you than it does in the glass try again just to be sure with humor bright in her eyes she lowered her mouth to his and sampled long and deep mmmhmm a definite improvement i do like your taste donovan she linked her fingers with his pleased that he made no move to break the contact when she slid down to nibble at his throat she teased him toying with his desire and her own as she savored his flesh warm here cooler there the rich beat of a pulse beneath her lips she enjoyed the shape of his body the width of his shoulders the hard smooth chest the quick quiver of his flat belly under her touch she liked the way her hand looked gliding over him her skin shades lighter than his the ring glowing with its meld of colors against the silver rubbing her cheek over him she felt not just passion but a deep drugging emotion that welled up like wine and clouded her senses her throat stung with it her eyes burned and her heart all but melted out of her chest with a sigh she brought her lips back to his it was she who was the witch tonight he thought wallowing in her she who had the power and the gift she had taken his heart his soul his needs his future and had them cupped delicately in her hands he murmured his love for her again and again but the language of his blood was gaelic and she didnt understand they moved together flowing over the bed as if it were an enchanted lake as the moon began to set shifting night closer to day they were lost in each other surrounded by the magic each brought to the other when she rose over him her body glimmering in the lamplight her eyes dark with desires heavy with pleasures he thought she had never looked more beautiful or more his he reached for her and she answered their bodies blended the moment was sweet and fine and fierce she arched back taking more of him shuddering with the glory of it their hands met and held gripping firm as they rose toward the next pinnacle when they could go no higher when he had emptied himself into her and their flesh was weak and wet from love she slid down to him hardly aware that her eyes were damp she buried her face at his throat shivering as his arms came around her dont let go she murmured all night dont let go all night i wont he held her while her heart struggled with the knowledge that it loved and until her body gave way to weariness and slept chapter contents prev next it wasnt so difficult to get a look at the appointment books for the beauty shop and health club in the silver palace if you smiled enough and tipped enough mel knew you could get a look at most anything and by tipping a little more it was easy to match her schedule with linda glasss that was the simple part the hard part for mel was the prospect of spending an entire day wearing a leotard when she took her place in the aerobics class with a dozen other women she sent a friendly smile in lindas direction so youre giving it a try the redhead checked to see that her mane was still bundled attractively in its band i really appreciate the tip mel responded with the move ive missed over a week it doesnt take long to get out of shape dont i know it whenever i travel she broke off when the instructor switched on a recorder out poured a catchy rock ballad time to stretch ladies all smiles and firm muscles the instructor turned to face the mirror at the head of the class now reach she said in her perky voice as she demonstrated mel followed along through the stretches and the warmup and into the more demanding routines though she considered herself in excellent shape she had to give all her attention to the moves obviously shed plopped herself down in a very advanced class and there was a matter of grace and style as well as endurance before the class was halfover she developed a deep loathing for the bouncy instructor with her pert ponytail and cheerful voice one more leg lift and im jumping her mel muttered although she hadnt meant to speak aloud it was apparently the perfect move linda flashed her a grim smile im right behind you she panted as she executed what the instructor gleefully called hitch kicks she cant be over twenty she deserves to die mel chuckled and puffed when the music stopped the women sagged together in a sweaty heap after pulse checks and cooldowns mel dropped down next to linda and buried her face in a towel thats what i get for taking ten days off with a weary sigh mel lowered the towel i cant believe i scheduled myself for an entire day i know what you mean ive got weight training next really mel offered her a surprised smile so do i no kidding linda blotted her neck then rose i guess we might as well go suffer through it together they moved from weights to stationary bikes from bikes to treadmills the more they sweated the friendlier they became conversation roamed from exercise to men from men to backgrounds they shared a sauna and a whirlpool and ended the session with a massage i cant believe you gave up your career to keep a house stretched on the padded table linda folded her arms under her chin i cant imagine it im not used to it myself mel sighed as the masseuse worked her way down her spine to tell you the truth i havent quite figured out what to do with myself yet but its a kind of experiment oh she hesitated just enough to let linda know it was a sensitive subject you see my husband and i have been trying to start a family no luck since weve gone through the whole route of tests and procedures without results i had this idea that if i quit for a while maybe shucked off some of the career tension well something might happen it must be difficult it is we both i suppose since were only children ourselves and dont have anyone but each other we really want a large family it seems so unjust really here we have this wonderful house were solid financially and our marriage is good but we just cant seem to have children if the wheels were clicking in lindas head she masked it with sympathy i guess youve been trying for a while now years its really my fault the doctors have told us theres a very slim chance that id be able to conceive i dont mean to offend you but have you ever thought of adoption thought about it mel managed a sad smile i cant tell you how many lists were on both of us agree that we could love a child that wasnt biologically ours we feel we have so much to give but she sighed again i suppose its selfish but we really want a baby it might be a little easier to adopt an older child but were holding out weve been told it could take years i dont know how well handle all those empty rooms she made her eyes fill then blinked away the tears im sorry i shouldnt go on about it i get maudlin thats all right linda stretched her arm between the tables to squeeze mels hand i guess no one can really understand like another woman they shared an iced juice and a spinach salad for lunch mel allowed linda to guide the conversation gently back to her personal life as the naive and deeply emotional mary ellen ryan she poured out information about her marriage her hopes her fears she sprinkled in a few tears for good measure and bravely wiped them away you arent thinking marriage yourself mel asked me oh no linda laughed i tried it once a long time ago its too confining for me jasper and i have a very nice arrangement were fond of each other but we dont let it interfere with business i like being able to come and go as i please i admire you you coldhearted floozy before i met donovan i had the idea that id go it alone through life carving out my niche not that i regret falling in love and getting married but i guess we all envy the woman who makes her own it suits me but youre doing all right youve got a guy whos crazy about you and hes done well enough that youve got a nice home just about perfect mel looked down at her empty glass just about once you have that baby itll be perfect linda patted her hand take my word for it mel dragged herself home tossing her gym bag one way and kicking her shoes the other there you are sebastian was looking down from the upstairs balcony i was about to send out a search party youd do better with a stretcher his smile faded are you hurt he was already starting down the steps i knew i shouldve kept an eye on you hurt she all but growled at him you dont know the half of it i had the aerobics instructor from hell her name was penny if that gives you a clue and she was cute as a damn button then i got handed over to some amazon queen named madge who put me on weights and all these hideous shiny machines i pumped and lifted and squatted and crunched wincing she pressed a hand to her stomach and all ive had to eat all day is a few stingy leaves aw he kissed her brow poor baby her eyes narrowed im in the mood to punch someone donovan it could be you how about if i fix you a nice snack her lips moved into a pout have we got any frozen pizza i sincerely doubt it come on he put a friendly arm around her shoulders as he led her into the kitchen you can tell me all about it while you eat she dropped down agreeably at the smoked glass kitchen table it was quite a day you know she linda does this whole routine twice a week inspired mel popped up again to root through the cupboards for a bag of chips i dont know why anybodyd want to be that healthy she said with her mouth full she seems okay really i mean when you talk to her she comes across as a normal bright lady eyes grim she sat again then you keep talking and you get to see that shes plenty bright shes also cold as a fish i take it you talked quite a bit sebastian glanced up from his construction of a kingsize sandwich hell yes i spilled my guts to her she knows how i lost my parents when i was twenty how i met you a couple years later the whole loveatfirstsight routine and you were pretty romantic she crunched into a chip was i he set the sandwich and a glass of her favorite soft drink in front of her you bet showered me with roses took me dancing and for long moonlit walks you were nuts about me he smiled as she bit hungrily into the sandwich im sure i was you begged me to marry you lord this is good she closed her eyes and swallowed where was i i was begging you to marry me right she gestured with her glass before drinking but i was cautious i did move in with you eventually and then i let you wear me down youve done everything to make my life a fairy tale since i sound like a terrific guy oh yeah i really played that up we are the worlds happiest couple except for our one heartbreak she frowned but kept on eating you know in the beginning i was starting to feel pretty bad about stringing her along i knew it was a job an important job but it just seemed so calculating she was nice friendly and i felt uncomfortable the way i was setting her up she reached for the chips again nibbling as she worked through her own thoughts then once i brought up the baby business i could practically see her go sharp you know all those soft edges just cleaved away she was still smiling and sympathetic and friendly as hell but she was clicking it all into that brain of hers and figuring the angles so i didnt feel bad about letting her pry more information out of me i want her donovan youll be seeing her again soon day after tomorrow at the beauty parlor for the works with a little moan mel pushed her plate away she thinks im a woman trying to fill the time on her hands she grimaced shopping was mentioned how we suffer for our work very funny since you spent the morning hitting a little white ball around i dont suppose i mentioned that i detest golf no she grinned good tell me how it went we ran into each other on the fourth tee quite by accident of course of course so we ended up playing the rest of the course together sebastian picked up her halffinished drink and sipped he finds my wife quite charming naturally we discussed business his and mine hes interested in making some investments so i made a few real estate suggestions clever i do have some property in oregon ive been thinking about selling anyway we had a drink afterward and discussed sports and other manly things i managed to drop into the conversation the fact that i hoped to have a son not just a kid as i said it was a manly sort of event a son to carry on the name to play ball with slipped more seamlessly into the conversation girls play ball she muttered never mind did he pick up on it only quite delicately i fumbled a bit looked distressed and changed the subject why she straightened in her chair if you had him on the line whyd you cut him loose because it felt right youll have to trust me on this mel gumm would have been suspicious if id taken him into my confidence so quickly with you and the woman its different more natural she mulled it over and though she was still frowning nodded all right im inclined to agree and weve certainly laid the groundwork i spoke with devereaux just before you got in they should have a full workup on linda glass by tomorrow and hell let us know as soon as gumm makes a move to check out our story good enough also were invited to dine with gumm and his lady on friday evening mel cocked a brow even better she leaned forward to kiss him you did good work donovan i suppose we make a fair team have you finished eating for now then i think we should prepare for friday night prepare what she shot him a suspicious look as he pulled her to her feet if youre going to start fiddling around with what im supposed to wear not at all its this way he told her as they walked out of the kitchen were going to be a devoted and deliriously happy married couple yeah so madly in love he continued drawing her toward the stairs i know the drill donovan well i firmly believe in the method school of acting so im quite sure it will help our performance if we spend as much time as possible making love oh i see she turned twining her arms around his neck and backing into the bedroom well like you said we have to suffer for our work mel was certain that one day she would look back and laugh or at least she would look back with the grim satisfaction of having survived since going into law enforcement she had been kicked cursed slugged and insulted had doors slammed in her face and on her foot shed been threatened propositioned and on one memorable occasion shed been shot at all of that was nothing compared to what was being done to her in the silver woman the hotels exclusive and expansive beauty salon offered everything from a wash and set to something exotically and terrifyingly termed body wrapping mel hadnt had the courage for that one but she was getting the treatment from head to toe and every inch between she arrived moments before linda and falling back on her established persona greeted the woman like an old friend during leg waxing which mel discovered quickly enough did hurt they discussed clothes and hairstyles smiling through gritted teeth mel was glad shed boned up for hours the night before with fashion magazines later while whatever pungent glop the beautician smeared on her face hardened mel chatted about how much she was enjoying living in tahoe our view of the lake is incredible i really cant wait until we get to know more people i love to entertain jasper and i can introduce you around linda offered as the pedicurist buffed her toenails being in the hotel business we know just about everyone youd want to know that would be marvelous mel chanced a look down and tried to look pleased rather than horrified that her toenails were being painted fuchsia donovan mentioned to me that he met jasper on the golf course at the club donovan just loves playing golf she said hoping it trapped him into spending hours on the green its more a passion than a hobby jaspers the same way i cant work up an interest in it myself she began to chat about different people she wanted mel to meet and about how they might get together for tennis or sailing mel agreed animatedly wondering if a person could actually die of boredom her face was scrubbed clean and cream was slathered on some sort of oil was squirted all over her hair and then plastic was wrapped around it i just love being pampered this way linda murmured they were both lying back in soft chairs having their hands massaged and their nails done me too mel said and prayed they were nearly finished i suppose thats why this job suits me most of the time i work nights so my days are free and i can make use of all the hotels benefits have you worked here long almost two years now she sighed its never dull i imagine you meet all sorts of fascinating people the highpowered sort thats what i like from what you were saying the other day your husband doesnt sound like small change mel would have grinned but she settled for an indulgent smile oh he does very well you could say that donovan has the magic touch they were rinsed their scalps were massaged mel actually found it quite enjoyable and it was nearly time for the finishing touches she realized that if linda didnt probe soon she would have to find an opening to bring up the subject herself you know mary ellen i was thinking about what you told me the other day oh mel feigned discomfort im so sorry about that linda dumping on you that way and so soon after wed met i guess i was feeling a little lost and homesick nonsense linda waved her glorious nails i think we just hit it off thats all you were comfortable with me yes i was but im more than a little embarrassed to think that i bored you with all that business about my personal life i wasnt bored at all i was touched her voice was smooth as silk with just the right touch of sympathy mel felt her hackles rising and it made me think please tell me if im getting too personal but have you ever considered private adoption you mean going through a lawyer who works with unwed mothers mel gave a long wistful sigh actually we did try that route once about a year ago we werent quite sure it was right it wasnt that the money was a problem but we were concerned about the legality and the morality but it all seemed perfect we even went so far as to have an interview with the mother our hopes were very high too high we picked our names and windowshopped for baby things it really looked as if it was going to happen at the last minute she backed out mel bit her lower lip as if to steady herself that must have been dreadful for you we both took it very hard to get that close and then nothing we havent discussed trying that way again since i can understand that but as it happens i do know of someone whos had a great deal of luck placing babies with adoptive parents mel closed her eyes she was afraid they would fill with derision not hope a lawyer yes i dont know him personally but as i said you meet a lot of people in this business and ive heard i dont want to promise or get your hopes up but if youd like i could check id be very grateful mel opened her eyes and met lindas in the mirror i cant tell you how grateful an hour later mel swung out of the hotel and into sebastians arms she laughed as he dipped her back for an exaggerated kiss what are you doing here playing the dutiful lovesick husband come to fetch his wife he held her at arms length and smiled her hair was fluffed into a sexy windblown look her eyes were deepened and enlarged with blending shadows and her lips were the same slick fuchsia as her nails in the name of finn sutherland what have they done to you dont smirk im not you look extraordinary stunning just not quite like my mel he tipped her chin up for another kiss who is this elegant polished woman im holding not as annoyed as she wanted to be she pulled a face youd better not make fun after what ive been through i actually had a bikini wax it was barbaric chuckling she linked her hands around his neck and my toenails are pink i cant wait to see he kissed her again lightly i have news me too why dont i take a walk with my gorgeous wife and tell her how gumms been putting out feelers on the estimable ryans of seattle all right she linked her fingers with his and ill tell you how out of the goodness of her heart linda glass is going to help us make contact with a lawyer about a private adoption we do work well together yes we do donovan pleased with herself she strolled beside him we certainly do from the presidential suite on the top floor of the silver palace gumm watched through the window a charming couple he commented to linda theyre certainly loopy for each other she sipped champagne as sebastian and mel walked off hand in hand the way she looks when she says his name almost makes me wonder if theyre really married ive had copies of the marriage certificate and other papers faxed in it all seems in order he tapped his fingers to his lips if they were a plant i cant imagine theyd be so easily intimate plant linda gave him a worried look come on jasper why would you even consider it theres no way back to us the business with the frosts concerns me well its too bad they lost the kid but we got our fee and we didnt leave a trail we left parkland i havent been able to locate him so he dropped off the edge of the world linda shrugged and moved over to press her body to gumms youve got nothing to worry about there you held his note and it was legit he saw you he wasnt seeing much of anything as panicked as he was plus it was dark and i was wearing a scarf parkland doesnt worry me she touched her lips to his weve got the touch babe being in an organization like this weve got so many covers and trapdoors theyll never come close to us and the money she loosened his tie just think how that money keeps pouring in you do like the money dont you he tugged down the zipper of her dress weve got that in common weve got lots in common this could be a big one for us we pass the ryans along there will be a nice fat commission in it i guarantee theyll pay the maximum for a kid the womans desperate to be a mommy ill do a little more checking still calculating he sank with her onto the couch no harm in that but im telling you jasper these two are primed no way we can lose no way mel and sebastian became a convivial foursome with gumm and linda they dined out enjoyed the casino lunched at the club and indulged in rousing doubles matches at tennis ten days of the high life was making mel edgy several times she ventured to ask linda about the lawyer she had spoken of and was told kindly to be patient they were introduced to dozens of people some of them mel found interesting and attractive others slick and suspicious she spent her days following the routine of a welltodo woman with time and money on her hands and her nights with sebastian she tried not to concern herself with her heart she had a job to do and if shed fallen in love doing it that was her problem to solve she knew he cared for her just as she knew he desired her it was a worry that he seemed so fond of the woman she pretended to be a woman she would cease to be as soon as the job was over not quite like my mel my mel he had said there was hope in that and she wasnt above clinging to it and as much as she wished the case were closed and justice served she began to dread the day when they would go home no longer married by design whatever her personal needs and private hopes she couldnt allow herself to put them ahead of what they were trying to do following a suggestion of lindas mel agreed to give a party after all she was supposed to be an enthusiastic entertainer a whiz of a homemaker and a society gem as she struggled into her little black dress she prayed she wouldnt make some telltale faux pas that showed her up as a phony damnation she swore as sebastian strolled into the bedroom problem darling zippers stuck she was half in and half out of the dress flushed harried and mad as a cat he was sorely tempted to help her the rest of the way out of it rather than in he gave the zipper a flick that sent it up to its home halfway up her back all done youre wearing the tourmaline he said reaching over her shoulder to touch the stone between her breasts morgana said it was good for stress i need all the help i can get turning she slipped regretfully into the heels which brought them eyetoeye its stupid but im really nervous the only kind of parties ive ever given involved pizza and beer did you see all that stuff downstairs yes and i also saw the caterers who will take care of it but im like the hostess im supposed to know what to do no youre supposed to tell other people what to do then take all the credit she smiled a little thats not so bad its just that somethings got to happen soon ill go out of my mind if it doesnt linda keeps making cryptic remarks about being able to help but i feel like ive been spinning wheels for the last week patience we take the next step tonight what do you mean she caught at his sleeve we said no holding back if you know something have seen something tell me it doesnt always work like a perfect mirror of events i know the person were looking for will be here tonight and ill recognize who it is weve played the game well so far mel and well play it out all right she took a deep breath what do you say honey bun shall we go down and get ready to greet our guests he winced dont call me honey bun shoot and i thought i was getting the hang of it she started down then stopped with a hand pressed to her stomach oh lord theres the bell here we go it wasnt really so bad mel discovered as the party flowed through the house and onto the deck everyone seemed to be having a dandy old time there was some nice classical music of sebastians choosing playing in the background the night was balmy enough that they could leave the doors wide and allow the guests to roam in and out the food if she did say so herself was excellent and if she didnt recognize half of the canapés it hardly mattered she accepted the compliments graciously there was wine and laughter and interesting conversation which she supposed made for a pretty good party and it was nice to watch sebastian move through the room to look over and see him smile at her or to have him stop beside her for a touch or a private word anyone looking at us would buy it she thought were the worlds happiest couple madly in love with each other she could almost buy it herself when his gaze moved in her direction and his eyes warmed sending those secret signals up her spine linda glided up looking dropdead gorgeous in a white offtheshoulder gown i swear the man cant keep his eyes off you if i could find his twin i might give marriage another shot after all theres no one else like him mel said sincerely enough believe me donovans one of a kind and hes all yours yes all mine well besides being lucky in love you throw a wonderful party your house is beautiful and linda calculated worth a good half a million on the market thank you but i really owe you for recommending the caterer hes a jewel anything i can do she squeezed mels hand and gave her a long look i mean that mel was quick do you have you oh i dont mean to nag but i havent been able to think about anything else for days no promises she said but then she winked there is someone id like you to meet you did say i could invite some people of course she slipped on her hostess mask you know i feel this is your party as much as mine you and jasper have become such good friends and were fond of you too come over this way so i can introduce you keeping mels hand in hers linda began weaving through the guests ill bring her back she said laughing i just need to steal her a moment ah here you are harriet harriet dear i want you to meet your hostess and my friend mary ellen ryan mary ellen harriet breezeport how do you do mel took the slim pale hand gently the woman was well into her sixties and had a fragile air that was accented by her snowwhite hair and half glasses delighted to meet you so kind of you to invite us her voice was hardly more than a whisper linda told me how charming you are this is my son ethan he was nearly as pale as his mother and wirethin his handshake was brisk and his eyes were as black as a birds lovely party thank you why dont i find you a chair mrs breezeport and something to drink oh i would dearly love a little wine the woman smiled wispily i dont want to be any bother not at all mel took her arm and led her to a chair what can i get you oh ethan will take care of it wont you ethan of course excuse me a good boy harriet said as her son walked off to the buffet table takes such good care of me she smiled up at mel linda tells me youve recently moved to tahoe yes my husband and i moved from seattle its quite a change indeed indeed ethan and i sometimes vacation here we keep a nice little condo they chatted while ethan brought back a plate with a few choice canapés and a small glass of wine linda had already slipped off when mel glanced over and saw sebastian approaching this is my husband mel slipped a hand through his arm donovan this is harriet and ethan breezeport linda said you were a dashing figure harriet offered a hand im afraid ive been hoarding your charming wife im often guilty of that myself in fact i have to steal her for a moment a small problem in the kitchen enjoy yourselves he nudged mel along and then finding no private spot ducked with her into a closet donovan for gods sake shh in the dim light his eyes were very bright its her he said quietly whos her and why are we standing in the closet the old woman shes the one the one mels mouth fell open excuse me do you expect me to believe that that fragile old lady is the head of a babynapping ring exactly he kissed her astonished mouth were closing in sutherland chapter contents prev next mel met harriet breezeport twice more over the next two days once for tea and again at a party if it hadnt been for her faith in sebastian mel would have laughed at the idea of the whisperyvoiced matron as the head of a criminal organization but she did have faith in him so she watched and played her part it was devereaux who fed them the information that neither harriet nor ethan breezeport owned a condo in tahoe nor in fact was there any record that either party existed still when the contact came it came from neither of them but from a tanned young man with a tennis racket mel had just finished a match with linda and was waiting over a glass of iced tea for sebastian to complete a round of golf with gumm the man approached wearing tennis whites and a dazzling smile mrs ryan yes im john silbey a mutual acquaintance pointed you out i wonder if i could have a word with you mel hesitated as she imagined a happily married woman might when approached by a strange man all right he sat laying the tennis racket across his tanned knees i realize this is a bit unorthodox mrs ryan but as i said we have mutual acquaintances ive been told you and your husband might be interested in my services really she arched a brow coolly but her heart was picking up rhythm you dont look like a gardener mr silbey though my husband and i are quite desperate for one no indeed he laughed heartily im afraid i cant help you there im a lawyer mrs ryan oh she tried for hopeful confusion and apparently pulled it off silbey leaned a little closer and spoke gently this isnt the usual way i solicit clients but when you were pointed out to me just now i thought it might be a good opportunity for us to become acquainted im told you and your husband are interested in a private adoption she moistened her lips and rattled the ice in her glass for good measure i weve hoped she said slowly weve tried its been very difficult all the agencies weve tried have such long waiting lists i understand and she could see that he did and that he was very pleased to find her emotional desperate and primed he touched her hand in sympathy we tried going through a lawyer before but the whole thing fell through at the last minute she pressed her lips together as if to steady them im not sure i could handle that kind of disappointment again its wrenching im sure i would hate to get your hopes up before we discuss this in more detail but i can tell you that ive represented several women who have for one reason or another required the placement of their child what they want for them is a good home a loving home its my job to find that mrs ryan and when i do i have to say its one of the most rewarding experiences a man can have and one of the most lucrative mel thought but she smiled tremulously we want very much to provide a good and loving home for a child mr silbey if you could help us i cant begin to tell you how grateful wed be he touched her hand again then if youre agreeable well talk further we could come to your office anytime you say actually id like to meet you and your husband under less restrictive circumstances at your home so that i can assure my client on how you live how you are together as a couple in your own habitat of course of course she said brimming with excitement dont have an office do you bucko whenever its convenient for you well im afraid im booked for the next couple of weeks oh she didnt have to feign disappointment oh well i suppose weve waited this long he waited a moment then smiled kindly i could spare an hour this evening unless you oh no she grabbed his hand in both of hers that would be wonderful im so grateful donovan and i thank you mr silbey i hope ill be able to help is seven oclock all right with you its fine she blinked out tears of gratitude when he left her she stayed in character certain there would be someone watching she dabbed at her eyes with a tissue pressed a hand to her lips sebastian found her sniffing into her watery iced tea mary ellen the sight of her redrimmed eyes and trembling lips brought instant concern darling whats wrong the moment he took her hands the jolt of excitement nearly rocked him back on his heels only sheer willpower kept the astonishment from showing oh donovan she scrambled to her feet spotting gumm over his shoulder im making a scene laughing she wiped at the tears im sorry jasper not at all gallantly he offered a silk handkerchief has someone upset you mary ellen no no she gave a little shuddering sob its good news marvelous news im just overreacting would you excuse us jasper give my regrets to linda i really need to speak with donovan alone of course he walked off to give them their privacy and mel buried her face in sebastians shoulder what the hell is going on he demanded in a soothing murmur as he stroked her hand contact all damp eyes and shaky smiles she drew her head back this sleazy lawyer hell i doubt he is a lawyer just plopped himself down and offered to help us with a private adoption look delighted i am he kissed her for his own enjoyment and for the benefit of their audience whats the deal out of the goodness of his heart and in consideration of a desperate woman hes agreed to come by tonight and discuss our needs in more detail very obliging of him oh yes i may not have your gifts but i could read his mind well enough one look at me and he thought patsy i could almost hear him calculating his take lets go home she slipped an arm around him the air around here is really bad well linda asked gumm as they watched sebastian and mel walk away like shooting fish in a barrel pleased with himself he signaled to a waiter theyre so giddy with the idea theyll ask the minimum amount of questions and pay the maximum fee he might be a little more cautious but hes so besotted with her hed do anything to make her happy ah love linda sneered its the best scam in town you got the merchandise picked out gumm ordered drinks then sat back to light a cigarette he wants a boy so i think well oblige him since hes paying top dollar weve got a nurse in new jersey ready to select a healthy male right out of the hospital good you know im fond of mary ellen maybe ill throw her a shower an excellent idea i wouldnt be surprised if in a year or two theyd be in the market again he checked his watch id better call harriet and tell her she can start pushing buttons better you than me linda said with a grimace the old bag gives me the creeps the old bag runs a smooth setup he reminded her yeah and business is business linda picked up the glass the waiter set in front of her and raised it in a toast to the happy mommyanddaddytobe to an easy twentyfive grand better linda touched her glass to his much better mel knew her part and was ready when silbey arrived promptly at seven her hand trembled a bit as she accepted his im so glad you could come its my pleasure she led him into the sprawling living room chattering brightly weve only been in the house a couple of weeks there are still a lot of changes i want to make theres a room upstairs that would make a wonderful nursery i hope donovan sebastian stood across the room pouring a drink mr silbey is here sebastian knew his part as well he appeared to be reserved and nervous as he offered silbey a drink after a few social inanities they sat sebastian and mel close together on the sofa hands linked in mutual support all solicitude silbey opened his briefcase if i could just ask you a few questions get to know you a bit they filled in their established backgrounds while silbey took notes but it was their body language that told the tale the quick hopeful glances exchanged the touches silbey continued the interview completely unaware that every word he spoke was being transmitted to two federal agents in an upstairs room clearly pleased with the progress he was making silbey sent them an encouraging look i have to say in my personal and professional opinion you would make excellent parents the selecting of a home for a child is a very delicate matter he pontificated for a while on stability responsibility and the special requirements of raising an adopted child mels stomach turned even as she beamed at him i can see that youve both thought this through very seriously very thoroughly there is however a point you may want to discuss at more length the expenses i know it sounds crass putting a price on something we should consider a miracle but there is a reality to be accepted theres a matter of medical expenses and compensation to the mother my fee court costs and filing all of which i will handle we understand sebastian said wishing he was free to wring silbeys neck ill require a twentyfivethousanddollar retainer and another hundred and twentyfive thousand at the end of the legalities this will include all the expenses of the mother sebastian started to speak he was after all a businessman but mel gripped his hand tighter and hit him with a pleading glance the money wont be a problem he said and touched her cheek all right then silbey smiled i have a client shes very young unmarried she wants very much to finish college and has come to the difficult decision that raising a child on her own would make this impossible ill be able to provide you with her medical background and that of the father shes quite firm that there be no other information divulged with your permission i will tell her about you and give her my recommendation oh mel pressed her fingers to her lips oh yes to be frank youre exactly the kind of parents she was hoping for i believe well be able to complete this with everyones best interest served mr silbey mel leaned her head against sebastians shoulder when i mean how soon would we know and the child what can you tell us id say youd know within fortyeight hours as far as the child he smiled benignly my client is due to deliver any day i have a feeling my call is going to ease her mind tremendously by the time they had walked silbey to the door mel had shed a few more tears the moment she was alone with sebastian fury burned her eyes dry that sonofa i know he put his hands on her shoulders she was vibrating like a plucked string well get them mel well get them all youre damn right we will she paced to the stairs and back you know what this means dont you theyre going to steal a baby an infant probably right out of a hospital or clinic logical as always he murmured watching her carefully i cant stand it she pressed a hand to her churning stomach i cant bear the idea of some poor woman lying in a hospital bed being told her babys been stolen it wont take long he wanted to slip into her thoughts to see for himself just what was in her head but hed given his word we have to play this through yeah that was just what she was going to do he wouldnt approve she decided and neither would the feds but there were times you had to follow your heart wed better make sure the boys upstairs got all of that she took a deep breath then i think we should do what any happy expectant couple would do which is go out and tell our dearest friends and celebrate mel sat in the lounge at the silver palace with a glass of champagne in her hand and a smile on her lips to new and valued friends linda laughed and clinked glasses oh no to the happy parentstobe well never be able to thank you she looked from linda to gumm both of you nonsense gumm patted her hand linda merely made an inquiry to a friend were both delighted such a small gesture reaped such benefits we still have to sign papers sebastian pointed out and wait for the mothers approval were not going to worry about any of that linda waved details away what we have to do now is plan a baby shower id love to give you one mary ellen up in the penthouse though she was getting damned tired of weeping mel let her eyes fill thats so tears spilled over as she got to her feet excuse me an emotional wreck she rushed off to the ladies room as shed hoped linda followed her a moment later what an idiot i am dont be silly linda sat beside her slipped an arm around her they say expectant mothers are apt to cry at the drop of a hat with a shaky laugh mel dried her eyes i suppose would you mind terribly getting me a drink of water before i try to repair the damage sit right there mel figured she had twenty seconds at best so she moved fast she flipped open lindas beaded evening bag pushed through past lipstick and perfume and gripped the penthouse key she was slipping it into the pocket of her evening pants when linda came back with a cup thanks mel smiled up at her thanks a lot the next step was to get away from the group for at least twenty minutes without being detected she suggested a celebratory dinner with a little gambling as an appetizer always the gracious host gumm insisted on making the arrangements in the dining room himself marking time mel managed to slip away from sebastian and linda in the crowd at the crap table she took the express elevator keeping well to the back of the glass walls the top floor was silent as she stepped out mel checked her watch then fit the key into the lock of the penthouse she didnt need much with the evidence they already had she needed only enough to link gumm and linda with silbey or the breezeports she judged gumm as a man who kept records on everything and kept them cleverly maybe it was rash she thought as she headed straight for a huge ebony desk but the idea of them even now plotting to steal a baby fired her blood she wasnt going to stand by while someone else went through what rose and stan had experienced not while there was a chance she could make a difference she found nothing in the desk of interest and used up five of her allotted twenty minutes in the search undaunted she moved on checking tables for false bottoms locating a wall safe behind a section of books she would have loved to have the time and the talent to lift that lock but she had to admit defeat with less than three minutes to go she found what she was looking for in plain sight the second bedroom of the suite served as a fussily decorated office that linda used as a convenience there on top of her french provincial desk was a leatherbound account book at first glance it seemed like nothing more than it purported to be a daily record of deliveries for the hotel shops mel had nearly put it down again in disgust when she noted the dates merchandise acquired tampa picked up little rock delivered louisville accepted cod detroit commission breathing shallowly mel flipped pages merchandise acquired monterey picked up scuttlefield delivered lubbock accepted cod atlanta commission david she thought and didnt bother to hold back a string of oaths it was right there all the dates and cities and more babies listed like packages to be shipped and paid for on delivery tightlipped she skimmed the pages and let out a hiss between her teeth hb ordered new blue package west bloomfield new jersey pick up between and standard route acceptance and final payment expected by estimated commission you bitch mel muttered as she closed the book she struggled against the urge to break something and scanned the room instead when she was certain nothing was out of place she started for the door oh shes probably off having another crying jag linda said as she walked through the main door of the penthouse into the parlor hell find her mel took a quick look around and opted for the closet i cant say im looking forward to spending the evening with her gumm said i doubt shell talk about anything but booties and baby formula we can take it lover especially for twice our usual fee her voice faded a bit as she walked toward the opposite bedroom i think it was a good idea to arrange for dinner up here the more grateful and emotional they are the less theyll think once they have the kid they wont question anything harriets thoughts exactly she already has ethan putting the wheels in motion i was surprised when she came down to take a look at them for herself but shes a little more cautious since the frost affair mel kept her breath slow and even she pressed her fingers against the stone of her ring communication between people who are important to each other she remembered and shut her eyes well heres hoping come on donovan get your butt up here and bring the marines it was risky she knew but she thought the odds were in her favor reaching into her bag she felt the comforting bulk of her weapon not that way she took a deep bracing breath and put the account book in instead of taking the revolver out she set her bag on the floor then opened the closet theyll pass the merchandise to our contact in chicago gumm was saying id like to pick him up in albuquerque linda put in i could always use an extra couple of thousand for the run her head snapped up as mel deliberately bumped a chair what the hell gumm was in the room like a shot twisting the struggling mels arms behind her let me go jasper youre hurting me people who break into other peoples homes often get hurt i i was just lying down for a while she made her eyes dart crazily to make the lie all the more ridiculous i didnt think youd mind what have we got here linda asked a plant i should have known i should have smelled it cop linda considered cop eyes wide with alarm mel twisted i dont know what youre talking about i was just resting howd she get in jasper demanded and mel let the key she was holding slip out of her hands mine swearing in disgust linda bent to pick it up she must have palmed it i dont know what jasper cut off mels protest with a backhand that left her head ringing she decided it was time to drop one act for another okay okay you dont have to play rough she shuddered and swallowed audibly im just doing my job jasper shoved her into the parlor and onto the sofa which is look im just an actress i took a gig with donovan hes a pi stall mel thought stall stall stall because he was coming she knew he was i only did what he told me to do i dont care what youre into and i got an appreciation for a good scam gumm moved to the desk and took a pistol from the top drawer what are you doing in here man you dont need that she said swallowing he said i should get the key and come up to look around he thought there might be some papers in the desk there she gestured toward the ebony desk it seemed like a real kick you know and hes paying me five grand for the job a twobit actress and a pi linda said furiously what the hell do we do now what we have to do look look you say the word and im out of here i mean out of the state mel tried for a tawdry kind of charm i mean it was great while it lasted the clothes and all but i dont want any trouble i didnt hear anything i didnt see anything you heard plenty gumm countered i got a bad memory shut up linda snapped and mel shrugged well have to contact harriet shes back in baltimore seeing to the details of the last job gumm ran his hands through his hair shes going to be very unhappy shell have to call off the nurse we cant take a kid without a buyer twentyfive thousand down the tubes linda sent mel a look of avid dislike i was actually pretty fond of you mary ellen she walked over to lean into mels face squeezing a hand around her throat as it is now im going to get a lot of satisfaction out of letting jasper take care of you hey listen shut up she shoved mel back youd better arrange for someone to do it tonight and to pick up the pi too i think a little spat in their house maybe a nice murdersuicide ill take care of it at the knock on the door mel made to scramble up and as expected had linda clamp a hand over her mouth room service mr gumm the damn dinner he muttered take her in the other room and keep her quiet ill handle this a pleasure linda took the gun gumm handed her and gestured mel into the next room smoothing back his hair gumm went to the door then gestured for the waiter to roll in the roomservice tray dont bother to set up our guests havent arrived yet yes they have sebastian strolled in jasper id like you to meet special agent devereaux fbi in the next room linda swore and mel grinned excuse me she said politely tramped hard on lindas foot and knocked the gun aside sutherland sebastian said with restrained fury from the doorway youve got some explaining to do in a minute to please herself she turned and rammed her fist into lindas astonished face that one was for rose she said he wasnt happy with her sebastian made that abundantly clear through the rest of that evening through all the explanations devereaux wasnt exactly thrilled himself though she thought it was smallminded of him since shed all but wrapped the evidence in a bow and handed it to him sebastian had a right to be annoyed she supposed shed acted on her own but she was the professional besides it had worked out exactly as shed planned so what was his problem she asked him just that several times as they packed up for the trip home as they flew back to monterey as he dropped her off at her office his only answer was one of his long enigmatic looks the last thing he said to her left her miserable and silent i kept my word mary ellen you didnt as a matter of trust it comes down to that that had been two days before she thought as she brooded at her desk and there hadnt been a peep from him since shed even swallowed her pride and called him only to get his answering machine it wasnt that she felt she owed him an apology exactly but she did think he deserved another chance to be reasonable she toyed with the idea of going to morgana or anastasia and asking them to intercede but that was too weak all she wanted to do was to put things back on an even keel between them no no she wanted much more than that mel admitted and that was what was killing her only one way to do it she told herself and kicked back from her desk she would hunt him down pin him to the wall if necessary but she would make him listen to her all the way along the winding mountain road she practiced what she would say and how she would say it she tried being tough experimented with being quiet and solemn and even took a shot at being penitent when that didnt sit well she opted for aggressive tactics shed just march right up to his door and tell him to cut out the silent routine she was tired of it if he wasnt there shed wait he was there all right she discovered as she reached the top of his lane but he certainly wasnt alone there were three other cars in the drive including what appeared to be the longest stretch limo in the known world she stepped out of her car and stood beside it wondering what to do next i told you didnt i tell you mel looked around and spotted a pretty woman in a flowing tealength dress a greeneyed blonde she said a definite smack of satisfaction in her irish voice i told you something was bothering him yes dear the man beside her was tall and gangly his graying hair receding into a dramatic widows peak he looked rather dashing in jodhpurs and top boots a victorian quizzing glass dangled from a string around his neck but it was i who told you it was a female nevertheless the woman glided across the grounds with both plump hands held out to mel hello hello and welcome ah thanks im ah looking for of course you are the woman said with a breezy laugh anyone could see that couldnt they douglas pretty he said in response not a pushover he peered at her with eyes that were so much like sebastians that mel began to put two and two together he didnt tell us about you which speaks for itself i suppose she said after a moment his parents she thought sinking a family reunion was no place for a confrontation i dont want to disturb him when he has company maybe you could tell him i stopped by nonsense im camilla by the way sebastians mother she took mels arm and began to lead her toward the house i quite understand your being in love with him my dear child ive loved him myself for years panicked mel looked for a route of escape no i that is i really think i should come back later no time like the present douglas said and gave her a friendly nudge through the door sebastian look what weve brought you he brought the glass to his eye and peered around owlishly where is that boy upstairs morgana breezed in from the direction of the kitchen hell be oh hello hi the frost on the greeting told mel it had been a bad idea to come i was just leaving i didnt realize your family was visiting oh they drop in now and again after she took one long look into mels eyes morganas smile wanned stepped in it did you she murmured thats all right hell come around i really think i should meet the rest of the family camilla said gaily and kept mels arm in an iron grip as she marched her toward the kitchen there were glorious scents in the air and roomsful of people a tall queenly woman was laughing raucously as she stirred something on the stove nash was on a stool beside a lean middleaged man with steelgray hair when the man glanced up at her she felt like a moth on a pin hey mel nash sent her a wave and she was thrust into the fray introductions followed camilla taking charge territorially my brotherinlaw matthew she began gesturing to the man beside nash my sister maureen at the stove maureen waved an absent hand and sniffed at her brew and my sister bryna hello a woman every bit as stunning as morgana stepped forward to take mels hand i hope youre not too befuddled by all this we all dropped in quite unexpectedly just this morning no no really i dont want to intrude i should really just then it was too late sebastian walked in flanked by ana and a short husky man with twinkling eyes ah sebastian bryna kept mels hand more company mel this is padrick anas father hello it was easier to look at him than sebastian nice to meet you he strolled right up and pinched her cheek stay for dinner well put some meat on your bones maureen my moonflower what is that tantalizing scent hungarian goulash padrick winked at mel and not a single eye of newt in the batch guaranteed yes well i appreciate the invitation but i really cant stay she took a chance and glanced at sebastian im sorry she fumbled when he just continued to gaze at her with those quiet inscrutable eyes i shouldnt have i mean i really should have called first ill catch you later excuse us he said to the group at large gripping mels arm as she tried to dash by mel hasnt seen the foal since the birthing though she knew it was cowardly she shot one desperate glance behind her as he pulled her out of the door you have company and that company moved as a unit to the kitchen window to watch the goingson family isnt company he said and since youve come all this way i have to believe you have something to say well i do and ill say it when you stop dragging me fine he stopped near the paddock where the foal was busily nursing say it i wanted to i talked to devereaux he said linda copped a plea and spilled everything theyve got enough on gumm and the breezeports to put them away for a long time theyve got a line on a handful of others like silbey too im aware of all that oh well i wasnt sure she stuck her hands in her pockets its going to take some time to locate all the children and get them back where they belong but it worked damn it she blurted out i dont know what the hell youre so bent out of shape about his voice was deceptively mild dont you i did what i thought was best she kicked at the ground then strode over to the fence theyd already made plans to snatch another kid it was right in the book the book you went in and found on your own if id told you what i was going to do youd have tried to stop me wrong i would have stopped you she frowned back at him see by doing it my way we saved a lot of heartache and risked more the anger hed been struggling to hold back flared there was a bruise on your cheek a qualified job risk she shot back and its my cheek good god sutherland she had a gun on you only for a minute hell donovan the day i cant handle a sap like linda glass is the day i retire im telling you i just couldnt take the idea of them snatching another baby so i went with the gut her eyes were so eloquent some of his anger died i know what im doing and i also know it seems like i was cutting you out but i wasnt i called you he took a calming breath but it failed to work and if id been too late well you werent so whats the point the point is you didnt trust me the hell i didnt who else was i trusting when i stood in that closet and tried to use the ring or whatever connection we had to get you and the feds up there if i hadnt trusted you i wouldve slipped right out the door with the book she grabbed at his shirt and shook him it was because i trusted you that i played it out that way staying there letting them catch me because i knew i could trust you to back me up i tried to explain it all to you before i knew theyd tell me things devereaux could use and with the book as a backup wed have them cold steadying himself he turned away as angry as he was he saw the truth in that perhaps it wasnt the kind of trust hed wanted but it was trust you could have been hurt sure i could be hurt every time i take a case thats what i do thats what i am she swallowed struggling to clear an obstruction in her throat i had to accept you and what you are and believe me it was no snap if were going to be friends the same goes you may have a point but i still dont like your style fine she snapped back blinking her vision clear same goes at the kitchen window camilla shook her head he always was stubborn ten pounds she wears him down padrick pinched his wifes bottom affectionately ten pounds and no tricks ana shushed him we wont be able to hear mel let out a shaky breath well we know where we stand anyway and im sorry excuse me he turned and was astonished by the tears he saw on her face mary ellen dont im going to get this out she wiped furiously at the tears i have to do what i think is right and i still think what i did was right but im sorry youre so angry with me because i oh i hate this she scrubbed her hands over her face evading him when he reached for her dont i dont want you to i dont need to be patted or soothed even if i am acting like a baby you were mad and i guess i cant blame you for it or for dropping me cold dropping you cold he nearly laughed i left you alone and well out of harms way until i could be certain i could restrain myself from throttling you or present you with an ultimatum you might have tossed back in my face whatever she sniffed and regained some control i guess what i did hurt you and i didnt mean it to he smiled a little same goes okay there had to be some way to finish this with a little dignity intact anyway i wanted to clear the air and to tell you i think we did a good job now that its done i figured id better return this it was hard one of the hardest things shed ever done to pull his ring from her finger looks like the ryans are getting a divorce yes he took the ring back and held it warm in the palm of his hand as he considered her it wasnt necessary to dip into her thoughts to see that she was suffering it wasnt particularly noble but the fact that she was pleased him very much it seems a pity he brushed his knuckles over her cheek then again i much prefer you to her she blinked you do very much i was beginning to find her a little dull shed never argue with me and she was forever having her nails done gently he cupped a hand behind her head and drew her closer she certainly wouldnt have been caught dead in those jeans guess not she murmured leaning into him into the kiss she felt herself tremble felt the tears welling up again as she threw her arms around him sebastian i need she tightened her hold as her lips clung to his tell me i want oh lord you scare me she drew back her eyes wet and terrified just read my mind will you for gods sake just look at what im feeling and give me a break his eyes darkened his hands moved up to cup her face he looked and found everything hed been waiting for again he murmured taking her mouth but this time the kiss was gentle coaxing cant you tell me cant you say the words theyre the truest magic i dont want you to feel like im boxing you in its just that i love you he finished for her yeah she managed a weak smile you could say i blurred the lines i wasnt going to bring it up but it seemed like i should only fair that i should be upfront pretty awkward when youve got a houseful of people all of whom have their noses pressed up to the kitchen window and are enjoying this nearly as much as i who she spun around flushed and stumbled backward oh lord look im going i really cant believe i did this unnerved she lifted a hand to tug at her hair and saw the ring back on her finger as she stared at it he stepped forward i gave the stone to morgana a stone ive treasured most of my life i asked her to have a ring made out of it for you for you he repeated waiting until she lifted her eyes to his because you were the only woman i wanted to wear it you were the only woman i wanted to share my life with twice now ive put it on your finger and both times it was a pledge to you he held out his hand offering no one in any time in any place will love you more her eyes were dry now and her nerves were suddenly calm as the day do you mean it his lips curved no sutherland im lying with a laugh she launched herself into his arms tough break ive got witnesses the spontaneous applause from the kitchen made her laugh again oh i do love you donovan im going to do my best to make your life eventful he swung her in one giddy circle i know after one last long kiss he took her by the hand come meet your family again weve all been waiting for you charmed prologue contents prev next magic exists who can doubt it when there are rainbows and wildflowers the music of the wind and the silence of the stars anyone who has loved has been touched by magic it is such a simple and such an extraordinary part of the lives we live there are those who have been given more who have been chosen to carry on a legacy handed down through endless ages their forebears were merlin the enchanter ninian the sorceress the faerie princess rhiannon the wegewarte of germany and the jinns of arabia through their blood ran the power of finn of the celts the ambitious morgan le fay and others whose names were whispered only in shadows and in secret when the world was young and magic as common as a raindrop faeries danced in the deep forests and sometimes for mischief sometimes for love mixed with mortals and they do still her bloodline was old her power was ancient even as a child she had understood had been taught that such gifts were not without price the loving parents who treasured her could not lower the cost or pay it themselves but could only love instruct and watch the young girl grow to womanhood they could only stand and hope as she experienced the pains and the joys of that most fascinating of journeys and because she felt more than others because her gift demanded that she feel more she learned to court peace as a woman she preferred a quiet life and was often alone without the pain of loneliness as a witch she accepted her gift and never forgot the responsibility it entailed perhaps she yearned as mortals and others have yearned since the beginning for a true and abiding love for she knew better than most that there was no power no enchantment no sorcery greater than the gift of an open and accepting heart chapter contents prev next when she saw the little girl peek through the fairy roses anastasia had no idea the child would change her life shed been humming to herself as she often did when she gardened enjoying the scent and the feel of earth the warm september sun was golden and the gentle whoosh of the sea on the rocks below her sloping yard was a lovely background to the buzzing of bees and the piping of birdsong her long gray cat was stretched out beside her his tail twitching in time with some feline dream a butterfly landed soundlessly on her hand and she stroked the edge of its pale blue wings with a fingertip as it fluttered off she heard the rustling glancing over she saw a small face peeping through the hedge of fairy roses anas smile came quickly naturally the face was charming with its little pointed chin and its pert nose its big blue eyes mirroring the color of the sky a pixie cap of glossy brown hair completed the picture the girl smiled back those summersky eyes full of curiosity and mischief hello ana said as if she always found little girls in her rosebushes the girls voice was bright and a little breathless can you catch butterflies i never got to pet one like that before i suppose but it seems rude to try unless one invites you she brushed the hair from her brow with her forearm and sat back on her heels ana had noticed a moving van unloading the day before and she concluded she was meeting one of her new neighbors have you moved into the house next door uhhuh were going to live here now i like it cause i get to look right out my bedroom window and see the water i saw a seal too in indiana you only see them in the zoo can i come over of course you can ana set her garden spade aside as the girl stepped through the rosebushes in her arms was a wriggling puppy and who do we have here this is daisy the child pressed a loving kiss to the top of the puppys head shes a golden retriever i got to pick her out myself right before we left indiana she got to fly in the plane with us and we were hardly scared at all i have to take good care of her and give her food and water and brush her and everything cause shes my responsibility shes very beautiful ana said soberly and very heavy she imagined for a little girl of five or six she held out her arms may i do you like dogs the little girl kept chattering as she passed daisy over i do i like dogs and cats and everything even the hamsters billy walker has someday im going to have a horse too well have to see about that thats what my daddy says well have to see about that utterly charmed ana stroked the puppy as she sniffed and licked at her the child was as sweet as sunshine im very fond of dogs and cats and everything ana told her my cousin has horses two big ones and a brandnew baby really the child squatted down and began to pet the sleeping cat can i see them he doesnt live far so perhaps one day well have to ask your parents my mommy went to heaven shes an angel now anas heart broke a little reaching out she touched the shiny hair and opened herself there was no pain here and that was a relief the memories were good ones at the touch the child looked up and smiled im jessica she said but you can call me jessie im anastasia because it was too much to resist ana bent down and kissed the pert nose but you can call me ana introductions over jessie settled down to bombard ana with questions filtering information about herself through the bright chatter shed just had a birthday and was six she would be starting first grade in her brandnew school on tuesday her favorite color was purple and she hated lima beans more than anything could ana show her how to plant flowers did her cat have a name did she have any little girls why not so they sat in the sunshine a bright pixie of a girl in pink rompers and a woman with garden dirt smearing her shorts and her lightly tanned legs while quigley the cat ignored the playful attentions of daisy the dog anas long wheatcolored hair was tied carelessly back and the occasional wisp worked free of the band to dance in the wind around her face she wore no cosmetics her fragile heartbreaking beauty was as natural as her power a combination of celtic bones smoky eyes the wide poetically sculptured donovan mouth and something more nebulous her face was the mirror of a giving heart the pup marched over to sniff at the herbs in her rockery ana laughed at something jessica said jessie the voice swept over the hedge of roses deeply male and touched with exasperation and concern jessica alice uhoh he used my whole name but jessies eyes were twinkling as she jumped to her feet there was obviously little fear of reprisals over here daddy im right over here with ana come and see a moment later there was a man towering over the fairy roses no gift was needed to detect waves of frustration relief and annoyance ana blinked once surprised that this roughandready male was the father of the little sprite currently bouncing beside her maybe it was the day or twos growth of beard that made him look so dangerous she thought but she doubted it beneath that dusky shadow was a sharpfeatured face of planes and angles a full mouth set in grim lines only the eyes were like his daughters a clear brilliant blue marred now by an expression of impatience the sun brought out glints of red in his dark tousled hair as he dragged a hand through it from her perch on the ground he looked enormous athletically fit and disconcertingly strong in a ripped tshirt and faded jeans sprung at the seams he cast one long annoyed and unmistakably distrustful glance at ana before giving his attention to his daughter jessica didnt i tell you to stay in the yard i guess she smiled winningly daisy and i heard ana singing and when we looked she had this butterfly right on her hand and she said we could come over she has a cat see and her cousin has horses and her other cousin has a cat and a dog obviously used to jessies rambling her father waited it out when i tell you to stay in the yard and then youre not there im going to worry it was a simple statement made in even tones ana had to respect the fact that the man didnt have to raise his voice or spout ultimatums to get his point across she felt every bit as chastened as jessie im sorry daddy jessie murmured over a pouting lower lip i should apologize mr sawyer ana rose to lay a hand on jessies shoulder after all it looked as if they were in this together i did invite her over and i was enjoying her company so much that it didnt occur to me that you wouldnt be able to see where she was he said nothing for a moment just stared at her with those waterclear eyes until she had to fight the urge to squirm when he flicked his gaze down to his daughter again ana realized shed been holding her breath you should take daisy over and feed her okay jessie hauled the reluctant pup into her arms then stopped when her father inclined his head and thank mrs miss ana supplied donovan anastasia donovan thank miss donovan for putting up with you thank you for putting up with me ana jessie said with singsong politeness sending ana a conspirators grin can i come back i hope you will as she stepped through the bushes jessie offered her father a sunny smile i didnt mean to make you worry daddy honest he bent down and tweaked her nose brat ana heard the wealth of love behind the exasperation with a giggle jessie ran across the yard the puppy wriggling in her arms anas smile faded the moment those cool blue eyes turned back to her shes an absolutely delightful child ana began amazed that she had to wipe damp palms on her shorts i do apologize for not making certain you knew where she was but i hope youll let her come back to visit me again it wasnt your responsibility his voice was cool neither friendly nor unfriendly ana had the uncomfortable certainty that she was being weighed from the top of her head to the bottom of her grassstained sneakers jessie is naturally curious and friendly sometimes too much of both it doesnt occur to her that there are people in the world who might take advantage of that equally cool now ana inclined her head point taken mr sawyer though i can assure you i rarely gobble up young girls for breakfast he smiled a slow curving of the lips that erased the harshness from his face and replaced it with a devastating appeal you certainly dont fit my perception of an ogre miss donovan now ill have to apologize for being so abrupt she gave me a scare i hadnt even unpacked yet and id lost her misplaced ana tried another cautious smile she looked beyond him to the twostory redwood house next door with its wide band of windows and its curvy deck though she was content in her privacy she was glad it hadnt remained empty long its nice to have a child nearby especially one as entertaining as jessie i hope youll let her come back i often wonder if i let her do anything he flicked a finger over a tiny pink rose unless you replace these with a tenfoot wall shell be back and at least hed know where to look if she disappeared again dont be afraid to send her home when she overstays her welcome he tucked his hands in his pockets id better go make sure she doesnt feed daisy our dinner mr sawyer ana said as he turned away enjoy monterey thanks his long strides carried him over the lawn onto the deck and into the house ana stood where she was for another moment she couldnt remember the last time the air here had sizzled with so much energy letting out a long breath she bent to pick up her gardening tools while quigley wound himself around her legs she certainly couldnt remember the last time her palms had gone damp just because a man had looked at her then again she couldnt recall ever being looked at in quite that way before looked at looked into looked through all at once a very neat trick she mused as she carried the tools into her greenhouse an intriguing pair father and daughter gazing through the sparkling glass wall of the greenhouse she studied the house centered in the next yard as their closest neighbor she thought it was only natural that she should wonder about them ana was also wise enough and had learned through painful experience to be careful not to let her wondering lead to any involvement beyond a natural friendliness there were precious few who could accept what was not of the common world the price of her gift was a vulnerable heart that had already suffered miserably at the cold hand of rejection but she didnt dwell on that in fact as she thought of the man and of the child she smiled what would he have done she wondered with a little laugh if she had told him that while she wasnt an ogre no indeed she was most definitely a witch in the sunny and painfully disorganized kitchen boone sawyer dug through a packing box until he unearthed a skillet he knew the move to california had been a good one hed convinced himself of that but hed certainly underestimated the time the trouble and the general inconvenience of packing up a home and plopping it down somewhere else what to take what to leave behind hiring movers having his car shipped transporting the puppy that jessie had fallen in love with justifying his decision to her worried grandparents school registration school shopping lord was he going to have to repeat that nightmare every fall for the next eleven years at least the worst was behind him he hoped all he had to do now was unpack find a place for everything and make a home out of a strange house jessie was happy that was and always had been the most important thing then again he mused as he browned some beef for chili jessie was happy anywhere her sunny disposition and her remarkable capacity to make friends were both a blessing and a bafflement it was astonishing to boone that a child who had lost her mother at the tender age of two could be unaffected so resilient so completely normal and he knew that if not for jessie he would surely have gone quietly mad after alices death he didnt often think of alice now and that fact sometimes brought him a rush of guilt he had loved her god he had loved her and the child theyd made together was a living breathing testament to that love but hed been without her now longer than hed been with her though he had tried to hang on to the grief as a kind of proof of that love it had faded under the demands and pressures of daytoday living alice was gone jessie was not it was because of both of them that hed made the difficult decision to move to monterey in indiana in the home he and alice had bought while she was carrying jessie there had been too many ties to the past both his parents and alices had been a tenminute drive away as the only grandchild on both sides jessie had been the center of attention and the object of subtle competition for himself boone had wearied of the constant advice the gentle and not so gentle criticism of his parenting and of course the matchmaking the child needs a mother a man needs a wife his mother had decided to make it her lifes work to find the perfect woman to fit both bills because that had begun to infuriate him and because hed realized how easy it would be to stay in the house and wallow in the memories it held hed chosen to move he could work anywhere monterey had been the final choice because of the climate the lifestyle the schools and he could admit privately because some internal voice had told him this was the place for both of them he liked being able to look out of the window and see the water or those fascinatingly sculptured cypress trees he certainly liked the fact that he wasnt crowded in by neighbors it was alice who had enjoyed being surrounded by people he also appreciated the fact that the distance from the road was enough to muffle the sound of traffic it just felt right jessie was already making her mark true it had given him a moment of gutclutching fear when hed looked outside and hadnt seen her anywhere but he should have known she would find someone to talk to someone to charm and the woman frowning boone settled the top on the skillet to let the chili simmer that had been odd he thought as he poured a cup of coffee to take out on the deck hed looked down at her and known instantly that jessie was safe there had been nothing but kindness in those smoky eyes it was his reaction his very personal very basic reaction that had tightened his muscles and roughened his voice desire very swift very painful and totally inappropriate he hadnt felt that kind of response to a woman since he grinned to himself since never with alice it had been a quiet kind of rightness a sweet and inevitable coming together that he would always treasure this had been like being dragged by an undertow when you were fighting to get to shore well it had been a long time he reminded himself as he watched a gull glide toward the water a healthy reaction to a beautiful woman was easily justified and explained and beautiful shed been in a calm classic manner that was the direct opposite of his violent response to her he couldnt help but resent it he didnt have the time or inclination for any kind of reaction to any kind of woman there was jessie to think of reaching in his pocket he took out a cigarette lit it hardly aware he was staring across the lawn at the hedge of delicate roses anastasia he thought the name certainly suited her it was oldfashioned elegant unusual daddy boone jolted as guilty as a teenager caught smoking in the boys room by the high school principal he cleared his throat and gave his pouting daughter a sheepish grin give your old man a break jess im down to half a pack a day she folded her arms theyre bad for you they make your lungs dirty i know he tamped the cigarette out unable to take even a last drag when those wise little eyes were judging him im giving them up really she smiled it was a disconcertingly adult sureyouare smile and he jammed his hands in his pockets give me a break warden he said in a passable james cagney imitation you aint putting me in solitary for snitching one drag giggling already forgiving him for the lapse she came over to hug him youre silly yeah he cupped his hands under her elbows and lifted her up for a hearty kiss and youre short one day im going to be big as you she wrapped her legs around his waist and leaned back until she was upside down it was one of her favorite pastimes fat chance he held her steady as her hair brushed the deck im always going to be bigger he pulled her up again lifting her high and making her squeal with laughter and smarter and stronger he rubbed the stubble of his beard against her while she wriggled and shrieked and betterlooking and ticklish she shouted in triumph digging her fingers into his ribs she had him there he collapsed on the bench with her okay okay uncle he caught his breath and caught her close youll always be trickier pinkcheeked brighteyed she bounced on his lap i like our new house yeah he smoothed her hair as always enjoying the texture of it under his palm me too after dinner can we go down to the beach and look for seals sure daisy too daisy too already experienced with puddles on the rug and chewedup socks he glanced around where is she shes taking a nap jessie rested her head against her fathers chest she was very tired i bet its been a big day smiling he kissed the top of jessies head felt her yawn and settle my favorite day i got to meet ana because her eyes were heavy she closed them lulled by the beating of her fathers heart shes nice shes going to show me how to plant flowers hmm she knows all their names jessie yawned again and when she spoke again her voice was thick with sleep daisy licked her face and she didnt even mind she just laughed it sounded pretty when she did like a fairy jessie murmured as she drifted off boone smiled again his daughters imagination his gift to her he liked to think he held her gently while she slept restless ana thought as she strolled along the rocky beach at twilight she simply wasnt able to stay inside working with her plants and herbs when she was dogged by this feeling of restlessness the breeze would blow it out of her she decided lifting her face to the moist wind a nice long walk and shed find that contentment again that peace that was as much a part of her as breathing under different circumstances she would have called one of her cousins and suggested a night out but she imagined morgana was cozily settled in with nash for the evening and at this stage of her pregnancy she needed rest sebastian wasnt back from his honeymoon yet still it had never bothered her to be alone she enjoyed the solitude of the long curved beach the sound of water against rock the laughing of the gulls just as she had enjoyed the sound of the childs laughter and the mans drifting to her that afternoon it had been a good sound one she didnt have to be a part of to appreciate now as the sun melted spilling color over the western sky she felt the restlessness fading how could she be anything but content to be here alone watching the magic of a day at rest she climbed up to stand on a driftwood log close enough to the water that the spray cooled her face and dampened her shirt absently she took a stone out of her pocket rubbing it between her fingers as she watched the sun drop into the flaming sea the stone wanned in her hand ana looked down at the small waterlike gem its pearly sheen glinting dully in the lowering light moonstone she thought amused at herself moon magic a protection for the night traveler an aid to selfanalysis and of course a talisman often used to promote love which was she looking for tonight even as she laughed at herself and slipped the stone back into her pocket she heard her name called there was jessie racing down the beach with the fat puppy nipping at her heels and her father walking several yards behind as if reluctant to close the distance ana took a moment to wonder if the childs natural exuberance made the man appear all the more aloof she stepped down from the log and because it was natural even automatic caught jessie up in a swing and a hug hello again sunshine are you and daisy out hunting for faerie shells jessies eyes widened faerie shells what do they look like just as youd suppose sunset or sunrise thats the only time to find them my daddy says faeries live in the forest and usually hide because people dont always know how to treat them quite right she laughed and set the girl on her feet but they like the water too and the hills id like to meet one but daddy says they hardly ever talk to people like they used to cause nobody really believes in them but kids thats because children are very close to magic she looked up as she spoke boone had reached them and the sun setting at his back cast shadows over his face that were both dangerous and appealing we were discussing faeries she told him i heard he laid a hand on jessies shoulder though the gesture was subtle the meaning was crystalclear mine ana says there are faerie shells on the beach and you can only find them at sunrise or sunset can you write a story about them who knows his smile was soft and loving for his daughter when his gaze snapped back to hers ana felt a shudder down her spine weve interrupted your walk no exasperated ana shrugged she understood that he meant she had interrupted theirs i was just taking a moment to watch the water before i went in its getting chilly we had chili for dinner jessie said grinning at her own joke and it was hot will you help me look for faerie shells sometime maybe when her father wasnt around to stare holes through her but its getting too dark now and i have to go in she flicked a finger down jessies nose good night she gave a cool nod to her father boone watched ana walk away she might not have gotten chilled so quickly he thought if shed worn something to cover her legs her smooth shapely legs he let out a long impatient breath come on jess race you back chapter contents prev next id like to meet him ana glanced up from the dried petals she was arranging for potpourri and frowned at morgana who the father of this little girl youre so enchanted with more fatigued than she cared to admit morgana stroked her hand in a circular motion over her very round belly youre just chockfull of information on the girl and very suspiciously lacking when it comes to papa because he doesnt interest me as much ana said lightly to a bowl filled with fragrant leaves and petals she added lemon for zest and balsam for health she knew very well how weary morgana was hes every bit as standoffish as jessie is friendly if it wasnt obvious that hes devoted to her id probably dislike him instead of being merely ambivalent is he attractive ana lifted a brow as compared to a toad morgana laughed and leaned forward come on ana give well he isnt ugly setting the bowl aside she began to look through the cupboard for the right oil to mix through the potpourri i guess youd say he has that hollowcheeked dangerous look athletic build not like a weight lifter she frowned trying to decide between two oils more like a a longdistance runner i suppose rangy and intimidatingly fit grinning morgana cupped her chin in her hands more this from a married woman about to give birth to twins you bet ana laughed chose an oil of rose to add elegance well if i have to say something nice he does have wonderful eyes very clear very blue when they look at jessie theyre gorgeous when they look at me suspicious what in the world for i havent a clue morgana shook her head and rolled her eyes anastasia surely youve wondered enough to find out all youd have to do is peek with a deft and expert hand ana added drops of fragrant oil to the mixture in the bowl you know i dont like to intrude oh really and if i was curious she added fighting a smile at morganas frustration i dont believe id care to see what was rolling around inside mr sawyers heart i have a feeling it would be very uncomfortable to be linked with him even for a few minutes youre the empath morgana said with a shrug if sebastian was back hed find out whats in this guys mind anyway she sipped more of the soothing elixir ana had mixed for her i could do it for you if you like i havent had cause to use the scrying mirror or crystal for weeks i may be getting stale no ana leaned forward and kissed her cousins cheek thank you now i want you to keep a bag of this with you she said as she spooned the potpourri into a net bag and put the rest in bowls around the house and the shop youre only working two days a week now right two or three she smiled at anas concern even as she waved it off im not overdoing darling i promise nash wont let me with an absent nod ana tied the bag securely are you drinking the tea i made up for you every day and yes im using the oils religiously im carrying rhyolite to alleviate emotional stress topaz against external stresses zircon for a positive attitude and amber to lift my spirits she gave anas hand a quick squeeze ive got all the bases covered im entitled to fuss she set the bag of potpourri down by morganas purse then changed her mind and opened the purse herself to slip it inside its our first baby babies morgana corrected all the more reason to fuss twins come early indulging in a single sigh morgana closed her eyes i certainly hope these do its getting to the point where i can hardly get up and down without a crane more rest ana prescribed and very gentle exercise which does not include hauling around shipping boxes or being on your feet all day waiting on customers yes maam now lets have a look gently she laid her hands on her cousins belly spreading her fingers slowly opening herself to the miracle of what lay within instantly morgana felt her fatigue drain away and a physical and emotional wellbeing take its place through her halfclosed eyes she saw anas darken to the color of pewter and fix on a vision only ana could see as she moved her hands over her cousins heavy belly and linked with her ana felt the weight within her and for one incredibly vivid moment the lives that pulsed inside the womb the draining fatigue yes and the nagging discomfort but she also felt the quiet satisfaction the burgeoning excitement and the simple wonder of carrying those lives her body ached her heart swelled her lips curved then she was those lives first one then the other swimming dreamlessly in that warm dark womb nourished by the mother held safe and fast until the moment when the outside would be faced two healthy hearts beating steady and close beneath a mothers heart tiny fingers flexing a lazy kick the rippling of ana came back to herself came back alone youre well all of you i know morgana twined her fingers with anas but i feel better when you tell me just as i feel safe knowing youll be there when its time you know i wouldnt be anywhere else she brought their joined hands to her cheek but is nash content with me as midwife he trusts you as much as i do anas gaze softened youre lucky morgana to have found a man who accepts understands even appreciates what you are i know to have found love was precious enough but to have found love with him then her smile faded ana darling robert was a long time ago i dont think of him at least not really of him but of a wrong turn on a particularly slippery road indignation sharpened morganas eyes he was a fool and not in the least worthy of you rather than sadness ana felt a chuckle bubble out of her you never liked him not from the first no i didnt frowning morgana gestured with her glass and neither did sebastian if you recall i do as i recall sebastian was quite suspicious of nash too that was entirely different it was she insisted as ana grinned with nash he was just being protective of me as for robert sebastian tolerated him with the most insulting sort of politeness i remember ana shrugged which of course put my back up well i was young she said with a careless gesture and naive enough to believe that if i was in love i must be loved back equally foolish enough to be honest and foolish enough to be devastated when that honesty was rewarded with disbelief then outright rejection i know you were hurt but theres little doubt you could do better none at all ana agreed for she wasnt without pride but there are some of us that arent meant to mix with outsiders now there was frustration as well as indignation there have been plenty of men with elfin blood and without whove been interested in you cousin a pity i havent been interested in them ana laughed im miserably choosy morgana and i like my life just as it is if i didnt know that to be true id be tempted to work up a nice little love spell nothing binding mind she said with a glint in her eye just something to give you some entertainment i can find my own entertainment thanks i know that too just as i know youd be furious if i dared to interfere she pushed away from the table and rose regretting for a moment her loss of grace lets take a walk outside before i head home if you promise to put your feet up for an hour when you get there done the sun was warm the breeze balmy both of which ana thought would do her cousin as much good as the long nap she imagined nash would insist his wife take when she returned home they admired the lateblooming larkspur the starry asters and the big bold zinnias both had a deep love of nature that had come through the blood and through upbringing do you have any plans for all hallows eve morgana asked nothing specific we were hoping youd come by at least for part of the evening nash is going all out for the trickortreaters with an appreciative laugh ana clipped some mums to take inside when a man writes horror films for a living hes duty bound to pull out the stops for halloween i wouldnt miss it good perhaps sebastian will join you and me for a quiet celebration afterward morgana was bending awkwardly over the thyme and verbena when she spotted the child and dog skipping through the hedge of roses she straightened we have company jessie pleased but wary ana glanced over to the house beyond does your father know where you are he said i could come over if i saw you outside and you werent busy you arent busy are you no unable to resist ana bent down to kiss jessies cheek this is my cousin morgana ive told her youre my brandnew neighbor you have a dog and a cat ana told me jessies interest was immediately piqued then her gaze focused fascinated on the bulge of morganas belly do you have a baby in there i certainly do in fact i have two babies in there two jessies eyes popped wide how do you know because ana told me with a laugh she laid a hand on her heavy stomach and because they kick and squirm too much to be only one my friend missys mommy mrs lopez had one baby in her tummy and she got so fat she could hardly walk out of brilliant blue eyes jessie shot morgana a hopeful glance she let me feel it kick charmed morgana took jessies hand and brought it to her while ana discouraged daisy from digging in the impatiens feel that giggling at the movement beneath her hand jessie nodded uhhuh it went pow does it hurt no do you think theyll come out soon im hoping daddy says babies know when to come out because an angel whispers in their ear sawyer might be aloof morgana thought but he was also very clever and very sweet that sounds exactly right to me and thats their special angel forever and ever she went on pressing her cheek to morganas belly in the hope that she could hear something from inside if you turn around really quick you maybe could get just a tiny glimpse of your angel i try sometimes but im not fast enough she peered up at morgana angels are shy you know so ive heard im not she pressed a kiss to morganas belly before she danced away theres not a shy bone in my body thats what grandma sawyer always says an observant woman grandma sawyer ana commented while wrestling daisy into her arms to prevent her from disturbing quigleys afternoon nap both women enjoyed the energetic company as they walked among the flowers or rather as they walked and jessie skipped hopped ran and tumbled jessie reached for anas hand as they started toward the front of the house and morganas car i dont have any cousins is it nice yes its very nice morgana and sebastian and i practically grew up together kind of like brothers and sisters do i know how to get brothers and sisters cause my daddy told me how do you get cousins well if your mother or father have brothers or sisters and they have children those children are your cousins jessie digested this information with a frown of concentration which are you its complicated morgana said with a laugh opting to rest against her car for a moment before getting in anas and sebastians and my father are all brothers and our mothers are sisters so were kind of double cousins thats neat if i cant have cousins maybe i can have a brother or sister but my daddy says im a handful all by myself im sure hes right morgana agreed as ana chuckled brushing her hair back morgana glanced up there framed in one of the wide windows on the second floor of the house next door was a man undoubtedly jessies father ana had described him well enough morgana mused though he was more attractive and certainly sexier than her cousin had let on that very simple omission made her smile morgana lifted a hand in a friendly wave after a moments hesitation boone returned the salute thats my daddy jessie pinwheeled her arms in greeting he works up there but we havent unpacked all the boxes what does he do morgana asked since it was clear ana wasnt going to oh he tells stories really good stories about witches and fairy princesses and dragons and magic fountains i get to help sometimes i have to go because tomorrows my first day of school and he said i wasnt supposed to stay too long did i no ana bent down to kiss her cheek you can come back anytime bye and she was off gamboling across the lawn with the dog racing behind her ive never been more charmed or more worn out morgana said as she climbed into her car the girls a delightful whirlwind smiling out at ana she jiggled her keys and the father is certainly no slouch i imagine its difficult a man raising a little girl alone from the one glimpse i had he looked up to it she gunned the engine interesting that he writes stories about witches and dragons and such sawyer you said yes ana blew tousled hair out of her eyes i guess he must be boone sawyer it might intrigue him to know youre bryna donovans niece seeing as theyre in the same line of work that is if you wanted to intrigue him i dont ana said firmly ah well perhaps you already have morgana put the car in reverse blessed be cousin ana struggled with a frown as morgana backed out of the drive after driving to sebastians to give his horses their morning feeding and grooming ana spent most of the next morning delivering her potpourris her scented oils her medicinal herbs and potions others were boxed and packaged for shipping though she had several local customers for her wares including morganas shop wicca a great portion of her clientele was outside the area anastasias was successful enough to suit her the business shed started six years before satisfied her needs and ambitions and allowed her the luxury of working at home it wasnt for money the donovan fortune and the donovan legacy kept both her and her family comfortably off but like morgana with her shop and sebastian with his many businesses ana needed to be productive she was a healer but it was impossible to heal everyone long ago she had learned it was destructive to attempt to take on the ills and pains of the world part of the price of her power was knowing there was pain she could not alleviate she did not reject her gift she used it as she thought best herbalism had always fascinated her and she accepted the fact that she had the touch centuries before she might have been the village wise woman and that never failed to amuse her in todays world she was a businesswoman who could mix a bath oil or an elixir with equal skill if she added a touch of magic it was hers to add and she was happy happy with the destiny that had been thrust on her and with the life she had made from it even if shed been miserable she thought this day would have lifted her spirits the beckoning sun the caressing breeze the faintest taste of rain in the air rain that would not fall for hours and then would fall gently wanting to take advantage of the day she decided to work outside starting some herbs from seed he was watching her again bad habit boone thought with a grimace as he glanced down at the cigarette between his fingers he wasnt having much luck with breaking bad habits nor was he getting a hell of a lot of work done since hed looked out of the window and had seen her outside she always looked so elegant he decided a kind of inner elegance that wasnt the least diminished by the grassstained cutoffs and shortsleeved tshirt she wore it was in the way she moved as if the air were wine that she drank lightly from as she passed through it getting lyrical he mused and reminded himself to save it for his books maybe it was because she was the fairyprincess type he so often wrote about there was that ethereal otherworldly air about her and the quiet strength in her eyes boone had never believed that fairy princesses were pushovers but there was still this delicacy about her body a body he sincerely wished he hadnt begun to dwell upon not a frailty but a serene kind of femininity that he imagined would baffle and allure any male who was still breathing boone sawyer was definitely breathing now what was she doing he wondered crushing out his cigarette impatiently and moving closer to the window shed gone into the garden shed and had come out again with her arms piled high with pots wasnt it just like a woman to try to carry more than she should even as he was thinking it and indulging in a spot of male superiority he saw daisy streak across her lawn chasing the sleek gray cat he had a hand on the window prepared to shoot it up and call off the dog before he could make the move he saw it was already too late in slow motion it might have been an interesting and wellchoreographed dance the cat streaked like gray smoke between anas legs she swayed the clay pots in her arms teetered boone swore then let out a sigh of relief when she righted them and herself again before the breath was out daisy plowed through destroying the temporary balance this time anas feet were knocked completely out from under her she went down and the pots went up though he was already swearing boone heard the crash as he leapt through the terrace doors and down the steps to the lower deck she was muttering what sounded to him like exotic curses when he reached her and he could hardly blame her her cat was up a tree spitting down on the yipping dog the pots shed been carrying were little more than shards scattered over the grass and the edge of the patio where the impact had taken place boone winced cleared his throat ah are you all right she was on her hands and knees and her hair was over her eyes but she tossed it back and shot him a long look through the blond wisps dandy i was at the window this certainly wasnt the time to admit hed been watching her passing by the window he corrected i saw the chase and collision crouching down he began to help her pick up the pieces im really sorry about daisy weve only had her a few days and we havent had any luck with training shes a baby yet no point in blaming a dog for doing what comes naturally ill replace the pots he said feeling miserably awkward i have more because the barking and spitting were getting desperate ana sat back on her heels daisy the command was quiet but firm and it was answered instantly tail wagging furiously the pup scrambled over to lick at her face and arms refusing to be charmed ana cupped the dogs face in her hands sit she ordered and the puppy plopped her rump down obligingly now behave yourself with a little whine of repentance daisy settled down with her head on her paws almost as impressed as he was baffled boone shook his head howd you do that magic she said shortly then relented with a faint smile you could say ive always had a way with animals shes just happy and excited and roaring to play you have to make her understand that some activities are inappropriate ana patted daisys head and earned an adoring canine glance ive been trying bribery thats good too she stretched out under a trellis of scarlet clematis looking for more broken crockery it was then that boone noticed the long scratch on her arm youre bleeding she glanced down there were nicks on her thighs too hard to avoid with pots raining down on me he was on his feet in a blink and hauling ana to hers damn it i asked you if you were all right well really i well have to clean it up he saw there was more blood trickling down her legs and he reacted exactly as he would if it were jessie he panicked oh lord he scooped an amazed ana into his arms and hurried toward the closest door honestly theres absolutely no need its going to be fine baby well take care of it half amused half annoyed ana huffed out a breath as he pushed his way into the kitchen in that case ill cancel the ambulance if youd just put me he dropped her into one of the padded icecream chairs at her kitchen table down nerves jittering boone raced to the sink for a cloth efficiency speed and cheer were the watchwords in such cases he knew as he dampened the cloth and squirted it with soap he took several long breaths to calm himself it wont look so bad when we get it cleaned up youll see after pasting a smile on his face he walked back to kneel in front of her im not going to hurt you gently he began to dab at the thin line of blood that had dripped down her calf were going to fix it right up just close your eyes and relax he took another long breath i knew this man once he began improvising a story as he always did for his daughter he lived in a place called briarwood where there was an enchanted castle behind a high stone wall ana who had been on the point of firmly telling him she could tend to herself stopped and did indeed relax growing over the wall were thick vines with big razorsharp thorns no one had been to the castle in more than a hundred years because no one was brave enough to climb that wall and risk being scraped and pricked but the man who was very poor and lived alone was curious and day after day he would walk from his house to the wall and stand on the tips of his toes to see the sun gleam on the topmost towers and turrets of the castle boone turned the cloth over and dabbed at the cuts he couldnt explain to anyone what he felt inside his heart whenever he stood there he wanted desperately to climb over sometimes at night in his bed he would imagine it fear of those thick sharp thorns stopped him until one day in high summer when the scent of flowers was so strong you couldnt take a breath without drinking it in that glimpse of the topmost towers wasnt enough something in his heart told him that what he wanted most in the world lay just beyond that thorncovered wall so he began to climb it again and again he fell to the ground with his hands and arms pricked and bleeding and again and again he pushed himself up his voice was soothing and his touch his touch was anything but as gentle as he was with the cool cloth an ache began to spread slow and warm from the center of her body outward he was stroking her thighs now where the sharp edge of a shard had nicked the flesh ana closed her hand into a fist the twin of which clenched in her stomach she needed him to stop she wanted him to go on and on it took all of that day boone continued in that rich mesmerizing storytellers voice and the heat mixed sweat with the blood but he didnt give up couldnt give up because he knew as hed never known anything before that his hearts desire his future and his destiny lay on the other side so with his hands raw and bleeding he used those thorny vines and dragged himself to the top exhausted filled with pain he stumbled and fell down and down to the thick soft grass that flowed from the wall to the enchanted castle the moon was up when he awoke dazed and disoriented with the last of his strength he limped across the lawn over the drawbridge and into the great hall of the castle that had haunted his dreams since childhood when he crossed the threshold the lights of a thousand torches flared in that same instant all his cuts and scrapes and bruises vanished in that circle of flame that cast shadow and light up the white marble walls stood the most beautiful woman he had ever seen her hair was like sunlight and her eyes like smoke even before she spoke even before her lovely mouth curved in a welcoming smile he knew that it was she he had risked his life to find she stepped forward offered her hand to him and said only i have been waiting for you as he spoke the last words boone lifted his gaze to anas he was as dazed and disoriented as the man in the story he had conjured up when had his heart begun to pound like this he wondered how could he think when the blood was swimming in his head and throbbing in his loins while he struggled for balance he stared at her hair like sunlight eyes like smoke and he realized he was kneeling between her legs one hand resting intimately high on her thigh and the other on the verge of reaching out to touch that sunlight hair boone rose so quickly that he nearly overbalanced the table i beg your pardon he said for lack of anything better when she only continued to stare at him the pulse in her throat beating visibly he tried again i got carried away when i saw you were bleeding ive never been able to take jessies cuts and scrapes in stride struggling not to babble he thrust the cloth at her i imagine youd rather handle it yourself she accepted the cloth she needed a moment before she dared speak how was it possible that a man could stir her so desperately with doctoring and a fairy tale then leave her fighting to find a slippery hold on her composure when he apologized her own fault ana thought as she scrubbed with more force than was really necessary at the scrape on her arm it was her gift and her curse that she would feel too much you look like you should be the one sitting down she told him briskly then rose to go to the cupboard for one of her own medications would you like something cold to drink no yes actually though he doubted that a gallon of ice water would dampen the fire in his gut blood always makes me panic panicked or not you were certainly efficient she poured him a glass of lemonade from the fat pitcher she fetched from the refrigerator and it was a very nice story she was smiling now more at ease a story usually serves to calm both jessie and me during a session with iodine and bandages iodine stings she expertly dabbed a tobaccobrown liquid from a small apothecary jar onto her cleaned cuts i can give you something that wont if you like for your next emergency what is it suspicious he sniffed at the jar smells like flowers and so did she for the most part it is herbs flowers a dash of this and that she set the bottle aside capped it its what you might call a natural antiseptic im an herbalist oh she laughed at the skeptical look on his face thats all right the majority of people only trust healing aids they can buy at the drugstore they forget that people healed themselves quite well through nature for hundreds of years they also died of lockjaw from a nick from a rusty nail true enough she agreed if they didnt have access to a reputable healer since she had no intention of trying to convert him ana changed the subject did jessie get off for her first day of school yeah she was raring to go i was the one with the nervous stomach his smile came and went i want to thank you for being so tolerant of her i know she has a tendency to latch on to people it doesnt cross her mind that they might not want to entertain her oh but she entertains me in an automatic gesture of courtesy she took out a plate and lined it with cookies shes very welcome here shes very sweet unaffected and bright and she doesnt forget her manners youre doing a marvelous job raising her he accepted a cookie watching her warily jessie makes it easy as delightful as she is it cant be easy raising a child on your own i doubt its a snap even with two parents when the child is as energetic as jessie and as bright ana selected a cookie for herself and missed the narrowing of his eyes she must get her imagination from you it must be delightful for her to have a father who writes such lovely stories his eyes sharpened how do you know what i do the suspicion surprised her but she smiled again im a fan actually an avid fan of boone sawyers i dont recall telling you my first name no i dont believe you did ana said agreeably are you always so suspicious of a compliment mr sawyer i had my reasons for settling quietly here he set the halfempty glass down on the counter with a little clink i dont care for the idea of my neighbor interrogating my daughter or digging into my business interrogating she nearly choked on the word interrogating jessie why would i to get to know a little more about the rich widower in the next house for one throbbing moment she could only gape how unbelievably arrogant believe me i enjoy jessies company and i dont find it necessary to bring you into the conversation what he considered her painfully transparent astonishment made him sneer hed handled her type before but it was a disappointment a damned disappointment for jessie then its odd that youd know my name that im a single parent and my line of work isnt it she wasnt often angry it simply wasnt her nature but now she fought a short vicious war with temper you know i doubt very much youre worth an explanation but im going to give you one just to see how difficult it is for you to talk when you have to shove your other foot in your mouth she turned come with me i dont want i said come with me she strode out of the kitchen fully certain he would follow though annoyed and reluctant he did they moved through an archway and into a sundrenched great room dotted with the charm of white wicker furniture and chintz there were clusters of glinting crystals charming statues of elves and sorcerers and faeries through another archway and into a cozy library with a small adam fireplace and more mystical statuary there was a deep cushioned sofa in raspberry that would welcome an afternoon napper daintily feminine lace curtains dancing in the breeze that teased through an arching window and the good smell of books mixed with the airy fragrance of flowers ana walked directly to a shelf rising automatically to her toes to reach the desired volumes the milkmaids wish she recited as she pulled out one book after another the frog the owl and the fox a third wish for miranda she tossed a look over her shoulder though tossing one of the books would have been more satisfactory its a shame i have to tell you how much i enjoy your work uncomfortable he tucked his hands in his pockets he was already certain hed taken a wrong turn and he was wondering if he could find a suitable way to backtrack it isnt often grown women read fairy tales for pleasure what a pity though you hardly deserve the praise ill tell you that your work is lyrical and valuable on both a childs and an adults level far from mollified she shoved two of the books back into place then again perhaps such things are in my blood i was very often lulled to sleep by one of my aunts stories bryna donovan she said and had the pleasure of seeing his eyes widen i imagine youve heard of her thoroughly chastised boone let out a long breath your aunt he flicked his gaze over the shelf and saw several of brynas stories of magic and enchanted lands alongside his weve actually corresponded a few times ive admired her work for years so have i and when jessie mentioned that her father wrote stories about fairy princesses and dragons i concluded the sawyer next door was boone sawyer grilling a sixyearold wasnt necessary im sorry no actually he was much more embarrassed than sorry but that would have to do i had an uncomfortable experience not long before we moved and its made me overly sensitive he picked up a small fluidly sculpted statue of an enchantress turning it in his fingers as he spoke jessies kindergarten teacher she pumped all sorts of information out of the kid which isnt too hard really since jessies pumps always primed he set the statue down again all the more embarrassed that he felt this obligation to explain but she manipulated jessies feelings her natural need for a mother figure gave her all sorts of extra attention requested several conferences to discuss jessies unusual potential even going so far as to arrange a oneonone with me over dinner where she suffice it to say she was more interested in an unattached male with a nice portfolio than she was in jessies feelings or her welfare jessie was very hurt by it ana tapped a finger on the edge of one of his books before replacing it i imagine it was a difficult experience for both of you but let me assure you im not in the market for a husband and if i were i wouldnt resort to manipulations and maneuvers im afraid happyeverafter has been too well indoctrinated in me for that im sorry after i get those feet out of my mouth ill try to come up with a better apology the way she lifted her brow told him he wasnt out of the woods yet i think the fact that we understand each other will do now im sure you want to get back to work and so do i she walked past him into a tiled foyer and opened the front door tell jessie to be sure to drop by and let me know how she likes school heres your hat whats your hurry boone thought as he stepped out i will take care of those scratches he added but she was already closing the door in his face chapter contents prev next good going sawyer shaking his head boone sat down in front of his word processor first his dog knocks her down in her own yard then our blundering hero barges into her house uninvited to play with her legs to cap it he insults her integrity and insinuates that shes using his daughter to try to trap him all in one funfilled afternoon he thought in disgust it was a wonder she hadnt pitched him bodily out of her house rather than simply slamming the door in his face and why had he acted so stupidly past experience true but that wasnt the root of it and he knew it hormones he decided with a half laugh the kind of raging hormones better suited to a teenager than a grown man hed looked up at her face in that sunwashed kitchen feeling her skin warm under his hand smelling that serenely seductive scent she exuded and hed wanted hed craved for one blinding moment hed imagined with perfect clarity what it would be like to drag her off that curvy little chair to feel that quick jerkshudder of reaction as he devoured that incredibly softlooking mouth that instant edge of desire had been so sharp hed needed to believe there was some outside force some ploy or plot or plan to jumble his system so thoroughly safest course he realized with a sigh blame her of course he might have been able to dismiss the whole thing if it hadnt been for the fact that at that moment hed looked up into her eyes and seen the same dreamy hunger he was feeling and hed felt the power the mystery the titanic sexuality of a woman on the point of yielding his imagination had a great deal of punch he knew but what hed seen what hed felt had been utterly real for a moment for just a moment the tensions and needs had had that room humming like a harp string then hed pulled back as he should a man had no business seducing his neighbor in her kitchen now hed very likely destroyed any chance of getting to know her better just when hed realized he very much wanted to get to know miss anastasia donovan pulling out a cigarette boone ran his fingers over it while he thought through various methods of redemption when the light dawned it was so simple he laughed out loud if hed been looking for a way into the fair maidens heart which he wasnt exactly it couldnt have been more perfect pleased with himself he settled down to work until it was time to pick up jessie at school conceited jerk ana worked off her temper with mortar and pestle it was very satisfying to grind something even if it was only some innocent herbs into a powder imagine imagine him having the idea that she was on the make she decided sneering as if shed found him irresistible as if shed been pining away behind some glass wall waiting for her prince to come so that she could snare him the gall of the man at least shed had the satisfaction of thumbing her nose at him and if closing a door in anyones face was out of character for her well it had felt wonderful at the time so wonderful in fact that she wouldnt mind doing it again it was a damn shame he was so talented and it couldnt be denied that he was a wonderful father they were traits she couldnt help but admire there was no denying he was attractive magnetically sexual with just a dash of shyness tossed in for sweetness along with the wild tang of untamed male and those eyes those incredible eyes that just about stopped your breath when they focused on you ana scowled and tightened her grip on the pestle not that she was interested in any of that there might have been a moment in the kitchen when he was stroking her flesh so gently and his voice blocked out all other sound that she found herself drawn to him all right aroused by him she admitted it wasnt a crime but hed certainly shut that switch off quickly enough and that was fine by her beginning this instant and from now on she would think of him only as jessicas father she would be aloof if it killed her friendly only to the point where it eased her relationship with the child she enjoyed having jessie in her life and she wasnt about to sacrifice that pleasure because of a basic and very well justified dislike of jessies father hi there was that pixie face peeping through anas screen door even the dregs of temper were difficult to hold on to when she was faced with those big smiling eyes ana set the mortar and pestle aside and smiled back she supposed she had to be grateful that boone hadnt let the altercation that afternoon influence him to keep jessie away well it looks like you survived your first day of school did school survive you uhhuh my teachers name is mrs farrell she has gray hair and big feet but shes nice too and i met marcie and tod and lydia and frankie and lots of others in the morning we whoa with a laugh ana held up both hands maybe you should come in and sit down before you give me the days events i cant open the door cause my hands are full oh ana obligingly pushed open the screen what have you got there presents on a huff of breath jessie dropped a package on the table then she held up a large crayon drawing we got to draw pictures today and i made two one for daddy and one for you for me touched ana accepted the colorful drawing on the thick beige paper that brought back some of her own school memories its beautiful sunshine see this is you jessie pointed out a figure with yellow hair and quigley here a childish but undeniably clever depiction of a cat and all the flowers the roses and the daisies and the lark things larkspur ana murmured mistyeyed uhhuh and all the others jessie continued i couldnt remember all the names but you said youd teach me yes i will its just lovely jessie i drew daddy one of our new house with him standing out on the deck because he likes to stand there best he put it on the refrigerator an excellent idea ana walked over to center the picture on the refrigerator door anchoring it with magnets i like to draw my daddy draws real good and he said my mommy drew even better so i come by it naturally jessie slipped her hand into anas are you mad at me no sweetheart why would i be daddy said daisy knocked you down and broke your pots and you got hurt she studied the scratch on anas arm then kissed it solemnly im sorry its all right daisy didnt mean it she didnt mean to chew up daddys shoes either and make him say swear words ana bit her lip im sure she didnt daddy yelled and daisy got so nervous she peed right on the rug then he chased her around and around the house and it looked so funny that i couldnt stop laughing and daddy laughed too he said he was going to build a doghouse outside and put daisy and me in it ana lost any hope of taking it all seriously and she laughed as she scooped jessie up i think you and daisy would have a great time in the doghouse but if youd like to save your fathers shoes why dont you let me help you work with her do you know how can you teach her tricks and everything oh i imagine watch she shifted jessie to her hip and called quigley out from his nap beneath the kitchen table the cat rose reluctantly stretched his front legs then his back then padded out okay sit heaving a feline sigh he did up resigned quigley rose on his haunches and pawed the air like a circus tiger now if you do your flip i might just open a can of tuna fish later for your dinner the cat seemed to be debating with himself then perhaps because the trick was small potatoes compared to tuna he leapt up arching his back and flipping over to land lightly on his feet while jessie crowed with laughter and applauded quigley modestly cleaned his paws i didnt know cats could do tricks quigleys a very special cat ana set jessie down to give quigley a stroking he purred like a freight train nuzzling his face against her knee his familys in ireland like most of mine does he get lonely smiling ana scratched under quigleys jaw we have each other now would you like a snack while you tell me about the rest of your day jessie hesitated tempted i dont think i can cause its close to dinner and daddy oh i almost forgot she rushed back to the table to pick up a package wrapped in candystriped paper this is for you from daddy from unconsciously ana linked her hands behind her back what is it i know jessie grinned her eyes snapping with excitement but i cant tell telling spoils the surprise you have to open jessie picked it up and thrust it at ana dont you like presents jessie asked when ana kept her hands clasped tight behind her back i like them best of anything and daddy always gives really good ones im sure he does but i dont you like daddy jessies lower lip poked out are you mad at him because daisy broke your pots no no im not mad at him not for the broken pots anyway it wasnt his fault and yes of course i like him that is i dont know him very well and i caught ana decided and she worked up a smile im just surprised to get a present when its not my birthday to please the child ana took the gift and shook it doesnt rattle she said and jessie clapped and giggled guess guess what it is ah a trombone no no trombones are too big excitement had her bouncing open it open it and see it was the childs reaction that had her own heart beating a shade too fast ana assured herself to please jessie she ripped the paper with a flourish oh it was a book a childs oversize book with a snowy white cover on the front was a beautiful illustration of a goldenhaired woman wearing a sparkling crown and flowing blue robes the faerie queen ana read by boone sawyer its brandnew jessie told her you cant even buy it yet but daddy gets his copies early she ran a hand gently over the picture i told him she looks like you its a lovely gift ana said with a sigh and a sneaky one how was she supposed to stay irritated with him now he wrote something inside for you too impatient to wait jessie opened the cover herself see right there to anastasia with hopes that a magic tale works as well as a white flag boone her lips curved it was impossible to prevent it how could anyone refuse a truce so charmingly requested which was of course what boone was counting on as he shoved a packing box out of his way with his foot he glanced through the window toward the house next door not a peep he imagined it might take a few days for ana to calm down but he thought hed made a giant stride in the right direction after all he didnt want any antagonism between himself and jessies new friend turning back to the stove he lowered the heat on the boneless chicken breasts he had simmering then deftly began to mash potatoes jessies number one favorite he thought as he sent the beaters whirling they could have mashed potatoes every night for a year and the kid wouldnt complain of course it was up to him to vary the menu to make sure she got a healthy meal every night boone poured in more milk and grimaced he had to admit if there was one part of parenting he would cheerfully give up it was the pressure of deciding what they were to eat night after night he didnt mind cooking it so much it was that daily decision between pot roast baked chicken pork chops and all the others plus what to serve with it out of desperation hed begun to clip recipes secretly in hopes of adding some variety at one time hed seriously considered hiring a housekeeper both his mother and his motherinlaw had urged him to and then theyd gone into one of their competitive huddles on how to choose the proper woman to fit the bill but the idea of having someone in the house someone who might gradually take over the rearing of his daughter had deterred him jessie was his one hundred percent his despite dinner decisions and grocery shopping that was the way he liked it as he added a generous slice of butter to the creamy potatoes he heard her footsteps racing across the deck good timing frog face i was just about to give you a whistle he turned licking potatoes from his finger and saw ana standing in the doorway one hand on jessies shoulder the muscles in his stomach tightened so quickly that he nearly winced well hello i didnt mean to interrupt your cooking ana began i just wanted to thank you for the book it was very nice of you to send it over im glad you like it he realized he had a dishcloth tucked in his jeans and hastily rugged it out it was the best peace offering i could think of it worked she smiled charmed by the sight of him hovering busily over a hot stove thanks for thinking of me now id better get out of your way so you can finish cooking your dinner she can come in cant she jessie was already tugging on anas hand cant she daddy sure please he shoved a box out of her way we havent finished unpacking yet its taking longer than i thought it would out of politeness and curiosity ana stepped inside there were no curtains on the window as yet and a few packing boxes littered the stone colored floor tiles but ranged along the royal blue countertop there was a glossy ceramic cookie jar in the shape of alices white rabbit a teapot of the mad hatter and a dormouse sugar bowl potholders obviously hooked by a childs hand hung on little brass hooks the refrigerators art gallery was crowded with jessies drawings and the puppy was snoozing in the corner unpacked and tidy no she thought but this was already a home its a great house she commented i wasnt surprised when it sold quickly you want to see my room jessie tugged on anas hand again i have a bed with a roof on it and lots of stuffed animals you can take ana up later boone put in now you should go wash your hands okay she looked imploringly at ana dont go how about a glass of wine boone offered when his daughter raced off a good way to seal a truce all right drawings rustled as he opened the fridge jessies quite an artist it was awfully sweet of her to draw a picture for me careful or youll have to start papering the walls with them he hesitated the bottle in his hand wondering where hed put the wineglasses or if hed unpacked them at all a quick search through cupboards made it clear that he hadnt can you handle chardonnay in a bugs bunny glass she laughed absolutely she waited for him to pour hers and his elmer fudd welcome to monterey she said raising bugs in a toast thanks when she lifted the glass to her lips and smiled at him over the rim he lost his train of thought i have you lived here long all my life on and off the scent of simmering chicken and the cheerful disarray of the kitchen were so homey that she relaxed my parents had a home here and one in ireland theyre based in ireland for the most part now but my cousins and i settled here morgana was born in the house she lives in on seventeen mile drive sebastian and i were born in ireland in castle donovan castle donovan she laughed a little it sounds pretentious but it actually is a castle quite old quite lovely and quite remote its been in the donovan family for centuries born in an irish castle he mused maybe that explains why the first time i saw you i thought well theres the faerie queen right next door in the rosebushes his smiled faded and he spoke without thinking you took my breath away the glass stopped halfway to her lips those lips parted in surprised confusion i she drank to give herself a moment to think i suppose part of your gift would be imagining faeries under bushes elves in the garden wizards in the treetops i suppose she smelled as lovely as the breeze that brought traces of her garden and hints of the sea through his windows he stepped closer surprised and not entirely displeased to see the alarm in her eyes hows that scratch neighbor gently he cupped his hand around her arm skimmed his thumb up until he felt the pulse inside her elbow skitter whatever was affecting him was damn well doing the same to her his lips curved hurt no her voice thickened baffling her arousing him no of course it doesnt you still smell of flowers the salve no the knuckles of his free hand skimmed just under her chin you always smell of flowers wildflowers and sea foam how had she come to be backed against the counter his body brushing hers his mouth so close so temptingly close that she could all but taste it and she wanted that taste wanted it with a sudden staggering force that wiped every other thought out of her head slowly her eyes on his she brought her hand to his chest spread it over his heart where the beat was strong strong and wild and so would the kiss be she thought strong and wild from the first instant as if to assure her of that he grabbed a fistful of her hair tangling his fingers in it it was warm as hed known it would be warm as the sunlight it took its shade from for a moment his entire being was focused on the kiss to come the reckless pleasure of it his mouth was a breath from hers and her sigh was already filling him when he heard his daughters feet clattering on the stairs boone jolted back as if shed burned him speechless they stared at each other both of them stunned by what had nearly happened and by the force behind it what was he doing boone asked himself grabbing a woman in his kitchen when there was chicken on the stove potatoes going cold on the counter and his little girl about to skip into the room i should go ana set down her glass before it could slip out of her trembling hand i really only meant to stay a minute ana he shifted blocking the way in case she sprinted for the door i have a feeling what just happened here was out of character for both of us thats interesting dont you think she lifted those solemn gray eyes to his i dont know your character well i dont make a habit of seducing women in the kitchen when my daughters upstairs and i certainly dont make a habit out of wanting the hell out of a woman the minute i lay eyes on her she wished she hadnt set the wine down her throat was bone dry i suppose you want me to say ill take your word for it but i wont both anger and challenge sparkled in his eyes then ill have to prove it to you wont i no you my hands are clean clean clean blissfully unaware of the tension shimmering in the air jessie danced into the kitchen palms held out for inspection how come they have to be clean when i dont eat with my fingers anyway effortfully he pulled himself back and tweaked his daughters nose because germs like to sneak off little girls hands and into their mashed potatoes yuck she made a face then grinned daddy makes the best mashed potatoes in the whole wide world dont you want some she can stay for dinner cant she daddy really i of course she can mirroring his daughters grin but with something a great deal more dangerous in his eyes boone studied ana wed love to have you we have plenty and i think it would be a good idea for us to get to know each other before she didnt have to ask before what that was crystalclear but no matter how she tried she couldnt make her temper overtake the quick panicked excitement its very nice of you to ask she said with admirable calm i wish i could but she smiled down at jessies sound of disappointment i have to drive out to my cousins and take care of his horses will you take me with you sometime so i can see them if your father says its all right she bent down and kissed jessies sulky lips thank you for my picture sunshine its beautiful taking a cautious step away she looked at boone and the book i know ill enjoy it good night ana didnt run out of the house though she freely admitted she wasnt leaving so much as escaping back home she went through the motions giving quigley his promised tuna then changing into jeans and a denim shirt for the drive to sebastians house she was going to have to do some thinking she decided as she pulled on her boots some serious thinking weigh the pros and cons consider the consequences she had to laugh thinking how morgana would roll her eyes and accuse her of being impossibly libran perhaps her birth sign was partially responsible for the fact that ana could always see and sympathize with both sides of an argument it complicated matters as often as it solved them but in this case she was quite certain that a clear head and calm deliberation was the order of the day maybe she was unusually attracted to boone and the physical aspect of it was completely unprecedented certainly shed felt desire for a man before but never this quick sharp edge of it and a sharp edge usually meant a deep wound to follow that was certainly something to consider frowning she grabbed a jean jacket and started downstairs of course she was an adult unattached unencumbered and perfectly free to entertain the thought of a relationship with an equally free adult man then again she knew just how devastating relationships could be when people were unable to accept others for what they were still debating she swung out of the house she certainly didnt owe boone any explanations she was under no obligation to try to make him understand her heritage as she had tried to do years before with robert even if they became involved she wouldnt have to tell him ana got into her car and backed out of the drive her thoughts shifting back and forth it wasnt deception to hold part of yourself back it was selfpreservation as shed learned through hard experience and it was foolish even to be considering that angle when she hadnt decided if she wanted to be involved no that wasnt quite true she wanted it was more a matter of deciding if she could afford to become involved he was after all her neighbor a relationship gone sour would make it very uncomfortable when they lived in such close proximity and there was jessie to consider she was half in love with the girl already she wouldnt want to risk that friendship and affection by indulging her own needs purely physical needs ana told herself as she followed the winding road along the coast true boone would be able to offer her some physical pleasure she didnt doubt that for a moment but the emotional cost would just be too steep for everyone involved it would be better much better for everyone involved if she remained jessies friend while maintaining a wise distance from jessies father dinner was over and the dishes were done there had been a nottoosuccessful session with daisy though she would sit down if you pushed on her rump afterward thered been a lot of splashing in the tub then some horseplay to indulge in with his freshly scrubbed daughter there was a story to be told that last glass of water to be fetched once jessie was asleep and the house was quiet boone indulged himself with a brandy out on the deck there were piles of forms on his desk a parents homework that had to be filled out for jessies school files hed do them before he turned in he decided but this hour this dark quiet hour when the nearly full moon was rising was his he could enjoy the clouds that were drifting overhead promising rain the hypnotic sound of the water lapping against rock the chatter of insects in the grass that he would have to mow very soon and the scent of nightblooming flowers no wonder he had snapped this house up at the very first glimpse no place hed ever been had relaxed him more or given him more of a sense of rightness and peace and it appealed to his imagination the mystically shaped cypress the magical ice plants that covered the banks those empty and often eerie stretches of night beach the ethereally beautiful woman next door he smiled to himself for someone who hadnt felt much more than an occasional twinge for a woman in too long to remember he was certainly feeling a barrage of them now it had taken him a long time to get over alice though he still didnt consider himself part of the dating pool he hadnt been a monk over the past couple of years his life wasnt empty and hed been able after a great deal of pain to accept the fact that he had to live it he was sipping his brandy enjoying it and the simple pleasure of the night when he heard anas car not that hed been waiting for it boone assured himself even as he checked his watch he couldnt quite smother the satisfaction at her being home early too early to have gone out on a date not that her social life was any of his business he couldnt see her driveway but because the night was calm he heard her shut her car door then a few moments later he heard her open and close the door to her house propping his bare feet on the rail of the deck he tried to imagine her progress through the house into the kitchen yes the light snapped on and he could see her move past the window brewing tea perhaps or pouring herself a glass of wine shortly the light switched off again and he let his mind follow her through the house up the stairs more lights but it looked to boone like the glow of a candle against the dark glass rather than a lamp moments later he heard the faint drift of music harp strings haunting romantic and somehow sad briefly very briefly she was silhouetted against a window he could see quite clearly that slim feminine shadow as she stripped out of her shirt hastily he swallowed brandy and looked away however tempting it might be he wouldnt lower himself to the level of a peeping tom he did however find himself craving a cigarette and with apologies to his disapproving daughter he pulled one out of his pocket smoke stung the air soothed his nerves boone contented himself with the sound of harpsong it was a very long time before he went back into the house and slept with the sound of a gentle rain falling on the roof and the memory of harpsong drifting across the night breeze chapter contents prev next cannery row was alive with sounds the chattering of people as they strolled or rushed the bright ringing of a bell from one of the tourist bikes the ubiquitous calling of gulls searching for a handout ana enjoyed the crowds and the noise as much as she enjoyed the peace and solitude of her own backyard patiently she chugged along with the stream of weekend traffic on her first pass by morganas shop ana resigned herself to the fact that the perfect day had brought tourists and locals out in droves parking was going to be at a premium rather than frustrate herself searching for a spot on the street she pulled into a lot three blocks from wicca as she climbed out to open her trunk she heard the whine of a cranky toddler and the frustrated muttering of weary parents if you dont stop that right this minute you wont get anything at all i mean it timothy weve had just about enough now get moving the childs response to that command was to go limp sliding in a boneless heap onto the parking lot as his mother tugged uselessly at his watery arms ana bit her lip as it curved but it was obvious the young parents didnt see the humor of it their arms were full of packages and their faces were thunderous timothy ana thought was about to get a tanning though it was unlikely to make him more cooperative daddy shoved his bags at mommy and mouth grim bent down it was a small thing ana thought and they all looked so tired and unhappy she made the link first with the father felt the love the anger and the dark embarrassment then with the child confusion fatigue and a deep unhappiness over a big stuffed elephant hed seen in a shop window and been denied ana closed her eyes the fathers hand swung back as he prepared to administer a sharp slap to the boys diaperpadded rump the boy sucked in his breath ready to emit a piercing wail at the indignity of it suddenly the father sighed and his hand fell back to his side timothy peeked up his face hot and pink and tearstreaked the father crouched down holding out his arms were tired arent we on a hiccuping sob timothy bundled into them and rested his heavy head on his daddys shoulder thirsty okay champ the fathers hand went to the childs bottom but with a soothing pat he gave his tearyeyed wife an encouraging smile why dont we go have a nice cold drink he just needs a nap they moved off tired but relieved smiling to herself ana unlocked her trunk family vacations she thought werent all fun and frolic the next time they were ready to snarl at each other she wouldnt be around to help she imagined theyd muddle through without her after swinging her purse behind her back she began to unload the boxes she was delivering to morgana there were a half dozen of them filled with sacks of potpourri bottles of oils and creams beribboned sachets satiny sleep pillows and a months supply of special orders that ran from tonics to personalized perfumes ana considered making two trips gauged the distance and decided that if she balanced the load carefully she could make it in one she stacked juggled and adjusted then just managed to shut her trunk with an elbow she made it across the parking lot and down half a block before she began berating herself why did she always do this she asked herself two comfortable trips were better than one difficult one it wasnt that the boxes were so heavy though they were it was simply that they were awkward and the sidewalk was jammed and her hair was blowing in her eyes with a quick agile dance she managed barely to avoid a collision with a couple of teenage tourists in a surrey want some help annoyed with herself and irresponsible drivers she turned around there was boone looking particularly wonderful in baggy cotton slacks and shirt riding atop his shoulders jessie was laughing and clapping her hands we had a ride on the carousel and had ice cream and we saw you looks like youre still overloading boone commented theyre not heavy he patted jessies leg and following the signal she began to slide down his back well give you a hand thats all right she knew it was foolish to reject help when she needed it but she had managed quite successfully to avoid boone for the better part of a week and had managed almost as successfully to avoid thinking about him wondering about him i dont want to take you out of your way were not going any way in particular are we jessie uhuh were just wandering today its our day off ana couldnt prevent the smile any more than she could prevent the wariness from creeping into her eyes when she looked back at boone he was certainly looking at her she realized in that disconcertingly thorough way of his the smile creeping around his mouth had less to do with humor than it did with challenge i dont have to go far she began grabbing at a package that was beginning to slide i can just fine overriding her objections boone shifted boxes from her arms to his his eyes stayed on hers what are neighbors for i can carry one eager to help jessie bounced in her sneakers i can thank you ana handed jessie the lightest box im going a couple of blocks down to my cousins shop has she had her babies jessie asked as they started to walk no not yet i asked daddy how come she got to have two in there and he said sometimes theres twice the love how could anyone possibly have a defense against a man like this ana wondered her eyes were warm when they met his yes sometimes there is you always seem to have the right answer she murmured to boone not always he wasnt certain if he was relieved or annoyed that his hands were full of boxes if theyd been free he would have been compelled to touch her you just try for the best one at the time where have you been hiding anastasia hiding the warmth fled from her eyes i havent seen you out in your yard in days you didnt strike me as the type to scare that easily because jessie was skipping just ahead of them she bit off a more acid response i dont know what you mean i had work quite a bit of it as a matter of fact she nodded toward the boxes youre carrying some of it now is that so then im glad i didnt resort to knocking on your door and pretending i needed to borrow a cup of sugar i nearly did but it seemed so obvious she slanted him a look i appreciate your restraint and so you should she merely tossed her hair out of her eyes and called to jessie well go down this way so we can go in the back saturdays are usually busy she explained to boone i dont like going through the shop and distracting the customers what does she sell anyway oh ana smiled again this and that i think youd find her wares particularly interesting here we go she gestured to a little flagstone stoop flanked by pots of bloodred geraniums can you get the door jessie okay anxious as ever to see what was on the other side jessie shoved it open then let out a squeal oh look daddy look jessie set her package aside on the first available space and made a dive for the big white cat grooming herself on the table jessica boones voice was short and firm stopping his daughter in midstride what have i told you about going up to strange animals but daddy hes so pretty she ana corrected as she laid her boxes on the counter and your fathers quite right not all animals like little girls jessies fingers itched to stroke the thick white fur does she sometimes luna doesnt like anyone with a laugh ana scratched the cat between the ears but if youre very polite and pet her when she gives the royal consent youll get along well enough ana gave boone a reassuring smile luna wont scratch her when shes had enough shell just stalk off but apparently luna was in the mood for attention walking to the end of the table she rubbed her head against the hand jessie had held out she likes me the smile nearly split her face in two see daddy she likes me yes i see morgana usually keeps cold drinks back here ana opened the small refrigerator would you like something sure he really wasnt thirsty but the offer made it easy to linger he leaned back against the counter of the kitchenette while ana got out glasses the shop through there when he gestured at a door ana nodded yes and through theres the storeroom a great deal of what morgana sells is oneofakind so she doesnt keep a large supply of inventory he reached over anas shoulder to finger the thin leaves of a rosemary plant on the windowsill she into this kind of thing too ana tried to ignore the fact that his body was brushing hers she could smell the sea on him and imagined he and jessie had gone down to feed the gulls what kind of thing herbs and stuff in a manner of speaking she turned knowing shed be entirely too close and pushed the glass into his chest root beer terrific he knew it wasnt particularly fair and it was probably unwise as well but he took the glass and stood precisely where he was she had to tilt her head back to meet his eyes it might be a good hobby for jessie and me maybe you could show us how to grow some its no different from growing any living thing it took a great deal of effort to keep her voice even when breathing was so difficult care and attention and affection youre very much in my way boone i hope so with his eyes very intense very focused he lifted a hand to her cheek anastasia i really think we need to a deals a deal babe the smug voice carried through the door as it opened fifteen minutes of sitdown time every two hours youre being ridiculous for heavens sake you act as though im the only pregnant woman in the world heaving a sigh morgana walked into the back room her brows lifted when she saw the trio and particularly when she saw the way boone sawyer was caging her cousin at the rear counter youre the only pregnant woman in my world nash stopped short hey ana youre just the woman i need to convince morgana to take it easy now that youre here i can he glanced once at the man beside her then back again to focus boone well ill be damned boone sawyer you son of a he caught himself mostly because morgana shot an elbow into his ribs there was a little girl all eyes standing at the table gun he finished and strode across the room to shake boones hand and slap his back in a typical male greeting what are you doing here delivering stock i think he grinned gripping nashs hand hard in his how about you trying to keep my wife in line lord whats it been four years just about morgana folded her hands on her belly i take it you two know each other sure we do boone and i met at a writers conference it has to be ten years ago doesnt it i havent seen you since since alices funeral nash remembered abruptly and he remembered too the devastation the despair and the disbelief in boones eyes as hed stood beside his wifes grave how are you okay understanding boone smiled were okay good nash put a hand on boones shoulder and squeezed before he turned to jessie and youre jessica uhhuh she beamed up at him always interested in meeting someone new who are you im nash he crossed to her crouched down except for the eyes eyes that were all boone she was the image of alice bright pretty pixielike he offered her a formal handshake its nice to meet you she giggled and shook his hand did you put the babies into morgana to his credit he was speechless only for a moment guilty with a laugh he picked her up but im leaving it up to ana to get them out so what are the two of you doing in monterey we live here now jessie told him right next door to anas house no kidding nash grinned over at boone when a little more than a week id heard youd moved here and i figured id look you up once we got things together i didnt realize you were married to my neighbors cousin a small and fascinating world isnt it morgana commented she tilted her head at ana well aware that her cousin hadnt said a word since theyd come into the room since no ones going to introduce me im morgana sorry nash said jiggling jessie on his hip sit down im perfectly sit this from ana as she pulled out a chair outnumbered sighing morgana sat are you enjoying monterey very much boone told her and his gaze shifted to ana more than i anticipated i always enjoy having more than i anticipated with a light laugh she patted her belly well all have to get together very soon so you can tell me things nash doesnt want me to know id be glad to babe you know im an open book he kissed the top of morganas head and winked at ana that the stuff morganas been waiting for yes all of it anxious to keep her hands busy ana turned to the pile of boxes ill unpack it for you morgana i want you to try out this new violet body lotion before you put it out and i brought extra of the soapwort shampoo good im completely out she took the bottle of lotion from ana and unstopped the bottle nice scent she dabbed a bit on the back of her hand and rubbed it in good texture sweet violets and the irish moss da sent me she glanced up from her unpacking nash why dont you show jessie and boone the shop good idea i think youre going to find a lot of this right up your alley nash told boone as he led the way to the door boone shot a look over his shoulder before he passed through anastasia he waited until she glanced up from the boxes dont run away my my my morgana settled back and smiled like a cat with a direct line to bossy want to fill me in with a little more force than necessary ana ripped through packing tape on what on you and your gorgeous neighbor of course theres nothing to fill in darling i know you when i walked into this room you were so wrapped up in him i could have called out a tornado and you wouldnt have blinked ana busied herself unpacking bottles dont be ridiculous you havent called out a tornado since the first time we saw the wizard of oz ana morganas voice was low and firm i love you i know i love you too youre never nervous perhaps thats why its so fascinating and concerning to me that youre so nervous just now im not she rapped two bottles together and winced all right all right all right i have to think about it she whipped around he makes me nervous and it would be ridiculous to deny its the fact that im very attracted to him thats making me so nervous i just have to think about it think about what how to handle it him i mean i have no intention of making another mistake particularly since anything i do that involves boone also involves jessie oh honey are you falling in love with him thats absurd ana realized too late that the denial was too forceful to be taken at face value im just jumpy thats all i havent had a man affect me like this physically in ever never before and she was very much afraid never again in a long time i just need to think she repeated ana morgana held out both hands sebastian and mel will be back in a couple of days from their honeymoon why dont you ask him to look it would relieve your mind if you knew resolute ana shook her head no not that i havent considered it whatever happens however it happens i want it to be on equal terms knowing would give me an unfair advantage over boone i have a feeling those equal terms would be important to both of us you know best let me tell you something as a woman her lips curved as a witch knowing not knowing makes no difference with a man once he touches your heart no difference at all ana nodded then ill have to make sure he doesnt touch mine until im ready this is incredible boone was saying as he surveyed wicca just incredible i thought so too the first time i walked in nash picked up a crystal wand tipped at the end with a spear of amethyst i guess people in our line of work are suckers for this stuff fairy tales boone agreed accepting the wand before running a finger over a bronze cast of a snarling wolf or the occult a fine line between the two your last movie chilled my blood even when it made me laugh nash grinned the humor in horror nobody does it better he glanced over at his daughter she was staring at a miniature silver castle surrounded by a moat of rainbow glass her eyes huge her hands behind her back ill never get out of here emptyhanded shes beautiful nash said wondering as he often did about the children that would be his before much longer looks like her mother he saw the question and the concern in his friends eyes grief passes nash whether you want it to or not alice was a wonderful part of my life and she gave me the best thing in it im grateful for every moment i had with her he set the wand down now id like to know how you the worlds most determined bachelor came to be married and expecting twins research nash grinned and rocked back on his heels i wanted to get out of la and keep within commuting distance id only been here a short time when i needed to do some research on a script i walked in here and there she was there was more of course a great deal more but it wasnt nashs place to tell boone about the donovan legacy not even if boone would have believed him when you decide to take the plunge you take it big you too indianas a long way from here i didnt want to be able to commute boone said with a grimace my parents alices parents jessie and i were becoming their lifes work and i wanted a change for both of us next door to ana huh nash narrowed his eyes the redwood place with all the glass and decks thats the one good choice he glanced toward jessie again shed wandered around the shop and had worked her way back to the little castle she hadnt once asked for it and that made the naked desire in her eyes all the more effective if you dont buy her that i will when ana came out to restock a few shelves for morgana she saw not only the silver castle being rung up on the counter but the wand a threefoot sculpture of a winged faerie shed had her eye on herself a crystal suncatcher in the shape of a unicorn a pewter wizard holding a manyfaceted ball and a baseballsized geode were weak boone said with a quick sheepish grin as ana lifted a brow no willpower but excellent taste she ran a fingertip over the faerie wings lovely isnt she one of the best ive seen i figured id put her in my office for inspiration good idea she bent over a compartment containing tumbling stones malachite for clear thinking her fingers walked through the smooth stones testing rejecting selecting sodalite to relieve mental confusion moonstone for sensitivity amethyst of course for intuition of course she ignored him a crystal for allaround good things tilting her head she studied him jessie says youre trying to quit smoking he shrugged im cutting down she handed him the crystal keep it in your pocket tumbling stones are on the house when she turned away with her colorful bottles he picked up the crystal and rubbed it with his fingers it couldnt hurt he didnt believe in magic crystals or stone power though he did think they had plot possibilities boone also had to admit they looked kind of nice in the little bowl on his desk atmosphere he thought like the geode hed bought to use as a paperweight all in all the afternoon had had several benefits he and jessie had enjoyed themselves thoroughly riding the carousel at the emporium playing video games just walking down cannery row and fishermans wharf running into anastasia had been a plus he mused as he toyed with the creamy moonstone and seeing nash again discovering that they lived in the same area was gold hed been missing male companionship funny he hadnt realized it as busy as his life had been over the past few months with planning the move executing the move adjusting to the move and nash though their friendship had primarily been through correspondence over the years was exactly the kind of companion boone preferred easygoing loyal imaginative it would be a kick to be able to pass on a few fatherly hints to nash once his twins were born oh yeah he reflected as he held up the moonstone watching it gleam in the bright wash of moonlight through his office window it certainly was a small and fascinating world one of his oldest friends married to the cousin of the woman next door it would certainly be hard for anastasia to avoid him now and no matter what she said that was exactly what shed been doing he had a very strong feeling and he couldnt help being a bit smug about it that he was making the fair maiden nervous hed nearly forgotten what it was like to approach a woman who reacted with faint blushes confused eyes and rapid pulses most of the women hed escorted over the past couple of years had been sleek and sophisticated and safe he added with a little shrug hed enjoyed their companionship and hed never lost his basic enjoyment of female company but thered been no tug no mystery no illusion he supposed he was still the kind of man attracted to the oldfashioned type the rosesandmoonlight type he thought with a half laugh then he saw her and the laugh caught in his throat down in her garden walking almost gliding through the silvery light with the gray cat slipping in and out of the shadows her hair loose sprinkling gold dust down her back and over the sheer shoulders of a pale blue robe she carried a basket and he thought he could hear her singing as she cut flowers and slipped them into it she was singing an old chant that had been passed down generation to generation it was well past midnight and ana thought herself alone and unobserved the first night of the full moon in autumn was the time to harvest just as the first night of the full moon in spring was the time to sow she had already cast the circle purifying the area she laid the flowers and herbs in the basket as gently as children there was magic in her eyes in her blood under the moon through shadow and light these blooms i chose by touch by sight spells to weave to ease and free as i will so mote it be she plucked betony and heliotrope dug mandrake root and selected tansy and balsam blood roses for strength and sage for wisdom the basket grew heavy and fragrant tonight to reap tomorrow to sow to take only that which ive caused to grow remembering always what is begun to serve to aid an it harm none as the charm was cast she lowered her face to the blooms drawing in the ripe melody of the fragrance i wondered if you were real her head came up quickly and she saw him hardly more than a shadow by the hedge then he stepped through into her garden and became a man the heart that had leapt to her throat gradually settled again you startled me im sorry it must be the moonlight he thought that made her look so enchanting i was working late and i looked out and saw you it seemed late to be picking flowers theres a lot of moonlight she smiled he had seen nothing it wasnt safe for him to see i would think youd know that anything picked under the full moon is charmed he returned the smile got any rampion the reference to rapunzel made her laugh as a matter of fact i do no magic garden is complete without it ill pot some for you if you like i rarely say no to magic the breeze fluttered her hair giving in to the moment he reached out took a handful he watched the smile in her eyes fade what replaced it had his blood singing you should go in jessies alone shes asleep he moved closer as if the hair hed twined around his finger were a rope and she were drawing him to her he was within the circle now within the magic shed cast the windows are open so id hear her if she called for me its late ana gripped the basket so tightly that the wicker dug into her skin i need to gently he took the basket and set it on the ground so do i his other hand moved into her hair combing it back from her face very much as he lowered his mouth toward hers she shivered and tried one last time to take control boone starting something like this could complicate things for all of us maybe im tired of things being simple but he turned his head just a fraction so that his lips cruised up her cheek over her temple im surprised you dont know that when a man finds a woman picking flowers in the moonlight he has no choice but to kiss her she felt her bones melting her body was pliant when she slipped into his arms and she has no choice but to want him to her head fell back and she offered he thought he would take gently the night seemed to call for it with its perfumed breezes and the dreamy music of sea against rock the woman in his arms was wandslender and the thin silk of her robe was cool over the warmth of satin skin but as he felt himself sink into that soft lush mouth as her fragrance whispered seductively around him he dragged her hard against him and plundered instantly desperate instantly greedy no rational thought could fight its way through the maze of sensations she brought to him a sharp arrow of hunger pierced him bringing on a groan that was only part pleasure pain he felt the aches of a thousand pricks of pain yet he couldnt pull himself away from her couldnt stop his mouth from seeking more of hers he was afraid afraid that if he released her she would disappear like smoke and he would never never feel this way again she couldnt soothe him part of her wanted to stroke him and ease him and promise him that it would be all right for both of them but she couldnt he devastated her whether it was her own grinding needs the echo of his need seeping into her or a mix of both the result was a complete loss of will she had known yes she had known that this first meeting would be wild and strong shed craved it even as shed feared it now she was beyond fear like him she found the mixture of pain and pleasure irresistible her trembling hands skimmed over his face into his hair and locked there her body shuddering from the onslaught pressed urgently to his when she murmured his name she was breathless but he heard her heard her through the blood pounding in his head heard that soft shaky sound she was trembling or he was the uncertainty about who was more dazed had him slowly carefully drawing away he held her still his hands on her shoulders his gaze on her face in the moonlight she could see herself there trapped in that sea of blue trapped in him boone not yet he needed a moment to steady himself by god hed nearly swallowed her whole not just yet holding himself back he touched his lips to hers lightly in a long quiet kiss that wrecked whatever was left of her defenses i didnt mean to hurt you you didnt she pressed her lips together and tried to bring her voice over a whisper you didnt hurt me you staggered me i thought i was ready for this he ran his hands down her arms before he released her i dont know if anyone could be because he wasnt sure what would happen if he touched her again he slipped his hands into his pockets maybe its the moonlight maybe its just you i have to be straight with you anastasia i dont know quite how to handle this well she wrapped her arms tight and cupped her elbows that makes two of us if it wasnt for jessie you wouldnt go into that house alone tonight and i dont take intimacy lightly steadier now she nodded if it wasnt for jessie i might ask you to stay with me tonight she took a long breath she knew it was important to be honest at least in this you would be my first your his hands went limp now he felt both a lick of fear and an incredible excitement at the thought of her innocence oh god her chin came up im not ashamed of it no i didnt mean speechless he dragged a hand through his hair innocent a goldenhaired virgin in a thin blue robe with flowers at her feet and a man was supposed to resist and walk away alone i dont suppose you have any idea what that does to a man not precisely since im not a man she bent down for her basket but i do know what realizing that you may soon be giving yourself for the first time does to a woman so it seems to me we should both give this some clear thinking she smiled or tried to and its very difficult to think clearly after midnight when the moons full and the flowers are ripe ill say good night boone ana he touched her arm but didnt hold on nothing will happen until youre ready she shook her head yes it will but nothing will happen unless its meant with her robe billowing around her she raced toward the house chapter contents prev next sleep had been a long time coming boone hadnt tossed and turned so much as lain staring up at the ceiling hed watched the moonlight fade into that final deep darkness before dawn now with the sun streaming in bright ribbons over the bed he was facedown spread out and fast asleep in the dream floating through his brain he scooped ana into his arms and carried her up a long curved staircase of white marble at the top suspended above puffy cotton clouds was an enormous bed pooled in waterfalls of white satin hundreds of long slender candles burned in a drifting light he could smell them the soft tang of vanilla the mystique of jasmine and her that quietly sexy scent that went everywhere with her she smiled hair like sunlight eyes like smoke when he laid her on the bed they sank deep as if into the clouds themselves there was harpsong romantic as tears and a whisper that was nothing more than the clouds themselves breathing as her arms lifted wound around him they were floating like ghosts in some fantasy bound together by needs and knowledge and the unbearable sweetness of that first long lingering kiss her mouth moved under his yielding as she murmured daddy boone came awake with a crash as his daughter landed with a thump on his back his unintelligible grunt had her giggling and scooting down to smack a kiss on his stubbled cheek daddy wake up i fixed you breakfast breakfast he grumbled into the pillow struggling to clear the sleep from his throat and the dream from his system what time is it the little hands on the ten and the big hands on the three i made cinnamon toast and poured orange juice in the little glasses he grunted again rolling over to peer through gritty eyes at jessie she looked bright as a sunbeam in her pink cotton blouse and shorts shed done the buttons up wrong but shed brushed the tangles from her hair how long have you been up hours and hours and hours i let daisy outside and gave her breakfast and i got dressed all by myself and brushed my teeth and watched cartoons then i got hungry so i fixed breakfast youve been busy uhhuh and i was real quiet too so you didnt have to wake up early on your sleepin day you were real quiet boone agreed and reached up to fix her buttons i guess you deserve a prize her eyes lit what what do i get how about a pink belly he rolled with her on the bed wrestling while she squealed and wriggled he let her win pretending exhaustion and defeat when she bounced on his back too tough for me thats cause i eat my vegetables you dont i eat some uhuh hardly any when you get to be thirtythree you wont have to eat your brussels sprouts either but i like them he grinned into the pillow thats only because im such a good cook my mother was lousy she doesnt ever cook now jessie printed her name with a fingertip on her fathers bare back her and grandpa sawyer always go out to eat thats because grandpa sawyers no fool she was having trouble with the letter s boone noted theyd have to work on it you said we could call grandma and grandpa sawyer and nana and pop today can we sure in a couple of hours he turned over again studying her do you miss them baby yeah with her tongue between her teeth she began to print sawyer on his chest it seems funny that theyre not here will they come to visit us sure they will the guilt that was part and parcel of parenthood worked at him do you wish wed stayed in indiana no way her eyes went huge we didnt have the beach there and the seals and stuff or the big carousel in town or ana living next door this is the best place in the world i like it here too he sat up and kissed her brow now beat it so i can get dressed youll come right downstairs for breakfast she asked as she slid from the bed absolutely im so hungry i could eat a whole loaf of cinnamon toast delighted she rushed for the door im going to make more right now knowing she would take him at his word and go through an entire loaf of bread boone hurried through his shower opted not to shave and pulled on cutoffs and a tshirt that would probably have done better in the rag pile he tried not to dwell on the dream after all it was simple enough to interpret he wanted ana no big revelation there and all that white white on white was obviously a symbol of her innocence it scared the hell out of him he found jessie in the kitchen busily slathering butter on another piece of toast there was a plate heaped with them more than a few of them burnt the smell of cinnamon was everywhere boone put on the coffee before he snagged a piece it was cold hard and lumped with sugary cinnamon obviously jessie had inherited her grandmothers culinary talents its great he told her and swallowed gamely my favorite sunday breakfast do you think daisy can have some boone looked at the pile of toast again glanced down at the pup whose tongue was lolling out with any luck he might be able to pawn off half his sunday breakfast on the dog i think she could crouching boone held out a second piece of toast close enough for daisy to sniff sit he ordered in the firm nononsense voice the training books had suggested daisy continued to loll her tongue and wag her tail daisy sit he gave her rump a nudge daisy went down then bounded back on all fours to jump at him forget it he held the toast out of reach and repeated the command after five frustrating minutes during which he tried not to remember how simple it had been for ana he managed to hold the dogs hindquarters down daisy gobbled up the bread pleased with herself she did it daddy sort of he rose to pour himself some coffee well take her outside in a little while and have a real lesson okay jessie munched happily on her toast maybe anas company will be gone and she can help company boone asked as he reached for a mug i saw her outside with a man she gave him a big hug and a kiss and everything she the mug clattered onto the counter butterfingers jessie said smiling yeah boone kept his back turned as he righted the mug and poured the coffee what ah sort of a man he thought his voice was casual enough to fool a sixyearold anyway a really tall man with black hair they were laughing and holding hands maybe its her boyfriend boyfriend boone repeated between his teeth whats the matter daddy nothing coffees hot he sipped it black holding hands he thought kissing hed get a look at this guy himself why dont we go out on the deck jess see if we can get daisy to sit again okay singing the new song shed learned in school jessie gathered up toast i like to eat outside its nice yeah its nice boone didnt sit when they were on the deck but stood at the rail the mug in his hand he didnt see anyone in the next yard and that was worse now he could imagine what ana and her tall darkhaired boyfriend might be doing inside alone he ate three more pieces of toast washing them down with black coffee while he fantasized about just what hed say to miss anastasia donovan the next time he saw her if she thought she could kiss him to the point of explosion one night then dally with some strange guy the next morning she was very much mistaken hed straighten her out all right the minute he got ahold of her hed his thoughts broke off when she came out the kitchen door calling over her shoulder to someone ana jessie leapt up on the bench waving and shouting ana hi while boone watched through narrowed eyes ana looked in their direction it seemed to him that her hand hesitated on its way up to return the wave and her smile was strained sure he thought as he gulped down more coffee id be nervous too if i had some strange man in the house can i go tell her what daisy did can i daddy yeah his smile was grim as he set his empty mug on the rail why dont you do that snatching up some more toast she darted down the steps calling for daisy to follow and for ana to wait boone waited himself until he saw the man stroll outside to join ana he was tall all right boone noted with some resentment several inches over six feet he drew his own shoulders back his hair was true black and long enough to curl over his collar and blow romantically boone imagined a woman would think in the breeze he looked tanned fit and elegant and the breath hissed out between boones teeth when the stranger slipped an arm around anas shoulders as if it belonged there well see about this boone decided and started down the deck stairs with his hands jammed in his pockets well just see about this by the time he reached the hedge of roses jessie was already chattering a mile a minute about daisy and ana was laughing her arms tucked intimately around the strangers waist id sit too if someone was going to feed me cinnamon toast the man said and winked at ana youd sit if anyone was going to feed you anything ana gave him a little squeeze before she noticed boone at the hedge oh it was useless to curse the faint blush she felt heating her cheeks good morning hows it going boone gave her a slow nod then his gaze moved suspiciously to the man beside her we didnt mean to interrupt while you have company no thats all right i she broke off both confused and disconcerted by the tension humming in the air sebastian this is jessies father boone sawyer boone my cousin sebastian donovan cousin boone repeated and sebastian didnt bother to control the grin that spread over his face fortunately you made the introductions quickly ana he said i like my nose precisely the way it is he held out a hand nice to meet you ana was telling us she had new neighbors hes the one with horses daddy i remember boone found sebastians grip firm and strong he might have appreciated it if he hadnt seen the gleam of amusement in the mans eyes youre recently married indeed i am my he turned when the screen door slammed ah here she is now light of my life a tall slim woman with short tousled hair strode over in dusty boots cut it out donovan my blushing bride it was obvious they were laughing at each other he took his wifes hand and kissed it anas neighbors boone and jessie sawyer my own true love mary ellen mel she corrected quickly donovans the only one with the nerve to call me mary ellen greatlooking house she added with a nod toward the neighboring building i believe mr sawyer writes fairy tales childrens books much in the manner of aunt bryna oh yeah thats cool mel smiled down at jessie i bet you like that he writes the best stories in the world and this is daisy we taught her to sit can i come see your horses sure mel crouched down to ruffle the pups fur while mel engaged jessie in conversation about horses and dogs sebastian looked back at boone it is a lovely house you have he said actually hed toyed with buying it himself amusement lit his eyes again excellent location we like it boone decided it was foolish to pretend not to understand the meaning behind the words we like it very much very deliberately he reached out to trail a fingertip down anas cheek youre looking a little pale this morning anastasia im fine it was easy enough to keep her voice even but she knew very well how simple it would be for sebastian to see what she was thinking already she could feel his gentle probing and she was quite certain he was poking his nosy mental fingers into boones brain if youll excuse me i promised sebastian some hawthorn didnt you pick any last night her gaze met his held it i have other uses for that well get out of your way come on jess he reached for his daughters hand nice meeting both of you ill see you soon ana sebastian had the tact to wait until boone was out of earshot well well i go away for a couple of weeks and look at the trouble you get into dont be ridiculous ana turned her back and started toward an herb bed im not in any sort of trouble darling darling ana your friend and neighbor was prepared to rip my throat out until you introduced me as your cousin id have protected you mel said solemnly my hero besides mel went on it looked to me as though he was more in the mood to drag ana off by the hair than tackle you youre both being absurd ana snipped hawthorn without looking up hes a very nice man im sure sebastian murmured but you see men understand this territorial thing which is of course an obscure concept to the female oh please mel shoved an elbow in his ribs facts are facts my dear mary ellen i had intruded on his territory or so he thought naturally i would only think less of him if he had made no effort to defend it naturally mel said dryly tell me ana just how involved are you thats none of your business she straightened deftly wrapping the stems of the hawthorn and ill thank you to keep out of it cousin i know very well you were poking in which is why you blocked me your neighbor wasnt so successful its rude she muttered unconscionably rude the way you peek into peoples heads at the drop of a hat he likes to show off mel said sympathetically unfair disgusted sebastian shook his head i do not poke or peek at the drop of a hat i always have an excellent reason in this case being your only male relative on the continent i feel its my duty to survey the situation and the players mel could only roll her eyes as anas spine stiffened really eyes bright ana jammed a finger into sebastians chest then let me set you straight just because im a woman doesnt mean i need protection or guidance or anything else from a male relative or otherwise ive been handling my own life for twentysix years twentyseven next month sebastian added helpfully and i can continue to handle it whats between boone and me ah he held up a triumphant finger so there is something between you stuff it sebastian she only talks like that when she paints herself into a corner sebastian told mel usually shes extremely mild and wellmannered careful or ill give mel a potion to put in your soup thatll freeze your vocal cords for a week oh yeah intrigued by the idea mel tilted her head can i have it anyway a lot of good it would do you since i do all the cooking sebastian pointed out then he scooped ana up in a hug come on darling dont be angry i have to worry about you its my job theres nothing to worry about but she was softening are you in love with him instantly she stiffened really sebastian ive only known him for a week what difference does that make he gave mel a long look over anas head it took me less than that to realize the reason mel irritated me so much was that i was crazy about her of course it took her longer to understand she was madly in love with me but she has such a hard head im getting that potion mel decided ignoring the threat he drew back to consider ana at arms length i ask because he definitely has more than a neighborly interest in you as a matter of fact he thats enough whatever you dug out of his head you keep to yourself i mean it sebastian she said before he could interrupt i prefer doing things my own way if you insist he said with a sigh i do now take your hawthorn and go home and be newly weds now thats the best idea ive heard all day taking a firm grip on her husbands arm mel tugged him back leave her alone donovan anas perfectly capable of handling her own affairs and if shes going to have one she should know out on a strangled laugh ana gave him a shove out of my yard i have work to do if i need a psychic ill call you he relented and gave her a kiss see that you do a new smile began to bloom as he walked away with his wife i believe well stop by and see morgana and nash thats fine she shot a last glance over her shoulder id like to hear what they have to say about this guy myself sebastian laughed and hugged her close you are a woman after my own heart no im not she kissed him soundly ive already got it for the next several days ana busied herself indoors it wasnt that she was avoiding boone at least not to any great extent she simply had a lot to do her medicinal supplies had become sadly depleted just that day shed had a call from a client in carmel who was out of the elixir for her rheumatism ana had had just enough to ship but that meant she had to make more as soon as possible even now she had dried primrose simmering with motherwort on the stove in the little room adjoining the kitchen through a wide archway she had her distilling flasks condensers burners and bottles along with vials and silver bowls and candles set up for the day to the casual eye the room resembled a small chemistry lab but there was a marked difference between chemistry and alchemy in alchemy there was ritual and the meticulous use of astrological timing all of the flowers and roots and herbs she had harvested by moonlight had been carefully washed in morning dew others plucked under different phases of the moon had already been prepared for their specific uses there was syrup of poppy to be distilled and there was hyssop to be dried for cough syrup she needed some oil of clary for a specialty perfume and she could combine that with some chamomile for a digestive aid there were infusions and decoctions to be completed as well as both oils and incense plenty to do ana thought particularly since she had the touch of magic from the flowers picked in moonlight and she enjoyed her work the scents that filled her kitchen and workroom the pretty pink leaves of the flowering marjoram the deep purple of foxglove the sunny touch of the practical marigold they were lovely and she could never resist setting some in vases or bowls around the house she was testing a dilution of gentian grimacing at the bitter taste when boone knocked on her screen door i really do need sugar this time he told her with a quick charming grin that had her heart pumping fast im homeroom mother this week and i have to make three dozen cookies for tomorrow tilting her head she studied him you could buy them what homeroom mother worth her salt serves the first grade class storebought a cup would do it the image of him baking made her smile i probably have one come on in just let me finish this up it smells fabulous in here he leaned over to peek into the pots simmering on the stove what are you doing dont she warned just as he was about to dip a finger in a black glass pan cooling on the counter thats belladonna not for internal consumption in that form belladonna his brows drew together youre making poison im making a lotion an anodyne for neuralgia rheumatism and it isnt a poison if its brewed and dispensed properly its a sedative frowning he looked into the room behind with its chemical equipment and its bubbling brews dont you have to have a license or something im a qualified herbal practitioner with a degree in pharmacognosy if that relieves you she batted his hand away from a pot and this is not something for the novice got anything for insomnia besides belladonna no offense she was instantly concerned are you having trouble sleeping are you feverish she lifted a hand to his brow then went still when he took her wrist yes to both questions you could say youre the cause and the cure he brought her hand from his brow to his lips i may be homeroom mother but im still a man ana i cant stop thinking about you he turned her hand over pressing those lips to the inside of her wrist where the pulse was beginning to jerk and i cant stop wanting you im sorry if im giving you restless nights his brow quirked are you she couldnt quite suppress the smile im trying to be its hard not to be flattered that thinking about me is keeping you awake and its hard to know what to do she turned away to switch off the heat on the stove ive been feeling a little restless myself her eyes closed when his hands came down on her shoulders make love with me he brushed a kiss on the back of her neck i wont hurt you ana not purposely she thought never that there was so much kindness in him but would they hurt each other if she gave in to what she wanted needed from him and held back that part of herself that made her what she was its a big step for me boone for me too gently he turned her to face him theres been no one for me since alice died in the past couple of years there was a woman or two but nothing that meant any more than filling a physical emptiness no one ive wanted to spend time with to be with to talk to i care about you he lowered his mouth to hers very carefully very softly i dont know how i came to care this much this quickly but i do i hope you believe that even without a true link she couldnt help but feel it it made things more complicated somehow i do believe you ive been thinking seeing as i havent been sleeping ive had plenty of time for it absently he tapped a loosened pin back into her hair the other night i was rushing you probably scared you no then she shrugged and turned back to filter one of her mixtures into a bottle already labeled yes actually i guess you did if id known you were if id realized youd never with a sigh she capped the bottle my virginity is by choice boone and nothing im uncomfortable with i didnt mean he let out a hissing breath im doing a great job with this she chose another funnel another bottle and poured youre nervous with some chagrin he noted that her hands were rocksteady when she capped the next bottle i think terrified comes closer i was rough with you and i shouldnt have been for a lot of reasons the fact that youre inexperienced is only one of them you werent rough she continued to work to hide her nerves which were jumping every bit as much as his as long as she had to concentrate on what she was doing she could at least pretend to be calm and confident youre a passionate man thats not something to apologize for im apologizing for pressuring you and for coming over here today fully intending to keep things light and easy and then pressuring you again her lips curved as she walked to the sink to soak her pans is that what youre doing i told myself i wasnt going to ask you to go to bed with me even though i want you to i was going to ask if youd spend some time with me come to dinner or go out or whatever people do when theyre trying to get to know each other id like to come to dinner or go out or whatever good that hadnt been so hard he decided maybe this weekend friday night i should be able to find a sitter his eyes clouded somebody i can trust i thought you were going to cook for me and jessie a weight lifted you wouldnt mind i think id enjoy it okay then he framed her face in his hands okay the kiss was very sweet and if it felt as if something inside were going to rip in two he told himself he could deal with it friday it wasnt difficult to smile even if her system felt as if it had been rocked by a small earthquake ill bring the wine good he wanted to kiss her again but he was afraid hed scare her off ill see you then boone she stopped him before hed reached the door dont you want your sugar he grinned i lied her eyes narrowed youre not homeroom mother and youre not baking cookies no that was true but i have five pounds in the pantry hey it worked he was whistling as he walked out the door chapter contents prev next why isnt ana here yet when is she coming soon boone answered for the tenth time too soon he was afraid he was behind in everything the kitchen was a disaster hed used too many pans then again he always did he could never figure out how anyone cooked without using every pot pan and bowl available the chicken cacciatore smelled pretty good but he was uncertain of the results stupid he supposed absolutely stupid to try out a new recipe at such a time but hed figured ana was worth more than their usual fridaynight meatloaf jessie was driving him crazy which was a rarity she was overexcited at the thought of having ana over and shed been pestering him without pause ever since hed brought her home from school the dog had chosen that afternoon to chew up boones bed pillows so hed spent a great deal of valuable time chasing dog and feathers the washing machine had overflowed flooding the laundry room he was much too male to consider calling a repairman so hed torn the machine apart and put it back together again he was pretty sure hed fixed it his agent had called to tell him that a third wish for miranda had been optioned for an animated feature by one of the major studios that would have been good news at any other time but now he was expected to fit a trip to la into his schedule jessie had decided she wanted to be a brownie and had generously volunteered him as a brownie leader the thought of having a group of sixand sevenyearold girls looking to him to teach them how to make jewelry boxes out of egg cartons chilled his blood with a lot of ingenuity and plenty of cowardice he thought he might be able to ease his way out of it are you sure shes coming daddy are you sure jessica the warning note in his voice was enough to make her lower lip poke out do you know what happens to little girls who keep asking the same question nuhuh keep it up and youll find out go make sure daisys not eating the furniture are you awfully mad at daisy yes now go on or youre next he softened the order with a gentle pat on her bottom beat it brat or ill put you in the pot and have you for dinner two minutes later he heard the mayhem that meant jessie had located daisy and girl and dog were now wrestling the highpitched yelps and happy squeals played hell with the headache pulsing behind his eyes just need an aspirin he thought an hour or two of quiet and a vacation on maui he was on the point of giving a roar that would probably pop his head off his shoulders when ana knocked hi smells good he hoped it did she looked much better than good he hadnt seen her in a dress before and the swirl of watercolor silk did wonderful things for her slim body things like showing off those soft white shoulders under thin straps with it she wore an amulet on a long chain that had the square of engraved gold hanging just below her breasts crystals glinted in it drawing the eye and were echoed by the tearshaped drops at her ears she smiled you did say friday yeah friday then are you going to ask me in sorry lord he felt like a bumbling teenager no he decided as he slid the screen open for her no teenager had ever been this bumbling im a little distracted anas brows lifted as she surveyed the chaos of pots and bowls so i see would you like some help i think ive got it under control he took the bottle she offered noting that the pale green bottle was etched with symbols and that it carried no label homemade yes my father makes it he has her eyes lit with secrets and humor a magic touch brewed in the dungeons of castle donovan as a matter of fact yes she left it at that and wandered to the stove as he took out some glasses no bugs bunny this time im afraid bugs met a fatal accident in the dishwasher he poured the clear golden wine into the crystal glasses it wasnt pretty she laughed and lifted her glass in a toast to neighbors to neighbors he agreed clinking crystal against crystal if they all looked like you id be a dead man he sipped then lifted a brow next time well have to drink to your father this is incredible one of his many hobbies you might say whats in it apples honeysuckle starlight you can give him your compliments if you like he and the rest of my family should be here for all hallows eve halloween i know what it is jessies torn between being a fairy princess or a rock star your parents travel all the way to the states for halloween usually its a kind of family tradition unable to resist she took the lid off the pan and sniffed well well im impressed that was the idea equally unable to resist he lifted a handful of her hair you know that story i told you the day daisy knocked you down i find myself compelled to write it so much so that ive put what i was working on aside it was a lovely story normally i could have made it wait but i need to know why the woman was bound inside the castle all those years was it a spell one of her own making what was the enchantment that made the man climb the wall to find her thats for you to decide no thats for me to find out boone she lifted a hand to his then looked down quickly what have you done to yourself just rapped my knuckles he flexed his fingers and shrugged fixing the washing machine you should have come over and let me tend to this she ran her fingers over the scraped skin wishing she was in a position to heal it its painful he started to deny it then realized his mistake i always kiss jessies hurts to make them better a kiss works wonders she agreed and obliged him by touching her lips to the wound briefly very briefly she risked a link to be certain there was no real pain and no chance of infection she found that while the knuckles were merely sore he did have real pain from a tension headache working behind his eyes that at least she could help him with with a smile she brushed the hair from his brow youve been working too hard getting the house in order writing your story worrying if you made the right decision to move jessie i didnt realize i was that transparent it isnt so difficult to see she laid her fingers on either side of his temples massaging in small circles now youve gone to all this trouble to cook me dinner i wanted i know she held steady as she felt the pain flash behind her own eyes to distract him she touched her lips to his as she absorbed the ache and let it slowly fade thank you youre very welcome he murmured and deepened the kiss her hands slid away from his temples lay weakly on his shoulders it was much more difficult to absorb this ache this ache that spread so insidiously through her pulsing throbbing tempting much too tempting boone wary she slipped out of his arms were rushing this i told you i wouldnt thats not going to stop me from kissing you whenever i get the chance he picked up his wine then hers offering her glass to her again nothing goes beyond that until you say so i dont know whether to thank you for that or not i know i should no theres no more need to thank me for that than there is to thank me for wanting you its just the way it is sometimes i think about jessie growing up it gives me some bad moments and i know that if there was any man who pushed or pressured her into doing what she wasnt ready to do id just have to kill him he sipped and grinned and of course if she thinks shes going to be ready to do anything of the kind before shes say forty ill just lock her in her room until the feeling passes it made her laugh and she realized as he stood there with his back to the cluttered splattered stove a dishcloth hanging from the waist of his slacks that she was very very close to falling in love with him once she had she would be ready and nothing would make the feeling pass spoken like a true paranoid father paranoia and fatherhood are synonymous take my word for it wait until nash has those twins hell start thinking about health insurance and dental hygiene a sneeze in the middle of the night will send him into a panic morgana will keep nun level a paranoid father only needs a sensible mother to her words trailed off as she cursed herself im sorry its all right its easier when people dont feel they have to tiptoe around it alice has been gone for four years wounds heal especially if you have good memories there was a thud from the next room and the sound of racing feet and a sixyearold who keeps you on your toes at that moment jessie ran in and threw herself at ana you came i thought youd never get here of course i came i never turn down a dinner invitation from my favorite neighbors as boone watched them he realized his headache had vanished odd he thought as he switched off the stove and prepared to serve dinner hed never gotten around to taking an aspirin it wasnt what he would call a quiet romantic dinner he had lit candles and clipped flowers in the garden hed inherited when hed bought the house they had the meal in the dining alcove with its wide curved window with music from the sea and birdsong a perfect setting for romance but there were no murmured secrets or whispered promises instead there was laughter and a childs bubbling voice the talk was not about what the candlelight did to her skin or how it deepened the pure gray of her eyes it centered on first grade on what daisy had done that day and on the fairy tale still brewing in boones mind when dinner was over and ana had listened to jessies exploits at school along with those of jessies new and very best friend lydia she announced that she and the child were assuming kitchen duty no ill take care of it later he was very comfortable in the sunsetwashed dining alcove and he remembered too vividly the mess hed left behind in the kitchen dirty dishes dont go anywhere you cooked ana was already rising to stack the dishes when my father cooks my mother washes up and vice versa donovan rules besides the kitchens a good place for girl talk isnt it jessie jessie didnt have any idea but she was instantly intrigued by the notion i can help i hardly ever break any dishes and men arent allowed in the kitchen during girl talk she leaned conspiratorially toward jessie because they just get in the way she sent boone an arch look i think you and daisy could use a walk on the beach i dont a walk on the beach alone with no kp really really take your time jessie when i was in town the other day i saw the cutest dress it was blue just the color of your eyes and had a big satin bow ana stopped a pile of dishes in her hands and stared at boone still here just leaving as he walked out in the deepening twilight with daisy romping around him he could hear the light music of female laughter coming through his windows daddy said you were born in a castle jessie said as she helped ana load the dishwasher thats right in ireland a forreal castle a real castle near the sea it has towers and turrets secret passageways and a drawbridge just like in daddys books very much like its a magic palace ana listened to the sound of water as she rinsed dishes and thought of the squabbles and laughing voices in that huge kitchen with a fire going in the hearth and the good yeasty smell of fresh bread perfuming the air my father and his brothers were born there and his father and his and further back than i can say if i were born in a castle i would always live there jessie stood close to ana while they worked enjoying without knowing why the scent of woman and the lighter timbre of a female voice why did you move away oh its still home but sometimes you have to move away to make your own place your own magic like daddy and me did yes she closed the dishwasher and began to fill the sink with hot soapy water for the pots and pans you like living here in monterey i like it a lot nana said i might get homesick when the novelty wears off whats novelty the newness not a very wise thing to suggest to an impressionable child ana mused but she imagined nanas nose was out of joint if you do get homesick you should try to remember that the very best place to be is usually where you are i like where daddy is even if he took me to timbuktu excuse me grandma sawyer said he might as well have moved us to timbuktu jessie accepted the clean pot ana handed her and began to dry an expression of deep concentration on her face is that a real place umhmm but its also a kind of expression that means far away your grandparents are missing you sunshine thats all i miss them too but i get to talk to them on the phone and daddy helped me type a letter on his computer do you think you could marry daddy so grandma sawyer would get off his back the pan ana had been washing plopped into the suds and sent a small tidal wave over the lip of the sink i dont think so i heard him telling grandma sawyer that she was on his back all the time to find a wife so he wouldnt be lonely and i wouldnt have to grow up without a mother his voice had that mad sound in it he gets when i do something really wrong or like when daisy chewed up his pillow and he said hed be damned if hed tie himself down just to keep the peace i see ana pressed her lips hard together to keep the proper seriousness on her face i dont think hed like you to repeat it jessie especially in those words do you think daddys lonely no no i dont i think hes very happy with you and with daisy if he decided to get married one day it would be because he found somebody all of you loved very much i love you oh sunshine soapy hands and all ana scooted down to give jessie a hug and a kiss i love you too do you love daddy i wish i knew its different she said she knew she was navigating on boggy ground when you grow up love means different things but im very happy that you moved here and we can all be friends daddy never had a lady over to dinner before well youve only been here a couple of weeks i mean ever at all not in indiana either so i thought maybe it meant that you were going to get married and live with us here so grandma sawyer would get off his back and i wouldnt be a poor motherless child no ana did her best to disguise a chuckle it meant that we like each other and wanted to have dinner she checked the window to make certain boone wasnt on his way back does he always cook like this he always makes a really big mess and sometimes he says those words you know i know he says them when he has to clean it up and today he was in a really bad mood cause daisy ate his pillow and there were feathers all over and the washing machine exploded and he maybe has to go on a business trip thats a lot for one day she bit her lip really she didnt want to pump the child but she was curious hes going to take a trip maybe to the place where they make movies cause they want to make one out of his book thats wonderful he has to think about it thats what he says when he doesnt want to say yes but probably hes going to this time ana didnt bother to smother the chuckle you certainly have his number by the time theyd finished the kitchen jessie was yawning will you come up and see my room i put everything away like daddy said to when we have company id love to see your room the packing boxes were gone ana noted as they moved from the kitchen into the highceilinged living room with its open balcony and curving stairs the furniture there looked comfortably livedin bold bright colors in fabrics that appeared tough enough to stand up under the hands and feet of an active child it could have used some flowers at the window she mused some scented candles in brass holders on the mantel perhaps a few big plump pillows scattered here and there still there were homey family touches in the framed photographs the ticking grandfather clock and clever whimsical ones like the brass dragonshead andirons standing guard on the stone hearth and the unicorn rocking horse in the corner and if there was a little dust on the banister that only added to the charm i got to pick out my own bed jessie was telling her and once everything settles down i can pick out wallpaper if i want to thats where daddy sleeps she pointed to the right and ana had a glimpse of a big bed under a jadecolored quilt sans pillows a handsome old chest of drawers with a missing pull and a few stray feathers he has his own bathroom in there too with a big tub that has jets and a shower thats all glass and has water coming out of both sides i get to use the one out here and it has two sinks and this little thing that isnt a toilet but looks like one a bidet i guess so daddy says its fancy and mostly for ladies this is my room it was a little girls fantasy one provided by a man who obviously understood that childhood was all too short and very precious all pink and white the canopy bed sat in the center a focal point surrounded by shelves of dolls and books and bright toys a snowy dresser with a curvy mirror and a childsized desk littered with colored paper and crayons on the walls were lovely framed illustrations from fairy tales cinderella rushing down the steps of a silvery castle a single glass slipper left behind rapunzel her golden hair spilling out of a high tower window while she looked longingly down at her prince the sly endearing elf from one of boones books and a complete surprise to ana one of her aunts prized illustrations this is from the golden ball the lady who wrote it sent it to daddy for me when i was just little next to daddys i like her stories best i had no idea ana murmured as far as shed known her aunt had never parted with one of her drawings except to family daddy did the elf jessie pointed out all the rest my mother did theyre beautiful not just skillful ana thought and perhaps not as clever as boones elf or as elegant as her aunts drawing but lovely and as true to the spirit of a fairy tale as magic itself she drew them just for me when i was a baby nana said daddy should put them away so they wouldnt make me sad but they dont i like to look at them youre very lucky to have something so beautiful to remember her by jessie rubbed her sleepy eyes and struggled to hold back a yawn i have dolls too but i dont play with them much my grandmothers like to give them to me but i like the stuffed walrus my daddy got me better do you like my room its lovely jessie i can see the water and your yard from the windows she tucked back the billowing sheer curtains to show off her view and thats daisys bed but she likes to sleep with me jessie pointed out the wicker dog bed with its pink cushion maybe youd like to lie down until daisy comes back maybe jessie sent ana a doubtful look but im not really tired do you know any stories i could probably think of one she picked jessie up to sit her on the bed what kind would you like a magic one the very best kind she thought for a moment then smiled ireland is an old country she began slipping an arm around the girl and its filled with secret places dark hills and green fields water so blue it hurts the eyes to stare at it for long theres been magic there for so many centuries and its still a safe place for faeries and elves and witches good witches or bad ones both but theres always been more good than bad not only in witches but in everything good witches are pretty jessie said stroking a hand down anas arm thats how you know is this a story about a good witch it is indeed a very good and very beautiful witch and a very good and very handsome one too men arent witches jessie informed her giggling theyre wizards whos telling the story ana kissed the top of jessies head now one day not so many years ago a beautiful young witch traveled with her two sisters to visit their old grandfather he was a very powerful witch wizard but had grown cranky and bored in his old age not far from the manor where he lived was a castle and there lived three brothers they were triplets and very powerful wizards as well for as long as anyone could remember the old wizard and the family of the three brothers had carried on a feud no one remembered the why of it any longer but the feud ran on as they tend to do so the families spoke not a word to each other for an entire generation ana shifted jessie to her lap stroking the childs hair as she told the story she was smiling to herself unaware that shed lapsed into her native brogue but the young witch was headstrong as well as beautiful and her curiosity was great and on a fine day in high summer she slipped out of the manor house and walked through the fields and the meadows toward the castle of her grandfathers enemy along the way was a pond and she paused there to dangle her bare feet in the water and study the castle in the distance and while she sat with her feet wet and her hair down around her shoulders a frog plopped up on the bank and spoke to her fair lady he said why do you wander on my land well the young witch was not at all surprised to hear a frog speak after all she knew too much of magic and she sensed a trick your land she said frogs have only the water and the marsh i walk where i choose but your feet are in my water so you must pay a forfeit so she laughed and told him that she owed a common frog nothing at all well needless to say the frog was puzzled by her attitude after all it wasnt every day he plopped down and spoke to a beautiful woman and he had expected at least a shriek or some fearful respect he was quite fond of playing tricks and was sorely disappointed that this one wasnt working as hed hoped he explained that he was no ordinary frog and if she didnt agree to pay the forfeit he would have to punish her and what forfeit did he expect his answer was a kiss which was no more and no less than she had expected for as i said she was young but not foolish she said that she doubted very much if he would turn into a handsome prince if she did so and that she would save her kisses now the frog was very frustrated and he plied more magic whistling up the wind shaking the leaves in the trees but she merely yawned at this at the end of his tether the frog jumped right into her lap and began to berate her to teach him a lesson for his forwardness she plucked him up and tossed him into the water when he surfaced he wasnt a frog at all but a young man quite wet and furious to have had his joke turned on him after he swam to shore they stood on the bank and shouted at each other threatening spells and curses sending lightning walking the sky and shooting the air with thunder though she threatened him with the hounds of hell and worse he said he would have his forfeit regardless for it was his land his water and his right so he kissed her soundly and it took only that to turn the heat in her heart to warmth and the fury in his breast to love for even witches can fall under that most powerful of spells there and then they pledged to each other marrying within the month right there on the banks on the pond and they were happy then and after with lives full of love still every year on a day in high summer though she is no longer young she goes to the pond dangles her feet and waits for an indignant frog to join her ana lifted the sleeping girl she had told the end of the story only for herself or so she thought but as she drew back the cover boones hand closed over hers that was a pretty good story for an amateur must be the irish its an old family one she said thinking how often she had heard how her mother and father had met he expertly unlaced his daughters shoes be careful i might steal it from you as he tucked the covers around jessie daisy took a running leap and landed on the foot of the bed did you enjoy your walk after i stopped feeling guilty for leaving you with the dishes which took about ninety seconds he brushed jessies hair from her brow and bent to kiss her goodnight one of the most enviable things about childhood is being able to drop off to sleep like that are you still having trouble ive got a lot on my mind taking anas hand he drew her out of the room leaving the door open as he always did a lot of its you but there are a few other things honest but not flattering she paused at the top of the stairs seriously boone i could give you something she flushed and chuckled when she saw the light come into his eyes a very mild very safe herbal remedy id rather have sex shaking her head she continued downstairs you dont take me seriously on the contrary i mean as an herbalist i dont know anything about that sort of thing but i dont discount it he wasnt about to let her dose him either whyd you get into it its always been an interest there have been healers in my family for generations doctors not exactly boone picked up the wine and two glasses as they walked through the kitchen and out onto the deck you didnt want to be a doctor i didnt feel qualified to go into medicine now thats a very odd thing for a modern independent woman to say one has nothing to do with the other she accepted the glass he offered its not possible to heal everyone and i have difficulty being around suffering what i do is my way of satisfying my needs and protecting myself it was the most she felt she could give him and i like working alone i know the feeling both my parents thought i was crazy the writing was okay but they figured id write the great american novel at the very least fairy tales were hard for them to swallow at first they must be proud of you in their way theyre nice people he said slowly realizing hed never discussed them with anyone but alice theyve always loved me god knows they dote on jessie but they have a hard time understanding that i might not want what they want a house in the suburbs a decent golf game and a spouse whos devoted to me none of those things are bad no and i had it once except for the golf game id rather not spend the rest of my life convincing them that im content with the way things are now he twined a lock of her hair around his fingers dont you get the same sort of business from yours anastasia when are you going to settle down with some nice young man and raise a family no she laughed into her wine absolutely not the very idea of her mother or father saying even thinking such a thing made her laugh again i suppose you could say my parents are eccentric comfortable she laid her head back and looked at the stars i think theyd both be appalled if i settled for nice you didnt tell me you had one of aunt brynas illustrations when you made the family connection you were ready to chew me up and spit me out it didnt seem appropriate then i guess it slipped my mind obviously she thinks highly of you she only gave one to nash after the wedding and hed been coveting one for years that so ill be sure to rub his nose in it the next time i see him tipping up her chin with a finger he turned her face toward his its been a long time since i sat on a porch and necked im wondering if i still have the hang of it he brushed his lips over hers once twice a third time until hers trembled open in invitation he took the glass from her fingers set it aside with his as his mouth moved to accept what was offered sweet so sweet the taste of her warming him soothing him exciting him soft so soft the feel of her tempting him luring him charming him and quiet so quiet that quick catching sigh that sent a streak of lightning zipping up his spine but he was no sweaty fumbling boy groping in the dark the volcano of needs simmering inside him could be controlled if he couldnt give her the fullness of his passion then he could give her the benefit of his experience while he filled himself with her slowly degree by painful degree he gave back a care and a tenderness that had her teetering helplessly on that final brink before love to be held like this she thought dimly with such compassion mixed with the hunger in all of her imaginings she had never reached for this his tongue danced over hers bringing her all those dark and dusky male flavors his hands stroked persuasively while the muscles in his arms went taut when his mouth left hers to cruise down her jaw and over her throat she arched back willing desperately willing for him to show her more it was surrender he felt from her as clearly as he felt the night breeze against his skin knowing it would drive him nearer to the brink he gave in to the fevered need to touch she was small gloriously soft her heart beat frantically under his hand he could almost taste it taste that hot satin skin on his lips on his tongue deep within his mouth it was torture not to sample it now not to drag her dress down to her waist and feast the feel of her hardened nipples pressed against the silk had him groaning as he brought his mouth back to hers her mouth was as avid as desperate her hands moved over him as urgently as his over her she knew as she gave herself fully to this one moment that there would be no turning back they would not love now it couldnt be now on the starlit deck beneath windows where a child might wake and look for her father in the night but there was no turning back from being in love not for her she could not change that tidal wave of feeling any more than she could change the blood that coursed through her veins and because of it there would come a time very soon when she would give to him what she had given to no other overwhelmed she turned her head burying her face in his shoulder you have no idea what you do to me then tell me he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth making her shudder i want to hear you tell me you make me ache and yearn and hope she thought squeezing her eyes shut no one else has with a long shuddering sigh she drew away thats what were both afraid of i cant deny that his eyes were like cobalt in the dim light and i cant deny that the idea of carrying you upstairs now taking you into my bed is something i want as much as i want to go on breathing the image had her heart thundering do you believe in the inevitable boone ive had to she nodded so do i i believe in destiny the whims of fate the tricks of what men used to call the gods when i look at you i see the inevitable she rose pressed a hand to his shoulder to prevent him from standing with her can you accept that i have secrets i cant tell you parts of myself i wont share she saw both puzzlement and denial in his eyes and shook her head before he could speak dont answer now you need to think it through and be sure just as i do she leaned down to kiss him and linked quickly firmly she felt his jerk of surprise before she backed away sleep well tonight she said knowing that he would now and that she would not chapter contents prev next the one gift ana always gave herself on her birthday was a completely free day she could be as lazy as she chose or as industrious she could get up at dawn and gorge on ice cream for breakfast or she could laze in bed until noon watching old movies on television the single best plan for the one day of the year that belonged only to her was no plan at all she did rise early indulging herself in a long bath scented with her favorite oils and a muslin bag filled with dried herbs chosen for their relaxing properties to pamper herself she mixed up a toning face pack of elder flowers yogurt and kaolin powder lounging in the tub with harp music and iced juice while it worked its magic with her face tingling and her hair silky from its chamomile shampoo she slicked on her personalized body oil and slipped into a silk robe the color of moonbeams as she walked back into the bedroom she considered crawling back into bed and dozing to complete the mornings indulgence but in the center of the room where there had been nothing but an antique prayer rug when shed gone in to bathe stood a large wooden chest on a quick cry of pleasure she dashed over to run her hands over the old carved wood which had been polished to a mirror gleam it smelled of beeswax and rosemary and felt like silk under her ringers it was old ages old for it was something she had admired even as a child living in donovan castle a wizards chest it was reputed to have resided once in camelot commissioned for merlin by the young arthur with a laughing sigh she sat back on her heels they always managed to surprise her ana thought her parents her aunts and uncles so far away but never out of her heart the combined power of six witches had sent the chest from ireland winking through the air through time through space by means that were less and more than conventional slowly she lifted the lid and the scent of old visions ancient spells endless charms rose out to her the fragrance was dry aromatic as crusted petals ground to dust tangy with the smoke of the cold fire a sorcerer calls in the night she knelt lifting her arms out the silk sliding down to her elbows as she cupped her hands palms facing here was power to be respected accepted the words she spoke were in the old tongue the language of the wise ones the wind she called whipped the curtains sent her hair flying around her face the air sang a thousand harp strings crying in the breeze then was silent lowering her arms ana reached into the chest a bloodstone amulet the inner red of the stone bleeding through the deep green had her sitting back on her heels once more she knew it had belonged to her mothers family for generations a healing stone of enormous worth and mighty power tears stung the backs of her eyes when she realized that it was being passed to her as it was only every half century to denote her as a healer of the highest order her gift she thought running her fingers over a stone smoothed by other fingers in other times her legacy she gently set it back in the chest and reached for the next gift she lifted out a globe of chalcedony its almost transparent surface offering her a glimpse of the universe if she should choose to look this from sebastians parents she knew for she felt them as she cupped the globe in her hands next was a sheepskin inscribed with the writing of the old tongue a faery story she noted as she read and smiled as old as time as sweet as tomorrow aunt bryna and uncle matthew she thought as she laid it back inside though the amulet had been from her mother ana knew there would always be something special from her father as well she found it and she laughed as she took it out a frog as small as her thumbnail intricately carved in jade looks just like you da she said and laughed again replacing it she closed the chest then rose it would be afternoon in ireland she mused and there were six people who would be expecting a call to see if shed enjoyed her gifts as she started toward the phone she heard the knock at her back door her heart gave one quick unsteady leap then settled calmly ireland would have to wait boone held the gift behind his back there was another package at home one that he and jessie had chosen together but hed wanted to give ana this one himself alone he heard her coming and grinned the greeting on the tip of his tongue he was lucky he didnt swallow his tongue as well as the words when he saw her she was glowing her hair a rain of pale gold down the bad of a robe of silver her eyes seemed darker deeper how could they be as clear as lake water he wondered yet seem to hold a thousand secrets the gloriously female scent that swirled around her nearly brought him to his knees when quigley rushed against his legs in greeting boone jolted as if hed been shot boone with a quiet laugh bubbling in her throat ana put her hand on the screen are you all right yeah yeah i did i get you up no as calm as he was rattled she opened the door in invitation ive been up quite a while im just being lazy when he continued to stand on the porch she tilted her head dont you want to come in sure he stepped inside but kept a careful distance hed been as restrained as could be over the past couple of weeks resisting the temptation to be alone with her too often keeping the mood light when they were alone he realized now that his control had been as much for his sake as for hers she was painful to resist even when they were standing outside in the sunlight discussing jessie or gardening his work or hers but this standing with her the house empty and silent around them the mysterious perfume of a womans art tormenting his senses was almost too much to bear is something wrong she asked but she was smiling as if she knew no nothing ah how are you im fine her smile widened softened and you great he thought that if he were any more tense hed turn to stone fine i was going to make some tea im sorry i dont have any coffee but perhaps youd like to join me tea he let out a quiet breath terrific he watched her walk to the stove the cat winding around her legs like gray rope she put the kettle on then poured quigleys breakfast into his bowl crouching down she stroked the cat as he ate the robe slipped back like water exposing one creamy leg hows the woodruff coming and the hyssop ah she tossed her hair back as she looked up and smiled the herbs i gave you to transplant into your yard oh those they look great i have some basil and some thyme potted in the greenhouse you might want to take them along leave them on a windowsill for a while for cooking she rose when the kettle began to sputter i think youll find them better than storebought thatd be great he was almost relaxed again he thought hoped it was soothing to watch her brew tea heating the little china pot spooning aromatic leaves out of a pale blue jar he hadnt known a woman could be restful and seductive all at once jessies been watching those marigold seeds you gave her to plant like a hen watches an egg just dont let her overwater setting the tea to steep she turned well he blinked well boone are you going to show me whats behind your back or not cant fool you can i he held out a box wrapped in bright blue paper happy birthday how did you know it was my birthday nash told me arent you going to open it i certainly am she tore the paper revealing a box with the logo of morganas shop imprinted on the lid excellent choice she said you couldnt possibly go wrong buying me something from wicca she lifted the lid and with a quiet sigh drew out a delicate statue of a sorceress carved in amber her head was thrown back and exquisite tendrils of the dark gold hair tumbled down her cloak slender arms were raised bent at the elbows palms cupped and facing mirroring the ageold position ana had assumed over the chest that morning in one elegant hand she held a small gleaming pearl in the other a slender silver wand shes beautiful ana murmured absolutely beautiful i stopped by the shop last week and morgana had just gotten it in it reminded me of you thank you still holding the statue she lifted her free hand to his cheek you couldnt have found anything more perfect she leaned in rising on her toes to touch her lips to his she knew exactly what she was doing just as she knew even as he returned the kiss that he was holding himself on a choke chain of control power as fresh and cool as rainwater washed into her this was what she had been waiting for this was why she had spent the morning in that ancient female ritual of oils and creams and perfumes for him for her for their first time together there were knots of thorny vines ripping through his stomach an anvil of need ringing frantically in his head though their lips were barely touching her taste was drugging him making ideas like restraint and control vague unimportant concepts he tried to draw back but her arms wound silkily around him ana shh she soothed and excited as her mouth played softly over his just kiss me how could he not when her lips were parting so softly beneath his he brought his hands to her face framing it with tensed fingers while he fought a vicious internal war to keep the embrace from going too far when the phone rang he let out a groan that was both frustration and relief id better go no she wanted to laugh but only smiled as she drew out of his arms never had she sampled a power more delicious than this please stay why dont you pour the tea while i answer that pour tea he thought hed be lucky if he could lift the pot system jumbled he turned blindly to the stove as she took the receiver from the wall phone mama now she did laugh and boone heard the pure joy of it thank you thank all of you yes i got it this morning a wonderful surprise she laughed again listening of course yes im fine im wonderful i da she chuckled when her father broke in on the line yes i know what the frog means i love it i love you too no i much prefer it to a real one thank you she smiled at boone when he offered her a cup of tea aunt bryna it was a lovely story yes i am morganas very well so are the twins not very much longer now yes youll be here in time restless boone wandered the room sipping the tea which was surprisingly good he wondered what the devil shed put into it what the devil shed put into him just listening to her voice was making him ache he could handle it he reminded himself theyd have a very civilized cup of tea while he kept his hands off her then hed escape bury himself in his work for the rest of the day to keep his mind off her as well his story line was all but finished and he was nearly ready to start on the illustrations he already knew just what he wanted ana with a brisk shake of his head he gulped more tea it sounded as if she were going to carry on a conversation with every relative she had that was fine that was dandy it would give him time to calm himself down yes i miss you too all of you ill see you in a couple of weeks blessed be she was a little tearyeyed when she hung up but she smiled at boone my family she explained i gathered they sent me a chest of gifts this morning and i hadnt gotten a chance to call and thank them thats nice look i really this morning he said with a slight frown i didnt see any delivery truck it came early she looked away to set her cup down special delivery you could say theyre all looking forward to visiting at the end of the month youll be glad to see them always they were here briefly over the summer but with all the excitement about sebastian and mel getting engaged and married so quickly there wasnt much time to just be together she moved to the door to let quigley out would you like more tea no thanks really i should go get to work he was edging toward the door himself happy birthday ana boone she laid a hand on his arm felt his muscles quiver every year on my birthday i give myself a gift its very simple really one day to do whatever i choose whatever feels right to me hardly seeming to move at all she pulled the door closed and stood between it and him i choose you if you still want me her words seemed to ring in his ears as he stared down at her she appeared so calm so utterly serene she might have been discussing the weather you know i want you yes she smiled at that moment she was calm the eye of the hurricane yes i do when she took a step forward he took one in retreat was this seduction she wondered keeping her eyes on his i see that when i look at you feel it whenever you touch me youve been very patient very kind you kept your word that nothing would happen between us until i decided it should im trying unsteady he took another step back it isnt easy nor for me she stood where she was the silver robe shimmering around her in the sunlight youve only to accept me to accept that im willing to give you everything i can take that and let it be enough what are you asking me to be my first she said simply to show me what love can be he dared to reach out and touch her hair are you sure im very sure offering and asking she held out both hands will you take me to bed and be my lover how could he answer there were no words to translate what was churning inside him at that moment so he wasted no words only lifted her into his arms he carried her as if she were as delicate as the amber enchantress hed given her indeed he thought of her that way and he felt a thud of panic at the thought that he wouldnt be careful enough restrained enough it was so easy to damage delicacy when he reached the base of the stairs and started to climb his pulse was throbbing in anticipation and fear for her sake he wished it could have been night a candlelit night filled with soft music and silvery moonglow yet somehow it seemed right that he love her this first time in the morning when the sun was growing stronger in a deep blue sky and music came from the birds that flitted through her garden and the tinkling bells of the wind chimes she had at her windows where he asked her and she gestured toward her bedroom door it smelled of her a mix of female fragrances and perfumed powders and something else something he couldnt quite identify like smoke and flowers the sun streamed gaily through billowing curtains and splashed the huge old bed with the towering carved headboard he skirted the trunk charmed by the rainbow of colors refracted by colored crystals suspended from thin wire in front of each window rainbows instead of moonbeams he thought as he laid her on the bed foolish to be nervous now she told herself but her hands trembled lightly when she reached out to hold him against her she wanted this wanted him still the calm certainty she had felt only moments ago had vanished under a wave of nerves and needs he could see the need the nervousness in her eyes could she possible understand that they were a mirror of his she was so fragile and lovely fresh and untouched his for the taking and he knew it was vital for them both that he take with tenderness anastasia smothering his own fears he lifted her hand pressed his lips to the palm i wont hurt you i swear it i know that she linked her fingers with his wishing she could be sure if it was fear of the moment a woman experiences only once in her life or fear of the overwhelming depth of her love for him that left her shaky and unsure show me with rainbows dancing around them he lowered his mouth to hers a deep drugging kiss that both soothed and enticed time spun out drifted stopped still there was only his mouth against hers he touched her hair his fingers combing through tangling in the luxurious length of it to please himself he spread it over the pillow where it lay like a pool of gold dust against soft irish linen when his lips left hers it was to take a slow lazy journey of her face until he felt her nervous trembling fall away into pliancy even as she surrendered her fears to the light sweet sensations he brought her he kept the pace slow so slow that it seemed they had forever just to kiss she heard him murmur to her reassurances lovely lovely promises the low hum of his voice had her mind floating her lips curving in a quiet smile as they met his again she should have known it would be like this with him beautiful achingly beautiful he made her feel loved cherished safe when he slipped the robe from her shoulders she wasnt afraid but welcomed the feel of his mouth on her flesh eager now she tugged on his shirt and he hesitated only a moment before helping her remove it a groan ripped out of him as his body shuddered god the feel of her hands on his bare back he fought back a wave of greed and kept his own hands easy as he parted her robe her skin was like cream unbearably soft and fragrant with oils it drew him like nectar inviting him to taste as he closed his mouth over her breast the quiet strangled sound she made deep in her throat echoed like thunder in his head gently he used tongue and lips to take her to that next degree of pleasure while his own passions licked at him taunting him demanding that he hurry hurry hurry her eyes were so heavy impossible to open how could he know just where to touch just where to taste to make her heart shudder in her breast yet he did and her breath sighed out between her lips as he showed her more quiet whispers a gentle caress the scent of lavender and fairy roses thickening the air smooth sheets growing warm skin dampening with passion a rainbow of lights playing against her closed lids she floated there lifted by the magic they made together her breath quickening a little as he eased her higher just higher then there was heat searing torrid it erupted inside her so quickly so violently that she cried out and struggled against him no no boone i then a flash a lightning spear of pleasure that left her limp and dazed and trembling ana he had to dig his fisted hands into the mattress to keep from plunging into her driving them both where he knew the rewards were dark and desperately keen sweet he kissed her swallowing her gasping breaths so sweet dont be afraid no rocked to the core she held him close his heart was thundering against hers his body taut as wire no show me show me more so he slipped the robe away driving himself mad with the sight of her naked in a pool of sunlight her eyes were open now dark and steady on his beneath the passion just awakened he saw a trust that humbled him he showed her more fears melted away there was no room for them when her body was vibrating from dozens of more vivid sensations when he took her to the peak again she rode out the storm glorying in the flash of heat desperate for the next he held back gaining his pleasure from hers stunned by the way she responded to each touch to each kiss her innocence was his he knew with the breath laboring in his lungs the blood pounding in his head he entered her braced for her to stiffen and cry out knowing he would have to stop no matter how his body craved completion if she asked it of him but she didnt stiffen only gasped out his name as her arms came around him the brief flash of pain was instantly smothered by a pleasure greater fuller than she had ever dreamed possible his she thought she was his and she moved against him with an instinct as old as time deeper he slipped deeper filling her rocking her toward that final crest when she did cry out her body shuddering shuddering from the glory of it he buried his face in her hair and let himself follow he watched the dance of light against the wall listening to her heart calm and slow she lay beneath him still her arms around him her hands stroking his hair he hadnt known it could be like this that was foolish he thought hed had women before more hed loved before as i deeply as anyone could yet this union had been more than hed ever expected or experienced he had no way to explain it to her when he was far from understanding it himself after pressing a kiss to her shoulder he lifted his head to look i at her her eyes were closed and her face was flushed and utterly relaxed he wondered if she had any idea how much had changed for both of them that morning are you all right she shook her head alarming him instantly concerned he i braced on his arms to remove his weight from her her lashes fluttered up so that he could see the smoky eyes beneath them im not all right her voice was low and throaty im wonderful youre wonderful the smile curved beautifully on her lips this is wonderful you had me worried he brushed the hair away from her cheek i dont think ive ever been quite so nervous her lips were waiting for his when he bent his head to kiss her youre not sorry her brow arched do i look sorry no taking his time he studied her face tracing it with a fingertip you look kind of smug and the fact that she did brought him a rush of deep satisfaction im feeling very smug and lazy she stretched a little so he shifted to let her head rest on his shoulder happy birthday she chuckled against his throat it was the most unique present ive ever been given the thing about it is you can use it over and over again even better she tipped her head back and now her eyes were solemn you were very good to me boone very good for me it wasnt what id call an act of altruism ive wanted this since the first time i saw you i know it frightened me and excited me too she smoothed her palm over his chest wishing for a moment they could stay like this forever cocooned together in the sunlight this changes things her hand stilled tensed only if you want it to then i want it to he sat up bringing her with him so that they were facetoface i want you to be a part of my life i want to be with you as often as possible and not just like this she felt the old niggling fear trying to surface rejection rejection now would be devastating i am part of your life i always will be now he saw something in her eyes sensed it in the tension suddenly blooming in the room with them but no buts she said quickly and threw her arms around him no ands no anything now just this she kissed him pouring everything she could into it knowing she was cheating them both by holding back not knowing how to offer it and keep him with her im here when you want me as long as you want me i promise you rushing her again he berated himself as she clung to him how could he expect her to be in love just because they had made love he wasnt even sure what he was feeling himself it had all happened too fast and he was riding on the emotion of the moment he reminded himself as he held ana that he didnt have only his own needs to consider there was jessie what happened with ana would affect his daughter so there could be no mistaking no acting on impulse and no real commitment until he was sure well take it slow he said but felt a twinge of resentment when ana immediately relaxed against him but if anyone else comes to your door bearing gifts or needing a cup of sugar ill boot him out she squeezed him hard theres no one but you turning her head she pressed her lips to his throat you make me happy i can make you happier she laughed tilting her head back really not like that amused and flattered he nipped her lower lip not quite yet anyway i was thinking more along the lines of going down and fixing you lunch while you lazed around in bed and waited for me and then making love with you again and again well it was tempting but she recalled too well what one of his meals did to a kitchen and she had too many jars and bottles around that he might use incorrectly why dont we do it this way you wait for me while i fix lunch its your birthday exactly she kissed him before she slid out of bed which is why i get to do everything my own way i wont be long it was a pretty stupid man who wouldnt take a deal like that boone decided as he leaned back with his arms crossed under his head he listened to her running water in the adjoining bath then settled down to imagine what it would be like to spend the afternoon in bed ana belted her robe as she walked downstairs love she thought did marvelous things for the spirit better far better than any potion she could brew or conjure perhaps in time perhaps with enough of that love she could give him the rest boone wasnt robert and she was ashamed to have compared them even for a moment but the risk was so great and the day so marvelous humming to herself she busied herself in the kitchen sandwiches would be best she decided not terribly elegant but practical for eating in bed sandwiches and some of her fathers special wine she all but floated to the refrigerator which was crowded now with jessies artwork not even dressed yet morgana said through the back screen i suspected as much with a boneless turkey breast in her hand ana turned not only was morgana at her kitchen door but crowded around her was nash sebastian and mel too oh she felt the flush blooming even as she set the lunch meat aside i didnt hear you drive up obviously too selfinvolved with your birthday and all sebastian commented they piled in bringing hugs and kisses and pushing ribboned boxes into her hands nash was already opening a bottle of champagne find some glasses mel lets get this party started he winked at his wife as she collapsed in a chair apple juice for you babe im too fat to argue she adjusted her weight or tried to so did you hear from ireland yes a chest this morning its gorgeous glasses in the next cupboard she told mel gifts inside i talked to them right before shed gone upstairs to make love with boone another flush heated her cheeks i ah i really need to mel shoved a glass into her hand with champagne brimming up to the lip have the first glass sebastian finished for her he cocked his head to the side anastasia my love you look quite radiant turning twentyseven certainly appears to agree with you keep out of my head she muttered and took a sip to give herself a moment to figure out how to explain i cant thank you all enough for coming by this way if youd just excuse me a minute no need to get dressed for us nash poured the rest of the glasses sebastians right you look fabulous yes but i really need to ana i have a better idea the sound of boones voice from just down the hall had everyone lapsing into silence why dont we shirtless barefoot and rumpled he walked into the room then stopped dead whoops mel said and grinned into her glass succinctly put her husband studied boone through narrowed eyes dropping by for a neighborly visit are we shut up sebastian this from morgana who rested both hands on her tummy and smiled we seem to have interrupted i think we would have if wed been any earlier nash murmured into mels ear and made her choke back a chuckle ana aimed one withering glance at him before she turned to boone my familys brought along a little party and theyre all quite amused at the idea that i might have a private life she looked over her shoulder meaningfully that doesnt concern them she always was cranky when you got her out of bed sebastian said resigned to accepting boone for now mel it appears well need another glass of champagne already got it covered smiling she stepped forward and offered it to boone if you cant beat em she said under her breath and he nodded well he took a long sip and sighed it was obvious that his plans for the rest of the day would have to be adjusted anybody bring cake with a delighted laugh morgana gestured toward a large bakery box get ana a knife nash so she can cut the first piece i think well dispense with candles she appears to have gotten her wish already chapter contents prev next ana was much too accustomed to her family to be annoyed with or embarrassed by them for long and she was simply too happy with boone to hold a grudge as the days passed they moved slowly cautiously toward cementing their relationship if she had come to trust him with her heart with her body she had not yet come to trust him with her secrets though his feelings for her had ripened deepened into a love he had never expected to experience again he was as wary as she of taking that final step that would join their lives at the center was a child neither would have harmed by putting their own needs first if they stole a few hours on bright afternoons or rainy mornings it was theirs to steal at night ana would lie alone and wonder how long this magic interlude would last as halloween approached she and boone were caught up in their own preparations now and again her nerves would jump out at the idea of her lover meeting the whole of her family on the holiday then she would laugh at herself for acting like a girl on the point of introducing a first date by noon on the thirtyfirst she was already at morganas helping her now greatly pregnant cousin with preparations for the halloween feast i could have made nash do this morgana pressed a hand against the ache in the small of her back before she sat down to knead bread dough from a more comfortable position at the kitchen table you could make nash do anything simply by asking ana cubed lamb for the traditional irish stew but hes having such fun setting up his special effects just like a layman to think he can outdo the professionals she winced and moaned and had anas immediate attention honey no no its not labor though i damn well wish it was im just so bloody uncomfortable all the time now hearing the petulance in her own voice she winced again and i hate whiners you whine all you like its just you and me here always prepared ana poured some liquid into a cup drink it down i already feel like im going to float away like cleopatras barge by the goddess im big enough but she drank fingering the crystal around her neck and you already have a crew of two that did the trick of making her laugh talk to me about something else she begged and went back to her kneading anything to take my mind off the fact that im fat and grumpy youre not fat and youre only a little grumpy but ana cast her mind around for a distraction did you know that sebastian and mel are working on another case together no i didnt and it served to pique her interest im surprised mels very territorial about her private investigation business well shes lowered the gate on this one a runaway only twelve years old the parents are frantic when i talked to her last night she said they had a lead and she was sorry she couldnt take this afternoon off to give you a hand when mels in the kitchen its more like giving me a foot there was affection for her new inlaw in every syllable shes wonderful with sebastian isnt she yes smiling to herself ana layered the lamb with potatoes and onions in morganas big dutch oven toughminded hardheaded softhearted shes exactly what he needs and have you found what you need saying nothing at first ana added herbs shed known morgana would work her way around to it before the day was over im very happy i like him i had a good feeling about him from the first im glad so does sebastian though he has some reservations her brows knit but she kept her voice light particularly after he cornered boone and picked through his brain anas lips thinned as she adjusted the heat on the stove i havent forgiven him for that yet well morgana shrugged and set the dough in a bowl to rise boone didnt know and it soothed sebastians feathers he wasnt exactly pleased to have walked in on your birthday and found you fresh out of bed its certainly none of his business he loves you she gave anas arm a quick squeeze as she passed the stove hell always worry about you more because youre the youngest and simply because your gift makes you so vulnerable im not without my defenses morgana or common sense i know darling i she felt her eyes fill and brushed hastily at the tears it was your first time i didnt want to probe before but lord i never used to be so sentimental you were just able to hide it better abandoning her cooking for the moment ana crossed over to take morgana into her arms it was beautiful and hes so gentle i knew there was a reason i had to wait and he was it she drew back smiling boones given me more than i ever imagined i could have with a sigh morgana lifted her hands to anas face youre in love with him yes very much in love with him and he with you her gaze faltered i dont know oh ana i wont link with him that way her eyes leveled again her voice firmed it would be dishonest when i havent told him what i am and havent the courage to tell him how i feel myself i know he cares for me i need no gift to know he cares for me and thats enough when theres more if theres more hell tell me it never fails to surprise me how damn stubborn you are im a donovan ana countered and this is important i agree you should tell him she gripped anas arms before her cousin could turn away oh i know i despise it when someone gives me advice i dont want to hear but you have to let go of the past and face the future i am facing the future id like boone to be in it i need more time her voice broke and she pressed her lips together until she felt she could steady it morgana i know him hes a good man he has compassion and imagination and a capacity for generosity he isnt even aware of he also has a child when ana turned away this time morgana was forced to brace herself on the table is that what youre afraid of taking on someone elses child oh no i love her who wouldnt even before i loved boone i loved jessie and shes the center of his world as it should be theres nothing absolutely nothing i wouldnt do for either of them then explain stalling ana rinsed the hardcooked eggs she was going to devil do you have any fresh dill you know how uncle douglas loves his deviled eggs with dill on a hiss of breath morgana slapped a jar on the counter anastasia explain emotions humming ana jerked off the tap oh you dont know how fortunate you are with nash to have someone love you that way no matter what of course i know morgana said softly what does nash have to do with this how many other men would accept one of us so completely how many would want marriage or take a witch as a mother for his child in the name of finn anastasia the impatience in her voice was spoiled a bit by the fact that she was forced to sit again you talk as if were broomstickriding crones cackling while we curdle the milk in a mothers breast she didnt smile dont most think of us just that way robert a pox on robert all right forget him ana agreed with a wave of her hand how many times through the centuries have we been hunted and persecuted feared and ostracized simply for being what we were born to be im not ashamed of my blood i dont regret my gift or my heritage but i couldnt bear it if i told him and he looked at me as if she gave a half laugh as if i had a smoking cauldron in the basement filled with toads and wolfsbane if he loves you if ana repeated well see now i think you should lie down for an hour youre just changing the subject morgana began then looked up as nash burst in there were cobwebs in his hair simulated fortunately and an unholy gleam in his eyes you guys have got to see this its incredible im so good i scare myself he snatched a celery stalk from the counter and chomped come on dont just stand there amateurs morgana sighed and hauled herself to her feet the two women were admiring nashs hologram ghosts in the foyer when ana heard a car drive up theyre here filled with delight at the prospect of seeing her family she took one bounding leap toward the door then stopped dead she was already whirling around when morgana sagged against nash instantly he went as pale as his ghosts babe are you oh boy its all right she let out a long breath as ana took her other arm just a twinge really leaning back against nash she smiled at ana i guess having twins on halloween is pretty appropriate absolutely nothing to worry about douglas donovan was reassuring nash like his son he was a tall man and his mane of raven hair was only lightly silvered hed chosen black tie and tails for the occasion and had set them off with orange neon sneakers that pleased him enormously by glowing in the dark childbirth most natural thing in the world perfect night for it too right nash swallowed the lump in his throat his house was full of people witches if you wanted to get technical and his wife was sitting on the sofa looking as if she werent the least bit concerned that shed been in labor for over three hours maybe it was a false alarm camilla wafted by in a sequined ball gown and tapped nash on the shoulder with her feather fan leave it to ana dear child shell take care of everything why when i had sebastian i was in labor for thirteen hours we joked about that didnt we douglas after youd stopped shouting curses at me dear heart well naturally she wandered toward the kitchen thinking shed check on the stew ana never used quite enough sage would have turned me into a hedgehog if she hadnt been otherwise occupied douglas confided that makes me feel better nash muttered heaps delighted to have helped douglas slapped him heartily on the back thats what were here for dash nash douglas smiled benignly yes indeed mama morgana gave her mothers hand a squeeze go rescue poor nash from uncle douglas hes looking a little queasy bryna obligingly set aside her sketchpad shall i have your father take him out for a walk wonderful she gave a sigh of gratitude as ana continued to rub her shoulders there isnt anything for him to do quite yet anas father padrick plopped down the moment bryna vacated the seat hows the girl im really fine its all very mild as yet but im sure itll get rolling before too much longer she leaned over to kiss his plump cheek im glad youre all here wouldnt be anywhere else he put a pudgy hand on her belly to soothe and gave his daughter one of his elvish grins and my own little darling youre pretty as a picture take right after your da dont you naturally ana felt the next contraction start and kept her hands steady on morganas shoulders long relaxed breaths love will you want to give her some blue cohosh he asked his daughter ana considered then shook her head not yet shes doing well enough but you could get me my pouch ill want some crystals done he rose then flipped his hand over in the palm was a sprig of bell heather in full flower now where did this come from he said in the way he had since the laboring woman had been a babe herself take care of this for me ive business to tend to morgana brushed the heather against her cheek hes the dearest man in the world hell spoil these two if you let him das a pushover for children with the empathic link she knew morgana was in more discomfort than she was letting on ill have to take you upstairs soon morgana not yet though she reached over her shoulder for anas hand its so nice being here with everyone wheres aunt maureen mamas in the kitchen probably arguing with aunt camilla over the stew by now on a little groan morgana shut her eyes lord i could eat a gallon of it after ana promised and looked up as the rattle of chains and the moans of the suffering filled the room somebody at the door poor nash he cant relax long enough to appreciate his own handiwork is it sebastian ana craned her neck uhhuh he and mel are critiquing the holograms whoops there goes the smoke machine and the bats sebastian strode in amateurs and lydia was so scared she screamed and screamed jessie said relating the chills and thrills of the elementary schools haunted house then frankie ate so much candy he threw up sounds like a redletter day to forestall exactly the same eventuality hed already hidden away half of the treats jessied collected in her goodie bag i like my costume best of all as they got out of the car in front of morganas jessie twirled so that the starry pink material floated around her rather pleased with himself boone crouched to adjust her wings of aluminum foil it had taken him the better part of two days to figure out how to tack and baste and tie the fairy costume together but it was worth it she tapped her fathers shoulder with her cardboard wand now youre the handsome prince what was i before the ugly toad she squealed with laughter as he tweaked her nose do you think anas going to be surprised will she recognize me not a chance im not sure i recognize you myself theyd opted to dispense with a mask and boone had painted her cheeks with rouge reddened her lips and smudged her eyelids to her eyebrows with glittery gold shadow were going to meet her whole family she reminded her father as if he needed reminding hed been worrying about the event all week and i get to see morganas cat and dog again right he tried not to be overly concerned about the dog pan might look like a wolf disconcertingly so but hed been gentle and friendly with jessie the last time theyd visited this is going to be the best halloween party in the whole world rising to her tiptoes she pushed the doorbell her mouth fell open in a soundless gasp when the moans and clanking chains filled the air a husky man with thinning hair and jolly eyes opened the door he took one look at jessie and spoke in his best ghouls voice welcome to the haunted castle enter at your own risk her eyes were big blue saucers is it really haunted come in if you dare he squatted down until he was at eye level with her then pulled a fluffy stuffed bunny from up his sleeve ooh charmed jessie pressed it against her cheek are you a magician certainly isnt everyone uhuh im a fairy princess thats good enough and is this your escort for the evening he asked glancing up at boone no jessie laughed gaily hes my daddy im really jessie im really padrick he straightened and though his eyes remained merry boone was sure he was being measured and youd be sawyer he offered a hand boone sawyer were anastasias neighbors neighbors you say well i doubt thats all but come in come in he exchanged boones hand for jessies see what we have in store for you ghosts she nearly bounced out of her mary janes daddy ghosts not a bad attempt for a layman padrick said kindly enough oh by the way anas just taken nash and morgana upstairs weve having twins tonight maureen my passion flower come meet anas neighbors he turned to boone as a striking amazon in a scarlet turban came striding down the hall i imagine youd like a drink boyo padrick said to boone yes sir boone blew out a long breath i believe i would hesitant and uneasy mel knocked on the door of morganas bedroom then poked her head in she wasnt sure whether shed expected the clinical and to her mind frightening aura of a delivery room or the mystical glow of a magic circle either one she could have done without instead there was morgana propped up in a big cozylooking bed flowers and candles all around harp and flute music was drifting through the room morgana looked a bit flushed nash more than a bit pale but the basic normality of it all reassured mel enough to have her crossing the threshold when ana gestured to her come on in mel you should be an expert at this now after all you helped sebastian and me deliver the foal just a few months ago i feel like a horse morgana muttered but that doesnt mean i appreciate the comparison i dont want to interrupt or get in the way or oh boy she whispered when morgana threw her head back and began to puff like a steam engine okay okay nash gripped her hand and fumbled with a stopwatch here comes another one were doing fine just fine we hell morgana said between her teeth id like to see you breathe anas voice was gentle as she placed crystals over morganas belly they hovered in the air gleaming with an unearthly light that mel tried to take in stride after all she reminded herself shed been married to a witch for two months its all right babe nash pressed his lips to her hand wishing desperately for the pain to pass its almost over dont go she gripped his hand hard as the contraction began to ease dont go im right here youre wonderful as ana had instructed him he cooled morganas face with a damp cloth i love you gorgeous youd better she managed a smile and let out a long cleansing breath knowing she had a ways to go she closed her eyes how am i doing ana great a couple more hours a couple nash bit off the words and fixed on a smile that was sick around the edges terrific mel cleared her throat and ana glanced over im sorry we got a little distracted no problem i just thought youd want to know boones here with jessie oh ana mopped her own brow with her shirtsleeve id forgotten ill be right down would you send aunt bryna up sure hey morgana were all with you morganas smile was just a tad wicked great want to change places ill pass this time thanks she was edging toward the door ill just get out of your way youre not going to be gone long struggling against panic nash rubbed the small of morganas back and looked pleadingly at ana only a minute or two and aunt brynas very skilled besides we need some brandy brandy shes not supposed to drink for you ana said gently as she slipped out of the room the first thing ana noted when she reached the parlor was that jessie was being very well entertained anas mother was laughing her lusty fullbodied laugh as jessie recounted her classs escapades at the school halloween party since jessie was already cuddling two stuffed animals ana deduced that her father had already been up to his tricks she certainly hoped hed been discreet things are well upstairs bryna said quietly as they passed in the doorway perfect youll be a grandmother before midnight bless you anastasia bryna kissed her cheek and i do like your young man hes not but her aunt was already hurrying upstairs and there was boone standing by the fireplace where the flames crackled cheerily drinking what was surely one of her fathers concoctions and listening with an expression of fascinated bemusement to one of her uncle douglass stories so naturally we took the poor soul in for the night storm being what it was and what did he do but go screeching out in the morning shouting about banshees and ghosts and the like touched douglas said sadly tapping a finger to his head where an orange silk hat now resided a sad and sorry tale perhaps it had something to do with you clanging about in that suit of armor matthew donovan commented wanning a brandy in his longfingered hands no no a suit of armor doesnt resemble a banshee in the least i imagine it was maureens cat screeching that did it my cats do not screech she said insulted theyre quite well behaved i have a dog jessie piped up but i like cats too is that so always willing to oblige padrick plucked a yellowstriped stuffed kitten from between her fairy wings how about this one oh jessie buried her face in its fur then delighted padrick by climbing onto his lap and kissing his rosy cheek da ana leaned over the sofa to press her lips to his balding head you never change ana jessie bounced on padricks lap and tried to hold up her entire menagerie at once your daddys the funniest person in the world i like him myself she tilted her head curiously but who are you im jessie giggling she climbed down to turn in a circle no really honest daddy made me a fairy princess for halloween you certainly sound like jessie ana crouched down give me a kiss and lets see jessie pressed her painted lips to anas flushing with pleasure at her costumes success didnt you know me really you fooled me completely i was certain you were a real fairy princess your daddy said you were his fairy princess cause your mama was a queen maureen let out another peal of laughter and winked at her husband my little frog im sorry i cant stay and talk ana told jessie i know youre helping get morganas babies out do they come out together or one at a time one at a time i hope she laughed tousling jessies hair and looked over at boone you know youre welcome to stay as long as you like theres plenty of food dont worry about us hows morgana very well actually i came down to get some brandy for nash his nerves are about shot with an understanding nod matthew picked up a decanter and a snifter he has my sympathy when he passed them to her she felt a jolt of his power and knew that however calm his exterior his mind and his heart were upstairs with his daughter dont worry ill take care of her uncle matthew no one better you are the best ive known anastasia his eyes held hers as he flicked a finger over the bloodstone she wore around her neck and ive known many then a smile touched his lips boone perhaps youd walk anastasia back up be glad to boone took the decanter from ana before they started out your family boone began shaking his head at the foot of the stairs unaware that shed stiffened yes incredible absolutely incredible it isnt every day i find myself plopped into the center of a group of strangers with a woman about to give birth to twins upstairs a wolf because i swear that dog is no dog gnawing what looks like a mastodon bone under the kitchen table and mechanical bats flying overhead oh i forgot the ghosts in the foyer well it is halloween i dont think that has much to do with it he stopped at the top of the stairs i cant remember ever being more entertained theyre fabulous ana your father does these magic tricks terrific magic tricks for the life of me i couldnt figure out how he pulled it off no you wouldnt hes ah very accomplished he could make a living at it ive got to tell you i wouldnt have missed this party for the world he cupped his free hand around her neck the only thing missing is you i was worried youd feel awkward no though it does kind of scotch my plans to lure you into some shadowy corner and make you shiver with some bloodcurdling story so youd climb all over me for protection i dont spook easily smiling she twined her arms around him i grew up on bloodcurdling and uncles clanging around in suits of armor he murmured as he brushed his lips over hers oh thats the least of it she leaned against him changing the angle of the kiss we used to play in the dungeons and i spent an entire night in the haunted tower on one of sebastians dares courageous no stubborn and stupid ive never been more uncomfortable in my life she was drifting into the kiss losing herself at least until morgana conjured up a blanket and pillow conjured he repeated amused by the term sent up she corrected and poured herself into the embrace so that he would think of nothing but her when the door opened beside them they looked around like guilty children bryna lifted her brows summed up the situation and smiled im sorry to interrupt but i think boone is just what we need right now he took a firmer grip on the brandy bottle in there she laughed no if youd just stay there and let me send nash out for a moment or two he could use a little man talk only for a minute ana cautioned morgana needs him inside before boone could agree or refuse she slipped away resigned he poured a snifter took a good swallow himself then refilled it when nash stepped out he pressed the snifter on nash have a shot i didnt think it would take so long after a long breath he sipped the brandy or that it would hurt her so much if we get through this i swear im never going to touch her again yeah right i mean it despite the fact he knew it was an expectantfather cliché he began to pace nash i dont mean to interfere but wouldnt you feel better safer if morgana was in a hospital with a doctor and all that handy medical business a hospital no nash rubbed a hand over his face morgana was born in that same bed she wouldnt have it any other way with the twins i guess i wouldnt either well a doctor then anas the best remembering that relaxed him slightly believe me morgana couldnt be in better hands than hers i know midwives are supposed to be excellent and more natural i imagine he moved his shoulders if nash was content with the situation it wasnt up to him to worry about it i guess shes done it before no this is morganas first time i meant ana boone said on a chuckle delivering babies oh yeah sure she knows what shes doing its not that in fact i think id go crazy if she wasnt here but he took another swallow paced a little more i mean this has been going on for hours i dont know how she can stand it i dont know why any woman stands it just seems to me she could do something about it damn it shes a witch manfully masking another chuckle he gave nash an encouraging pat on the back nash its not a good time to call her names women get a little nasty when theyre in labor theyre entitled no i mean he broke off realizing he was going over the edge ive got to pull myself together yep i know its going to be all right ana wouldnt let anything happen but its so hard to watch her hurting when you love someone its the hardest thing in the world but you get through it and in this case youre getting something fantastic out of it i never thought i could feel this way about anybody shes everything i know what you mean feeling better nash passed the snifter back to boone is that how it is with ana i think it might be i know shes special yeah she is nash hesitated and when he spoke again he chose his words with care loyalty split two ways was the heaviest of burdens youd be able to understand her boone with your imagination your way of looking beyond whats considered reality she is a very special lady with qualities that make her different from anyone youve ever known if you love her and you want her to be a part of your life and jessies dont let those qualities block you boones brows drew together i dont think im following you just remember i said it thanks for the drink he took a steadying breath then went back in to his wife chapter contents prev next breathe come on baby breathe i am breathing morgana grunted out the words between pants and couldnt quite manage to glare at nash what the hell do you call this if its not breathing nash figured he was past his own crisis point shed already called him every name in the book and had invented several more ana said they were nearly there and he was clinging to that as desperately as morgana was clinging to his hand so he merely smiled at his sweaty wife and mopped her brow with a cool cloth growling spitting snarling he touched his lips to hers relieved when she didnt bite him youre not going to turn me into a slug or a twoheaded newt are you she laughed groaned and let out the last puff of air i can come up with something much more inventive i need to sit up more ana nash get in the bed behind her support her back its going to go quickly now arching her own back which echoed the aches in morganas she checked one last time to see if all was ready there were blankets warmed by the fire heated water the clamps and scissors already sterilized the glow of crystals pulsing with power bryna stood by her daughters side her eyes bright with understanding and concern images of her own hours in that same bed fighting to bring life into the world raced through her head that same bed she thought blinking at the mists in her eyes where her child now labored through the last moments the last pangs no pushing until i tell you pant pant ana repeated as she felt the contraction build within herself a sweet and terrible pang that brought fresh sweat to her skin morgana stiffened fought off the need to tense and struggled to do as she was told good good nearly there darling i promise have you picked out names i like curly and moe nash said panting right along with morgana until she managed to jab him weakly with an elbow okay okay ozzie and harriet but only if we have one of each dont make me laugh now you idiot but she did laugh and the pain eased back i want to push i have to push if its two girls he continued with an edge of desperation were going with lucy and ethel he pressed his cheek against hers two boys and its boris and bela morganas laughter took on a slightly hysterical note as she reached back to link her arms around nashs neck god ana i have to bear down ana snapped out go ahead push caught between laughter and tears morgana threw her head back and fought to bring life into the room oh god outside lightning shot across a cloudless sky and thunder cracked its celestial whip nice going champ nash began but then his mind seemed to go blank as glass look oh lord would you look at that at the foot of the bed ana gently competently turned the tiny dark head hold back now honey i know its hard but hold back just for a minute pant thats it thats the way next times the charm its got hair nash said weakly his face was as wet with sweat and tears as morganas just look at that what is it i havent got that end out yet ana sent a glittering smile to her cousin okay this is for the grand prize bear down honey and lets see if weve got ozzie or harriet with laughter morgana delivered her child into anas waiting hands as the first wild indignant cry of life echoed in the room nash buried his face in his wifes tangled hair morgana sweet lord morgana ours ours the pain was already forgotten eyes glowing morgana held out her arms so that ana could place the tiny wriggling bundle into them in the language of her blood she murmured to the babe as her hands moved gently to welcome what is it with a trembling hand nash reached down to touch the tiny head i forgot to look you have a son ana told him at the first lusty wail conversation in the parlor downstairs cut off like a switch all eyes shifted to the stairs there was silence stillness touched boone looked at his own child who slept peacefully on the sofa her head nestled in padricks comfortable lap he felt a tremor beneath his feet saw the wine slosh back and forth in his glass before he could speak douglas was removing his top hat and slapping matthew on the back a new donovan he said and snatched up a glass to lift in toast a new legacy a little tearyeyed camilla walked over to kiss her brotherinlaws cheek blessed be boone was about to add his congratulations when sebastian crossed the room he lighted a white candle then a gold one taking up a bottle of unopened wine he broke the seal then poured pale gold liquid into an ornate silver chalice a star dawns in the night life from life blood through blood to shine its light through love he was given the gift of birth and from breath to death will walk the earth the other gift comes through blood and bone and is for him to take and own charm of the moon power of the sun never forgetting an it harm none sebastian passed the cup to matthew who sipped first fascinated boone watched the donovans pass the chalice of wine from one to the other an irish tradition he wondered it was certainly more moving more charming than passing out cigars when he was handed the cup he was both honored and baffled even as he began to sip another wail sounded announcing another life two stars matthew said in a voice thickened with pride two gifts then the solemn mood was broken as padrick conjured up a party streamer and a rain of confetti as he blew a celebratory toot his wife laughed bawdily happy new year she said gesturing toward the clock that had just begun to strike twelve its the best all hallows eve since padrick made the pigs fly she grinned at boone hes such a prankster pigs boone began but the group turned as one as bryna entered the room she moved directly to her husband who folded her tightly within his arms theyre all well she brushed at happy tears all well and beautiful we have a grandson and a granddaughter my love and our daughter invites us all upstairs to welcome them not wanting to intrude boone hung back as the group piled out of the room sebastian stopped in the doorway arched a brow arent you coming i think the family you were accepted sebastian said shortly not certain he agreed with the rest of the donovans he hadnt forgotten how deeply ana had once been hurt an odd way to phrase it boone kept his voice mild to counteract a sudden flare of temper particularly since you feel differently regardless sebastian inclined his head in what boone interpreted as both challenge and warning but when sebastian glanced toward the sofa he softened i imagine jessie would be disappointed if you didnt wake her and bring her up for a look but youd rather i didnt ana would rather you did sebastian countered and thats more to the point he moved to the doorway again then stopped youll hurt her anastasia sheds no tears but shell shed them for you because i love her ill have to forgive you for that i dont see no sebastian nodded curtly but i do bring the child sawyer and join us its a night for kindness and small miracles uncertain why sebastians words angered him so much boone stared at the empty doorway he damn well didnt have to prove himself to some overprotective interfering cousin when jessie shifted and blinked owlishly he pushed sebastian out of his mind daddy right here frog face he bent and lifted his child into his arms guess what she rubbed her eyes im sleepy well go home soon but i think theres something youd like to see first while she yawned and dropped her heavy head on his shoulder he carried her upstairs they were all gathered around making a great deal more noise than boone imagined was the norm even for a home delivery room nash was sitting on the edge of the bed beside morgana holding a tiny bundle and grinning like a fool he looks like me dont you think he was asking of no one in particular the nose hes got my nose thats allysia morgana informed him rubbing a cheek over her sons downy head ive got donovan right well shes got my nose he peeked over at his son hes got my chin the donovan chin douglas corrected plain as a pikestaff hah maureen was jockeying for position theyre both corrigans through and through our side of the family has always had strong genes while they argued over that jessie shook off sleep and stretched forward is it the babies did they get born can i see let the child in padrick elbowed his brother out of the way let her have a look jessie kept one arm hooked around her fathers neck as she leaned forward oh her tired eyes went bright as ana took a babe in each arm to hold them up for jessie to see they look just like little faeries very delicately she touched a fingertip to one cheek then the other thats just what they are padrick kissed jessies nose a brand new faerie prince and princess but they dont have wings jessie said giggling some faeries dont need wings padrick winked at his daughter because they have wings on their hearts these faeries need some rest and some quiet ana turned to tuck the babies into morganas waiting arms and so does their mama i feel wonderful nevertheless ana shot a warning look over her shoulder that had the donovans reluctantly filing out boone morgana called out would you wait for ana drive her home shes exhausted im perfectly fine he should of course i will he settled the yawning jessie on his shoulder well be downstairs whenever youre ready it took another fifteen minutes before ana was assured that nash had all her instructions morgana was already drifting off to sleep when ana closed the door and left the new family alone she was exhausted and the powers of the crystals in her pouch were nearly depleted for almost twelve hours she had gone through the labor of childbirth with her cousin as closely linked as it was possible to be her body was heavy with fatigue her mind drugged with it it was a common result of a strong empathic link she staggered once at the top of the stairs righted herself then gripped her bloodstone amulet to draw on the last of its strength by the time she reached the parlor she was feeling a little steadier there was boone half dozing in a chair by the fire with jessie cuddled against his chest his eyes opened his lips curved hey champ i have to admit i thought this whole setup was a little loony but you did a hell of a job up there its always stunning to bring life into the world you didnt have to stay all this time i wanted to he kissed jessies head so did she shell be the hit of school on monday with this story its been a long night for her and one she wont forget ana rubbed her eyes almost as jessie had before falling asleep again where is everyone in the kitchen raiding the refrigerator and getting drunk i decided to pass since i already had more than my share of wine he offered a sheepish grin a little while ago i could have sworn the house was shaking so i switched to coffee he gestured toward the cup on the table beside him and now youll be up half the night ill just run and tell them im going if youd like to go put jessie in the car outside boone took a deep gulp of the cool night air ana was right he was wide awake hed have to work a couple of hours until the coffee wore off and hed more than likely pay for it tomorrow but it had been worth it he glanced over his shoulder to where the light glowed in morganas bedroom it had been well worth it he slipped jessies wings over her shoulders then laid her on the back seat beautiful night ana murmured from behind him i think every star must be out two new stars bemused boone opened the door for her thats what matthew said it was really lovely sebastian made a toast about life and gifts and stars and they all passed around a cup of wine is that an irish thing in a way she leaned her head back against the seat as he started the car within seconds she was asleep when boone pulled up in his driveway he wondered how he was going to manage to carry both of them to bed he shifted easing his door open but ana was already blinking awake just let me carry her inside and ill give you a hand no im fine blearyeyed ana stepped out of the car ill help you with her she laughed as she gathered up the store of stuffed animals da always goes overboard i hope you dont mind are you kidding he was great with her come on baby he lifted her and in the way of children she remained utterly lax she was taken with your mother too and the rest but your father was definitely the hero i expect shell be bugging me to go to ireland now so she can visit him in his castle hed love it she took the silver wings and followed him into the house just set those anywhere do you want a brandy no really she dropped the animals on the couch put the wings beside them then rolled her aching shoulders i wouldnt mind some tea i can brew some while you settle her in fine i wont be long a low growling emerged from under jessies bed when boone carried her in great watchdog its just us you blockhead desperately relieved daisy bounded out tail wagging she waited until boone had removed jessies shoes and costume then leapt onto the bed to settle at jessies feet you wake me up at six and ill staple those doggie lips closed daisy thumped her tail and shut her eyes i dont know why we couldnt have gotten a smart dog while we were at it boone was saying as he walked into the kitchen it wouldnt have been and then his words trailed off the kettle was on and beginning to steam cups were set out and the pot was waiting ana had her head pillowed on her arms at the kitchen table and was deep in sleep under the bright light her lashes cast shadows on her cheeks boone hoped it was the harshness of the light that made her look so delicately pale her hair spilled over her shoulder her lips were soft just parted looking at her he thought of the young princess who had been put under a spell by a jealous faerie and made to sleep a hundred years until wakened by true loves gentle kiss anastasia youre so beautiful he touched her hair indulging himself hed never watched her sleep and he had a sudden tearing urge to have her in his bed to be able to open his eyes in the morning and see her there beside him what am i going to do sighing he let his hand fall away from her hair and moved to the stove to shut off the kettle as gently as he had with jessie he lifted her into his arms and like jessie she remained lax gritting his teeth against the knots in his stomach he carried her upstairs and laid her on his bed you dont know how much ive wanted you here he said under his breath as he slipped off her shoes in my bed in the night all night he spread the covers over her and she sighed shifting in sleep and curling into his pillow the knots in his stomach loosened as he bent to touch his lips to hers good night princess in her panties and tshirt jessie padded into the bedroom before dawn shed had a dream a bad one about the haunted house at school and wanted the comfort and warmth of her father he always made monsters go away she scurried to the bed and climbed in to burrow against him it was then that she noted it wasnt her father at all but ana fascinated jessie curled up curious fingers played with anas hair in sleep ana murmured and tucked jessie under her arm to snuggle her close odd sensations tugged through jessies stomach different smells different textures and yet she felt as loved and safe as she did when her father cuddled her she rested her head trustingly against anas breast and slept when ana woke she felt arms around her small limp arms disoriented she stared down at jessie then looked around the room not her room she realized and not jessies boones she kept the child warm against her as she tried to piece together what had happened the last thing she remembered was sitting down after shed put on water for tea tired shed been so tired shed rested her head for a moment and and obviously had fallen fast asleep so where was boone cautiously she turned her head unsure whether she was relieved or disappointed to find the bed beside her empty impractical of course given the circumstances but it would have been so lovely to be able to cuddle back against him even as the child cuddled to her when she looked back jessies eyes were open and on hers i had a bad dream the girl told her in hushed morning whispers about the headless horseman he was laughing and laughing and chasing me ana snuggled down to kiss jessies brow i bet he didnt catch you uhuh i woke up and came to get daddy he always makes the monsters go away the ones in the closet and under the bed and at the window and everywhere daddies are good at that she smiled remembering how her own had pretended to chase them away with a magic broom every night during her sixth year but you were here and i wasnt scared with you either are you going to sleep in daddys bed at night now no she brushed a hand through jessies hair i think you and i both fell asleep and your father had to put both of us to bed but its a big bed jessie pointed out thered be room i have daisy to sleep with me now but daddy has to sleep all alone does quigley sleep with you sometimes ana said relieved at the rapid change of topic hes probably wondering where i am i think he knows boone announced from the doorway he was wearing only jeans unsnapped at the waist and he looked blearyeyed and harassed with the gray cat winding between his legs he howled and scratched at the back door until i let him in oh ana shoved her tumbled hair back as she sat up sorry i guess he woke you right the first time he tucked his thumbs in his pockets while the cat leapt onto the bed and began to mutter and complain to his mistress the knots in his stomach were back doubled how could he explain what he felt on seeing ana cuddled with his little girl in the big soft bed jessie what are you doing i had a bad dream she leaned her head against anas arm and stroked the cats fur so i came in to get you but ana was here she made the monsters go away just like you do quigley meowed plaintively and made jessie giggle hes hungry poor kitty i can feed him can i take him down and feed him sure if youd like before ana had finished the sentence jessie was bounding off the bed calling to the cat to follow sorry she woke you boone hesitated then moved over to sit on the edge of the bed she didnt apparently she just climbed right on in and went back to sleep and i should apologize for putting you to so much trouble you could have given me a shake and sent me home you were exhausted he reached out much as jessie had to touch her hair incredibly beautiful and totally exhausted having babies is tiring work she smiled where did you sleep in the guest room he winced at the crick in his back which makes getting a decent bed in there a top priority automatically she pressed her hands on his lower back to massage and ease you could have dumped me in there i dont think i would have known the difference between a bed and a sheet of plywood i wanted you in my bed his gaze met hers and locked i very much wanted you in my bed he tugged on her hair to bring her closer much closer i still do his mouth was on hers not so patient now not so gentle ana felt a quick thrill of excitement and alarm as he pressed her back against the pillows boone just for a minute his voice took on an edge of desperation i need a minute with you he took her breast searing her flesh through the thin silk of her rumpled blouse while his hands skimmed over her his mouth took and took swallowing her muffled moans his body ached to cover hers to press hard against soft to take quickly even savagely what he knew she could bring to him ana his teeth scraped down her throat before he gathered her close just to hold her he knew he was being unfair to both of them and he struggled to back off how long does it take to feed that cat not long enough with a shaky laugh she dropped her head on his shoulder not nearly long enough i was afraid of that he drew back running his hands down her arms to take hers jessies been after me to let her spend the night at lydias if i can work it out will you stay with me here yes she brought his hand to her lips then pressed it to her cheek whenever you like tonight he forced himself to release her to move away tonight he repeated ill go call lydias mother beg if i have to he steadied himself and slowed down i promised jess wed go get some ice cream maybe have lunch on the wharf will you come with us if it all works out we could drop her off at lydias then go out to dinner she pushed off the bed herself brushing uselessly at the wrinkles in her blouse and slacks that sounds nice great sorry about the clothes i wasnt quite brave enough to undress you she felt a quick thrill at the image of him unbuttoning her blouse slowly very slowly his fingers patient his eyes hot she cleared her throat theyll press out i need to change go check on morgana and the twins i could drive you thats all right my fathers going to pick me up so i can get my car what time did you want to leave about noon in a couple hours perfect ill meet you back here he caught her to him before she reached the doorway then stopped her heart with another greedy kiss maybe we could pick up some takeout bring it back and eat here that sounds nice too she murmured as she shifted the angle of the kiss or maybe we could just send out for pizza when we get hungry better much better by four oclock jessie was standing in lydias doorway waving a cheery goodbye her pink backpack was bulging with the amazing assortment of necessities a sixyearold girl required for a sleepover what made the entire matter perfect in her eyes was that daisy had been invited along for the party tell me not to feel guilty boone asked as he cast one last glance in the rearview mirror about about wanting my own daughter out of the house tonight boone adoring him ana leaned over to kiss his cheek you know perfectly well jessie could hardly wait for us to drive away so she could begin her little adventure at lydias yeah but its not packing her off so much its packing her off with ulterior motives knowing what those motives were brought a little knot of heat to anas stomach she isnt going to have less of a good time because of them particularly when you promised her she could have a slumber party in a couple of weeks if youre still feeling guilty think about how youre going to feel riding herd on five or six little girls all night he slanted her a look i kind of figured youd help since you have ulterior motives too did you the fact that hed asked pleased her enormously maybe i will she laid a hand over his for a paranoid father riddled with guilt youre doing a wonderful job keep it up im feeling better too much flattery isnt good for you just for that i wont tell you how many guys gave themselves whiplash craning their necks to get a second look at you when we were walking on the wharf today oh she skimmed back her blowing hair were there many depends on how you define many besides too much flattery isnt good for you i guess i could say i dont know how you could look so good today after the night you put in it could be because i slept like a rock she stretched luxuriously a bracelet of agates winked at her wrist morganas the amazing one when i got there this morning she was nursing both of the twins and looking as if shed just spent a reviving week at an expensive spa the babies okay the babies are terrific healthy and brighteyed nash is already a pro at changing diapers he claims both of them have smiled at him he knew that feeling too and had just realized he missed it hes a good guy nash is very special i have to admit i was stunned when i heard he was married nash was always the goitonyourown type love changes things ana murmured and carefully screened all wistfulness from her voice aunt bryna calls it the purest form of magic a good description once it touches you you begin to think nothings impossible anymore were you ever in love once she looked away studying the shimmering ice plants along the banks a long time ago but it turned out the magic wasnt strong enough then i learned that my life wasnt over after all and i could be perfectly happy alone so i bought my house near the water she said with a smile planted my garden and started fresh i suppose it was similar for me he grew thoughtful as they made the final turn toward home does being happy alone mean you dont think you could be happy with someone unease and hope ran parallel inside her i guess it means i can be happy as things stand until i find someone who not only brings me the magic but understands it he turned into the drive shut off the engine we have something together ana i know i never thought to feel anything this powerful again its different from what i had before and im not sure what that means i dont know if i want to know it doesnt matter she took his hand again sometimes you just have to accept that today is enough no its not he turned to her then his eyes dark intense not with you she took a careful breath im not what you think i am or what you want me to be boone youre exactly what i want his hands were rough as he dragged her against him her startled gasp was muffled against his hard seeking mouth chapter contents prev next a whip of panicked excitement cracked through her as he tore her free of the seat belt and yanked her across his lap his hands bruised his mouth branded this was not the boone who had loved her so gently taking her to that sweet sweet fulfillment with patient hands and murmured promises her lover of quiet mornings and lazy afternoons had become something darker something dangerous something she was helpless to resist she could feel the blood sizzling under her skin as he took those rough impatient hands over her this was the wildness she had tasted that first time in a moonlit garden with the scent of flowers ripe and heady this bursting of urgent needs was what he had only hinted at under all that patience and steady control in mindless acquiescence she strained against him willing eager and ready to race along any path he chose her body shuddered once violently as he dragged her over a ragged edge he heard her muffled cry against his greedy mouth tasted the ripeness of it as her fingers dug desperately into his shoulders the thought ran crazily through his mind that he could have her here right here in the car before reason caught up with either of them he tore at her blouse craving the taste of flesh the sound of ripping seams was smothered by her quick gasp as he feasted on her throat beneath his hungry mouth her pulse hammered erratically erotically the flavor of her was already hot already honeyed with passion on a vicious oath he shoved the door open yanking her out leaving it swinging he half carried half dragged her across the lawn boone staggered she tried to gain her feet and lost her shoes boone the car you left your keys he caught her hair pulling her head back his eyes oh lord his eyes she thought trembling with something much deeper than fear the heat in them seared through to her soul the hell with the car his mouth swooped down plundered hers until she was dazed and dizzy and fighting to breathe do you know what you do to me he said between strangled gasps for air every time i see you he pulled her up the steps touching her always touching her soft serene with something smoldering just behind your eyes he pushed her back against the door crushing conquering those full luscious lips with his there was something more in her eyes now he could see that she was afraid and that she was aroused it was as if they both were fully aware that the animal hed kept ruthlessly on a choke chain for weeks had broken free with the breath coming harsh through his lips he caught her face in his hands tell me ana tell me you want me now my way she was afraid she wouldnt be able to speak her throat was so dry and this new need so huge i want you the husky sound of her voice had the flames in his gut leaping higher now any way he hooked his hands in her blouse watched her eyes go to smoke just before he rent it in two when he kicked the door open she staggered back then was caught up in a torrid embrace like her blouse his control was in shreds his hands tight at her waist he lifted her off her feet to take her silkcovered breast in his mouth as crazed now as he she arched back her hands fisted in his hair boone please the plea sobbed out though she had no idea what she was asking for unless it was more he lowered her only so that he could capture her mouth again his teeth scraped erotically over her swollen lips his tongue dived deep then his heart seemed to explode in his chest as she began to tug frantically at his clothes he stumbled toward the stairs shedding his shirt as he went buttons popped and scattered but his greedy hands reached for her again yanking the thin chemise down to her waist as they reached the landing here he dragged her down with him right here at last he feasted racing his mouth over her quivering flesh ruthlessly exploiting her secrets relentlessly driving her with him where he so desperately needed her to go no patience here no rigid control for the sake of her fragility indeed the woman writhing beneath him on the stairs was anything but fragile there was strength in the hands that gripped him searing passion in the mouth that tasted him so eagerly whiplike agility in the body that strained under his she felt invincible immortal impossibly free her body was alive never more alive with heat pumping crazily through her blood the world was spinning around her a blur of color and blinding lights whirling faster faster until she was forced to grip the pickets of the banister to keep from falling off the edge of the earth her knuckles whitened against the wood as he tore her slacks away then the thin swatch of lace beneath his mouth oh his mouth greedy frantic fevered ana bit back a scream as he sent her flying into hot airless space her mindless murmurs were in no language he could understand but he knew he had taken her beyond the boundaries of the sane of the rational he wanted her there right there with him as they catapulted into the madness of vivid lawless passion hed waited hed waited now her slim white body bucked a thoroughbred ready to ride quivering like a stallion he mounted her driving himself into that wet waiting heat she arched to meet him and hips moving like lightning raced with him into the roaring dark her hands slid weakly off his damp back she was too numb to feel the slap of wood against them as they fell against the stairs she wanted to hold him but her strength was gone it wasnt possible to focus her mind on what had happened all that came were flashes of sensations bursts of emotions if this was the darker side of love nothing could have prepared her for it if this terrible need was what had lived inside him she couldnt comprehend how he could have strapped it back for so long for her sake she turned her damp face into his throat all for her sake beneath his stillshuddering body she was as limp as water boone struggled to get a grip on reality he needed to move after everything else hed done to her he was probably crushing her but when he started to shift she made a little sound of distress that scraped at his conscience here baby let me help you he eased away picking up a tattered sleeve of her blouse with some idea to cover her biting off an oath he tossed it down again shed turned slightly on her side obviously seeking some kind of comfort for gods sake he thought in disgust hed taken her like some kind of fiend and on the stairs on the stairs ana he found what was left of his own shirt and tried to wrap it around her shoulders anastasia i dont know how to explain explain the word was barely audible her throat was wild with thirst theres no possible let me help you up her body slid like wax through his arms ill get you some clothes or oh hell i dont think i can get up she moistened her lips and tasted him not for a day or two this is fine though ill just stay right here frowning at her he tried to interpret what he heard in her voice it wasnt anger it didnt sound like distress it sounded like very much like satisfaction youre not upset hmmm am i supposed to be well for i practically attacked you hell i did attack you almost taking you in the front seat of the car tearing off your clothes dragging you in here and devouring what was left of you on the stairs with her eyes still closed she drew in a deep breath then let it out again on a sigh through curved lips you certainly did and its the first time ive been devoured i dont think ill ever go up and down a staircase the same way again gently he tipped a finger under her chin until her eyes opened i had intended to at least make it to the bedroom i guess well get there eventually recognizing concern she put a hand on his wrist boone do you think i could be upset because you wanted me that much i thought you might be upset because this wasnt what youre used to making the effort she sat up wincing a little at the aches that would surely be bruises before much longer im not made of glass theres no way we could love each other that wouldnt be right but she linked her arms around his neck and her smile was wicked around the edges under the circumstances im glad we made it into the house he skimmed his hands down to her hips for the pleasure of bringing her body against his my neighbors very openminded ive heard that experimentally she caught his lower lip between her teeth remembering how much pleasure it gave her to feel his lips cruise over her face and throat she began a lazy journey over his fortunately my neighbors very understanding of passions i doubt anything would shock him even if i told him i often fantasize about him at night when im alone in bed it was impossible but he felt himself stir against her the deep dark wanting began to smolder again really what kind of fantasies of having him come to me her breath began to quicken as his mouth roamed over her shoulder come to my bed like an incubus in the night when a storm cracks the air i can see his eyes cobalt blue in a flash of lightning and i know that he wants me the way no one else ever has or ever will knowing very well that if he didnt take some kind of action now theyd remain sprawled on the stairs he gathered her up i cant give you the lightning she smiled as he carried her up you already have later hours later they knelt on the tumbled bed feasting on pizza by candlelight ana had lost track of time and had no need to know if it was midnight or approaching dawn they had loved and talked and laughed and loved again no night in her life had been more perfect what did time matter here guinevere was no heroine ana licked sauce from her fingers they had discussed epic poetry modern animation ancient legends and folklore and classic horror she wasnt sure how they had wound their way back to arthur and camelot but on the subject of arthurs queen ana stood firm and she certainly wasnt a tragic figure id think a woman especially one with your compassion would have more sympathy with her situation boone debated having a last piece from the cardboard box theyd plopped in the center of the bed why ana picked it up herself and began to feed it to him she betrayed her husband helped bring down a kingdom all because she was weakwilled and selfindulgent she was in love love doesnt excuse all actions amused she tilted her head and studied him in the flickering light he looked gloriously masculine in nothing but a pair of gym shorts his hair tousled his face shadowed with stubble isnt that just like a man finding excuses for a womans infidelity just because its written about in romantic terms he didnt think it was precisely an insult but it made him squirm a little i just dont think she had control of the situation of course she did she had a choice and she chose poorly just as lancelot did all that flowery business about gallantry and chivalry and heroism and loyalty and the two of them justified betraying a man who loved them both because they couldnt control themselves she tossed her hair back thats bull he laughed before he sipped his wine you amaze me here ive been thinking you were a romantic a woman who picks flowers by moonlight who collects statues of faeries and wizards and she condemns poor guinevere because she loved unwisely she fired up poor guinevere hold on he was chuckling enjoying himself immensely it didnt occur to either of them that they were debating about people most considered fictional lets not forget some of the other players merlin was supposed to be watching over the whole business why didnt he do anything about it fastidiously she brushed crumbs from her bare legs its not a sorcerers place to interfere with destiny come on were talking about the champ here one little spell and he couldve fixed it up and altered countless lives she pointed out gesturing with her glass skewed history no he couldnt do it not even for arthur people witches kings mortals are responsible for their own fates he didnt have any problem abetting adultery by disguising uther as the duke of cornwall and taking tintagel so that igraine conceived arthur in the first place because that was destiny she said patiently as she might have to jessie that was the purpose for all merlins power all his greatness his single most vital act was bringing arthur into being sounds like splitting hairs to me he swallowed the last bite of pizza one spells okay but another isnt when youre given a gift its your responsibility to know how and when to use it how and when not to can you imagine how he suffered watching someone he loved destroyed knowing even as arthur was being conceived how it would end magic doesnt divorce you from emotion or pain it rarely protects the one who owns it i guess not hed certainly had witches and wizards suffering in the stories he wrote it gave them a human element he found appealing when i was a kid i used to daydream about living back then rescuing fair maidens from fiery dragons sure going on quests challenging the black knight and beating the hell out of him naturally then i grew up and discovered i could have the best of both worlds living there up here he tapped his head with a fingertip when i was writing and having the creature comforts of the twentieth century like pizza like pizza he agreed a computer instead of a quill cotton underwear hot running water speaking of which he said fingering the hem of the tshirt hed given her to wear he moved on impulse and had her shrieking out a laugh as he tossed her over his shoulder and climbed out of bed what are you doing hot running water he repeated i think its time i showed you what i can do in the shower youre going to sing maybe later in the bathroom he opened the glass shower doors and turned on the taps hope you like it hot well i she was still over his shoulder when he stepped inside with the crisscrossing sprays raining she was immediately drenched front and back boone she sputtered youre drowning me sorry he shifted reaching for the soap you know this shower really sold me on the house its roomy he slicked the wet bar of soap up her calf pretty great having the twin shower heads despite the heat of the water ana shivered when he soaped lazy circles at the back of her knee its a little difficult for me to appreciate it from this position then she shoved her dripping hair out of her face and noticed that the floor was mirrored tiles oh my he grinned and moved slowly up to her thigh check out the ceiling she did tilting her head and staring at their reflections ah doesnt it just steam up treated glass does get a little foggy if youre in here long enough and he intended to be in there just long enough he began sliding her down his body inch by dangerous inch but that only adds to the atmosphere gently he pressed her against the back wall cupping her breasts through the clinging shirt want to hear one of my fantasies it oh he was rubbing a thumb over an aching nipple seems only fair better idea he brushed his lips over hers teasing retreating until her breath began to hitch why dont i show you first we get rid of this he dragged the wet shirt over her head tossing it aside it landed with a plop that had another tremor jerking through her system and i start here toying with her mouth he rubbed the slick soap over her shoulders and i dont stop until i get to your toes she had a feeling showers were going to join staircases in the more erotic depths of her imagination gripping his hips for balance she arched back as he circled wet soapy hands over her breasts steam it was all around her it was inside of her the thick moist air made it all but impossible to breathe a tropical storm water pounding heat rising the creamy soap had flesh sliding gloriously against flesh when their bodies moved together her hands foamed with it as she ran them over his back over his chest even as his mouth raced to possess his muscles quivered at her touch and her laugh was low and softly triumphant if she burned so did he that was power clashing against power there was no longer any doubt that she could give back the wild wanton wicked pleasure he brought to her a pleasure so much sweeter so much richer because it grew from love as well as passion she wanted to show him she would show him her hands slid down him over strong shoulders the hard chest she murmured in approval as she traced fingertips over his rib cage and down to the flat plane of his stomach he shook his head to try to clear it he had expected to seduce her here yet he was being seduced the delicate hands flowing over his slick skin were shooting arrows of painful need through his system wait his hands groped for hers held them firm he knew that if she touched him now he would never be able to hold back let me no with the new knowledge brimming inside her mouth seared over his and conquered let me her fingers closed around him sliding stroking squeezing lightly while his breath sounded harshly in her ear a fresh flash of triumph exploded inside her as she felt his quick helpless shudder then greed to have him all of him deeply inside her ana he felt the last wisps of reality fading ana i cant you want me delirious with power she threw her head back her eyes were hot with challenge then take me now she looked like a goddess newly risen from the sea wet cables of hair slicked like dark gold over her shoulder her skin glowed shimmered with water in her eyes were secrets dark mysteries no man would ever unlock she was glorious she was magnificent and she was his hold on to me bracing her against the wall he lifted her hips with his hands hold on to me she locked her arms around him keeping her eyes open he took her where they stood plunging into her as the water showered over them gasping out his name she let her head fall back through the rising mists she saw their reflections a wonderful tangle of limbs that made it impossible to see where he left off and she began on a moan of inexpressible pleasure she dropped her head to his shoulder she was lost lost thank god for it i love you she had no idea if the words were in her head or had come through her lips but she said them again and again until her body convulsed he emptied himself into her then could only stand weakly against the wall as the strength ran out of him his heart was still roaring in his ears as he closed his hands over her shoulders tell me now her lips were curved but she swayed a little and stared up at him through clouded eyes tell you what his fingers tightened making her eyes clear that you love me tell me now i dont you think we should dry off weve been in the water quite a while with an impatient jerk he switched off the taps i want to look at you when you say it and have at least some of my wits about me were going to stay right here until i hear you say it again she hesitated he could have no idea that he was forcing her to take the next step toward having him or losing him destiny she thought and choices it was time she made hers i love you i wouldnt be here with you couldnt be here if i didnt his eyes were very dark very intense slowly his grip lightened his face relaxed i feel as though ive waited years to hear you say that she brushed the wet hair away from his brow you only had to ask he caught her hands in his you dont because she was beginning to shiver he drew her out of the stall to wrap her in a towel he caught it close around her then wrapped his arms tight for more warmth anastasia tenderness swelled inside him as he touched his lips to her hair her cheek her mouth you dont have to ask i love you you brought something i thought id never have again never want again back into my life on a broken sigh she pressed her face to his chest this was real she thought this was hers she would find a way to keep it youre everything ive ever wanted dont stop loving me boone dont stop i couldnt he drew her away dont cry i dont the tears shimmered but didnt spill over i dont cry anastasia sheds no tears but shell shed them for you sebastians words rang uncomfortably in boones head resolutely he blocked them out it was ridiculous hed do nothing to hurt her he opened his mouth then closed it again a steamy bathroom was no place for the proposal he wanted to make and there were things he needed to tell her first lets get you another shirt we need to talk she was much too happy to pay any heed to the curl of uneasiness she laughed when he took her back to the bedroom and tugged another of his shirts over her head dreamily she poured two more glasses of wine while he pulled on a pair of jeans will you come with me he held out a hand and she took it willingly where are we going i want to show you something he took her down the shadowy hall into his office delighted ana turned a circle this is where you work there were wide uncurtained windows framed with curving cherrywood a couple of worn faded scatter rugs had been tossed on the hardwood floor starshine sprinkled through the twin skylights an industriouslooking computer reams of paper and shelves of books announced that this was a workplace but hed added charm with framed illustrations a collection of dragons and knights that intrigued her the winged faery hed bought from morgana had a prominent place on a high carved stool you need some plants she decided instantly thinking of the narcissus and daffodils she was forcing in her greenhouse i imagine you spend hours in this room every day she glanced down at the empty ashtray beside his machine following her gaze he frowned odd he thought he hadnt had a cigarette in days had forgotten about them completely hed have to congratulate himself later sometimes i watch out the window when youre in your garden it makes it difficult to concentrate she laughed and sat on the corner of his desk well get you some shades not a chance he smiled but his hands went nervously to his pockets ana i need to tell you about alice boone compassion had her rising again to reach out i understand i know its painful theres no need to explain anything to me there is for me with her hand in his he turned to gesture at a sketch on the wall a lovely young girl was kneeling by a stream dipping a golden pail into the silver water she drew that before jessie was born gave it to me for our first anniversary its beautiful she was very talented yeah very talented very special he sipped his wine in an unconscious toast to a lost love i knew her most of my life pretty alice reeder he needed to talk ana thought she would listen you were high school sweethearts no he laughed at that not even close alice was a cheerleader student body president allaround nice girl who always made the honor roll we ran in different crowds and she was a couple of years behind me i was going through my obligatory rebellious period and kind of hulked around school looking tough she smiled touched his cheek where the stubble was rough id like to have seen that i snuck cigarettes in the bathroom and alice painted scenery for school plays we knew each other but that was about it i went off to college ended up in new york it seemed necessary since i was going to write that i get myself a loft and starve a little she slipped an arm around him instinctively offering comfort waiting while he gathered his thoughts one morning i was in the bakery around the corner from where i was living and i looked up from the crullers and there she was buying coffee and a croissant we started talking you know what are you doing here the old neighborhood what had happened to whom that kind of thing it was comforting and exciting here we were two smalltown kids taking on big bad new york and fate had tossed them together ana thought in a city of millions she was in art school boone continued sharing an apartment only a couple of blocks away with some other girls i walked her to the subway we just sort of drifted together sitting in the park comparing sketches talking for hours alice was so full of life energy ideas we didnt fall in love so much as we slid into it his eyes softened as he studied the sketch very slowly very sweetly we got married just before i sold my first book she was still in college he had to stop again as the memories swam back in force instinctively his hand closed over anas she opened herself giving what strength and support she could anyway everything seemed so perfect we were young happy in love shed already been commissioned to do a painting we found out she was pregnant so we decided to move back home raise the child in a nice suburban atmosphere close to family then jessie came and it seemed as though nothing could ever go wrong except that alice never seemed to really get her energy back after the birth everyone said it was natural she was bound to be tired with a new baby and her work she lost weight i used to joke that she was going to fade away he closed his eyes for a minute thats just what she did she faded away when it had gone on long enough for us to worry she had tests but there was a messup in the lab and they didnt detect it soon enough by the time we found out she had cancer it was too late to stop it oh boone im sorry im so sorry she suffered that was the worst she suffered and there was nothing i could do i watched her die degree by degree and i thought i would die too but there was jessie alice was only twentyfive when i buried her jessie had just turned two he took a long breath before he turned to ana i loved alice i always will i know when someone touches your life that way you never lose it when i lost her i stopped believing in happyeverafter except in books i didnt want to fall in love again risk that kind of pain for myself or for jessie but i have fallen in love again what i feel for you is so strong it makes me believe again its not the same as i felt before its not less its just us she touched his cheek she thought she understood boone did you think i would ask you to forget her that i could resent or be jealous of what you had with her it only makes me love you more she made you happy she gave you jessie i only wish i had known her impossibly moved he lowered his brow to hers marry me ana chapter contents prev next she froze the hands that had reached up to bring him close stopped in midair her breath seemed to stall in her lungs even as her heart leapt with hope her mind warned her to wait very slowly she eased out of his arms boone i think dont tell me im rushing things he was amazingly calm now that hed taken the step the step he realized hed already taken in his head weeks before i dont care if im moving too fast i need you in my life ana im already in your life she smiled trying to keep it light i told you that it was hard enough when i only wanted you harder still when i started to care but its impossible now that im in love with you i dont want to live next door to you he took a firm grip on her shoulders to keep her still i dont want to have to send my child away so i can spend the night with you you said you loved me i do she gave in to desperate need and pressed herself against him you know i do more than i thought i could more than i wanted to but marriage is right he stroked a hand down her damp hair right for us ana i told you once i dont take intimacy lightly and i wasnt just talking about sex he drew her back wanting to see her face wanting her to see his im talking about whats inside me every time i look at you before i met you i was content to keep my life the way it was but thats no good anymore im not going to keep running through the hedges to be with you i want you with me with us boone if it could be so simple she turned away struggling to find the right answer it can be he fought against a quick flutter of panic when i walked in this morning and saw you in bed with your arms around jessie i cant tell you what went through me at that moment i realized that was what i wanted for you to be there just to be there to know i could share her with you because youd love her that there could be other children a future she shut her eyes because the image was so sweet so perfect and she was denying them both a chance to make the image reality because she was afraid if i said yes now before you understand me before you know me it wouldnt be fair i do know you he swept her around again i know you have passion and compassion that youre loyal and generous and openhearted that you have strong feelings for family that you like romantic music and apple wine i know the way your laugh sounds the way you smell and i know that i could make you happy if youd let me you do make me happy its because i dont want to do any less for you that i dont know what to do she broke away to walk off the tension i didnt know this was going to happen so quickly before i was sure i swear if id known you were thinking of marriage to be his wife she thought bound to him by handfast she could think of nothing more precious than that kind of belonging she had to tell him so that he would have the choice of accepting or backing away youve been much more honest with me than i with you about about what you are her eyes closed on a sigh im a coward so easily devastated by bad feelings afraid pathetically afraid of pain physical and emotional so hatefully vulnerable to what others can be indifferent to i dont know what youre talking about ana no you dont she pressed her lips together can you understand that there are some who are more sensitive than others to strong feelings some who have to develop a defense against absorbing too much of the swirl of emotion that goes on around them who have to boone because they couldnt survive otherwise he pushed back his impatience and tried to smile are you getting mystical on me she laughed pressing a hand to her eyes you dont know the half of it i need to explain and dont know how if i could she started to turn back determined to tell him everything and the sketchpad on his desk slid off at the movement automatically she bent to pick it up perhaps it was fate that it had fallen faceup showing a recently completed sketch an excellent one ana thought on a long breath as she studied it the fierce and wicked lines of the blackcaped witch glared up at her evil she thought he had captured evil perfectly dont worry about that he started to take it from her but she shook her head is this for your story the silver castle yes lets not change the subject not as much as you think she murmured indulge me a minute she said with a careful smile tell me about the sketch damn it ana please frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair its just what it looks like the evil witch who put the spell on the princess and the castle i had to figure there was a spell that kept anyone from getting in or out so you chose a witch i know its obvious but the story seemed to call for it the vindictive jealous witch furious with the princesss goodness and beauty casts the spell so the princess stays trapped inside cut off from love and life and happiness then when true love conquers the spells broken and the witch is vanquished and they live happily ever after i suppose witches are to you evil and calculating calculating she remembered it was one of the words robert had tossed at her that and much much worse goes with the territory power corrupts right she set the sketch aside there are those who think it it was only a drawing she told herself only part of a story hed created yet it served to remind her how large a span they needed to cross boone ill ask you for something tonight i guess you could ask me for anything tonight time she said and faith i love you boone and theres no one else id want to spend my life with but i need time and so do you a week she said before he could protest only a week until the full moon then there are things ill tell you after i do i hope youll ask me again to be your wife if you do if you can then ill say yes say yes now he caught her close capturing her mouth hoping he could persuade her by his will alone what difference will a week make all she whispered clinging tight or none he didnt care to wait it made him nervous and impatient that the days seemed to crawl by one then two finally three to comfort himself he thought about the turn his life would take once the interminable week was over no more nights alone soon when he returned restlessly in the dark she would be there the house would be full of her her scent the fragrances of her herbs and oils on those long quiet evenings they could sit together on the deck and talk about the day about tomorrows or perhaps she would want them to move into her house it wouldnt matter they could walk through her gardens under her arbors and she could try to teach him the names of all of her flowers they could take a trip to ireland and she could show him all the important places of her childhood there would be stories she could tell him like the one about the witch and the frog and he could write about them one day there would be more children and he would see her holding their baby the way she had held morgana and nashs more children that thought brought him up short and had him staring at the framed picture of jessie smiling out at him from his desktop his baby only his and his only for so long now he did want more children hed never realized until now how much he wanted more how much he enjoyed being a father it was simply something he was something he did now as his mind began to play with the idea he could see himself soothing an infant in the night as he had once soothed jessie holding out his arms as a toddler took those first shaky steps tossing a ball in the yard holding on to the back of an unsteady bike a son wouldnt it be incredible to have a son or another daughter brothers and sisters for jessie shed love that he thought and found himself grinning like an idiot hed love it of course he hadnt even asked ana how she felt about adding to the family that was certainly something theyd have to discuss maybe it would be rushing her again to bring it up now then he remembered how shed looked with her arm cuddling jessie in his bed the way her face had glowed when shed held two tiny infants up so that his daughter could see and touch no he decided he knew her she would be as anxious as he to turn their love into life by the end of the week he thought they would start making plans for their future together for ana the days passed much too quickly she spent hours going over the right way to tell boone everything then she would change her mind and struggle to think of another way there was the brash way she imagined herself sitting him down in her kitchen with a pot of tea between them boone she would say im a witch if that doesnt bother you we can start planning the wedding there was the subtle way they would sit out on her patio near the arbor of morning glories while they sipped wine and watched the sunset they would talk about their childhoods growing up in ireland is a little different than growing up in indiana i suppose she would tell him but the irish usually take having witches in the neighborhood pretty much for granted then shed smile more wine love or the intellectual way im sure youd agree most legends have some basis in fact this conversation would take place on the beach with the sound of the surf and the cry of gulls your books show a great depth of understanding and respect for what most consider myth or folklore being a witch myself i appreciate your positive slant on faeries and magic particularly the way you handled the enchantress in a third wish for miranda ana only wished she had enough humor left to laugh at each pitiful scenario she was certainly going to have to think of something now that she had less than twentyfour hours to go boone had already been more patient than she had a right to ask there was no excuse for keeping him waiting any longer at least she would have some moral support this evening morgana and sebastian and their spouses were on their way over for the monthly fridaynight cookout if that didnt buck her up for her confrontation with boone the following day nothing would as she stepped onto the patio she fingered the diamondclear zircon she wore around her neck obviously jessie had been keeping an eagle eye out for she zipped through the hedge with daisy yipping behind her to show his indifference to the pup quigley sat down and began to wash his hindquarters were coming to your house for a cookout jessie announced the babies are coming too and maybe i can hold one if im really really careful i think that could be arranged automatically ana scanned the neighboring yard for signs of boone how was school today sunshine it was pretty neat i can write my name and daddys and yours yours is easiest i can write daisys but i dont know how to spell quigleys so i just wrote cat then i had my whole family just like the teacher told us she stopped scuffed her shoes and for the first time since ana had known her looked shy was it okay if i said you were my family its more than okay crouching down ana gave jessie a huge hug oh yes she thought squeezing her eyes tight this is what i want what i need i could be a wife to him a mother to the child please please let me find the way to have it all i love you jessie you wont go away will you because they were close because she couldnt prevent it ana touched the childs heart and understood that jessie was thinking of her mother no baby she drew back choosing her words with care i would never want to go away but if i had to if i couldnt help it id still be close how can you go away and still be close because id keep you in my heart here ana took the thin braided gold chain with the square of zircon and slipped it over jessies neck ooh it shines its very special when you feel lonely or sad you hold on to this and think of me ill know and ill send you happiness dazzled jessie turned the crystal and it exploded with light and color is it magic yes jessie accepted the answer with a childs faith i want to show daddy she started to dash off then remembered her manners thank you youre welcome is ah is boone inside uhuh hes on the roof the roof cause next month is christmas and hes starting to put up the lights so we know how many we have to buy the whole house is going to be lit up daddy says this is going to be the most special christmas ever i hope so ana shielded her eyes with the flat of her hand and looked up there he was sitting on top of the house looking back at her her heart gave that quick improbable leap it always did when she saw him despite nerves she smiled lifting one hand in a wave while the other rested on jessies shoulder it would be all right she told herself it had to be boone ignored the tangle of christmas lights beside him and pleased himself by watching them until jessie raced back across the yard and ana went inside it would be all right he told himself it had to be sebastian plucked a fat black olive from a tray and popped it into his mouth when do we eat you already are mel pointed out i mean real food he winked down at jessie hot dogs herbed chicken ana corrected turning a sizzling thigh on the grill they were spread over the patio with jessie sitting in a wroughtiron chair carefully cradling a cooing allysia in her lap boone and nash were deep in a discussion on infant care morgana had donovan at her breast comfortably nursing while she listened to mel relate the happy ending of the runaway she and sebastian had tracked down kid was miserable she was saying sorry as hell hed taken off scared to go back when we found him cold broke and hungry and he realized his parents were scared instead of angry he couldnt wait to get home i think hes grounded till hes thirty but he doesnt seem to care she waited until morgana had burped her son her hands had been itching to touch want me to put him back down for you thanks morgana watched mels face as she lifted the baby thinking about having one of your own or two actually mel caught the special scent of baby and felt her knees go weak i think i might she cast a quick look over her shoulder and saw her husband was busy teasing jessie im not sure yet but i think i may have already started oh mel thats shh she leaned down using the baby for cover i dont want him to know or even suspect or id never be able to stop him from looking for himself i want to be able to tell him about this she grinned itll knock his socks off gently mel laid the child in his side of the double carriage allysias sleeping too jessie pointed out tracing a finger over the babys cheek want to put her down with her brother sebastian leaned over to help jessie stand with the baby thats the way he kept his hands under hers as she laid allysia down youll be an excellent mother one day maybe i can have twins too she turned when daisy began to bark hush she whispered youll wake the babies but daisy was lost in the thrill of the chase heading for open ground quigley shot through the hedges into the next yard yowling delighted with the game daisy dashed after him ill get him daddy making as much racket as the animals jessie raced after them i dont think obedience schools the answer boone commented tipping back a beer im thinking along the lines of a mental institution panting a bit jessie followed the sounds of barks and hisses across the yard over the deck around the side of the house when she caught up with daisy she put her hands on her hips and scolded you have to be friends ana wont like it if you keep teasing quigley daisy simply thumped her tail on the ground and barked again halfway up the ladder boone had used to climb to the roof quigley hissed and spat he doesnt like it daisy on a sigh she squatted down to pet the dog he doesnt know youre just playing and wouldnt really hurt him ever you made him scared she looked up the ladder come on kitty its okay you can come down now on a feline growl quigley narrowed his eyes then bounded up the ladder when daisy responded with another flurry of barks oh daisy look what youve done jessie hesitated at the foot of the ladder her father had been very specific about her not going near it but he hadnt known that quigley would get so scared and maybe hed fall off the roof and get killed she stepped back thinking she would go tell her father to come then she heard quigley meow daisy was her responsibility she remembered she was supposed to feed him and watch him so he didnt get in trouble if quigley got hurt it would be all her fault im coming kitty dont be scared with her lower lip caught between her teeth she started up the rungs shed seen her father go right on up and it hadnt looked hard at all just like climbing the jungle gyms at school or up to the top of the big sliding board kitty kitty she chanted climbing higher and giggling when quigley stuck his head over the roof you silly cat daisy was only playing ill take you down dont worry she was nearly to the top when her sneakered foot missed the next rung smells wonderful boone murmured but he was sniffing at anas neck not the chicken shed piled on a platter good enough to eat nash gave him a nudge as he reached for a plate if youre going to kiss her move aside the rest of us want dinner fine slipping his arms around a flustered ana he closed his mouth over hers in a long lingering kiss times almost up he said against her mouth you could put me out of my misery now and the words shut off when he heard jessies scream with his heat in his throat he raced across the yard shouting for her he tore through the hedges pounded across the grass oh god oh my god every ounce of blood seemed to drain out of him when he saw her crumpled on the ground her arm bent at an impossible angle her face as white as linen baby panicked he fell beside her she was too still even his fevered mind registered that one terrifying fact and when he reached down to pick her up there was blood her blood on his hands dont move her ana snapped out the order as she dropped beside them she was breathing hard fighting back terror but her hands clasped firmly over his wrists you dont know how or where shes hurt you can do more harm by moving her shes bleeding he cupped his hands on his daughters face jessie come on jessie with a trembling finger he searched for a pulse at her throat dont do this dear god dont do this we need an ambulance ill call mel said from behind them ana only shook her head boone the calm settled over her as she understood what she had to do boone listen to me she took his shoulders holding tight when he tried to shake her off you have to move back let me look at her let me help her shes not breathing he could only stare down at his little girl i dont think shes breathing her arm shes broken her arm it was more than that even without a closer link ana knew it was much more than that and there was no time for an ambulance i can help her but you have to move back she needs a doctor for gods sake someone call an ambulance sebastian ana said quietly her cousin stepped forward and took boones arms let go of me boone started to swing and found himself pinned by both sebastian and nash what the hells wrong with you we have to get her to a hospital let ana do what she can nash said fighting to hold his friend and his own panic back you have to trust her for jessies sake ana pale and shaken morgana passed one of her babies into mels waiting arms it may be too late you know what could happen to you if i have to try very gently oh so gently she placed her hands on either side of jessies head she braced waiting until her own breathing was slow and deep it was hard very hard to block out boones violent and terrified emotions but she focused on the child only the child and opened herself pain hot burning spears of it radiating through her head too much pain for such a small child ana drew it out drew it in let her own system absorb it when agony threatened to smother the serenity needed for such deep and delicate work she waited for it to roll past then moved on so much damage she thought as her hands trailed lightly down such a long way to fall a perfect image clicked in her mind the ground rushing up the helpless fear the sudden numbing jolt of impact her fingers passed over a deep gash in jessies shoulder the mirror image sliced through her own throbbed seeped blood then both slowly faded my god boone stopped struggling his body was too numb what is she doing how she needs quiet sebastian muttered stepping back from boone he took morganas hand there was nothing they could do but wait the injuries inside were severe sweat began to bloom on anas skin as she examined absorbed mended she was chanting as she worked knowing she needed to deepen the trance to save the child and herself oh but the pain it ripped through her like fire making her shudder her breath hitched as she fought the need to pull back blindly she clutched a hand over the zircon jessie still wore and placed the other over the childs quiet heart when she threw her head back her eyes were the color of storm clouds and as blank as glass the light was bright blindingly bright she could barely see the child up ahead she called shouted wanting to hurry knowing that one misstep now would end it for both of them she stared into the light and felt jessie slipping further away this gift is mine to use or scorn both pain and power shimmered in her voice this choice was mine from the day i was born what harms the child bring into me as i will so mote it be she cried out then from the tearing price to be paid for cheating death she felt her own life ebb teetering teetering toward the searing light as jessies heart began to beat tremulously under her hand she fought back for both of them calling on every ounce of her strength every vestige of her power boone saw his daughter stir watched her lashes flutter as ana swayed back jess jessie he leaped forward to scoop her into his arms baby are you all right daddy her blank unfocused eyes began to clear did i fall down yeah weak with relief and gratitude he buried his face against her throat and rocked her yeah dont cry daddy she patted his back im okay lets see he took a shaky breath before he ran his hands over her there was no blood he discovered no blood no bruise not even the smallest scratch he held her close again staring at ana as sebastian helped her to her feet do you hurt anywhere jessie uhuh she yawned and nestled her head on his shoulder i was going to mommy she looked so pretty in all the light but she looked sad like she was going to cry when she saw me coming then ana was there and she took my hand mommy looked happy when she waved goodbye to us im sleepy daddy his own heart was throbbing in his throat thickening his voice okay baby why dont you let me take her up when boone hesitated nash lowered his voice shes fine anas not he took the already dozing child dont let common sense get in the way pal he added as he took jessie inside i want to know what happened here afraid hed babble boone forced himself to speak slowly i want to know exactly what happened all right ana glanced around at her family if youd leave us alone for just a minute id like to she trailed off as the world went gray swearing boone caught her as she fell then hoisted her into his arms what the hell is going on he demanded what did she do to jessie he looked down alarmed by the translucent pallor of anas cheeks what did she do to herself she saved your daughters life sebastian said and risked her own be quiet sebastian morgana murmured hes been through enough he yes she laid a restraining hand on her cousins arm boone ana needs rest a great deal of rest and quiet if youd prefer you can bring her home one of us will stay and take care of her shell stay here he turned and carried her inside she was drifting in and out in and out of worlds without color there was no pain now no feeling at all she was as insubstantial as a mist once or twice she heard sebastian or morgana slip inside her deeply sleeping mind to offer reassurance others joined them her parents her aunts and uncles and more after a long long journey she felt herself coming back tints and hues seeped back into the colorless world sensations began to prickle along her skin she sighed once it was the first sound she had made in more than twentyfour hours then opened her eyes boone watched her come back he rose automatically from the chair to bring her the medication morgana had left with him here he supported her holding the cup to her lips youre supposed to drink this she obeyed recognizing the scent and the taste jessie shes fine nash and morgana picked her up this afternoon shes staying with them tonight with a nod she drank again how long have i been asleep asleep he gave a half laugh at her prosaic term for the comalike state shed been in youve been out for twentysix hours he glanced at his watch and thirty minutes the longest journey shed ever taken ana realized i need to call my family and tell them im well ill do it are you hungry no she tried not to be hurt by his polite distant tone of voice this is all i need for now then ill be back in a minute when he left her alone she covered her face with her hands her own fault she berated herself she hadnt prepared him had dragged her feet and fate had taken a hand on a tired sigh she got out of bed and began to dress what the hell are you doing boone demanded when he walked in again youre supposed to rest ive rested enough ana stared down at her hands as she meticulously buttoned her blouse and id just as soon be on my feet when we talk about this his nerves jittered but he only nodded have it your way can we go outside i could use some air fine he took her arm and led her downstairs and out on the deck once she was seated he took out a cigarette struck a match hed hardly closed his eyes since hed carried ana upstairs and hed been subsisting on tobacco and coffee if youre feeling up to it id appreciate an explanation im going to try to give you one im sorry i didnt tell you before ana linked her hands tight in her lap i wanted to but i could never find the right way straight out he said as he dragged deeply on smoke i come from a very old bloodline on both sides a different culture if you like do you know what wicca is something cold brushed his skin but it was only the night air witchcraft actually its true meaning is wise but witch will do she looked up and her clear gray eyes met his tired shadowed ones im a hereditary witch born with empathic powers that enable me to link emotionally and physically with others my gift is one of healing boone took another long drag on his cigarette youre going to sit there look me in the face and tell me youre a witch yes furious he flung the cigarette away what kind of a game is this ana dont you think after what happened here last night i deserve a reasonable explanation i think you deserve the truth you may not think it reasonable she held up a hand before he could speak tell me how you would explain what happened he opened his mouth closed it again hed been working on that single problem for more than twentyfour hours without finding a comfortable solution i cant but that doesnt mean im going to buy into this all right she rose laid a hand on his chest youre tired you havent had much sleep your heads pounding and your stomachs in knots he lifted a brow derisively i dont think you have to be a witch to figure that out no before he could back away she touched a hand to his brow pressed the other to his stomach better she asked after a moment he needed to sit down but he was afraid he wouldnt get up again shed touched him barely touched him and even the shadow of pain was gone what is it hypnotism no boone look at me he did and saw a stranger with tangled blond hair billowing out in the wind the amber enchantress he thought numbly was it any wonder it had reminded him so much of her ana saw both shock and the beginning of belief on his face when you asked me to marry you i asked you to give me time so that i could find the right way to tell you i was afraid her hands dropped away afraid youd look at me exactly the way youre looking at me now as if you dont even know me this is bull look i write this stuff for a living and i know fiction from fact my skill for magic is very limited still she reached into her pocket where she always carried a few crystals with her eyes on boones she held them out in her palm slowly they began to glow the purple of the amethyst deepening the pink of the rose quartz brightening the green of the malachite shimmering then they rose an inch two inches up circling spinning in the air and flashing with light morgana is more talented with such things he stared at the tumbling crystals trying to find a logical reason morgana is a witch too shes my cousin ana said simply which makes sebastian sebastians gift is sight he didnt want to believe but it was impossible to discount what he saw with his own eyes your family he began those magic tricks of your fathers magic in its purest form she plucked the crystals out of the air and slipped them back in her pocket as i told you hes very accomplished as are the rest of them in their own ways were witches all of us she reached out to him but he backed away im sorry youre sorry rocked to the core he dragged both hands through his hair it had to be a dream a nightmare but he was standing on his own deck feeling the wind hearing the sea thats good thats great youre sorry for what ana for being what you are or for not finding it important enough to mention im not sorry for being what i am pride stiffened her spine i am sorry for making excuses to myself not to tell you and im sorry most sorry of all that you cant look at me now the way you did only a day ago what do you expect am i supposed to just shrug this off pick up where we were before to accept the fact that the woman i love is something out of one of my own stories and think nothing of it im exactly what i was yesterday and what ill be tomorrow a witch yes she folded her hands at her waist a witch born to the craft i dont make poisoned apples or lure children into houses of gingerbread thats supposed to relieve my mind even i dont have the power to do that as i told you all of us are responsible for our own destinies but she knew he held hers in his hands you have your choice to make he struggled to get a grip on it and simply couldnt you needed time to tell me well by god i need time to figure out what to do about it he started to pace then stopped dead jessie jessies over at morganas ana felt the crack in her heart widen oh yes with my cousin the witch a single tear spilled over and ran down her cheek what do you think morganas going to do cast a spell on her lock her in a tower i dont know what to think for lords sake ive found myself in the middle of a fairy tale what am i supposed to think what you will ana said wearily i cant change what am and i wouldnt not even for you and i wont stand her and have you look at me as if i were a freak im not shall i tell you what youre feeling she asked him as another tear fell betrayed angry hurt and suspicious of what i am what i can do or will do my feelings are my own business he shot back shaken i dont want you to get inside me that way i know and if i were to step forward right now reach out to you as a woman youd only back away so ill save us both good night boone when she walked off the deck into the shadows he couldnt bring himself to call her back chapter contents prev next i guess youre still a little dazed nash lounged against the rail of boones deck enjoying a beer and the cool evening breeze i was never a little dazed boone told him look maybe im just a narrowminded sort of guy nash but finding out the lady next door is a witch kind of threw me off stride especially when youre in love with the lady next door especially i wouldnt have believed it who would but i saw what she did with jessie then i started piecing other things together he laughed shortly sometimes i still wake up in the middle of the night and think i dreamed the whole thing he walked over to the rail leaning out toward the sound of water it shouldnt be real she shouldnt be real why not come on boone its our business to stretch the envelope a little this blows the envelope wide open boone pointed out and what we do we do for books for movies its entertainment nash its not life its mine now boone blew out a breath i guess it is but didnt you dont you even question it or worry about it sure i did i thought she was pulling my leg until she tossed me up in the air and left me hanging there the memory made him grin even as boone shut his eyes morganas not the subtle type once i realized the whole thing was on the level it was wild you know wild boone repeated yeah i mean ive spent most of my life making up stories about this kind of thing and here i end up marrying an honesttogoodness witch elfin blood and everything elfin blood the term had boones head reeling it doesnt bother you why should it bother me it makes her who she is and i love her i have to admit im a little dubious about the kids i mean once they get going ill be outnumbered the twins boone had to force his mouth to close are you telling me those babies are will be a pretty sure bet come on boone they arent going to grow warts and start to cackle they just get a little something extra mels expecting too she just found out for sure shes the most downtoearth lady i know and shes handling sebastian as if shes been around a psychic all her life so youre saying loosen up boone whats your problem nash dropped down on the bench i know its not that easy let me ask you this how far into the relationship were you when morgana told you about her what do i call it her pretty much right off the bat i was researching a script and id heard about her you know how people are always telling me about weird stuff not that i believed it but i thought shed make a good interview and what about mel and sebastian i cant say for sure but she met him when a client of hers wanted to hire a psychic nash frowned into his beer i know what youre getting at and youve got a point maybe she should have been straight with you earlier he gave a choked laugh maybe okay she should have been but you dont know the whole story morgana told me that ana was in love with this guy a few years back she was only about twenty i think and really nuts about him he was an intern at some hospital and she got the idea that they could work together that she could help him so she told him everything and he dumped her hard apparently he was pretty vicious about it and with her empathic thing shes really vulnerable to well bad vibes lets say it left her pretty shaky she made up her mind shed go it alone when boone said nothing nash blundered on look i cant tell you what to do or how to feel i just want to say that she wouldnt have done anything to hurt you or jessie on purpose shes just not capable of it boone looked toward the house next door the windows were blank and dark as they had been for more than a week where is she she wanted to get away for a little while give everybody some room i guess i havent seen her since the night she told me for the first few days i figured it was better if i stayed away from her he felt a quick pang of guilt i kept jessie away from her too then about a week ago she took off she went to ireland she promised to be back before christmas because his emotions were still raw boone only nodded i thought i might take jessie back to indiana before the holidays just for a day or two maybe ill be able to work all this out in my head by the time we all get back christmas eve padrick sampled the wassail smacked his lips and sighed no better night in the year filling a cup he handed it to his daughter put color in your cheeks my darling and fire in my blood the way you make it but she smiled and sampled isnt it incredible how the twins have grown aye he wasnt fooled by the bright note in her voice i cant stand to see my princess so sad im not she squeezed his hand im fine papa really i can turn him into a purple jackass for you darling id be pleasured to no because she knew he was only half joking she kissed his nose and you promised we wouldnt have to talk about it once everyone got here aye but a promise she reminded him and moved away to help her mother at the stove she was glad her house was filled with the people she loved with the noise of family there were the scents she had always associated with this holiday cinnamon nutmeg pine bayberry when shed arrived home a few days before shed thrown herself into a flurry of preparations tree trimming present wrapping cookie baking anything and everything to take her mind off the fact that boone was gone that he hadnt spoken to her in more than a month but she would survive it she had already decided what to do and she refused to let her own unhappiness ruin the family celebration well be pleased to have you home with us back in ireland ana maureen bent to kiss her daughters head if its truly what you want ive missed ireland ana said simply i think the goose is nearly ready after opening the oven and taking a heady sniff she nodded ten minutes more she predicted ill just go see if everythings on the table wont even discuss it maureen said to her husband when ana slipped out tell you what id like my dove id like to take that young man and send him off to some nice frozen island just for a day or two mind if ana wasnt so sensitive about such matters i could brew up a nice potion to bring him around padrick patted his wifes bottom you have such a delicate touch reenie the lad would be bound by handfast before he could blink which would be the best thing to happen to him and that darling child of his he sighed nibbling his way up his wifes arm but ana would never forgive us for it well have to let her work this out her own way frustrated by a day of canceled flights and delays boone slammed the car door what he wanted was a long hot bath and what he had to look forward to was an endless night of dealing with those terrifying words some assembly required if santa was going to put in an appearance before morning boone sawyer was going to have to put in some overtime come on jess he rubbed his tired eyes hed been traveling for more than twelve hours if you counted the six hed spent twiddling his thumbs in the airport lets get this stuff inside anas home jessie tugged on his arm and pointed toward the lights look daddy theres morganas car and sebastians and the big black car too everybodys at anas house i see that he felt his heart begin to trip a little faster then it all but stopped when he saw the for sale sign in her front yard can we go over and say merry christmas please daddy i miss ana she closed her hand around the zircon she wore can we go say merry christmas yeah glaring at the sign he gripped his daughters hand yeah lets go do that right now move away would she he thought as he strode across the lawn in a pigs eye sell her house when he wasnt looking and just take off theyd just see about that daddy youre walking too fast jessie had to trot to keep up and youre squeezing my hand sorry he drew in a long breath then let it out again he scooped her up and took the stairs two at a time the knock on her door wasnt so much a request as a demand it was padrick who answered his round face wreathed in a fake white beard and red stocking cap on his balding head the minute he saw boone the twinkle in his eyes died well well look what the cat dragged in brave enough to take us all on at once are you boyo were not all as polite as my ana id like to see her oh would you now hold it right there he gave jessie his charming smile and lifted her out of boones arms looks like i got me a real elf this time tell you what lass you run right on in and look under that tree see if theres not something with your name on it oh can i she hugged padrick fiercely then turned back to her father please can i sure like padricks his smile faded as soon as jessie raced inside i came to see ana mr donovan well youre seeing me what do you think youd do if someone took your jessies heart and squeezed it dry though he was more than a head shorter than boone he advanced fists raised i wont use nothing but these on you youve my word as a witch now put em up boone didnt know whether to laugh or retreat mr donovan take the first punch he stuck his whiskered chin out looking very much like an indignant santa ill give you that much and its more than youd be deserving ive listened to her crying in the night over the likes of you and its boiled my blood told myself padrick if you get facetoface with that weasel of a man youll have to demolish him its a matter of pride he took a swing that spun him completely around and missed boone by a foot she wouldnt let me go after that other slimy bastard when he broke her poor heart but ive got you mr donovan boone tried again dodging the peppery blows i dont want to hurt you hurt me hurt me padrick was dancing now fueled by the insult his santa cap slipped over his eyes why i could turn your insides out i could give you the head of a badger i could papa with one sharp word ana stopped her fathers babbling threats you go on inside princess this is mans work i wont have you fighting on my doorstep on christmas eve now you stop it just let me send him to the north pole just for an hour or two its only fitting youll do no such thing she stepped out and put a warning hand on his shoulder now go inside and behave or ill have morgana deal with you bah i can handle a witch half my age shes sneaky ana pressed a kiss to his cheek please papa do this for me could never refuse you anything he muttered then he turned glittering eyes on boone but you watch your step mister he jabbed out a plump finger you mess with one donovan you mess with them all with a sniff he went inside im sorry ana began fixing a bright smile on her face hes very protective so i gathered since he wasnt going to have to defend himself after all he could think of nothing to do with his hands but shove them in his pockets i wanted to we wanted to say merry christmas yes jessie just did they were silent for another awkward moment youre welcome to come in have some wassail i dont want to intrude your family he offered what almost passed for a grin i dont want to risk my life either even the faint smile faded from her eyes he wouldnt really have harmed you its not our way i didnt mean what the hell was he supposed to say to her i dont blame him for being upset and i dont want to make you or your family uncomfortable if youd rather i could just he turned slightly and the sign on her lawn caught his eye his temper rose accordingly what the hell is that isnt it clear enough im selling the house ive decided to go back to ireland ireland you think you can just pack up and move six thousand miles away yes i do boone im sorry but dinners nearly ready and i really have to go in of course youre welcome to join us if you dont stop being so bloody polite im going to he cut himself off again i dont want dinner he said between his teeth i want to talk to you this isnt the time well make it the time he backed her through the doorway just as sebastian came down the hall behind her placing a light hand on anas shoulder he sent boone a warning glance is there a problem here anastasia no i invited boone and jessie for dinner but he isnt able to join us pity sebastians smile glittered with malice well then if youll excuse us sawyer boone slammed the door behind him causing all the ruckus inside to switch off like a light several pairs of eyes turned their way he was too furious to note that sebastians were now bright with amusement stay out of my way boone said quietly each and every one of you i dont care who you are or what you are more than ready to fight a fleet of dragons he grabbed anas hand you come with me my family can damn well wait he yanked her back outside from her perch under the christmas tree jessie stared wideeyed after them is daddy mad at ana no happy enough about what shed seen to burst at the seams maureen gave the little girl a squeeze i think theyve just gone off to take care of another christmas present for you one i think youll like best of all outside ana labored to keep up stop dragging me boone im not dragging you he said as he dragged her through the side yard i dont want to go with you she felt the tears shed thought she was finished with stinging her eyes im not going through this again you think you can put up a stupid sign in your yard and solve everything guided by moonlight he tugged her down the rock steps that led to the beach drop a bombshell on my head then take off for ireland i can do exactly as i please witch or no witch youd better think that one over again you wouldnt even talk to me im talking to you now well now i dont want to talk she broke away and started to climb back up then youll listen he caught her around the waist and tossed her over his shoulder and were going to do this far enough from the house so that i know your family isnt breathing down my neck when he reached the bottom he flipped her over and dropped her to her feet one step he warned you take one step away and ill haul you back i wouldnt give you the satisfaction she struggled with the tears preferring temper you want to have your say fine then ill have mine as well i accept your position on our relationship i deeply regret you feel it necessary to keep jessie away from me i never dont deny it for days before i left for ireland you kept her at home she picked up a handful of pebbles and threw them out to sea wouldnt want your little girl too near the witch after all she whirled back to him for gods sake boone what did you expect from me did you see me rubbing my hands together and croaking out ill get you my pretty and your little dog too his lips quirked at that and he reached out but she spun away give me some credit ana i did a little later than i should have but i did and you turned away just as id known you would known though he was getting tired of the choreography he pulled her around again how did you know how id react did you look in your crystal ball or just have your psychic cousin take a stroll through my head neither she said with what control she had left i wouldnt let sebastian look and i didnt look myself because it seemed unfair i knew youd turn away because because someone else had it doesnt matter the fact is you did turn away i just needed to take it in i saw the way you looked at me that night she shut her eyes ive seen that look before oh you werent cruel like robert there were no names no accusations but the result was the same stay away from me and mine i dont accept what you are she wrapped her arms tight and cupped her elbows for warmth im not going to apologize for having what i think was a very normal reaction and damn it ana i was tired and halfcrazy watching you lie there in bed all those hours and you were so pale so still i was afraid you wouldnt come back when you did i didnt know how to treat you then you were telling me all of this she searched for calm knowing it was the best way the timing was bad all around i wasnt quite strong enough to deal with your feelings if you had told me before you would have reacted differently she glanced toward him no i dont think so but youre right i should have it was unfair and it was weak of me to let things go as far as they did dont put words in my mouth ana unless youre what do you call it linked if youre not linked with me you dont know what im feeling it hurt that you didnt trust me she nodded brushing a tear from her cheek i know im sorry you were afraid i told you i was a coward he frowned watching the hair blow around her face as she stared out at the moonkissed sea yes you did the night you came across my sketch the one of the witch that upset you she shrugged im oversensitive sometimes it was just the mood i was about to tell me and then i scared you off with my evil witch it seemed a difficult time to tell you because youre a coward he said mildly watching her let me ask you something ana what did you do exactly to jessie that day i linked i told you im an empath it hurt you i saw he took her arm turning her to face him once you cried out as if it were unbearable afterward you fainted then slept like the dead for more than a day thats part of it she tried to push his hand away it hurt too much to be touched when her defenses were shattered when the injuries are so serious theres a price yes i understand i asked morgana she said you could have died she said the risk was very great because jessie he could hardly say it she was gone or nearly and you werent just fixing some broken bones but bringing her back from the edge that the line is very fine and its very easy for the healer to become the victim what would you have had me do let her die a coward would have i think your definition and mine are different being afraid doesnt make you a coward you could have saved yourself and let her go i love her so do i and you gave her back to me i didnt even thank you do you think i want your gratitude it was too much she thought next he would offer her pity i dont i dont want it what i did i did freely because i couldnt bear to lose her either and i couldnt bear for you for me he said gently for you to lose someone else you loved i dont want to be thanked for it its what i am youve done it before what you did with jessie im a healer i heal she was it still hurt to think of it she was slipping away i used what i have to bring her back its not that simple his hands were gentle on her arms now stroking not even for you you feel more than others morgana told me that too when you let your defenses down youre more vulnerable to emotion to pain to everything thats why you dont cry with his fingertip he lifted a teardrop from her cheek but youre crying now you know everything there is to know whats the point of this the point is to take a step back to the night you explained it all to me the point is for you to take another chance and open yourself up for me you ask too much she sobbed the words out then covered her face oh leave me alone give me some peace cant you see how you hurt me yes i can see he wrapped his arms around her fighting to soothe while she struggled for release youve lost weight youre pale when i look into your eyes i see every ounce of pain i caused you i dont know how to take it back i dont know how your father kept himself from cursing me with whatever was in his arsenal we cant use power to harm its against everything we are please let me go i cant i almost thought i could she lied to me i told myself she betrayed my trust she isnt real he kept a firm grip on her arms as he pulled her away it doesnt matter none of it matters if its magic i dont want to lose it i cant lose you i love you ana all that you are please he touched his lips to hers tasting tears please come back to me the shaft of hope was almost painful she clung to it to him i want to believe so do i he cupped her face kissing her again and i do i believe in you in us if this is my fairy tale i want to play it out she stared up at him you can accept all of this all of us i figure im pretty well suited to do just that of course it might take a while for me to convince your father not to do something drastic to my anatomy he traced his fingers over her lips as they curved i didnt know if youd ever smile for me again tell me you still love me give me that too yes i love you her lips trembled under his always i wont hurt you again he brushed away tears with his thumbs ill make up for everything its done she caught his hands thats done we have tomorrow dont cry anymore she smiled rubbing her fists across her cheeks no i wont i never cry he took those damp fists and kissed them you said to ask you again its been longer than a week but im hoping you havent forgotten what you said your answer would be i havent forgotten put your hand here he pressed her palm to his heart i want you to feel what i feel he linked his free hand with hers the moons almost full the first time i kissed you was in the moonlight i was charmed enchanted spellbound i always will be i need you ana she could feel the strength of that love pouring into her you have me i want you to marry me share the child you gave back to me shes yours as much as mine now let me make more children with you ill take you as you are anastasia i swear ill cherish you as long as i live she lifted her arms to him hair like sunlight eyes like smoke shafts of moonglow shimmered around her like torchlight ive been waiting for you epilogue contents prev alone on a wild crag facing a stormy sea stood donovan castle this dark night lightning flashed and shuddered in the black sky and the wind set the leaded glass to shaking in the diamond panes inside fires leaped and glowed in the hearths those who were witches and those who were not gathered close waiting for the indignant wail that would signal a new life are you cheating grandda jessie asked padrick as he perused his cards cheating he gave a merry laugh and wiggled his brows certainly i am go fish she giggled and drew from the pile granny maureen says you always cheat she tilted her head were you really a frog that i was darling a fine green one she accepted this just as she accepted the other wonders of her life with the donovans she petted the snoring daisy who rested her big golden head in jessies lap will you be a frog again sometime so i can see i might surprise you he winked and changed her hand of cards into a rainbow of lollipops oh grandda she said indulgently sebastian mel hustled down the main stairs and shouted into the parlor where her husband was sipping brandy and watching the card game shawn and keely are awake and fussing i have my hands full helping with ana be right there the proud papa of three months set down his snifter and headed up to change diapers nash bounced oneyearold allysia on his knee while donovan sat in matthews lap playing with his pocket watch be careful he doesnt eat it nash commented or make it disappear were having a little trouble keeping him in line the lad needs to spread his wings a bit if you say so but when i went to get him out of his crib the other day it was full of rabbits real ones takes after his mother matthew said proudly she ran us ragged allysia leaned back against her father and smiled instantly daisy woke and trotted over within seconds every dog and cat in the house was swarming through the room ally nash said with a sigh remember how we said one at a time doggies squealing ally tugged gently on the ears of matthews big silver wolf kittycats next time just one okay nash plucked a cat off his shoulder nudged another off the arm of the chair a couple of weeks ago she had every hound within ten miles howling in the yard come on monsters he rose tucking allysia then donovan under his arms like footballs they kicked and giggled i think its time for bed story donovan demanded uncle boone hes busy youll have to settle for one from your old man he was indeed busy watching a miracle the room was scented with candles and herbs warmed by the fire glowing in the hearth he held tight to ana as she brought their son into the world then their daughter then their second son three he kept saying it over and over even as bryna settled an infant in his arms three theyd told him there would be triplets but he hadnt really believed it runs in the family exhausted elated ana took another bundle from morgana she pressed her lips gently to the silky cheek now we have two of each he grinned down at his wife as mel settled the third baby in the crook of anas arm i think we need a bigger house well add on would you like the others to come up bryna asked gently or would you rather rest awhile no please ana tilted her head so that it rested against boones arm ask them to come up they crowded in making too much noise ana made room in the big bed for jessie to sit beside her then placed a baby in her arms this is your brother trevor your sister mauve and your other brother kyle im going to take good care of them always look grandda we have a big family now you do indeed my little lamb he blew heartily into his checked kerchief he wiped his runny eyes and looked mistily at boone just as well i didnt flatten you when i had the chance here boone held out a squealing infant hold your grandson ah maureen my cheesecake look at this he has my eyes no my frog prince he has mine they argued with the rest of the donovans throwing their weight to one side or the other boone slipped his arm around his wife held his family close as his son suckled greedily at his first taste of mothers milk lightning flashed against the windows the wind howled and the fire leapt high in the grate somewhere deep in the forest high in the hills the faeries danced and they lived happily ever after
