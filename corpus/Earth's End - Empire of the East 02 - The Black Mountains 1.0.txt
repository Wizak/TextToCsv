the black mountains by fred saberhagen version a bw release chapter the great demon came to chup in the middle of an autumn night of howling wind it came amid a torrent of air whose vortices shrieking round the castle rose seeming ly within a single howl or gasp of attaining life it came with a blast that rattled and shook chups hovel of a shelter pitched against the inside of the castles massive outer wall lying sleepless with the nagging of his everpainful wound chup had heard time and again the screaming passage of things that from their sound were on the verge of becoming elementals of the air so it was that he paid little heed to the demons first shaking of his leanto but soon the shaking grew more violent a prolonged pounding as of air made heavy against one end of his little shelter bouncing its rickety boards against the wall of enormous stones stirring on his pallet raising his upper body on his elbows chup looked down the length of his paralyzed legs in the direction of the sound and in the midnight darkness he saw the demon coming in like faintly luminescent smoke through the cracks of his patchwork shelter involuntarily he stiffened the thing come from the east was chups ally or it would have been in his days of power when he had been lord chup and had held a satrapy and castle of his own in fief from the dread eastern overlords who dwelt in the black mountains but even a strong man thinking demons were his allies even such a man when a demon came to him at midnight and at hardly more than arms length distance might know himself strong indeed if he resisted the urge to run or to cover his eyes and flatten his body to the ground chup was chup he did not cover bis eyes as for fleeing or flattening on the ground mewicks maiming battlehatchet had settled that question for him half a year ago raised on his elbows he kept his eyes fixed steadily on the smoky image coalescing in the close dark space before him out side the wind moaned lowly now and soft relieved of bear ing that which had come in to chup rain began to spatter on the leanto inside the hovel space changed and distance grew as the face of the demon began to take its shape chup could see scarcely anything like a human feature on it yet he knew it was a face in the altered space there was nothing by which to judge its size but he knew that it was huge as it be came a little more distinct there quickly grew in chup the fear that he might understand what he was looking at that he might perceive the features rightly and they would be too horrible to face nothing but demons could shake him so now his eyes demanded if not closing at least to be allowed to slide out of focus with a sighing breath he at last let them do so only then as if it had waited for that yielding did the demon speak its voice was a skeletal hand searching fur tively through dead leaves lord chup the power tapped by this pronouncing of his name made its image once more plain in his sight with a shudder he gave up trying to face it down and let himself sprawl back on his rough bed a forearm flung over his eyes but he could still speak steadily enough i am chup lord no longer but lord again mayhap the dry leaves rustled stirred by finger bones your unclaimed bride the lady charmian does send you greeting now through me a greeting from where from her place of power and safety in the black moun tains to the east it was no surprise that she should be there many had been luckier than chup had gotten away on the day that this her fathers castle had fallen to the west of course the demon could be lying to him it could have come from the black mountains merely to torment a crip ple like some nasty child on a romp sometimes no mean ness was too small for them to bother with but no on sec ond thought it would not have come so lightly to this castle now filled as the place was with an army of wizards and warriors of the west even demons had to heed some dangers it was here then on important business without lifting his arm from his eyes chup asked what does my lady want of me now the image of the demons face began to form inexorably inside chups eyelids under his forearm that could not keep it out moving what did not seem to be a mouth it said she wishes to share with you as with one worthy of her her present power and glory and delight now whether he opened his eyes or shut them the demons face like some hideous afterimage remained the same power suddenly shakingangry chup raised his head and glared power is mine you say his enemies had not heard a groan or a complaint from him in half a year but now the fullness of his bitterness burst out then show me that i have just the power to move my legs can you do that below the monstrous face the darkness worked and there appeared a pair of hands roughly manlike but deformed and huge they were visible in the light that sprang out when a cover was removed from an object held in one of them it was a large thick goblet or bowl dark itself but holding a bursting warmth of multicolored light that glow seemed to eat away the darkness and to halfobliterate the demons image and yet it did not dazzle when chup looked directly at it the demons free hand reached for chup he uttered an involuntary grunt but did not feel the repulsive contact he expected there was only an impersonal force that spun his body halfway round like a log now he lay face down with his dead feet still pointed at the demon on his back right in the old unhealthy wound where mewicks hatchet had bitten at his spine chup now felt a cold touch as of icy water a moment later there followed something some kind of shock that might have been pain of terrible intensity but was ended so quickly that even the timidest man could scarcely have cried out when that clean shock had passed chup realized that it had burned away the nagging gnawing that had lived in the wound almost since it was made before he could think beyond that point or speak the next change came a daz zling tingling down the great nerves of both thighs auto matically he tried to move the legs that had been quite in sensible still they would not stir it was long months since those wasted shrunken muscles had contracted save for painful and uncontrollable twitchings but even now he felt those muscles try with his arms he turned himself again upon his back the demon withdrawn slightly was recapping the vessel from which it seemed to have poured out his healing warmth and light vanished chup again faced only a distorted presence dim in darkness the only sounds in the hovel were those of rain and autumn wind and chups lonely ragged breathing that now gradually grew steadier is this a true healing he asked at length and then why have you done it a true healing sent to you by your bride that you may come to her oh why then she is very gracious chup could feel the coursing we down to his toes he tried them but they were still too stiff to move he did not dare accept this miracle as true not yet she is full of unexpected kindness come messenger i am no child this is some prank or what does she need me for with the speed of a blow the demonface came looming over him he was chup but he was no more than human he could not with all his will keep from turning his head away and lifting up an arm as if to ward a blow his stomach that had never troubled him before a fight or on a weekold battlefield of unburied men now knotted in a retching spasm his eyes clenched uselessly upon the demon image looking through their lids unhurriedly the voice of dry leaves scraped at him i am not to be mocked lord though you were and lord you are to be not to be called messenger in insolence much less shall you scorn those who sent me here those of course charmian herself was no magician to have the ordering of demons she would as she had before have charmed a wizard or two into helping her with what ever scheme she played at the demon would not let him think he was to be punished for his disrespect he had the sensation that the demon was starting to peel away the outer layers of his mind with no more effort or concern than a man toying with an insect they could change men if it kept on it would turn him into something far less than a cripple unless they really needed him he cried out he could not think he was chup but he could not stand against an avalanche you are not to be mocked he whispered through clenched teeth nor are your masters to be scorned the effortless onslaught faded when he was master of his eyes again and made himself look there was nothing to be seen but the bearable dim face the demon then began impersonally to tell him why he was needed among the forces of the west now gathering in this castle there is a peasant youth named rolf born here in the broken lands there could have been more than one fitting that descrip tion but chup had no doubt who was meant i know him short and dark tough and wiry that is his appearance with him he now carries al ways and everywhere a thing that must be taken from him it must be brought to the lady charmian and to no one else in the black mountains and soon when the youth goes with his army into battle what we seek may well be destroyed or lost here the power of the west is too strong for me or any other to take the thing by force stealth must be used what is it a small thing in size a woven knot made from a wom ans yellow hair a charm of the kind that men and women use when they seek from one another what some of them call love yellow hair charmians own he waited in silence for the demon to go on it rasped tomorrow your legs will bear your weight and soon they will be strong enough for battle or running you are required to get this charm before the western army marches they may move any day and bring it to your lady men in her service will be patrolling in the desert a few kilometers to the east and watching for you beyond that you must expect no further help the hugeness of the demons face was growing less chup saw how far the space beneath his slanting roof had stretched now it was coming back the dry voice too was fading i will not come to you here again except to punish you for failure and then the face and voice were gone the hovel and the darkness that it held were still and ordinary the wind outside went howl ing loud again chup lay without moving until it had be come an ordinary sound burdened with no more than the rain the rain and clouds rare here on the very edge of desert made late the first entry of the mornings light into the long and crowded barrackroom that occupied one whole side of the ground level of the castle rolf woke when all was still in darkness round him the familiar jumble of packs equip ment weapons and bunks and hammocks with their load of snoring bodies he who had roused him without touch or word stood at the foot of rolfs bunk a tall and bulky figure in the gloom loford what and then rolf guessed what had brought the wizard to him my sister is there something there may be something we can learn come loford turned away he looked the part of a warrior rather than a wizard until you saw his clumsiness rolf was into his clothes and had caught him up before loford had started up the stair outside the barracks door as they climbed together the rising turns of stone toward the castles roof the wizard explained in a low voice my brother has arrived as we expected he is speaking much of technology and how we may be able to use it of course i mentioned your experience and your handiness along that line he was interested i told him also how i have tried with my poor spells to find out what happened to your sister beside my brother i am a backwoods dabbler any way we have tried a thing or two together working through the night certain powers that i never could have com manded he has called up and set to work understand the answer we get may be incomplete or or it may not be one that i want to hear they started up the last steep stair leading to the battlemented roof still i thank you and your brother it will not be your fault if the news is bad now at last they stood atop the flat paved roof of the castles single modest tower rolf pulled his jacket tighter against the drift of dying rain and through habit without thinking made sure that something in his jacket pocket was safe he was a little less than average height and at seven teen no doubt nearly done with growing taller his hands and feet were large and his face under wild black hair looked intent rather than either handsome or illfavored the wiry leanness of his adolescence was filling out to some degree with solid active weight mist hung like wet garments round the tower it made an excellent lookout post during the day but there was no sentry here in this hour before the dawn a green unearth ly looking fire glowed in a brazier on a tripod near one battlement beside it a single figure stood in wizards robes motionless looking out and away into the rainy night across the chesthigh barrier of stones loford raised one finger to his lips then led rolf forward the green fire flared up once and the waiting figure turned the light was such that rolf could not well judge the face of lofords brother but he was tall and spare of build he held out his hands a little from his sides fingers moving as if testing some invisible quality of the air arrayed on the paved roof around him rolf now saw were some of the things that good magicians sometimes used the fruits and flowers of autumn what might be water and milk in little jars small heaps of earth and sand plain wooden twigs both bent and straight the green unsteady light had changed them all but they looked innocent and simple still lofords brother rolf still had not heard him named conveyed somehow by turn of head or hand perhaps that rolf should come to stand beside him rolf moved to do so still keeping silence as he had been signed to do as soon as he stood beside the wizard looking out across the battle ment in the direction from which the rain was drifting east he saw the clouds and tendrils of lethargic mist speed faster in a moment it seemed as if he stood upon the prow of a racing ship of stone somehow driving into a gale a holder full of the wizards flowers came toppling inward from the parapet to make a tiny smash rolf put out his hands and gripped the stone before him the man beside him slowly raised one long lean arm and pointed with it nearly dead ahead just at that point the driving mist flew faster became a gray smooth blur that was not mist and then tore soundlessly from top to bottom rolf peered into the opening leaned into it and then for him the wind and rain were gone a vision engulfed him while it seemed that he hung bodiless in space it was a forest clearing that he saw fresh with the greenery of spring or early summer a place completely familiar to him that he had never thought or hoped to see again the trees the open grass and garden a path a simple small dwelling of thatch and poles the vision was utterly silent but it held life and movement sun and shadow shifting with a breeze fowl strutting in their little pen beside the house and now in the shaded doorway a dun figure moved and rolf as in a nightmare knew that his legs could not impel him forward his voice could not cry out a warning there was his mother in the doorway one hand with a gesture he had seen a thousand times wiping itself on her familiar ragged apron the other hand she raised to shade her eyes as she looked outward past rolfs disembodied viewpoint she would be looking toward the road and now a stiffening of her body showed alarm rolf did somehow cry out then as in a nightmare knowing and enduring the worst before it happened his mother heard him not but someone disembodied too or at least invisible was gripping his arms speaking with lofords kind of roaring whisper in his ear it is all written it is all unchangeable what happened then they cannot see or hear you you can only watch and learn his mother hurried inside the house and shut the use less door it was all more than half a year past he had thought himself healed and scarred but now he did not know how he could watch any more but he must watch he must find out if lisa his sister was still alive and he must learn who they were the ones who came soldiers of the east of course but rolf wanted their faces and their names there in the foreground of the vision now the first of them appeared a mounted trooper wearing black and bronze his back to rolf slowly and alertly he rode toward the house and behind him came another and another the beginning of a mounted line rolfs father on that day lay in the house helpless his foot mangled while doing forced labor on the oppressors roads lisa had been at home rolf himself when the soldiers came had been plowing in a distant field all un aware there were six of the soldiers now still on their riding beasts they made a semicircle before the peasants door the mouths of some of them were wide with soundless shouts or laughter their weapons were held ready and now the door was opening rolfs mother standing there again he watched until his mother turned and tried to flee and then he could not look he shut his eyes and floated in a void but could not flee the thought of what was happening at length there came what must be lofords hand huge and unseen to clamp his chin and shake his head trying to force him now to see rolf saw when he looked that the flimsy peasants hut had already been contemptuously kicked to bits in its small ruin he knew were the bodies of the mother and father for the son to find when he came running home and here was lisa twelve years old her long hair still bound neatly up in peasant style but her garments now torn and smeared as limp and pale as death she had been hoisted awkward ly before the saddle of a soldier the marauders were almost ready to leave it seemed wiping blades and straightening clothing he who carried lisa must be their officer for he alone wore halfarmor and he rode the tallest steed turn ing his mount now out of the yard toward the road he showed rolf his youthful unlined and harmlesslooking face there was a soft proud almost pouting look about the mouth he turned back in the saddle to urge his men then came on now seemingly only a bodys length from rolf he glanced down once indifferently at the still body of the girl he carried they would not have bothered to carry her off if she were dead or dying alive so choked was his throat rolf had to try twice to speak intelligibly is she still alive now will i find her he heard loford at a little distance murmuring some thing first low then more insistently rolf understood that his question was being passed on the vision meanwhile faded to a shifting blur of fog and light then loford brought back the answer which he whispered to rolf slow ly and not like one who understood she lives you must get help from the tall broken man what who lofords silence seemed to say that no further reply was possible was loford or anyone with him anymore rolf drifted bodiless and alone but he would not be quieted not yet then what of those who took her he demanded there were six soldiers of the east in ekumans black and bronze how many of them still breathe coherence returned to the forms that moved before rolfs sight the scene had changed he now beheld a portion of a simple unpaved road turning through that same green wooded land rolf recognized the place as one near where his home had been at first there was no one in sight a trooper in bronze and black not the officer came riding abruptly into rolfs field of view the man rode easily looking back toward his fellows and he laughed or per haps he shouted or only yawned the vision was still silent and the mans cheeks and eyes and nose were gone his jaws of weathered bone gaped showing missing teeth what might have been dried leather clung in odd fragments to his skull and to his skeletons hands but his garments were still as taut as if there were solid flesh inside to fill them out and he rode as jauntily as if he were a living man his collar stretched to compass a thick neck where there was nothing but a stack of vertebrae rolf understood that he was an swered as regarding this mans present fate the second trooper hove into view astride his beast he grinned for he too was a skeleton but did not laugh as if he knew his doom he rode slouched forward in a some how morose and sulky attitude good grounds he had for peevishness straight before him bobbing weightlessly there extended the long handle of a farmers pitchfork the long tines vanished in his tunics front came out again as fine sharp points protruding from his back rolf had one third his answer now the third man next appeared and he wore flesh upon his bones and breathed but only in a vision could anyone so ill and wasted sit on a beast and ride his eyes rolled vacantly and now rolf saw that a savage wound had cracked his skull the surface gash had healed leaving a long twisty scar along the scalp marked by a streak of grayness in the hair but it was plain from the mans appearance that the damage done inside the head had never healed and never would the fourth man came a skeleton with no hand bones depending from his sleeves perhaps someone had fore stalled rolf by taking revenge on this man for some other crime and he had bled to death when they were finished lopping him or he might have survived his wounds how ever they had been suffered and fled with other of ekumans people to the east there to discover no one could be both ered feeding him and now here came the fifth man riding jauntily a hatchet buried in his fleshless skull the overthrow of the eastern power in the broken lands had taken heavy toll the tallest beast came last with lisa still carried living but unconscious before the saddle rolf saw with a shock that she was changed her ragged garments and her body looked the same and her dark brown boundup hair but her face had been transformed from its familiar homeliness to beauty that awoke an echo from rolfs dream and made him catch his breath this was the girl whom he had called his sister yet it was not he called her name out once and then fell silent marveling her captor too was live and whole his fullfleshed image with its proud bored face watched indifferently the ghastly capering before him of his slaughtered men does he live then rolf demanded of the air he will be slain and he will live he thought the answer came loford the vision was suddenly spinning before rolf like a reflection in a whirlpool he staggered drew in a deep breath and found himself firmly in his own body once more standing on the solid castle stone leaning with numbed hands against a crenelation loford and lofords brother were close beside him and the light of day had come to make the green fire ghostly dim the last torn ribbons of the fog were swirling far above them now borne by what seemed no more than a natural wind a wizards or a statues face that of lofords brother lined but somehow ageless came looming over rolf call me gray the statue said you will understand i cannot casual ly use my real name how is it with you with me how would it be did you not see then rolf felt lofords grip upon his arm and fought to calm himself i am sorry i give you thanks and ask your pardon gray i grant it gray said solemnly rolf turned from one of the wizards to the other she lives then but where tell me could he still have her with him the one who took her i do not know said gray you heard the only guide that we were given to further information get help from the tall broken man i expect that will prove decipherable to you i am not sure what powers we reached today but at least they were not definitely evil and i would tend to trust them though they were strange it seemed to me i spoke with one who held the lightning in his hands be that as it may however get help from the tall broken man a little later rolf stood on the tower alone save for the sentry who had come with day to scan the desert while he was deep in thought gazing out over the complex crowded courtyards of the castle rolf saw a familiar figure by the newly rebuilt main gate in the outer wall dragging crippled legs out of a beggars leanto a broken man who once was tall after the day of battle in which the castle and the broken lands it dominated had passed from east to west chup had lain for days near death when it became apparent that he was not going to die he had been placed under close guard by the new masters of the land thomas and other lesser leaders of the west had come many times to question him chup had told them nothing they had not tried to force answers from him new to revolution and to power they probably were not sure what questions needed answers nor what information chup was likely to possess in fact he could not have told them much of any use he knew little of som the dead of zapranoth the demon lord and of the beastlord draffut the powers of the black mountains two hundred kilometers distant across the desert they were the powers of the east that the men of the broken lands and the other newly freed satrapies must fear and must eventually defeat if they were to retain their freedom chup unlike most others of his rank in the eastern hierarchy had never formally pledged himself to the east never passed through the dark and littleknown ordeals and ceremonies he had never visited the black mountains a few of the free folk as the successful western rebels in the broken lands did sometimes call themselves had perhaps been willing to show some mercy to a fallen enemy at least to one who had never been known to dabble in pointless cruelty himself perhaps for that reason chups life had been spared chup himself thought it more likely that after the physicians and the wizards had looked many times at the illhealing wound on his back had jabbed pins and burning sticks at his useless unfeeling withering legs and had decided that no herb nor surgeons knife nor wizards spell could ever mend what mewicks flashing hatchetblade had severed then the free folk of the west were quite content for him to live existence as a cripple among enemies should be a punishment worse than death so they let him go or rather one day they dragged him out of the cell in which he had been guarded explaining nothing to him they simply dragged him out and let him go in an outer courtyard when he was left alone he used his hands to drag himself somewhat farther when he got as far as the great new gate where the road came in through the massive outer wall he could see the empty distances the road ran to and found no point in trying to crawl on when chup had been sitting for half a day beside the gate preparing himself to starve there came one he had never seen before an old man to leave beside him a chipped cup with some water in it the old man having set this down as if he were doing something shameful and hardly looking at chup walked quickly on thinking it highly unlikely that anyone would trouble to poison him in his present state chup drank somewhat later a passing wagoneer perhaps a stranger looked down from his high seat perhaps saw only a beggar instead of a fallen enemy and tossed chup a halfgnawed bone chup propped his torso erect against the castle wall and chewed he had never been too finicky about his food when in the field turning his head to the right he could squint across two hundred kilometers of desert to a horizon dark ened by the black mountains even if he could somehow get there the east that he had served had little use for the crippled and the failed that was of course quite right and realistic fitting with the way the world was made where else a few kilometers to the west was the sea to north and south as here his former enemies were in power the village just below the castle was in ruins from the fighting but people were already moving back and rebuild ing the road here promised to be a busy one it seemed that if he must try to live on handouts he was not too likely to reach a better place than this by the night of that first day he had gathered scraps of wood and had begun to build his leanto near the gate on the morning after the demons visit chup had hie back in his legs before emerging from his shelter he had tested them gritting his teeth and laughing with the glorious pain of freely coursing blood and thawing muscles what ever the source of the healing magic it was extremely pow erful he could bend each knee slightly and move all his toes his fingers told him that the wound upon his back had shriveled to a scar as smoothly healed as any of his other battle marks now he must earn what the east had given him he knew them too well to think for a moment that the demons part ing threat of punishment for failure had been an idle one emerging at the usual hour from his shelter he took care to give no slightest sign that anything of moment had oc curred during the night the light drizzle was fading as he dragged himself to his usual station at one side of the great gate which had just been opened for the morning as usual he held in his lap his beggars bowl chipped pottery sal vaged from a dump his pride was too great to be destroyed by taking alms it had been easier because he had never been forced to really beg the weather had been good and food plentiful throughout the summer people came to look at him a lord humbled a villain punished a terrible fighter beaten people whom he never asked or thanked put in his bowl small coins or bits of food there were no other beg gars at the gate and not many in the land western soldiers maimed in the fighting were still being cared for as heroes and the others of the east of less importance than chup had evidently been slain to the last man sometimes people came to gloat silently or loudly at his downfall he did not look at them or listen they were no great bother the world was like that but he was not going to give them the satisfaction of dying starving or even showing discomfort if he could help it often it was the soldiers even those who had fought against him who gave him food and drink when they spoke to him civilly he answered them in the same way daily he dragged himself to get water at their barracks well inside a courtyard and only once was he hindered in doing so a pair of fat legs had come walking to stand with great deliberateness astride his way chup swinging along on his arms his own legs bound up beneath him on a pad of rags had stopped squinting up into the sun a fat soldiers face glaring down asked loudly if there was anything it could do for the great lord chup you might cease to block my pathway to the well there was no trace of crippling in chups voice you want water why we cant allow that no not a mighty lord like chup drinking out of the same well as lousy soldiers a mighty lord should have wine lets see now how can we get him some by that day chups arms had by serving him as legs re gained something of their old strength he considered that if he could get the right grip on the soldier he could pull him down and strangle him without strong legs it would probably be impossible to break his back of course the soldiers loitering companions watching silently might not continue to do so while the fat one was being killed but chup had little indeed to lose he was waiting patiently for his best chance to try for the grip he wanted when mewick came to stop the baiting mewick had a soft foreignly accented voice that some how contrasted with and yet suited his mournful hawk nosed face oh please good soldiers let us not have quar reling here and fighting it leads to injuries yes and pain and many sadnesses oh let us have no quarreling the soldier who had been trying to torment chup had not known who mewick was mewick had no battlehatchet with him at the moment and the fat one had probably not been here for the fighting he had started to say provoking things to mewick but some of his comrades had come to haul at him and whisper enlightening things he fell silent and let himself be pulled to some distance before he began to scowl again and tug aggressively at his belt mewick had stayed a little longer but chup had not bothered to look up again at his old opponent he had dragged himself on to the well and had gotten his drink as usual whether through luck or for some other reason he had not been bothered there again this morning chup had hardly taken his place beside the gate when he saw the youth rolf pacing across the outer courtyard toward him rolf stepped quickly but de liberately frowning at the puddles evidently on serious business yes he was coming straight toward chup the two of them had not spoken since chup was a lord and the other a weaponless rebel this visit today could not be co incidence the demon must have somehow arranged it chups chance was coming sooner than he had dared to hope rolf looking preoccupied halted a couple of meters away and wasted no time in preliminaries it may be you can tell me something that i want to know he began about a matter that is not likely to mean anything to you one way or the other of course ill be willing to give you something within reason in return for information not for the first time chup found himself somewhat taken with this youth who came neither bullying the cripple nor trying to be sly chup said my wants these days are few i have food and little need of anything else what could you give me i expect youll be able to think of something chup almost smiled suppose i did what must i tell you in return i want to find my sister speaking rapidly saying noth ing of his sources of information rolf described briefly the time and circumstances of lisas vanishing her appearance and that of the proudfaced officer chup scowled the tale awoke real memories a little hazy though they were better and better he would not have to invent what makes you think that i can tell you any thing i have good reason grunting in a way that might mean anything or nothing chup stared past rolf again as if he had forgotten him he must not seem at all eager to do business the silence stretched until rolf broke it impatiently why should you not help me i think you no longer have any great love for anyone in the east he broke off suddenly like one aware of blundering chup did not look up rolf in a slower voice went on your bride is there i know i didnt i didnt mean to say anything about her here was a peculiar nearapology chup looked up rolf had lost the aspect of a determined bitter man abruptly he had become an awkward boy speaking of a lady in the manner of one who cherished secret thoughts of her rolf stumbled on i mean she the lady charmian couldnt be harmed in any way by what you tell me of my sister or her kidnapper one of rolfs big hands rose per haps unconsciously to touch his jacket as if for reassurance that something carried in an inner pocket was safe i know you were her husband he blurted awkwardly and then ran out of words he stared at chup with what seemed a mix ture of anxiety hatred and despair i am her husband chup corrected drily rolf came near blushing or did blush it was hard to tell with his dark skin you are of course though chup loved best the sword he could use clever ness i am so in name only of course you and the rest of the west came breaking in the castle gates here before charmian and i could do more than drink from the same wine cup rolf looked somewhat relieved and utterly distracted now despite himself from the business that had originally brought him to chup he sat down facing chup he wanted needed to ask chup something more but it took much hesitation before he could get it out was she really i mean there have always been bad things said about the lady charmian things i cant be lieve chup had to conceal amusement which was a problem he had not faced in quite a while he managed though you mean was she as evil as they say chup looked very sober you cant believe all that you hear young one things were very dangerous for her in the castle though not as dangerous as they were for others living with her she had to pretend to be something different than what she truly was and she learned to dissemble very well rolf was nodding and seemed to some extent relieved it amused chup to have answered him with perfect truth so i have thought said rolf she seemed so beautiful yes so she could not have been like her father and the others of course chup thought suddenly understanding the boys monumentally innocent stupidity about the lady char mian he was befuddled by the lovecharm that he carried the same that chup would have to carry later however time enough then to cross that bridge rolf was saying more calmly nor were you i think as bad as ekuman and the others i know you were a satrap of the east oppressing people but you were not as vile as most of them the most gracious compliment i have enjoyed in some time chup rubbed a fleabitten shoulder against the cool damp stone of the sunless wall the moment seemed favor able to get down to business so you would like me to tell you where your sister may be found i cant much of rolfs original businesslike manner returned but you know something something that youll want to hear which is and since you are in earnest i will tell you what i want in return all right lets hear that first chup let his voice fall into a grim monotone if i can help it i do not want to die like this rotting by centimeters give me a rusty knife blade so i can at least feel like an armed man and take me out into the desert and leave me there the great birds are gone south on their migration but some other creature will find me and oblige me with a finish fight or let thirst kill me or a mirageplant but i am loath to beg myself to death before my enemies it came out quite convincingly he thought yesterday there would have been more truth in it than fiction rolf frowned why must it be the desert if you cant bear to live why not here no dying here would be giving in to you whove made a beggar of me out there ill have gotten away from you so long did rolf sit silent pondering that chup felt sure the bait was taken however the fish was not yet caught chup volunteered if you want to make sure of my finish bring along a pair of swords i think the chances would be somewhat in your favor ill tell you what i can about your sister before we fight if rolf was outraged by this challenge from a cripple he did not show it once away from the subject of charmian he was adult again again he was silent for a time watch ing chup closely then he said ill take you to the desert he paused if you lie to me about my sister or try any other sort of foolishness i wont leave you in the desert dead or living instead ill drag you back here dead or living to be displayed beside this gate chup keeping his face impassive shifted his gaze into the distance in a moment rolf grunted got to his feet and strode away chapter it was midafternoon before rolf came back leading a loadbeast the look of the animal suggested it might be a reject from the castle stable that could not be expected to give useful service in the coming campaign slung on the animal were several containers that might hold food and water rolf had also armed himself but not with two swords a serviceable sword and a long keen knife hung from separate belts cinched round his waist the time since morning had been an ordeal for chup testing his patience to the limit first of course because he was not sure his fish was wholly caught secondly the urge to move his legs had become almost overwhelming un der his ragged trousers their muscles were far looser and even seemed thicker than they had been yesterday the ache and tingle of returning life had turned into an itch for movement rolf coming back said nothing but halted his feeble looking animal just beside chup then he came to catch chup under the armpits and with wiry strength heave his halfwasted frame erect the gate sentries turned their heads to watch as did some passersby but no one seemed to care if chup departed he was a prisoner no more but only beggar once standing chup with his strong hands gripped the saddle and raised himself while rolf guided his dangling legs into the stirrups rolf asked are you going to be able to hang on there i wouldnt want you to fall and split your head not just yet i can manage and chup with his arms alone could keep his balance in the saddle he had forgotten how high one raised a man rolf took the loadbeast by the bridle and they were off down the sloping switchback road that led first to the village and then the world rolf walked with long strides beside the loadbeasts head a position that let him keep the corner of one eye on chup chup for his part breathed deeply with the joy of seeing the castle gradually recede behind him and the greater joy of surreptitiously testing his legs in the stirrups and feeling them respond before they reached the village rolf turned off the road he led the animal down a slope of wasteland to the be ginning of the desert the autumn day had cleared and had grown almost hot ahead of them gently rolling flat ness shimmered with mirage sparsely marked with vegeta tion it stretched on to the horizon where towered the black mountains jagged and enigmatic rolf had chosen the only direction which led quickly to solitude and was heading straight east from the castle men in the service of the lady charmian were to be patrolling in the desert that might or might not mean some help for chup he could not count on any neither chup nor rolf spoke again until the castle had fallen nine or ten kilometers behind them at this distance it plainly overlooked them still from its perch on the low flank of a mountain pass but the eastward of this point where they now were the lay of the land was such that a man going east could take advantage of declivities and brush and perhaps never see the castle or be seen from it again here rolf stopped the beast and still warily holding its bridle turned to chup tell me what you know and after that touching a water bag slung on the animal rolf said this ill leave with you and the knife the beast goes back with me of course you wont be able to get any where or to stay alive out here for very long but thats what you asked for chup was curious how do you plan to judge whether or not what i tell you is the truth you have no cause to seek revenge on me in particular rolf paused and i dont think you lie just for the sake of lying do harm just for the sake of doing it he let an other moment pass also i already know on good authority a few things more than what ive told you about what hap pened to my sister whatever you tell me should match with that chup nodded several times he had intended anyway to tell rolf the truth he could almost regret that rolf would not live long enough to benefit the name of the man you want is tarlenot chup said he served as an escort commander and a courier between the black mountains and outlying satrapies he may still whether he is still alive i have no idea what did he look like his face as you described it ive heard that women found him handsome and i think he shared their view he was young strong of middling height an uncommonly good fighter so ive heard rolfs face showed nothing and when did you see him last he might have had his questions on a written list i can tell you that exactly enough chup turned his face to the north remembering it was on the last night of my journey southward from my own satrapy coming here to the broken lands to take my charming bride i came traveling with considerable style and power rid ing a river barge down the dolles and escorted by two hundred armed men tarlenot with five or six going north ward met us on the last day before we reached the castle he and his troop being so few in unfriendly country were glad to spend the night in our encampment who or what was he escorting then rolf listening eagerly leaned just slightly forward but he was not near enough as yet for chup to lunge at him he was escorting no one perhaps he carried messages anyway he had with him one captive girl who might have been your sister as nearly as i can recall she must have been about twelve years old darkhaired i think ugly whether she had any closer resemblance to yourself i cant remember true she was not pretty rolf said eagerly he shook his head nor was she my blood relative what happened then i had other things to think about i remember tarlenot if i am not mistaken saying something about selling her in the north there was a tavernkeeper up there at a caravan serai chup stopped caught by a sudden thought why it conies back now on that night i dreamt and it was most odd i thought i wakened while all the men in the encampment even the sentries lay sleeping all around me the watchfires burned down low i dreamed i was awake but could not move tarlenot he moved and rose up from his blankets but i could see his eyes were closed and he was still asleep what happened then rolf was utterly intent but none the less alert and still no closer chup thought he might better have kept quiet about the dream it must sound like some devious lie or stalling tactic but now he had begun it i dreamt there came one from outside the firelight taller than a man and dressed in full dark armor that hid his face and all his body a great lord certainly but whether of east or west i could not say the earth seemed to sink down beneath his feet as stretched cloth would yield to the weight of a walking man he stood before the sleeping standing tarlenot and stretched out his hand toward yes toward where the girl must have been lying and the dark lord said what you have there is mine and you will dispose of it as i wish those were his words or very like them and tarlenot bowed like one accepting orders though his eyes remained closed in sleep then all became confused as in dreams it often does you know when i awoke it was morning the sentries were alert as they must have been all through the night the girl was still asleep and smiling that recalled to me my dream but then i forgot it again in the press of the days business the dream had been very vivid and the way he had for gotten and then remembered it was odd quite likely it had some magical importance for chup but what he asked the girl was not your blood relative you say who was she i call her my sister i thought of her that way seeing how intently chup leaned forward gripping the saddle rolf went on she was about six years old when she came to us the year i was eleven the armies of the east had not yet come to us but they were in the country to the south and people fleeing north sometimes passed along our road we thought lisa must have come from some such group passing through my parents and i woke up one spring morning to find her standing naked in our farmyard crying she could remember nothing not her name or how shed gotten there she could hardly talk but she had been well fed and cared for up till then my mother marveled that she had not a bruise or scratch you took her in chup would find out all he could from the young fool before he should come close enough of course i told you that was before the east had come upon us we had food in plenty we named her lisa for my true sister that had died as a baby rolf scowled running thin on patience why are you questioning me tell me what happened to her chup shook his head i told you what happened to her finally i do not know except for this when we separated in the morning tarlenot spoke no more of going north and selling his captive but of going east to the black mountains i of course came south with other things to think about weary of talking chup reached for the water bag and got a drink after probing chup with his gaze for a time rolf nodded i think if you were making up a lie you would make one that was more satisfying and believable and yet rolf hesi tated come if this tale just now was a lie tell me the water and the knife will still be yours and freedom what ever it may be worth to you out here no lie ive done my part of the bargain told you all i know chup gripped his left leg with his hands and pulled it free of the stirrup and then the right he made them dangle lifelessly come get me down another moment or two and this animal will fall beneath my weight swing yourself off with your arms said rolf ill hold its head chup had he been honestly trying might not have been able to manage getting off without using his legs which ever side he lurched toward one of his limp legs hooked over the saddle while the other dangled awkwardly in such a position that it was likely to be broken under him if he just let go and fell even a man seeking to be left alone in the desert to die would not like to start his ordeal with a broken ankle chup grunted shifted from one side to the other made his legs dead and appeared to be trying to get down the beast muttered and grew restive while rolf con tinued to hold its head at last rolf muttered impatiently ill lift you down still holding the bridle with one hand he stepped to the side of the animal opposite from where chup was dinging at the moment he freed chups leg so it would slide easily over the animals back then bridle still in hand he moved back around the loadbeasts head he found chup standing free rolfs moment of surprise was time enough for chup to halflunge halffall upon his victim chup learned in that first moment of real test that his legs were still far from their full strength they could do little more than hold him up but they had served him well enough for a moment and that moment was enough rolfs hand had moved quickly but still he had hesitated fractionally between drawing sword and dagger and by the time his choice had settled on the shorter blade it was too late chups hand was there to grip rolfs wrist and argue for the weapon grappling as he fell chup dragged the other down upon the sand the youth had wiry strength and two good legs he writhed and kicked and struggled but already lord chup had the grip he wanted on rolfs dagger arm rolfs tough arm muscles strained and quivered fighting for his life the lord chup with brutal power methodical and patient wore them down the captured arm began to bend it was near the breaking point before its hand would open and give the dagger up chup caught the weapon up reversed he did not want to kill rolf until he had made absolutely sure the charm was still with him if it was not rolf would have to tell him where it was he clubbed rolf along the skull with the butt of the knife and rolf went limp inside rolfs jacket in an inner pocket buttoned shut and holding nothing else chup found the charm no sooner had his fingers touched it than he snatched them back when he took it would it work on him as it seemed to have on this young clod turn him mistyeyed and doting over the treach erous woman whom he had wed for nothing but political reasons only briefly did he kneel there in hesitation there was no use worrying about it if he would be a lord once more he had no choice but to take the charm into his possession and carry it to the east the loadbeast decrepit and lethargic as it was had run off a few strides and was still stirring restlessly chup called to it in a soothing voice then he muttered the three brief defensive spells that sometimes seemed to work for him he was a poor magician and drew the coil of hair out of rolfs pocket he turned it over in his hands it was an intricately woven circlet of startling gold about the size to fit around a mans upper arm chup had no immediate feeling of power in it but obviously it was no mere trinket it was not dull or crumpled though an oaf had kept it in his pocket perhaps for half a year and had probably given it much secret fondling holding it chup did not doubt for a moment that it was charmians hair it brought her beauty sharply to his mind and he stood up swaying on his reborn legs gazing at the charm aye his unclaimed bride was beautiful whatever else men might say of her they never argued that char mians was the beauty made real that lonely men imagined in their daydreams he recalled now the ceremonies of their wedding there had followed half a year of death for him but now he was a man again eventually he took note of rolfs stirrings at his feet and tucked the charm into a pocket in his own rags and bent to put an end to his victim on chups stillunsteady legs it was a slow bending before he could complete it one of his victims feet was hooked behind his right ankle and the other came pushing neatly at the front of chups right knee the warriorlord had no more chance of remaining upright than a choppedthrough tree when he landed on his back he lay still briefly raging at his own foolishness while he pretended to be stunned pre tending did no good for the peasant was not fool enough to jump on him instead rolf was crawling and scrambling away dazedlooking but also plainly full of life chup strug gled erect and tried to hurry in pursuit but instead of lunging and pouncing he could only stumble on his traitor ous legs and fall again quickly he was up once more drawing his captured dag ger but rolf too was now on his feet facing chup sword drawn and pointed more or less steadily at chups midsec tion something he had almost forgotten began to grow in chup his old happiness of combat at least he observed you have learned how to hold a blade since last we fought rolf was not minded to talk or even listen his face showed how he too raged at himself for carelessness he lunged forward thrusting straight at chup in a wicked blur to chup his own response seemed horribly slow and rusty but still his hand had not forgotten what to do it came up of itself bringing the knife in an economical curve to meet the sword they clashed and the long steel sang shoot ing two centimeters wide of chups ribs then quickly the sword slid back to make a looping swing and cut chup saw it was coming downward toward his legs they had no nimbleness to save themselves he let himself drop for ward reaching down with his short blade to parry the stroke as best he could he caught the sword blade in the angle between hilt and blade of his dagger caught it and tried to pin it to the ground but rolf wrenched the sword away again rolf feinted twice before he struck again but there was not much skill in his pretense so chup had time to get back on his feet parrying the real cut even as he rose chup saw as they circled that the loadbeast was moving steadily away no help for that his eyes were locked on rolfs and both of them were breathing harshly so it went on for a little time with nothing said rolf would advance and strike or sometimes only feint chup parried and faked attacking in his turn with his short blade he could not very well attack a sword held by a determined foe if chup had had his strong legs he could have tried and might have won skipping back when the sword cut at him driving forward then at the precisely proper instant for striking without perfectly dependable legs it would be suicide a firstrate swordsman in rolfs place would have driven in on chup trying to stay just at the distance where the sword could strike but the dagger could not pounding one stroke upon another until at last the shorter blade must miss a parry though rolf was dangerous with a sword he was far from masterly chup watched and judged him critical ly rolf was evidently determined he was not going to be tricked again into rushing to too close quarters with the lord chup so he stood just a fraction of a meter too far away before he struck and he failed to press his attacks against his efforts the knife in chups hand could with a minimum of luck stand like a wall of armor rolf at last drew back a further step and dropped his sword point slightly perhaps he hoped to provoke chup into something rash but chup only dropped his own arms to his sides and stood there resting panting honestly his legs he thought were stronger than when the fight had started as if ex ercise were an aid to the demons magic but in the joy of fighting with health and strength and freedom come again he had no great wish to kill he said youngster come with me to the east follow and serve me and i will make you a warrior yes and a leader of warriors you have the guts for it though you yourself may never be a great one with the sword you have the guts and if you live long enough you may absorb a little knowledge the murderous determination frozen in the young face did not thaw for an instant instead rolf closed again and struck once twice three times with greater violence than usual the blades rang rang rang ah chup thought it was too bad a good man wasted as an enemy chup would have to kill him if he could the desert this near the castle must be patrolled should a squad of western cavalry appear that would be all for the lord chup and his ambition and his golden bride and too the sun was lowering suppose they kept on duelling here until nightfall to fight with blades in darkness was more like pitching coins than matching skills rolf circled round him now struck less frequently and ap peared to be thinking more it seemed that he was searching for the proper way trying strategies in his mind he might hit on the right one he would have the guts to try it if he decided it was best chup therefore had better get the initiative and soon how he would dare rolf anger him play on young impatience come here to me child and i will impart a little knowl edge just a little spanking is all that i intend come no reason for you to be so much afraid it seemed rolf was not even listening he was looking eastward now past chups shoulder and there was a change toward desperation in rolfs face chup carefully backed up a step to insure against surprises and took a quick glance behind him a thin cloud of dust rose from the desert a kilometer or more away and be neath the dust he glimpsed movement as of riders and he thought that the riders were garbed in black rolf too thought that he saw black uniforms and plain ly they were coming from the east chup had lowered his blade again at the same time stretching himself up to his full height his beggars rags were suddenly completely incongruous in a lofty and dis tant tone he said burrow into the sand young one rolfs thought like a cornered animal jumped wildly this way and that it would be hopeless in this barren country to try to run from mounted men the approaching riders now seemed to be coming straight on as if they had already spotted chup at least he stood quite tall and willing to be seen dont be an idiot hide i say bending low rolf scrambled around the nearest hum mock threw himself down there and dug himself as rapid ly and thoroughly as possible into the sand between two straggly bushes not much more than his head emerging amid roots and wiry stems was left unburied when he ceased his work and froze hearing hoofbeats near at hand looking out through his inadequateseeming cover over the top of the hummock he could see the head and shoulders of chup who stood facing away from rolf with chin held high and in that moment rolf felt a chill brush over him a shadow unseen by eyes yet deeper far than any simple lack of light something enormous and invisible brushed by him something that he thought was searching for him it missed him and was gone the many hoofbeats their makers still unseen by rolf had halted very near at hand dust came drifting above chup and now an unknown deep and weary voice called out and are you chup the former satrap i am the lord chup man where is it were you able to chup in his best commanding voice broke in and your name officer for a moment the only sound was the shifting of hooves then the deep tired voice said captain jarmer if it makes any difference to you now quickly tell me whether you jarmer you will provide me with a mount that beast you see wandering away there will not support me longer some of the mounts shifted their positions and now rolf could see the one he took to be the captain blackbearded scowling down at chup mounted beside the captain was one in wizards robes of iridescent black with the hump of some small beastfamiliar showing under the loose robes at the shoulder the wizard juggled something like a crystal in his cupped hands a facet of it winked at rolf with a sharp spear of the lowering sun again he felt the sense of something searching passing by chup in the meantime was continuing his debate with jarmer yes i have it and it is not your job to ask for proofs of anything but to escort me now the sooner you provide me with a mount the sooner we will be where all of us want to go there was a murmuring of voices chup vanished from rolfs view to reappear more fully a few moments later mounted well captain are there any more problems i must solve before we can be off a western army lies within that fortress and if theyve eyes theyve seen your dust by now but still the captain tarried exchanging glances with his wizard then he spoke to chup once more in the tones of one who knew not whether to be angry or obsequious had you no companion on your way out here from that castle my wise man here says his crystal indicates no companion that i mean to tarry for that ancient loadbeast mirages and a skulking predator or two un hurriedly but ending all delay chup turned his new mount to the east and dug his heels in the captain shrugged then motioned with his arm the wizard put away his jiggling piece of light the sound of hooves rose loudly for a moment then rapidly declined with the settling of the light dust they had raised rolf almost unbelieving watched and listened to them go letting out his heldin breath in little whiffs when the last sound of hooves had faded utterly he pulled himself out of the sand and looked the riders plume of dust was already distant in the east from which the night was soon to come turning back to face the castle he saw that some sentinel had too late given the alarm a heavy stream of beasts and men a mounted reconnaissanceinforce flowed from the castles main gate toward the desert rolf stood there numbly waiting for them he had been given back hope for his sisters life but robbed of something whose importance he had not understood until it was taken from him though in truth his feelings were more relief than loss as if an aching tooth had been pulled his hand re turned again and again to the empty pocket his head ached from the robbers blow ask help of the tall broken man why had grays powers told him that chapter on the first night of the long flight into the east there had been only brief pauses to take rest during the following day their toiling across the enormous waste of land seemed to bring the black mountains no closer jarmer during day light slowed down the pace somewhat pausing for long rests with posted sentinels chup at each stop slept deeply lying with his golden treasure beneath his body where none could reach it without waking him when he awoke he ate and drank voraciously till those of the blackclad soldiers who had been ordered to share provisions with him grum bled not too loudly when they looked him in the eye his legs grew stronger steadily they were not yet what legs should be to serve the lord chup properly but he could stand and move on them without expecting to fall down the second morning of the journey the sun was very high before it came in sight the black mountains of the east were tall before them now casting their mighty shad ows many kilometers out upon the desert clouds draped their distant summits seen from this near they were no longer black nor particularly forbidding what had given them the hue of midnight from a distance chup saw now to be the myriad evergreen trees that clothed the middle slopes like bluegreen twisted moss the troop with chup and jarmer riding at its head trav eled now upon a long slow rise of land by which the desert approached the cliffs already they were at a con siderable elevation above the middle of the desert the chain of peaks so near ahead now ran far on either flank to north and south and curved ambiguously from sight in both directions so chup was now hard put to guess how far the range might stretch straight ahead was one of the higherlooking peaks sheer cliffs rising to its waist now from somewhere on the table land above the cliffs it disgorged a dozen or so flying reptiles down to inspect the mounted troop they flew on laboring slow wings the air here must be high and thin for them and the season of their hibernation was approach ing looking more closely at the cliffs as he rode ahead chup saw that they were not after all a perfect barrier to them and into them a road went climbing switchback after switch back toward that road and halfhidden pass jarmer was leading his men and indeed the frayedout start or end ing of that climbing road seemed to be appearing now beneath the ridingbeasts hurrying hooves chup was observing all these matters with alert eyes and mind but with only half his thought a good part of his attention was focused inward upon a vision that had grown in his minds eye through the two long nights and single day upon the desert charmian the weight of the knot of his wifes hair swing ing in his pocket as the wind and motion of the ride swung his light and ragged garments seemed to strike like molten gold against his ribs he remembered everything about her and there was not a thing that made her less desirable he was the lord chup again and she was his the gradually steepening slope slowed down the tired rid ingbeasts the road they traveled empty of all other traffic veered abruptly away from the cliffs then toward them again on the first winding of the steep part of its ascent the cliff tops must be a kilometer above their heads chup drank again from the borrowed waterskin he had slung before his saddle his thirst was marvelous the water must be going he thought to fill out his recovering legs their muscles still seemed to be thickening by the hour though the speed of recovery was not what it had been at first he stood up in his stirrups now and squeezed the barrel of the beast beneath him with his knees the skin on his legs ached and itched stretching to hold the new live flesh some of the reptiles were quite close now swelling down ward from the sky on leather wings spread wider than chups arms and thick with graygreen scales they circled gliding drifting round the troop through their snouts and needleteeth they cawed and clamored an exchange with jarmer he told them he was bringing back a former satrap who had just escaped the west the bridegroom of the lady charmian jarmer said their black eyes bored at chup jarman said nothing to them of any golden charm they cawed again and rose laboriously to carry word ahead on the next switchback of the road the troop climbed past a slender ancient watchtower unmanned on this road where scouting reptiles perched and the defenders above held such advantage of position that it almost seemed an empty fort might turn an army back but in chups mind the slender tower was chiefly an evoking symbol of the slenderness of his bride again with another turning of the road the riders passed shabby dulleyed serfs at labor in a terraced hill side field among them were a few girls and women young enough to look young though they labored for the east but chups eyes passed quickly over them only searching for one who was not there who could not be but she was real somewhere ahead probably atop this mountain she had sent him health and power and she was she must be waiting for him oh he knew what she was like he remembered every thing not just the incredible beauty but what she was like no longer seemed to matter it was a long and arduous climb up through the narrow pass chup held as an article of faith that no fortress existed that could not be taken by siege surprise or treachery if not by direct attack but this one he would far rather hold than try to take if there was no easier way than this up through the cliffs as soon as they had reached the top men dismounted wearily chup among them and animals slumped to their knees to rest they faced a nearly horizontal tableland rugged and cracked by many crevices across this wound the road that they had followed up the pass and at its other side two or three hundred meters distant sprawled the lowwalled citadel of som the dead chup could not see much from here but several gates open in the outer rampart of gray stone it did not look particularly formidable as a defense there was no need for it to be a few earth works now unmanned stood right at the head of the pass where chup and his escort had stopped it needed no shrewd military eye looking back and down from here to see that a few men here could stop an army beyond the citadel the mountain went on up to lose its head at last within a clinging scarf of cloud this mountain unlike most of those surrounding was but little forested very little vegetation grew above the citadel but there the rock itself grew black the more chup looked up at that slope the better he perceived how odd it was on that dark dead surface was it perhaps metal instead of rock there were a few tiny even blacker spots that might be windows or the entrances of caves no paths or steps led to them they might be reptile nests but why so high above the citadel already at an altitude where the leatherwings had hard work to fly jarmer was standing beside him now looking forward as if halfexpecting some signal from the citadel the only movement there was of banners each black with stripes of other colors snapping briskly over the ramparts chup turned to him and asked i suppose that som the dead dwells there above the fort where all the signs of life are gone jarmer looked at him oddly for a moment then laughed by the demons no not som nor demons either quite the opposite thats where the beastlord draffut dwells you may meet him one day if youre lucky then worry replaced amusement i hope youre what you claim to be and what you bring is genuine you seem quite ignorant just bring me to my lady where is she shortly they were mounting up again and riding jarmer turned away from the largest gate set in the center of the gray stone wall and flanked with modest towers and chose a path that followed close beneath the wall round to the south flank of the citadel there a small gate was open just wide enough for the troop to enter in a single weary file still surrounded by frowning defensive walls they reached a stableyard where they dismounted giving their animals into the care of quickmoving dulleyed serfs scarcely had chup got his feet upon the ground when there came hurrying to him a man with the indefinable air of the wizard about him more powerfully by far than the one who had accompanied the patrol though this new comer had no iridescent robes and no familiar on his shoul der he was slight of build with a totally bald head that kept tilting from side to side on his lean corded neck as if he wished to view from two angles everything he saw this man caught chups ragged sleeve and in a rapid low voice demanded you have it with you that depends on what you mean where is the lady charmian the man did something like a dance step in his im patience the charm the charm he urged with voice held low its safe to speak trust me i am working for her then you can take me to her lead on the man seemed torn between his annoyance and satis faction at chups caution follow me he said at last and turned and led the way a series of gates were opened for them first by black garbed soldiers then by serfs with each barrier they passed the aspect of their surroundings grew milder still the upper half of the mountain black and enigmatic steadily looked down on them from almost straight above but now chup followed the wizard along pleasant paths of flagstones and of gravel across terraces and gardens bright with autumn flowers and fragrant with their scent they passed a garden er a bentleg cripple with a face like death pulling himself with wracking hurried effort along the path upon a little cart his implements before him the last barrier they came to was no wall but a tall thorny hedge chup followed the bald wizard through a gateless opening they came upon a garden patio built out from a low stone building or from one wing of it chup could not see how far the house extended here was the grass thicker and better cared for than before and the flowers between a pair of elegant marble fountains brighter and more numerous by now the day was well advanced the sun come round the mountains bulk it made a flare and shock of gold of charmians hair as she rose from a divan against the wall to greet her husband her gown was gold with small fine trimmings of dead black her grace of movement was in itself enough for him to know her by her beauty filled his eyes and nearly blinded him my lady his voice was hoarse and dry then he remembered and regretted that he stood before her in the rags and filth of half a year of beggary my husband she called out in tones an echo of his own mingled with the tinkling of the fountains it was her voice as he had dreamed of it through all the lonely nights but no he had not dreamed of her why not he frowned never mind he shook his head to clear his eyes and now he saw her beauty plain and for a moment could not speak my husband chup the very sunlight was not brighter nor more joyful than her voice and in her eyes he read what all men want to see her arms reached out ignoring all his filth he had taken three steps toward her and would have run if he could the remaining distance when his feet were pulled out from under him and the world in the form of a rough gravel path came smiting up to strike him in the face he heard a shriek of laughter and from the corner of his eye saw a dwarfish figure spring up and flee away from a concealing bush beside the path trailing howls of glee the unthinking speed in his arms had slapped out his hands in time to break his fall and save his chin and nose gaping up now at his bride he saw her beauty gone not taken away or faded but shattered in her face like some smashed image in a mirror it was her hateful rage contorted her face so how well he knew that look and how could he have forgotten it she glared her rage at him as he regained his feet she screamed out her shrewish filth and hate how often he had heard it in the brief days he had known her before their marriage ceremony he had not been the target then of course she would not then have dared now why was she screaming all this abuse at him it neither hurt nor angered him he had no intention of striking her or shouting back she was his bride infinitely beautiful and desirable and he would have her and she must not be hurt yes yes all that was settled it was simply annoying that he had for some reason completely forgotten this side of her character she was screeching at him filth carrion did you ever doubt i would repay you triply for it for what he asked deliberately a vein of anger stood out in her lineless forehead for a moment she could not speak then in a choking voice not unlike a reptiles caw for striking me a tiny drop of spittle came far enough to strike his cheek the touch of it was to him a warm and lovely blessing i struck you why that was mad ridiculous how could she think but wait wait ah yes he remembered he nodded you were hysterical when i did that he said absently trying to brush the dust from his rags i did it for your good actually i only slapped you with my open hand not very hard you were hysterical much as you are now at that she cried out with new volume and alarm she backed away toward a doorway that led into the building from a gap between hedges there came running three men in servants drab clothes one of them was quite large to gether they ran to make a wide barrier between him and his lady take him away she ordered in a soft and venomous voice regaining most of her composure we will amuse ourselves with him later she turned quickly to the bald wizard who was still hovering near hann you have made sure he has it with him have you not he tilted his head i have not yet had that opportunity my lady i have it chup interrupted them your lady wizard no shes mine and i have come to claim her he stepped forward and saw with some surprise that the three fools in his way stood fast they saw only his dirt and rags and perhaps they had seen him fall when he was tripped he scorned to draw his knife for such as these he heeled an ugly nose up with his left hand and swung his right fist into the stretchedup throat below it one man down he grabbed a reaching hand by its extended thumb and broke bone with one wrenching snap he had only one opponent left this third and largest fellow had got behind chup in the meantime and got him in a clumsy grip but now with his fellows yelping and thrashing about in helplessness the lout realized he was alone and froze i am the lord chup knave let go he said it quietly standing still and he had the feeling that the man would have done so if he had not feared charmian more than chup instead the big slave cried out hoarsely and tried to lift chup and throw him they swayed and staggered together for a moment before chup could shift his hips aside and snap a fist behind him low enough for best effect now he was free to turn once more to claim his lady she once more howled for help the wizard hann hauled out a short sword from under his cloak most magic was un reliable when violence was right at hand and threw him self between chup and his bride but hann was not the equal of the last swordsman chup had faced and chup was stronger now than then hann dropped his good long blade and fell down screaming when he felt the knife caress his arm before he saw it move this time however charmian did not resume her noise making nor did she try to flee instead she stood with bright eyes smiling past chups shoulder he heard a foot crunch gravel there behind him on the path it was tarlenot who stood there he had already drawn his sword at sight of the lawn littered with writhing groaning men his eyes were fixed on chup in puzzlement but they lighted unpleasantly in recognition as chup turned round to face him tarlenot was not a tall man but power ful and long of arm his short pink tunic showed bare legs as muscular as chups had been in his days of full strength around his thick neck was clasped a thin collar of some dark plain metal a strangely poorlooking thing for one to wear who was otherwise garbed luxuriously tarlenots face was haughty now more so than chup remembered the countenance of a pouty child grown big and muscular his hair fell with a slight curl round his ears he nodded his head lightly in recognition to chup and gave him a little smile but he made no move to sheathe his sword tarlenot said charmians ethereal and tender whisper make this one a gardener for us chup bent and picked up the sword dropped by the wizard hann who still sat moaning bleeding lightly on the flagstones the sword seemed stout enough though its twisted fancy hilt was not much to the liking of chups eye it did feel better than it looked that is no gardeners tool tarlenot observed and here we do not need another lord charmian giggled quietly at them tarlenot his legs have grown too straight bend his knees for him we will get him a little cart and he will tend our flowers chup sighed faintly and moved a step farther from his lady it was hard when the woman you were devoted to might stick a knife between your ribs she was his bride and the only woman he wanted but there would be no trusting her tarlenot he called out watching and waiting while the other made up his mind one questioned me about you only a few days ago oh in what connection the mind had been made up first though would you rather i only cut your tendons or took your legs clean off they say that useless limbs are worse than none at all you should know is it so he was one who meant to do things to you that you would not like chup stepped slowly and easily forward now he will never have his chance his legs were working very well but he could have wished to give them their first real test in practice he raised his blade as he ad vanced and tarlenots sword came up in a motion quite gentle and controlled and with a careful metal touch the duel was joined with the first preliminary touches and feints chup knew that he had met a formidable enemy and one cautious enough not to be deceived by chups scarecrow appearance into taking the scarecrow lightly and when chup had to make a really quick hard parry for the first time he realized there was no great endurance left in his own body long underfed but newly healed and just finished with a long ride tarlenot on the other hand was fresh and vigorous had it not been for the residual effect of the healing elixir fading now though the good work it had done remained chup might have been quickly beaten his muscles were left aching and quivering by two or three exchanges at full power and speed now he also knew beyond doubt that tarlenot was very good that the first small slip against him would very likely be the last they circled slowly on the gravel path and flagstones and felt for cautious footing amid the flowers between the tinkling fountains chup as he turned saw charmian pass within his range of vision he saw her with a gesture stay her other attendants now running up from any interference he saw how bright her eyes were and the expectant parting of her perfect lips she would take the winner but only to use him and discard him when it was to her advantage or merely suited to her whim chup knew that if tarlenot perhaps did not but she was chups and then in front of her face came tarlenots visage powerful composed and proud let me see said tarlenot if i can hit the old wound on your spine within a fin gers breadth how was it done like this and he at tacked chup parried desperately and riposted his weary arm thrust wide not like that no he said but with some skill demons and blood but he was tired and tarlenot knew it must have counted on it to some degree from the start was now carefully making sure that chups tremulous nearexhaustion was no sham now that tarlenot had measured chups reach and something of his style he began to push the fight harder harder till he himself began to puff now chup gave ground steadily as they circled sheer desperation kept him going now he might back into a cor ner he saw before him the gardener on his cart with lifeless eyes no he was the lord chup and he would win or die and just then tarlenots sword came flicking in a little faster than before chup saw the danger but his weary tardy arm could not make the parry quite in time and he felt the hot bite of the wound along his side with that hurt there came before chup all the blackness of the past half year all of it seemingly alive before him in the person of his foe the hurt was rage the rage was fuel the only hope and power he had left he let his fury drive him forward striking fast and hard stroke after stroke and then he staggered halting he feigned a final exhaustion before his ultimate reserve of energy was quite gone tarle not with triumph too early on his face came thrusting in as chup had thought he would chup parried that thrust and spent his final strength in one last blow straight over hand cleaving downward at the angle of his enemys shoul der and neck the sword touched glancingly the blackish metal collar and then bit down through garments flesh and bone he saw tarlenots eyes bulge out and the red fountain leaping from the wound clear down to the breastbone chups sword smote and tarlenot was driven to his knees and then fell backward dead his arms flung wide chup found the strength to set his foot upon the ruined tunic that had once been silken pink and wrench to get his sword blade from the riven chest he staggered back then and by instinct got his back against a wall he leaned there choking while the world grew gray and dim before him with the throbbing of his heart as if it were his own blood pud dling up the walk but no he was not bleeding much his searching fingers told him that the cut along his side had parted little more than skin charmian but she was gone that was all right let her play any game she wanted but he was going to have her now as soon as he had rested for a bit a sound made him turn but there was nothing to see but a small mob of dumblooking lackeys goggling timidly at him from a dis tance the odd sound did not emanate from them from where then straight up a flying reptile had emerged from one of the windowlike openings that marked the mountains dead black upper slope it was winging down toward where chup stood but not on reptiles wings he realized its rounded headless body considerably bulkier than a man hung be neath a speedblur such as the wings of hummingbirds drew in the air but this blur was a thin horizontal disc a spin ning not a vibration up and down the noise it made growing now into a whining roar was like no sound of life that chup had ever heard the thing came rushing almost falling down toward the garden where chup stood plum meting faster than could a reptile or a bird the body be neath the blur looked dead and rigid chup pushed himself away from the wall he had seen before something of the magic that the old world had called technology and he knew well the hopelessness of fighting with a sword against machines he moved toward the doorway beside charmians empty divan the flying thing looked too big to get in there but before chup reached the door the wizard hann was coming out to meet him not as a foe but wel coming with a flushed maidservant skipping beside him awkwardly trying to finish tying a bandage on hanns arm the lady charmian sends you greetings then hann noticed the flying machines approach and chups atten tion to it no no lord chup do not concern yourself it is not a fighting device put up your sword come in the lady charmian greets you as i said and expresses her apologies for all of this unfortunate she will soon receive you you have the golden charm with you i trust she begs you let her maidens tend you now when you are rested and refreshed chup was not really listening as he went on with hann inside the door which was too narrow for that flying blur to pass anyway the machine was not coming to chup instead it descended close beside the corpse of tarlenot where he lay half on gravel half on grass just above the ground the flyer hovered while the shining whirl of speed on top roared down a blast of air a wind that pressed down bushes kicked up dust and rippled grass along the head less metal body there stood symbols meaningless to chup valkyrie mark v th field hospital battalion in another moment the rounded metal body opened six secret holes three on a side and from them came extending hidden legs sliding jointed things like insects feelers grown monstrously large these reached for tarlenot and probed him one delicate legtip clinging to the dull metal collar beside the great leaking leer of his wound then suddenly and effortlessly with its slender legs the flying thing gath ered up tarlenots dead weight drew it up and swallowed it into a coffinsized cavity that gaped suddenly in the metal belly and as suddenly closed again the six legs retracted also and in that same moment the old world thing shot upward once again roaring a louder noise and blasting the garden with a greater rush of air it raced up toward the place whence it had come it turned insectsized again and vanished into one of the windows where accord ing to jarmer the beastlord draffut dwelt chup had stepped outside again and remained gaping upward until prompted by hanns diplomatic voice when you have rested and refreshed yourself lord chup and dressed in finer garments your lady waits to see you lowering his eyes chup found a quartet of serving girls approaching all were young but ugly his lady preferred her servants so he knew to heighten by contrast her own beauty the four girls carrying towels and garments and what might be jars of ointment advanced very slowly looking almost too frightened to put one foot before another chup nodded he would have to relax his guard some time i would put down this sword that i have won but i seem to have no scabbard for it hann hastened to amend the lack unburdening his own waist wincing when he moved his wounded arm here take all indeed i think i am well rid of it let the shoemaker stick to his last when he had wiped and sheathed his sword chup let the servants of charmian lead him along a short path into another garden and from that into another wing of the same low sprawling building that charmian had entered he could not yet see its full extent perhaps all of soms court lived in its separate apartments in a luxurious room the servants stripped away chups filthy rags and tended the light cut along his side with what seemed ordinary oint ments not the demons cure the girls fear of him abated rapidly and by the time they had immersed him in hot water in a sunken marble tub they were talking almost freely back and forth among themselves to serve anyone but charmian would be a relaxation and a pleasure he thought after serving her he set the lovecharm of springy golden hair upon the twisty hilt of his captured sword and set both close beside him as he soaked and washed and soaked again he was too weary to give the least thought to his attendants or anyone else as females amid their nervous chatter though he caught their names portia with the blackest skin and hair that he had ever seen and a bad scar on her face kath blond and buxom with eyes that looked in different ways lisa shortest and youngest nothing quite right about her looks lucia shaped well enough except for her huge mouth and teeth samantha and karen looking like sisters or even twins with sallow skins pimples and hair that looked stringy though it was bound up in peasant style like that of the four other girls when portia and kath had finished scrubbing his back lisa and lucia poured on rinse water and samantha and karen held for him a robelike towel when he had been clothed in rich garments karen and lucia fed him soup and meat and wine between mouthfuls he touched the golden charm safe now in an inner pocket of his tunic of soft black he only tasted the wine for al ready sleep hung like weighty armor on his eyelids where is my lady he demanded is she coming here or must i go to her there was a moments hesitation before kath with no ticeable reluctance answered if my lord permits i will go and see if she is ready to receive you at this the other girls relaxed perceptibly his weariness was great and he reclined on a soft couch though he had much to think about his eyes kept closing of themselves keep talking he ordered the five girls you there do you sing and lisa sang and karen fetched out an instrument with strings the music that they made was soft you sing quite well and easily chup said for one who serves the lady charmian how long have you been her servant the girl paused in her song for half a year my lord since i was brought to the black mountains and what were you before she hesitated i do not know forgive me lord my head was hurt my memory is gone sing on and then he was waking with a start the golden charm clenched in his hand inside his pocket it seemed that no long time had passed for the sun still shone outside and the young girls still made their soft music his tiredness was like the hands of enemies gripping all his limbs but he could not rest until he had made sure of her at the very least seen her once again he arose and walked out of the building into the garden under the upper mountains looming bulk on legs that pained but could not rest he paced the paths and lawns emptied now of men and cleaned of signs of violence he entered the building where she had gone in in a narrow passage he caught a whiff of perfume that woke old memories clamoring and at a little distance heard charmians wellremembered laugh he put aside a drapery some distance inside a vast and elegantly female room charmian sat on an elaborate couch she was facing chup expectantly though his coming had been soundless the man who sat there with her facing her had fair hair that fell with a slight curl around his ears his long strong arms emerged from the short sleeve of a lounging suit of black and pink as this man arose turning toward chup the wary pouting eyes of tarlenot chup could do nothing but stand frozen in the doorway marking well the scar wide and long but neatly healed that ran down from the joining of neck and shoulder to vanish on the hairy chest ran down from just below the metal collar that bore a little shiny spot left by a sword chapter the army of the west lay camped for the night a days march to the northeast of the castle of the broken lands around them the plain was no longer a true desert but a gentle sea of sparse grass now drying and dying before the approaching winter once men had grazed the flocks of peacetime here but that was long ago thomas now had with him more than four thousand men all holding in common a hard hatred of the east the ranks of his own fighters of the broken lands had been greatly swollen by volunteers from mewicks country and others in the south from the offshore islands and from the north beasts in the early evening the camp murmured with the feed ing of the army and the digging of temporary defenses for the night with the hundred matters of organization and re pair that must be tended to before the second days march inside thomass big tent were crowded the score of men he had called into a meeting the first matter that thomas raised with them was the golden charm and its sudden departure to the east that the charm was magic of great power was obvious to all and none blamed rolf for having fallen so deeply under its influence that he had not spoken of it during the long months since he had found it while it forced him to cherish secret thoughts of a woman he would otherwise have hated though he was not blamed still he was downcast and somewhat ashamed as he sat at one side of the circle in the tent thomas gray and a few others were at one end of the long tent their chairs around three sides of a plain table the fourth side being open to the wide circle of men who made themselves comfortable upon the matting of the floor thomas with his strong arms folded before him sat at the center of the table leaning forward a trifle look ing up at gray who was on his feet and holding forth some of you know but some do not gray was saying that i and other wizards of the west have for some years spent most of our time in desperate search for the we of zapranoth the demonlord in the black mountains there was a faint murmur round the tent rolf felt a little better seeing how many of the others faces mirrored his own ignorance of what the higher wizards did it now seems possible continued gray that i stood next to the life of zapranoth where i had scarcely thought to look for it inside the walls of that strong castle we left yesterday it is possible i think not likely that the demon lords life was hidden in that twist of hair eyes turned to rolf enough of them so that he felt he had to speak i had no thought or feeling of any demon near me before or after the charm was taken from me gray had paused to survey his audience now he said a number of you are still looking at me blankly or frown ing suspiciously at that young man i am convinced that a short lecture on the ways of demons is in order having re ceived a nod of agreement from thomas he went on the ordinary layman soldier or not has little hard knowledge of magic though it almost daily influences his life and to him the ways of demons are as unaccountable as those of earth quakes i must make sure you understand me when i speak of our search for the life of zapranoth now that we are on the march and spies have hopefully all been left behind us i can speak somewhat more freely if you understand it may be that you can help and if you help we may still succeed and if we succeed in slaying the demonlord of the black mountains it will count for more than would grinding the walls of soms citadel to powder depend on that now when i speak of finding a demons life i do not mean his active presence but his essence secret and vulner ablewhat the men of the old world seem to have called the soul a demons soul is separable in space from his per sonality it is invisible impalpable and of vital importance for only through it can he be destroyed to keep his soul safe he may hide it in any innocent thing a flower a tree a humans hair a rock the foam of the sea a spiderweb he may keep it far away from him where his enemies will not think to look for it or near at hand where he will more easily know when it is threatened and take steps in its defense what is it one of the furgarbed northmen got to his feet is not som the dead the viceroy of the east in the black moun tains and the demonlord only his subordinate well then it would seem to me zapranoths life must be in soms control gray shook his head we think not those who rule the empire of the east would not care to give any underling as much power as som would have if zapranoth were ab solutely at his mercy therefore they have given som only a lesser power of punishment over the demonlord so the two of them are constrained to eye each other jealously it is a common pattern in the organization of the east thomas and other senior leaders nodded the man from the north sat down and one from the south from mewicks country asked if you wizards are baffled trying to get at zapranoth how are we supposed to help how first understand the great importance of our search then if our campaigning takes you among strangers friendly or neutralseeming say nothing of this matter but listen carefully for any hint that there is information to be had we will pay for it we make no broadcast offers of reward or half the fools and swindlers in the world would come to clog our path and waste our time with spies and agents of the east among them the chance that you will hear any clue is doubtless very small but we must take every chance that we can get i have said our search is desperate gray took his seat and thomas rose any more ques tions on our magic then lets go on to something else he looked round the wide circle as if gauging the temper of his men before continuing it will be plain to all of you that our numbers though we are a real army now are insuf ficient to storm any citadel as strong as soms in the black mountains you must know also that i have sent emissaries farther afield to every other source of western strength we are aware of looking for help you have been asking your selves and me who may be sending troops to help us and where we are to meet them the answer is no troops are coming or very few we go on this campaign with no more men than we have now yet we are attacking the black mountains thomas paused there with every eye fixed on him in tently there was no murmur in the tent but rather a deep hush somewhere in the camp outside a blacksmith was shouting coarse imprecations at an animal he went on after we make a feint to the north and perhaps fight a few skirmishes there with soms outlying garrisons in the black mountains is his power rooted and only there can it be destroyed someone urged wait for the spring then for the birds help we cannot scale soms cliffs or knock them down the birds could lift rope ladders for us scout bear messages drop rocks upon the enemy and use their talons too thomas shook his head inflexibly and the murmur of approval that had started up died down we thought once that the silent people might have stayed we would have tried to warm them through the winter but it is written in their bonemarrow it seems that they must fly south each autumn there was nothing we or they could do about it however if the birds of the west will be absent from this campaign the reptiles of the east will at least be sluggish and thickblooded and it is all very well to say wait for spring then the silent people will fly north to us again and help us but so might som be stronger then and what of this human army we have gathered here and now shall we sit on our tails for another half year hoping for improve ment in our luck that got something of the response he must have hoped for folding his arms before him once again thomas went on in a milder voice as for getting at som in his citadel we think that we have found a way gray once more the wizard arose and spoke his audience heard him out in steadily deepening silence as the plan he was proposing became clear at least to some degree men cast looks at one another across the circle with slowly lengthening faces when the wizard paused there were no questions probably rolf thought because the only ones that came to mind were bluntly insulting about grays sin cerity or sanity thomas stonyfaced glared at his men and through them while gray concluded as i said before we are now on the march somewhat away from prying eyes now the time has come to test what i propose and if the test succeeds to practice it it will not be a usable technique without con siderable practice the stunned silence continued thomas dismissed the meeting and while the others were filing out called rolf to one side where he stood with gray rolf you have more experience with technology than anyone else we know of in our army gray will need an assistant in the project he just spoke of i think you could do a good job of helping him rolf grunted i dont know much really you have a knack thomas clapped both their shoulders and said to gray take him if you will as your helper for the first experiment then thomas turned quickly away answering voices that were already calling him to see about some other business gray and rolf were left confronting each other in what was apparently a mutual lack of confidence tell me young one the tall wizard said at last what do you know about the djinn much like demons are they not grays gaze grew harder young one may you never be called upon to suffer in proportion to your ignorance of the world djinn are not demons and no more like them than men are like the talking reptiles gray led rolf from the tent continuing to talk mean while demons are without exception of the east rather it is only the men of the east turned against mankind who can call on them for service but the djinn are rather like elementals neither goodnor evil in themselves and a man may call on them without being corrupted or consumed there by i see rolf nodded not seeing much but what has this to do with technology and the scheme you were proposing they were walking now through the uneven rows of tents gray heading apparently for the outskirts of the camp just this the djinn i plan to call upon for help is unique so far as i know among his kind he is a technologist a builder and designer i think superior in those fields to any human who has lived since the old world now help me with some preparations if you will it seemed to rolf that he had little choice besides the djinn as gray described him was certainly intriguing they had gotten past the tents now to a place within the trench lines of the camp but near its edge not far from the latrines it was a clear open area perhaps fifty meters across badly illuminated by a couple of torches on poles stuck in the ground rolf had earlier heard casual speculation that the place was being kept reserved for some magical purpose near its center was tethered a sullenlooking loadbeast wear ing panniers that were bulky but did not seem heavy from these rolf and the wizard gathered bags and parcels which gray opened on the sand from them in turn he took small objects which rolf again helping as directed he set out on the ground in a regular and careful pattern the things looked to rolf for the most part like toys for some carpenters child there were miniature hammers wooden wheels a tiny saw small brace and bit and other tools rolf i am told that once you rode upon an old world vehicle that moved across the land without a beast to pull it that you learned its secrets of control and rode it into battle that is so rolf had finished laying out his portion of the pattern had you ever any indication that it might fly no gray his answer was emphatic it was of metal and heavier than a big house and it had no sign of wings gray shrugged well certainly they had many machines that did not fly but they had some that did and some of them still do i think though that does not concern us at this moment what i proposed in meeting just now was not as mad as the men evidently thought it machines can fly and i intend that we shall use them to assault the cliffs of the black mountains gray spoke in a low voice now per haps to himself as much as to rolf squinting at the arrange ment of toy tools on the ground he grunted with satisfaction and began to draw with his staff it occurred to rolf that he had not noticed any staff in grays hand until just now a diagram of straight lines surrounding the symbolic tools the djinn that i will summon up will build for us a vehicle which we will then operate ourselves i think its operation will not be too difficult for intelligent men who have a little nerve and imagination gray stood his staff beside him on the ground there it remained though leaning slightly from the vertical as if it had taken root he rummaged in the beasts panniers again and produced a paper that he unrolled and showed to rolf from drawings left by the ancients of some of their simpler flying machines i have made this sketch of my own other types they made as well that were heavier than air and winged like birds but the technology of those re mains somewhat beyond my grasp and what i cannot under stand i cannot order the djinn to build however the type that i have shown here should suit our needs very well rolf studied the sketch it showed apparently in midair a rimmed platform or shallow basket supported at each of its four corners by a cluster of lines the lines in turn reach ing tautly upward to four great globes above a mast rose from the center of the platform small sails bellied and pennants fluttered showing the direction of the breeze in side the basket four men sat or squatted riding in apparent comfort these globes from which the flying craft depended were made of some elastic fabric gray explained sometimes filling them with hot air was enough to make them rise rolf considered silently was gray mad but wait hot air did rush up the chimney but with the djinn to labor for us we shall do far better our globes will be made of thin metal much stronger and safer and in them there will be nothing nothing rolf tried to make the question sound intel ligent gray studied him and sighed perhaps he wondered if he should request a more intelligent aide consider why does a ship or any chunk of wood float on the water because because it is lighter than water too light to sink ah very true gray smiled and tapped the paper with his finger now when all the air has been exhausted from these metal spheres experiments have already shown me that air indeed has weight when the weight of this whole apparatus is thus made less than the weight of an equal volume of air what will this flying craft do it will weigh less than air yes it all sounded mad but rolf despite himself felt some enthusiasm growing for this mad scheme wild as grays ideas were they somehow felt right in his mind gray spoke more rapidly perhaps pleased that someone could at least halfway understand him air is very light true but nothingness is lighter still i tell you the ancients made the idea work are you ready to try it with me young technologist i will need quick hands to help me and a quick mind too perhaps thomas tells me you have both and i believe him of course you will help you are ordered to but are you really with me in this enterprise rolf took the time to give the question honest thought i am gray nodded with a flourish then he beckoned to his balancing staff that sprang lightly through the air into his hand be silent for a moment now while i evoke the djinn he is an odd creature even of his kind irascible and not wellmeaning but he must labor for us though he cares nothing for east or west or for any man or demon the callingup was accomplished with quick confidence after making a few controlled gestures over the array of toy tools and drawn lines gray uttered in a low rapid voice words that rolf could not quite hear there appeared fire in the air before the wizard with a belching of soot and acrid smoke and accompanied by a sound of rapid pound ing as by unseen crude and heavy implements the voice of the djinn rolled forth sounding one moment like splinter ing wood the next like clashing metal i come as bidden master what is your command after a further incantation evidently meant to seal his control over the creature gray unrolled his sketch and held it forth toward the flaming image of the djinn meanwhile intoning i first let be created four such great hollow spheres such as you see represented here the djinns voice hammered interrupting you let be that means you do not hinder asperity was in grays voice it means that i command i order you to do it and be quick the specifications for the globes are as follows the djinn did not dispute him further but maintained its sooty glow in silence evidently listening a moment after gray had finished detailing his order there appeared seem ingly from nowhere four crude blocks of metal each half as big as a man in another moment the blocks were glowing hot at once there arose a mighty screeching and a banging as of invisible hammers the few soldiers who had been standing in the middle distance watching were being joined momentarily by ever growing numbers of their fellows drawn by the prospect of seeing something spectacularly unusual in the way of magic the camp had doubtless heard by now several versions of what had happened at the meeting in thomass tent rolf for his part backed up a few paces and considered putting his fingers in his ears to dull the noise the blocks of metal glowed incandescent and expanded under the powerful working of the djinn they stretched out and up into enor mous sheets of fiery metal which then began to curve them selves perfectly and surely into the form of spheres when the spheres each the size of a small house were almost completely closed the djinn left them to continue cooling on the sand meanwhile he received from gray the specifications for the platform of the flying device and for the ropes and sails and their attachments so i let it be done gray concluded the djinn began to work again extruding from its smoke long coils of twine and as it worked it grumbled just so you understand that it is i am gathering all the stuffs and doing all the work that you are letting it does not come from nothingness you know nothingness said gray sharply is what i want inside the spheres when the craft is finished we are aboard and alls in readiness for flight then will i give you the order to empty them and seal them the djinn emitted a burst of noise somewhat like the working of a broken sawmill it took rolf a little time to understand that this was laughter nothingness you do not know what you are ordering beg pardon what you are letting master contrary dolt a vein now stood upon grays forehead rolf made a prudent mental note that the wizard was not notably long on patience gray went on by nothingness i mean a lack of air a vacuum nullity such as you yourself will soon become if you irritate me too sorely the djinn evidently did not regard the threat as idle for the work did pick up speed and for the time being at least there were no further threats or grumblings what seemed to be a multitude of invisible hands spun twine into stout ropes and fastened ropes to the basket as it was fabricated it was of a size to hold three or four people without crowd ing with a waisthigh rim all round woven of tough flexible withes and seemingly very light each corner of the square basket was secured with several ropes to one of the great metal spheres their overshadowing bulks creaked as they cooled and all but hid the basket from observation at grays direction a central mast was now stepped in and sails and pennants made and stowed folded in the bottom of the basket water and provisions from more common place sources went in also full night had come but was not yet very far advanced when gray was satisfied that all was in readiness for flight he himself was the first to step into the basket with a somewhat cautious scissoring of his long legs now master rolf if you will and rolf feeling almost evenly balanced between eagerness and reluctance hopped nimbly aboard thomas and several others had drawn near to wish the voyagers well and to observe at close range whatever might happen next when the last word of encouragement had been called in between the surrounding metal globes gray gestured for silence facing the smoky glow of the djinns image he swept his pointing hand to one after another of the four spheres as he cried out now let there be ex hausted from them all the air and other vapors and let them then be sealed shut a quartet of hissing noises suddenly surrounded the bas ket issuing from the four orifices left in the spheres rolf felt his hair stirred by one of the jets of air tensely he gripped the baskets railing waiting for the first surge of flight and almost at once the four enormous globes did stir themselves but not to rise instead as their hissings began they rolled from side to side on the sand they lurched and crumpled and deformed themselves the sphere in front of rolf seemed to be struck by some giant and invisible mace it sounded a deafening clang as it drew into itself a vast dent that bent its surface to its center then all four spheres in a great blacksmiths uproar of tortured metal were shriv elling and flattening like so many fruithusks thrown into a fire as their obscuring bulks shrank down rolf saw thomas and others tumbling away with as little thought of dignity or face as they would have shown before an enemy ambush that caught them unarmed rolf had one leg over the basket rim again and would have fled but one direction looked as perilous as another meanwhile the basket stayed firmly seated on the sand only swaying with grays vocifer ous anger the wizard spouted words at a tremendous rate while rolf dodged this way and that to avoid his gesturing arms silence returned as suddenly as it had fled the metal spheres being reduced to shrunken twisted wads of scrap were still grays speech faltered and ran down and for the moment silence was complete there quickly ensued a murmur of laughter from part of the watching army a mur mur that dissolved before it could grow too large when gray swept his glare around him like a weapon the dim masses of men beyond the torchlight began to scatter and drift off in clots and fragments a number of the men once they had gotten some distance away seemed compelled to utter muted whooping noises thomas and others drawing near once more after their retreat spitting dust and brushing it from their clothes did not seem much amused but none of them dared yet say anything to gray he drew in a big breath and shouted one more outburst at the djinn its flaming fuming scroll flared on apparently unperturbed oh great master it answered in its clattering voice such a curse as you have just delivered would pain me like the grip of zapranoth if i were in fact such a dis obedient traitor as you say i am but as things are i feel no ill effects i have followed your instructions to the letter ahhg technology gray flung down his arms which he had dramatically been stretching wide he climbed out of the basket in his excitement of disgust catching his foot on the rim and nearly falling lowering his voice he said to those nearby it speaks the truth technology how can any man who means to keep his sanity go far in such an art rolf having gotten out of the basket too was thinking hesitantly he asked can i put questions to this djinn why not gray snapped as if answering only with the easiest thing to say rolf turned to address the fiery image you there what made the balls all crumple up like that there was a brief silence as if the djinn were assessing its new questioner then with a clatter the answer came little master they crumpled because the air was taken out of them why why not the outside air pushed in with all its weight and there was only thin metal to resist it gray had spoken of his experiments showing that air had weight the wizard looked exceedingly uncomfortable now but with a sharp motion of his head he signed rolf to go on with his questioning rolf considered it seemed to him that grays theory was basically correct a machine made lighter than air should rise in air as wood rose in water and air most certainly had weight but obviously there were traps and dangers awaiting the technologist rolf asked gray must it speak the truth to us yes gray sighed but not the whole truth thats the catch go on go on ask it more perhaps you have a better head for this than i rolf took thought tried to put from his mind the fact that everyone present was watching and listening to him and faced the djinn again suppose you make the walls of the globes thicker and stronger that should keep them from being crushed when you take out the air you are right said the djinn immediately shall i re build them so and would they still be light enough when emptied to lift us and the basket with them there was a short delay no this time rolf thought he detected disappointment he folded his arms and took a few short paces to and fro tell me djinn what did the men of the old world do when they wished to fly they made a flying machine and rode in it i myself was born with the new world of course and never saw them but so i have been told and so i truly believe how did they make these flying machines there was another pause describe a way and i will tell you if it is right or wrong rolf looked at gray who shook his head and told him i cannot compel it to greater helpfulness than that the djinn must give us what it knows of the truth in answer to our questions but if it wishes to be grudging it can yield only a small fragment at a time rolf nodded accepting the rules of the game which he was beginning to find fascinating djinn were these flying devices lighter than the air some of them had they lifting spheres as big as these were sometimes yet their spheres were not crushed that is true the audience was silent the time of half a dozen breaths had passed before rolf chose his next question were their lifting spheres empty no the monosyllable had a forced reluctant sound they were filled then with something lighter than the air they were the stars had rotated to midnight before rolf had ex tracted from the djinn what seemed to be the last necessary bit of information and gray could issue new orders that the new spheres be made of fabric such as you have de scribed airtight and capable of stretching and that they be filled by this lighterthanair gas that will not burn to the point where they will lift the basket with us in it shortly before dawn having managed a few hours sleep in the meantime gray and rolf were once more in the basket attended by an audience much smaller and less hopefullooking than that of the previous evening once more gray gave orders to the djinn the new balloons that had replaced the crumpled metal spheres rose from the sands as they inflated then tugged boldly at their strong tethers then pulled them taut the basket creaked and moved and rolf beheld the desert floor go dropping silent ly from beneath his feet thomas and the few who had come with him to the launching cheered and waved the camp was already astir with preparations for the days march and now a wider cheer went up to greet the swiftascending flyer rolf look ing down upon an earth much darker than the lightening sky saw his comrades breakfast fires shrink steadily the airborne flying machine was drifting slowly but steadily to the north gray was issuing sharp orders planned before hand to the djinn whose smoky image drifted without weight or apparent effort beside the basket there came a hissing as flyinggas was vented from the bags their giant shapes were spheres no longer but pressed together above the mast by their own bulging the hissing continued as gray had ordered until their ascent had been stopped or so the djinn informed them rolf could not say from one moment to the next that they were really on the same level and he would have been hard put to judge exactly how high they were the fires of the camp were now a scattering of sparks at some distance to the south and the last men rolf had seen there had been shrunken to the stature of small insects not that he was worried about their height the tight grip he had taken on the rim of the basket when it lifted was now loosening enjoyment was winning out steadily over fright gray too seemed pleased rubbing his hands together and exclaiming in satisfaction after exchanging with rolf opinions that all was going well he resumed giving orders to the djinn for the attachment of rigging to the mast and the readying of sails the wizard called out jovially rolf have you ever steered a sailing ship no though i have lived my whole life near enough to the sea it matters not i have experience once we get up a sail ill show you how to tack against the wind wed best not fly by daylight there may be reptiles scouting things did not immediately go right with the rigging rolf was called upon to hold lines tie knots and pull a sail soon rose upon the mast but hung in utter limpness after doing so gray scowling again hauled this way and that on lines and cloth but the sail would not so much as flutter he hoisted a pennant but it too drooped like chain mail clenching his fists gray muttered is this some countering magic i sense none yet there was a breeze before we lifted from the ground there is one yet said rolf nodding to the evershrinking pattern of the camps cookfires dimming now with the ap proach of dawn or what is carrying us northward but then he realized he could not feel a breath of moving air upon his face gray took one look back at the camp and called the djinn to question why does the wind not belly out my sail name a reason and i will say if it be true the clatter of the djinns voice became something like a cackle gray sputtered rolf asked djinn are we becalmed because our whole craft is already moving with the wind like part of it in stead of the wind pushing past us it is so angrily gray flared up there were sails drawn in the old world pictures then a thought struck him silent after a moment he grumbled of course those drawings may have been sheer fancy they did that sometimes but they did have real airships how then did they steer them rolf question it some more and i will think meanwhile rolf tried not to think of how fast they might be drifting and how high djinn tell me did the ancients ever use sails clatter cackle not to fly did they use paddles to propel their airships never rudders to steer them there was a reluctantseeming pause yes yes rolf pounced without a second thought then fetch us such a rudder here at once the air around them seemed to sigh as with a giants effort or perhaps the satisfaction of a djinn then arrived the rudder here and at once indeed it was a wall of metal curving monstrous overgrown wedged between balloon and basket so that it bent the mast and stretched the ropes and all but crushed the occupants shaped roughly like a door for some great archway the rudder was a good twelve meters long its longest straightest edge turned downward now was nearly a meter thick coming out of the flatness of this edge were festoons of cabling and the ends of metal pipes the balloon sank horrendously under the huge load gray bent double under the slab whose main weight was for tunately carried by the baskets rim cried out an order in an instant the great mass was gone the airship leaped up again gray stood and rolf recovered himself from the position into which he had been forced almost entirely out of the basket there was silence for a little while except for gasps and wheezings when gray spoke at last his voice was icily de tached in magic hasty words are illadvised so i learned long ago i will not utter any more of them believe me well i have blundered too this night let us learn from our mistakes and then forget them if we can gray may i ask the djinn a cautious question ask him what you will our troubles seem to stem from giving him orders turning to the unperturbed scroll of smoke rolf asked did the old worlders ever use such a rudder as you brought to us to steer a flying craft like this one lighter than the air and with no means of making headway through the air he was imagining himself in a boat drifting with a current and he saw clearly in his mind that the rudder in the boat was useless for there was no streaming of water around it no the monosyllabic answer seemed all innocence gray asked did they ever steer craft like this at all no the two humans exchanged a weary look gray said i had better give orders for the gradual deflation of the bags so that we drift no farther it will take our men a while to reach us as it is i see no danger in that order rolf said cautiously as gas began to hiss from the bags again he turned to the east where now the sun lanced at him from above the distant range of the black mountains there was one peak that seemed to tower above the rest its head lost in a wreath of cloud that looked much higher still than the balloon gray seemed to know where he was looking there lies the citadel of som the dead the wizard said on those cliffs can you see them that rise up halfway on the high est mount theres where we must somehow land part of our army and somewhere there thought rolf my sister may be still alive we will find a way he said with his hand he struck the basket rim we will make this work here comes the ground said gray the landing was a tumble but it broke no bones chapter chup stood frozen in the doorway watching as the man whom he had killed stood up fresh and healthy as when their duel had started tarlenot startled by chups entrance turned and got up quickly but when he saw chups paraly sis of astonishment he relaxed enough to offer him a slight bow and a mocking smile charmian who had looked up as if expecting chup said in a calm voice leave us now good tarlenot tarlenot with the air of one who had completed his visit anyway bowed once more this time to her i shall as you know i must soon give up this happy collar for a while and take to the road again of course i mean to see you again before i set out she waved him off if not you shall when you return go now he frowned briefly at her decided not to argue and gave chup one more look of amusement then tarlenot withdrew going out through a doorway at the long cham bers other end charmian now turned herself completely toward chup and at the sight of him began to giggle in a moment she was rolling over on her couch quite gracefully in her mirth and she laughed with a loud clear peal like some innocent teasing girl chup moved unsteadily toward her from his doorway still looking after tarlenot he said my blade went this far down in him this far i saw him die out there she went on laughing merrily my hero chup but you are so astonished it is worth all the vexation just to see you so for his part chup was very far from laughter what powers of sorcery do you have here what do battles mean and warriors lives when dead men jump up grinning her mirth quieted she began to eye chup as if with sympathy it was not sorcery dear chup but his guards mans collar that saved him no collar stopped my blade i cut down to his heart i know death when i see it dear fool i did not mean that at all of course you cut him down he died you beat and killed him as i knew you would but then he was restored by the lord draffut there is no way of restoring but then chups voice trailed off she following his thought nodded with amusement yes my lord as it was done for you restoration by the fluid of the lake of life since you do not wear the collar of soms guard i had to risk the beastlords great displeasure by having the fluid stolen for you by one of the demons he so hates but i would face greater risks than that to have you with me her face and voice were innocent and proud come sit beside me here have you the little trinket with you that was woven of my hair he walked to the soft couch and sat down beside his unclaimed bride from his pocket he brought out the golden charm clenched in his hand no keep it for me my good lord until i tell you how it must be used keep it and guard it well with no one else will it be so safe charmian took his hand but only to press his fingers tighter around the knot of yellow hair he put the thing back in his pocket still foremost in his thought was the resurrection he had witnessed so tarle not will be magically healed whenever and however he is slain if he falls here in sight of soms citadel and with his collar on did you not hear him say just now that he will leave his guardsmans collar here when he goes out as a courier again the valkyries will not fly more than a kilome ter or two from the citadel the what the valkyries the flying machines of the old world that take the fallen guardsmen up to draffut to be healed they get but little practice now what is this guard of soms you speak of it as some tiling special an elite corps of men he thinks reliable she had re leased his hand and was talking in a businesslike way they number about five hundred there are no more collars than that he observed you have not yet managed to get one of these protective collars for yourself she seemed slightly hurt i will depend upon my strong lord chup for protection we will see that you have a collar of course as soon as possible besides the valkyries will take no woman you have been depending on the strong lord tarlenot till now i gather well i will wait and catch him with his collar off charmian laughed again this time even more delightedly and curled up amid her silks that messenger why you are joking lord you must know i am only using him and to make him really useful i must lead him on my only true thoughts are for you grimly and thoughtfully he said i remember that you do not have true thoughts now she was hurt her eyes looked this way and that then sought him piteously and fluttered one who did not know her as he did might easily have been convinced he knew her and was not fooled but she was still his bride and allimportant to him he frowned wondering why he did not wonder there must be a reason and he ought to have remembered it but somehow it eluded him my every thought has been for you his allimportant bride was pouting true when you arrived today i pre tended to be angry surely you could not have been de ceived by that i wanted tarlenot to fight you so you would put him in his place you must have understood that could he ever have beaten you even on the sickest day youve ever had why yes he could and handily she avoided his reaching hand and jumped to her feet how can you dare to think that i have ever meant you harm if you will be rude enough to ask for proof of my intentions i can only point out that here you are restored to life and health and power and who is responsible for your restoration if not i very well you saved me but for your own reasons you wanted this again he pulled the charm out of his pocket looking down at the soft and shiny thing resting so lightly in his open hand he could remember vaguely that he had felt misgivings about picking it up for the first time but he could not remember why he asked what do you want it for put it away please when he had done that charmian sat down again and took his hand between hers i want to use it to make you a viceroy in the black mountains in soms place he grunted in surprise beyond mere disbelief be at ease my lord she reassured him the wizard hann who is with us in this enterprise has made this apartment proof against soms spies i came in quite unnoticed not by me i wanted you to enter my good lord her small hands pressed his fingers tenderly ah but it is good to have you sitting with me once again you will be lord of high lords here with zapranoth and draffut as your vassals and i will be your consort proud beside you he made another boorish noise unruffled she pressed his arm chup do you doubt that i would like to be the lady of a viceroy i dont doubt that her nails spurred his forearm and do you think that i would want some lesser man than you beside me one who could not hold such a prize when we had won it or try for something higher still by all the demons you underrate me if you do viceroy lord of high lords armies numbering tens of thousands under his command beside him charmian looking as she did now he could no longer wholly doubt what she was saying has viceroy som no need of you to hold his place and help him try for something higher still her eyes flashed anger mixed with determination i want a living man not dead but you are right my lord som is the key we must dispose of him she said it easily he gave me shelter when my father fell thinking i would be useful to him one day i convinced him you would be useful too he does not know that you have brought the means of his downfall chups manner was still scornful and what are we to do with som the dead how shall we topple him her eyes that had gone to feast upon some distant vision came back to his unwaveringly the circlet woven of my hair must go into his private treasure hoard unknown to him only thus can he be made vulnerable to certain magic that we shall use against him he must be guarded against such charms of course but hann says that the one you carry is of unequalled power chup said you speak much of this wizard hann and what he says what does he gain by helping you charmian pouted i see i must soothe down your point less jealousy again hann wants only vengeance for some punishment that som inflicted on him long ago i know that hann gives no impression of great skill at magic yet he is stronger in his way than elslood was or zarf then why can he not make a stronger charm than elslood wrought he thought he could feel it in his pocket like a circle of heavy fire she shook her head impatiently i do not understand it perfectly but it seems that elslood wanting me to care for him stole some of my hair and wove the charm but he tapped some power greater than he understood the effect was reversed the charm only made him dote all the more on me never mind we need not struggle with these technicalities of magic all that you need worry about my lord is getting the charmed circlet woven of my hair into soms private treasure hoard how i have already gone far in learning ways and making plans for that but the execution of the plan requires some one like yourself my lord and who is there but you how his voice was still heavy with his skepticism she seemed about to tell him but first she recounted once more the joys of being viceroy he still could not credit what she said but her soft voice wore him down so that he passed the midpoint between doubting and belief all things were possible when his bride whispered that they were now she was telling him what he must do now hear me my lord this is vital to us both and you must learn it the sooner the better three things must fall together ere we strike first the human guards who watch the outer entrance to the treasure vault must be those we have sub orned second are you listening the new breed of centi pedes in the second room must not yet have hatched thirdly the word for quieting the demons in the inner vault must be the one we know demons again he ceased to listen he was wearying quickly of all these endless words even if they came from her when she herself was here shaking his head to break the spell of words he reached for her my lord wait hear me this is vital but he would not wait nor hear her any longer and with a small sigh of vexation she let him have his way on the next day when he had truly rested there came to him officers of soms guard as was to be expected they wished to question chup about the military situation in the west about thomass plans and the strength of his forces chup related the rumors common in the broken lands for what they might be worth he told the officers what he had observed of troop movements from his beg gars post and of other matters bearing on the military the conditions of roads and livestock in the broken lands the feelings and prosperity of the populace the state of the harvest he could give the guardsmen little comfort except as regarding the relative smallness of thomass force thomas would need great reinforcement before he could attempt an attack upon this citadel chup was soon sitting at ease with the officers military men like himself he was now dressed like them in a uni form of black except that he had as yet no rank and of course no guardsmans collar in the course of exchanging some soldiers talk he asked them about the collars he could not imagine how it would feel to enter a fight with the knowledge that you could be glued together again if you were hacked apart would it be a spur or a hindrance to the most effective action would a man who wearied let himself be killed to gain a rest one of the officers shook his head and raised one finger it ended in a tiny abnormal loop of flesh instead of a fin gernail the healings not that safe or certain things some times go wrong up in lord draffuts house a man whos badly mangled going in may well come out too crooked to walk straight and those whove been too long lifeless when the valkyries pick em up may never again be smarter than little animals the other officer nodded his scarred head still he said i think none of us are likely to turn in our collars see much fighting here chup asked not since we came here and draffut handed out his collars he was here first you know before the east or west we do grow somewhat stale those of us who stay inside these mountains nothing but a peasant uprising from time to time but we practice well handle this thomas if he comes you think hell gather men enough to try chup guessed he might they chatted some more chup was invited to visit the officers club on a lower level of the citadel where wine and gambling and fresh peasant girls were available he got up and strolled with the two men to sample the wine as for the dice and the women he had no money at the moment and could not imagine himself wanting any woman but one walking the main buried corridors of the citadel he took note of the fighting men he saw he supposed the garrison might number a thousand if all the able men were mobilized but the five hundred elite guardsmen should be easily able to hold the natural defenses of the place against thomass four thousand or so a few of the guardsmen were grotes quely misshapen with old scars of wounds no man could ordinarily survive though they were active still this con firmed what the officer had said about the uncertainty of being healed so tarlenot had needed at least some guts to face him in a fight that was a useful if not encouraging bit of information on a rival chup had other things to watch for on his walk to the officers club and back again through rooms and passages carved from the mountains rock in one large chamber decorated with some ancient artisans frieze of unknown men and creatures he spotted without paying it any ob vious attention the entrance to the passage that charmian had told him to watch for it was an unmarked tunnel lead ing downward and yet farther into the mountain it was this way that by many turns and branches she had de scribed would lead him to soms own treasure hoard again and again during the next two days she repeated her instructions to him by then he had ceased to doubt her word on anything at all and then she awoke him in the night to tell him that the time had come the three re quirements had fallen together he must try tomorrow to reach the treasure vault of som he strode into the high friezecorniced room with the air of a man upon some important errand as indeed he was the room was an intersection of two corridors and held people passing continually to and fro no one paid attention as chup turned aside into the downward way that led toward the treasure it led to other things as well and was not guarded here chup walked unarmed with any blade or club he must not kill today must leave no traces of his passage for weapons he carried charmians knowledge of soms secrets gathered he knew not how but trust her to manage that in a world of men and his own boldness and speed of mind and body and three words of magic and a pocketful of dried fruit innocent to the eye and taste hann had demon strated that a human might eat of it without effect a few people passed chup coming toward him through the tunnel he descended then the way branched once and again and now there were no other walkers the branch that chup had been taught to follow was a narrow way and it went on without another intersection for some distance now and then it broke out of its walls into a large cave where it formed a suspended walkway across chasms whose depths were lost in darkness sunlight filtered down into the big caves through hidden openings some where high above along the buried parts of the way a few cheap lampstands cast some illumination there were no signs nor any evidence that any goal of much importance lay in this direction so far all was as charmian had foretold and now here just as she had said the path bridged a wider crevasse than usual and then once more branched the right way she had told him led up into the viceroys private quarters the left side narrower was the one that chup must take now at last there were posted warning signs chup had no doubt of what they meant though he did not stop to try to puzzle out the letters he also ignored another blunter warning a bundle of mummied hands that were no doubt supposed to be those of wouldbe trespassers hung like a cluster of dried vegetables above the way he moved his head slightly as he walked beneath not liking that the dead fingers should brush his hair his pulse went quicker if he were stopped and questioned now it would be hard to say convincingly that he had seen no warning a final abrupt turn and chups path came to an end against a massive unmarked door this too he found as charmian had described it so strongly built that a crew of men swinging a ram would be needed to break it down and the tunnel so curved before it that such a gang would have no place to stand having no sword hilt to rap out a signal with chup put his knuckles to the job the door re sounded no more than would a massive tree stump but someone must have been listening for the little noise for it was answered quickly there was a grating noise and a dim face peeking out at chup through a small and heavy grill there came next a sliding of bars and rattle of chains and the great door moved inward just enough for him to enter he stepped into a barren rockwalled chamber about ten meters square and almost as high the two men in guardsmens collars standing watch had been given no chairs or other furniture to lure them into relaxation directly across from the door where chup had entered a ladder five or six meters long stood leaning against the wall beside the ladder was the rooms only visible aperture besides the door a nar row hole that led down into darkness thick candles in wall sconces lit the guardroom adequately one of the men who greeted chup was hardly more than half a man in size his legs being grotesquely short the other guard was of ordinary size and sound of limb but his face was the strangest chup had ever seen on living man a wall of scars from which one live eye gleamed like something trapped according to charmian these men had been enlisted in her cause by promises of better healing when she came to power the two of them closed up and chained and barred the great door tight as soon as chup was through it and then they looked at chup expectantly but saying nothing he had wasted no time either but had crossed the cham ber to look down into the hole he could see nothing in the darkness there wheres the beast he asked i mean in which part of its room the scarred man made a nervous sound hard to say youve got some means of putting it to sleep of course but id like to know just where to toss the bait they came and stood beside him at the hole peering down and listening muttering to each other trying to locate the beast they were nervous for his welfare if his attempt miscarried down below their complicity in it would be discovered when chup alive or dead was found it seemed to chup a long time passed before the dwarfed man raised a hand for his attention and pointed to the quarter of the room below where he evidently thought the beast to be bending over the pit straining his ears chup thought he could barely hear a dry patter that must be made by its multitude of feet there there yes the scarred man whispered itll be behind you as you go down the ladder they got ready for him the long ladder chup saw now that it was really an extremely slim and elegant stair complete with handrail fit for som to use when he went down to count his gold and now they slid the ladder down chup went down facing the ladder about one third of its length before he tossed his first piece of dried fruit he heard the hundred feet shiver before he saw the railthin catquick body he could not tell for sure whether the bait had been taken hann had said the two pieces swallowed should afford chup time enough to walk a kilometer plenty of time to complete his mission he let his eyes become somewhat more accustomed to the gloom before he tossed a second piece of fruit and he saw this one snapped up by the first pair of delicate legs flicked up into the tiny harm less mouth a moment only passed before the beast shivered twitched extravagantly and began to curl its body its hun dred legs in disarray it slid down springily to the floor showing chup as it bent the hundred branching slivers of its whiplike tail chup cautiously went down the rest of the ladder the centipede had fallen and remained completely quiet he left the ladder and paced toward the door that led to the next lower level and now the dryness of fear was growing in his throat behind him he heard the ladder being drawn up so it had been planned in case some officer should come while he was down below there was a bloated bulk of darkness that he only just avoided stepping on when it made a feeble movement in his path he had been told of this also it had been a man and was still alive nourishing the larvae of the centipede inside it self perhaps its hands would someday join the thieves bun dle over the tunneled walk perhaps it had in fact once been a wouldbe thief in the faint light from below he could make out the way to the next lower level an ordinary doorway led to a simple solid stair of stone narrow and curving but quite open what was below had no desire nor occasion to come up and the centipede would be too frightened to go down chup went down armed with the three words of magic hann had taught him they weighed now like swallowed arrows in his throat syllables not fit for ordinary men to bear chup went down the curving stair and before him the increasing light carried the hint of the color of gold as he had been instructed chup counted the turnings of the stair and stopped on what should be the last before the source of light ahead could come into his view there he drew in his breath and said clearly and loudly paus ing after each word the three words of the incantation with the first word there fell a silence in the air where before he had only thought the air was silent there had been a certain quiet murmuring that he was not aware of until it ceased with the second word the light in the room below was dimmed and the air became fresh and ordinary where be fore he had only thought that it was so and time began to make itself felt so that chup perceived the age in all the slimy stones that built the vault surrounding him the third word of the incantation seemed to hang for ever on his tongue but when he had said it time flowed on once more as it should the golden light before him grew as bright as ever a certain rippling watery reflection in it had been stopped so it was steady where before he had only thought that it was so with that chup went on down walking into soms treasure room through its sole entrance the vaulted chamber was round and high perhaps twenty meters across the golden light came from the center of it seemingly from the treasure itself it lay in carelesslooking heaps for the most part bril liant yellow metal coins and jewelry bars and foldings of gold leaf here and there the piles were studded with the sharper glint of silver or the brighter flash of gems the treasure was still sealed from chup by a last en circling fence of what seemed fragile metal wands he had no need to cross that barrier or worry about it instead he looked up at once to the upper vaulting of the high chamber by the light of the ensorceled treasure he saw that up there the seven guardian demons hung where hanns three words had sent them like malformed bats in fine gray gossamer robes they were head down with arms or forelegsit was hard to specifythat hung below their heads several of the dangling limbs hung nearly to the level of chups head so elongated were the demons shapes one had a gray blur of a talon run like a fishhook through the hide of a small furry beast a living toy apparently that struggled and squeaked incessantly to be free and very slowly dripped red blood as chup watched the de mons they began to drone like humans newly fallen asleep who start to snore with a shudder he pulled his gaze down and stepped forward making himself forget what hung above his head he stood staring for just a moment in awe at the accumu lated wealth before him he thought he had seen riches before and owned some too but he had known only handfuls compared to his the moment of distraction passed what drove him had far more power over him than greed taking now from his pocket the golden circlet of charmians hair infinitely bright er in his eyes than any hoard of metal he held it up before him in both hands he was reluctant ever to let it go but after all it was the woman he wanted not her token it was for the sake of their future life together that he must give away the charm for no other reason could he have parted with it now he tossed it from him over the innocentlooking fence of fragile rods toward the piledup wealth as it passed from his fingers it seemed to draw from him a greater spark than ever man might get by rubbing cloth and amber and with this spark invisible for all its power charmians image in his mind was smashed and shattered as in a broken mirror under the blow chup lurched forward two steps hands outstretched and groping like one aroused from sleep walking he blinked and cried out incoherently his case was all the worse for his remembering all the nightmare that had brought him here nightmare magic that had made him trust his bride tightly he squeezed shut his eyes forgetting for the moment even the dreaming droning blinded demons over his head as he tried to call back charmians face tried to see it once again as he had seen it setting out upon his mission he visualized her now as beautiful as ever but now freed of the potent charm he recognized her beauty as nothing but a mask worn by an enemy he stood gazing dazedly through the fragileseeming fence of wands the gold circlet had vanished lost in the dazzle of the yellow metal stacked and strewn there and now that he was freed of it he did not want it back nor her she would be with tarlenot now or hann or someone else and chup realized that he no longer minded that the thought broke in upon him that she must have known he would be freed by tossing away the charm or did she think he was still bound to her and blinded by the simple magic of her attraction like the other men she used no he never had been enthralled by her before he picked up the charm she must have known that he would at this point be set free to do what where did his best interests lie was he now committed irrevocably to helping her against som remembering now her face and voice over the last few days he concluded that she still hated him for not being manageable without magic especially for once slapping her to put an end to a mindless hysteria of noise was she done with using him now and was her revenge already set at best his time of safety here was passing quickly cau tiously he turned to leave the treasure chamber above his head the little furry animal still writhed and squeaked impaled upon the demons dangling talon chup put up a hand in passing to rob the demon of its toy he tossed the small beast ahead of him up the curving stair there it might find a crevice in which to die in peace the curses of three thousand wizards on all demons he could not slay them but he would take the chance to rob one of a toy when he had climbed round the first turn of the ascending stair he paused and uttered in reverse order hanns three words the light changed subtly down below and no longer was there perfect silence when he had climbed to the darkened level of the centi pede he was glad that he had wasted no more time below for already the beast was stirring it was not moving yet but trying to rise its feet ascratching on the pavement in the darkness he waited briefly to give his eyes a better chance to see now that he had thought a little it seemed to him that he would have no more usefulness to charmian no longer bewitched he could do nothing for her that someone more manageable tarlenot could not do almost as well she hated chup he felt quite sure of that and she was not the girl to leave her hate unsatisfied he could see the dim shape of the centipede now lying on its side curling and uncurling like a slow snake swim ming in the dark its feet scraped but were not yet ready to support it chup moved in the utmost silence stepping toward the place where they must let down the ladder for him here would this be where charmian meant for him to die the more he thought the likelier it appeared for one thing this whole scheme could have been accomplished in a different way hann could have given the two deformed guards dried fruit and magic words they could have taken the circlet in and thrown it on the pile as easily as chup except in that case chup would have been left above ground live and active and with his own will back again holding his breath he listened for any sound above they must be standing silent and listening too suppose he called up for the ladder and they lowered it when he unarmed climbed to the top the two guardsmen would be there one on each side with weapons drawn or suppose they did not lower the ladder but laughed at him they could have some means to grapple his body and hoist it up after the centipede had struck him either way once he was dead put him down a crevice somewhere he would vanish or seem to be the victim of an accident or some chance quar rel or casual assassination only there would be nothing to connect him with the treasure vault behind chup now the sounds of the centipede grew louder looking back it saw it was now managing to drag itself along the floor it moved in his direction and close above him now he heard the faint sound of a sandalscrape and the intake of a nervous breath where is he came a guards low whisper if the demons took him after all theyre certain to report him and were through chups eyes had now adapted well enough for him to see the beast in some detail thin as an arm its body was though longer than a man about as long as the many weaponed tail that flicked and twitched behind it a man with good arms might easily break the beasts thin neck it seemed except that as soon as he tried to get a grip that tail would come snapping like a whip in the gloom impos sible to block or dodge the clustered poisonspines grew longer than fingers on that tail how could a man fight such a thing barehanded why thus and so and he would have a fighting chance if it was dazed and slow the cold calculation of tactics led chup on into the outline of a larger plan he trusted what his instinct told him in a fight the reasons came clearer later if he took the time to think them out the animal was trying now to stand was on the verge of success chup drew a deep breath and moved into action he scraped his sandals on the paving making hurried foot steps and in a low clear voice he called out let down the ladder from up above the laughter came the centipede was still sliding toward chup with whis pery scraping of its feet and body on the stones moving more quietly than the dazed beast chup circled to its rear and closed in he grabbed in the near darkness with his unprotected hand for the tail and caught it just under the cluster of poisonspines at the tip he set his foot against what might be called the creatures rump and shoved it down and pinned it when it would have tried to rise hold ing the tail straight was easy enough but the multitude of slender legs had strength in numbers resilient power sur prising for their size he was in for a struggle as soon as the drug had worn off completely the more so as he must not kill this beast the fighters intuition on which he relied had grasped that point at once though he had not thought it through with conscious logic he must keep for himself the option of making charmians plan succeed or fail and to leave this animal dead would mean alerting som and the plots eventual discovery up above the guardsmens low voices were cheering on the beast put down the ladder quick by all the demons chup cried out he was now sitting on the body of the beast to hold it down their position could not be seen from up above his right hand was still vising the tail his left hand feeling for the neck fight it out oh great lord chup called down a voice whats wrong did you forget your sword he answered with a wordless cry of rage as he shifted his grip upon the creature just slightly and stood up lifting it across his shoulders the weight was quite surprising for the size it must be half as heavy as a man that sounded like it did it for him it must have wait a moment though the hundred legs remained in agitation pounding softly coldly at chups head he moved with his hideous burden carefully keeping out of direct sight of the men above stepping soundlessly one of the hidden voices said toss down a bait weve waited long enough it got him or hed still be running said the other doubtfully he might have gone back down to the vault dimwit the words wont work twice in one night re member hann told us that no manll run to a wakeful demon not even if a hundredloggers chasing him throw a bait we dont know when an inspectors going to come all right all right wheres the beast ill toss one before his nose chup twisted his burden off his shoulder and lowered it carefully in straining arms just enough to let the little feet make scratching sounds upon the floor there there hear it chup heard the tiny spat of hanns dried fruit landing a meter or so before him he waited counting slowly to ten his captives body prisoned now under his left arm its deadly tail still clamped safely by his tireless sword hand then he pressed the hundred legs down on the pavement once again and this time let the writhing sides make contact too to make the sounds of staggering and collapse it took the bait go down tom go down if youre in such a hurry wait till it falls i say chup lifted the animal again and moved in silence to a new position its quiet now go down and haul out the mighty lord chup we had it settled you were going down youre the stronger as you always brag so now be quick about it a snarl of fear and anger quick what if an inspector comes it was the dwarf who eventually prevailed the tall scarred man came down the ladder slowly and hesitantly frowning into the shadows where he thought chup and the beast must both be lying he had his sword drawn and he spun round quickly when he heard chups soft step behind him then he screamed and jumped away and fell when he saw what weapon chup was brandishing without hesitation chup turned and charged up the lad der the writhing beast held above him and in front of him he saw the dwarfs face peering down incredulously then tumbling backward out of sight in terror the dwarf was far too late in trying to draw his stubby sword chup by that time had reached the ladders top pitched the animal back down the hole and was reaching for the little man the dwarfs thick sword arm caught was twisted till the weapon clattered to the floor then he himself was flung away across the room hold back chup barked out with his back against the door i mean no killing here no valkyries buzzing down the tunnel to haul you out and bring investigators now hold back the disarmed dwarf was sitting scowling where he had been tossed and gave no impression of any eagerness to attack nor did the tall scarred man who having beaten the maltreated centipede to the ladder on one lap or an other of what must have been a lively race now halted at the ladders top the tall one was armed but so now was chup who had scooped up the dwarfs sword and what chup had just accomplished without a blade must have augmented his reputation considerably in the present com pany the men held back chup nodded and reached behind him with one hand to slide back the massive bolts that sealed the door the scheme you were enlisted for goes forward and if you play your parts i will see to it that you are rewarded as you deserve he thought he went on speaking with his field commanders voice the plan goes on but now i am in charge and not those who first bribed you and instructed you remember that raise that ladder the tall man hesitated briefly then jumped to obey sheathing first his sword the dwarf was snuffling now like some schoolboy caught in an escapade chup demanded what were you to do next what signal were you to give her that i am dead the tall one said your your body lord to be left where it would be found as if some feral centipede had there are some in these caverns to make your death look accidental i see chup could now take time to think maintain your guard here as if nothing had happened if an inspector comes say nothing i left no traces down below i will be back or will send word to tell you what to do now he could see the logic and the details of his plan and he was grinning as he went out and shut the door chapter the corpses face had been shattered into unrecognizabil ity as if by a long fall onto rock and the appearance of the rest of the body suggested that it had been nibbled by some kind of scavenger reptiles perhaps the men who had brought the body to charmian soldiers led by two officers who were not of her small group of plotters stood by watching stolidly as she attempted to make the re quested identification she looked long at what had been the face and at the heavy limbs that had once been powerful they did not seem to have anything to do with chup but in their present state they might be his as well as not charmian was not squeamish about death in others and put out a hand and turned the ruined head trying without success to find an identifiable feature the build and hair color of the dead man were chups and the nowtattered black uniform might have been the one that he had worn she could see no marks of weapons on the body half a day after chup had set out upon his mission for her she had as planned sent word to soms chamberlain in quiring whether her husband had been detained on any business word came back that nothing was known of his whereabouts half a day after that the search was begun in earnest now another day later this events were pro ceeding just about on the schedule she had planned where was this man found she asked wedged in a deep crevice lady in one of the deep caves it appeared he might have fallen from a bridge the officers voice was neutral can you make an identifica tion not with certainty she lifted her eyes calmly no one high in the councils of the east would be expected to show much grief for the loss of any other but yes i think this is the body of my husband tell the viceroy som that i am grateful for his help in searching and if it was no accident that killed the lord chup then those who did it are as much soms enemies as mine the officers bowed and half a day after they and their men had gone wheel ing their gruesome charge upon a cart other messengers came from som more cheerfully garbed and with far merrier words to speak it was a summons for her to appear before the viceroy but it came couched in the welcome form of gracious invitation soon after those emissaries also had departed leaving her time for preparation the wizard hann sat watching char mian they were in a central room of her elaborate suite hann sat astraddle of a delicate chair turned back to front his sharp chin resting broodingly upon his wry somehow unwizardly forearms crossed upon the chairs high back the clothes that charmian was to wear closefitting gar ments of raven black hung thin and shimmering beside a screen she herself swathed in a white robe and soft towels and newly emerged from her bath sat primping before an array of mirrors surrounded by white and brilliant lamps she would make an imperious motion of her finger or her head or merely with her eyes and karen or kath would jump to adjust the angle of a mirror or lamp or lisa or portia would fetch a different comb or brush jar or phial most of which their lady considered and rejected saman tha was upon some errand for charmian and lucia had earlier been judged guilty of some gross error and was not here there was blood drying on the small silvery whip that lay at one end of the long dressing table charmians face utterly intent on appraising itself in all its multiple reflections was for the time devoid of youth and softness was ageless as ice and equally as hard hann observing her thus disarmed and charmless was able to appraise her with something of the feeling he had when watching another magician pull off a perilous feat professional respect he need never have worried about her nerves he told himself this girlwoman had matured considerably in the half year since she had come here as a frightened refugee from the start she had been enormously ambitious and now she could be cold and capable and selfcontrolled she probably could commandan army given a tactical ad viser and mouthpiece to pass on orders a man like tarlenot and she would have the nerve and ruthlessness to manage the other powers that were the viceroys even the power called zapranoth given the aid of a wizard of great skill hann the rulers of the empire of the east would not care if som were overthrown by one of his subordinates that would mean only that a more capable servant had replaced a less and now it did seem that soms hand was faltering only in the back of hanns mind the question waited why had the body been so mutilated impossible to certainly identify well why not the dwarf and scarface swore that they had put the lord chup down a crevice as planned and there were little scavenger beasts that strayed out from the dungeons where they bred charmian was dismissing her attendants as soon as the last of them had left the room she turned to hann a ques tioning look hann understanding quickly made use of the best developed of his powers to quickly scan the suite and its environs in this branch of magic he thought that he was unexcelled the voices of invisible powers inhuman and abject and faithful muttered their reports to him speaking close and softly in his ear so none but he could hear speak safely he said to charmian no one is listening but me fingering a tiny perfume bottle she asked how did our viceroy and master acquire his name hann was perplexed som who else my learned fool why is he called the dead he sprang up from his chair aghast you dont know that a light danced in charmians eyes she remained seated at her dressing table looking at hann in her mirrors she was quite relaxed save for her fingers on the little phial you know that i have met som only twice and both times only briefly i realize of course that the purpose of his name must be to frighten those who hear it but in what sense is it true in a very real sense alarmed at her ignorance hann tilted his head from side to side in agitation in a real sense then but tell me more charmians voice was soothing and deliberate her eyes tranquil hann absorbed some of her calm turned his chair around and sat down properly well som does not age at all he is immune alike to poison and disease if what i hear is true the wizard frowned he has reached some balance struck some bargain with death i admit i do not know how charmian appeared to disbelieve you speak as if death were some man or demon hann who had been to the center of the empire of the east said nothing for a moment he had tied his fortune to this girl and now her inexperience and rashness were begin ning to frighten him there was not time to teach her much i know what i know he said at last she inquired calmly enough and what else do you know of som well i have never seen him enter battle but it is said on good authority that any man who raises a weapon against som finds himself smitten in that very moment with the same wound that he is trying to inflict on hearing this charmians many mirror faces marred their foreheads with thoughtful frowns she said then when i have put my ring of magic through soms nose and led him from his throne how are we to do away with him if no weapon can kill him there may be one ah though what the weapon is i do not know nor does som himself know i believe through the powers that served him hann had recently heard of recent threats to som by some mysterious power of the west threats implying that the one effective weapon was known and would be used when the time came i do not know but i could quickly learn if i was given all the tools and wealth i needed for my work when i am consort of a new viceroy you shall have all you need and more now what else must i know of som before i go to him hann went on worriedly i know by my own nose that there is sometimes the smell of death upon him though when he is inclined to deal mildly with those around him he covers up his stink with perfumes and i warn you when you see him at close range and from the corner of your eye you are liable to see not a mans face but a noseless skull can you smile and coo at that and not show your disgust once more she appeared to be concentrating completely on her reflection adding a final something to her lips i you do not know me hann no i admit that i do not he jumped to his feet again and began to pace two or three strides and turn sharply about two or three more and turn again oh i know that you are able but also that you are very young and from the hinterlands inexperienced and untraveled in the world her mirrors all laughed at him in light and easy con fidence annoyed and worried all the more he pressed on i know back in your fathers little satrapy men were ruining themselves to win your favor some here also but re member that not everyone here will be so easily manipu lated she gave no sign that she had heard he raised his voice a trifle do you suppose you have enthralled and bedazzled me i am your full partner in this enterprise my lady it is magic that is drawing som to you see that you do not forget it you do not know me charmian repeated softly and with that she pushed away her clutter of towels and jars and phials and turned to him from her mirrors the room seemed brighter suddenly even clothed as she was in the loose concealing robe never have i seen said hann in a new distracted voice and after the four words fell silent marveling she laughed and stood up with a single swaying of her hips hann said in a blurred voice wait do not go just yet her lips swelled in a pretended pout ah do not tempt me so sly wizard for you know how weak i am how subject to your every trifling spell and whim only the knowledge that i must go for the sake of your own wel fare enables me to tear myself away and with that she laughed again and vanished behind the screens where her attendants were and hann was left with no more than the memory of a vision by the time she had finished dressing and set out the time of her appointment was near at hand but she did not hurry the audience chamber was not far off on her walk deep into the citadel she was bowed on and escorted by a series of the viceroys attendants some of whom were hu man others were more beastlike or more magical than men and had shapes not commonly encountered away from the black mountains charmian no longer marveled at them like a backwoods girl twice before she had walked this way at her first audience with som nearly half a year ago just after her fathers downfall the viceroy had told her simply and briefly that it suited his purposes to grant her asylum at her second audience she had stood silent and apparently unnoticed amid a number of other courtiers as som announced to them the opening of a new campaign to recover her fathers and the other lost satrapies and par ticularly to crush the archrebel thomas of the broken lands little or nothing had been heard of the campaign since then on neither occasion had som shown her any more interest than he might have bestowed upon an article of furniture she had soon learned from the gossip of the other courtiers that he was dead indeed regarding the pleasures of the body or so they all had thought what would they say today looking into soms great audience hall from just outside the door she was vaguely disappointed to see that it was almost empty then as she was bidden enter by the cham berlain she saw that the viceroy had just finished talking with a pair of military men who were now walking back ward from his presence bowing noisily rolling up their scrolls of maps som was frowning after them charmian could not discern any change since her last audience in the man who sat upon the ebony throne som was a man to all appearances of middle size and middle age rather plainly dressed except for a richly jeweled golden chain around his neck he was rather sparely built and his aspect at first glance was not unpleasant save perhaps for his rather sunken eyes the soldiers backed past charmian and she heard them stumbling and colliding with each other at the doorway as they left but the viceroys aspect softened as bis eyes re focused on her the chamberlain effaced himself and charmian was alone with her high lord in the great room where a thousand might have gathered alone save for a few guardsmen heavily armed and standing motionless as statues and for a pair of squat inhuman guardians she could not tell at once if they were beasts or demons that flanked his throne at a little distance on each side som beckoned to her with a gesture whose slightness she found enviable that of one who knows he has complete attention with humility in every move her eyes downcast steps quick but modest she walked toward him when still at a humble distance she stopped and made obeisance deeply with all the grace at her command all was silent in the vast hall when she thought it time to raise her eyes to the ebony throne som was gazing down at her solemnly with the stillness of a statue or a snake then like a snake he moved with a sudden flowing gesture in his dry strong voice he said charmian my daughter i have come to think of you as in some sense a relative of mine you have lately begun to assume importance in my plans she dipped her eyes briefly and raised them again so might a girl perform the gesture who had but lately begun to practice it before her mirror a perfect imitation of in nocence would never be convincing here she said i hope these thoughts of me are in some measure pleasing to my high lord viceroy come closer yes stand there and when he had gazed upon her from closer range for a little while som asked is it then your wish to please me as a woman it is long since any have done that i would please my high lord som in any way he might desire there was perfume in the hall of high quality cer tainly but stronger than the delicate scent she had put on herself come closer still she did so and sank on one knee before him so close that he might have reached out a hand and touched her face but he did not for just a moment her nostrils caught a whiff of something else beneath the perfume as if perhaps a small animal had crawled beneath the viceroys throne and died my daughter if you will have me so my high lord som or should i now say sister to you charmian as you will have it lord waiting for the next move of the game with her eyes cast down submissively she saw that som had no nose and that his sunken eyes were black and empty holes my woman then well settle it at that give me your hand golden one in all my treasure hoard i have not such gold as you have in your hair do you know that the statement gave her a bad moment of suspicion but when she looked straight at her lord again she saw an or dinary mans face smiling thinly and nodding however she could not hear him breathe and his hand when she touched it felt like meat that had been kept somewhat too long in the kitchen of a palace her hand did not for a moment tense or her face change she would take the fastest surest way to power though it meant embracing dead meat and waking in the morning beside a noseless skull on a fine pillow in his dry voice lowered now he asked her what do you mark about me truthfully and without hesitation she replied that you do not wear the collar of the guard high lord it was a sign that hann had mentioned meaning that som enjoyed some better protection than the valkyries the viceroy smiled and do you know why i wear it not impulsively she answered because you are mightier than death he gave a silent shaking grimace that she realized in a moment was his laughter he said you are thinking that it is because i am already dead but yet i rule and crush my enemies and have my joys dead i have become death rather no weapon no disease not even time has ter rors for me now she only vaguely understood him and she could not think what to reply instead of speaking she bowed her head and once more pressed to her lips the sticky tissue of his hand the viceroy said and all that is mine my golden one i have decided to share with you with unconcealed joy charmian rose in response to the viceroys tug on her hand soms dead hands pulled her to him and she kissed him on the lips or where lips should have been and seemed to be as your willing slave forever gracious lord holding her at arms length now and smiling in great pleasure he said therefore you will become death too these last words of his seemed to stay circling like birds in charmians awareness uncertain whether or not they meant to land when at last they came fully home to her her new triumph was shattered like a glass goblet not yet did her distress show in her face or voice her surface was her strength where terror would reach only when it had already conquered all within she only asked like a girl expressing sweet wonderment at a reward too great i shall become as you are lord even so he reassured her happily patting her hand between his with faint sticking sounds ah i could almost regret such goldenness must perish at its peak like the beauty of a blossom plucked but so it must be for the woman who shares my endless life and power with a shock of terror as sharp as the pain of blade or fire she caught herself barely in time from trying to pull her hands away from his in the back of her mind she was aware that other presences human she thought were coming into the audience chamber but she could pay them no attention now she must express her joyful acceptance of soms offer without the least appearance of hesitation but moment by moment her understanding of his meaning grew more cer tain and her fear grew more intense never for an instant had she expected this she would rather die rather die a thousand times a million times than become as he was she could smile without a tremor at his dead face she could embrace it warmly if she must but to see the like of it in her mirror was unimaginable was fear more pure than she had ever known no longer knowing whether she could conceal her horror faint with the dizziness of it she whispered when why now is anything the matter my high lord charmian could scarcely see would not some crevice open in the earth to swallow her it is only that i would preserve my beauty for you that you may continue to enjoy it he made a gesture of impatience as i said it is annoy ing that your appearance must be so much changed but never mind it is only mortal men who find those super ficialities of great importance what draws me to you is primarily your inner essence so like my own now there is something wrong what is it is the process causing you discomfort the process my high now it happens to me now she was only halfaware of losing control of pulling away from him and moving back a step he peered at her in evident astonishment why yes i am impatient once having decided that you are the one to rule beside me i had the magicians begin the process of your transformation as soon as you entered the chamber already the change is far advanced there was a rush of the world and screaming vaguely charmian realized it was herself who screamed and that the sound of pounding steps on wood and stone came from her own running feet she had no longer any plan no thought except to flee the death that moved and spoke and would engulf her with its own decay a tall shape loomed before her very near she had run into it and rebounded before she saw it was a man and knew his face the living face of chup still mad with panic she tried to run around chup but he caught her by the arm she had never seen his face so hard not even on that day so long ago when he had slapped her now his voice came as if ground out between two stones does it surprise you queen of death to see that i am still alive then charmian understood what chups presence here must mean that all her plotting had been discovered all her hopes destroyed her fear was so extreme she could not move or speak she sank down in a faint before attend ants came to carry her from the chamber som relaxed now upon his throne spent a little time in the enjoyment of his almost silent grimacing laughter chup waited standing motionlessly at attention until the viceroy had composed himself and beckoned him to come nearer my good chup all your warnings to me have been borne out by investigation the wizard hann has been arrested the circlet of the ladys hair has been found where you left it in my treasure vault with no trace visible of how you put it there needless to say my security measures will be extensively revised fortunately i am less susceptible to lovecharms than these unhappy plotters thought so it was shrewd of you to cast your lot with me chup bowed slightly som went on unhappily the man tarlenot has de parted on a couriers mission on empire business it may be difficult to get him in our grasp again but he left be hind him his guardsmans collar which shall be yours along with some substantial military rank for the first time since entering chup allowed himself to smile thats how id choose to serve my high lord som i am a fighter with little taste for these intrigues and you shall have your command the viceroy paused of course there is one matter first your pledging to the east ah said chup to himself without surprise i might have known settling himself still more informally upon his throne som continued you were for some time a satrap in our service were you not but unlike others of your rank you never came here to make a formal pledge that has always seemed to us rather odd there was no satisfying the powers of the east always the certainty of great success was one more step away chup said rather wearily i have been six months a crippled beggar you were a satrap free to come for a much longer time than that soms voice was no longer so relaxed be fore you lost your satrapy there was no good answer chup could give as a satrap he had certainly been busy fighting and he had told himself that he served his masters better in that way than by par taking in mysterious rituals but they had never seen it quite that way now som was looking at him from his sunken eyes and chup thought that he could smell the death the viceroy said this pledging is more important than you seem to realize there are many who ask to bind themselves com pletely to the east to share in its inner powers and are not allowed to do so as a soldier long accustomed to orders and the ways of giving them chup understood that there was but one thing for him to say i ask to be allowed to make my pledge high lord as soon as possible excellent som took from around his own neck a richly jeweled chain which he tossed carelessly to chup as a mark of my good favor and the beginning of your fortune thanks many thanks high lord your face says there is something else you want if i may retain for the time being the lodgings of that treacherous woman and her servants those who had no part in her plotting to this the viceroy assented with a nod the chamber lain was evidently signalling him that other business pressed for with a few quick words he gave chup his dismissal after backing deferentially from the chamber chup hung the chain of soms favor around his neck and made his way to what had been charmians apartment with the chain around his neck he was now saluted by soldiers of the common ranks people of more standing some of whom had not deigned to notice him before now nodded or eyed him with respect and calculation when he reached the apartment he found it swarming with men in black each of whom bore a skull insignia upon his sleeve in the past chup had noticed only a few of these men in the citadel and had not thought of their significance they were searching charmians rooms thoroughly leaving casual wreckage in the process with the air of men well trained for what they were about chup did not attempt to interfere until he found their leader whose sleeve bore a much larger skull this man though he maintained an air of arrogance was like everyone else impressed with the chain that hung about chups neck in answer to chups question he led him to a service passage in the rear of the apartment there chained together sitting huddled against the wall there waited karen lisa lucia portia samantha and kath chup said you may release them on my word i am to occupy these rooms and i will require a good staff familiar with the place to restore order from this mess that you have made they have not been questioned yet the leader of the skullmen said finality in his voice i am somewhat aware of how the plotting went and who was involved as our lord som can tell you these are innocent but they will be here when you want them for your questions it took a little more argument but chup did not lack stubbornness and pride and there was soms favor hanging down upon his chest when the skullmarked men in black at length departed their fruitless searching finished the six girls unchained were left behind when they were alone with him the six of them came slowly to surround chup scarred portia strabismic kath and the other ugly four lucia samantha karen and lisa hanging back a little they said nothing did nothing but gaze at him he bore this silent disturbing scrutiny only briefly be fore issuing curt orders for them to get to work the shortest turned away at once and started in he had to bark com mands and kick a couple of the others to get them moving properly then he walked out into the garden turning ideas over in his mind on the next day soms chamberlain came to chup and with few words led him down into the mountain through devious and guarded tunnels they passed along routes new to chup until the tunnel they were in broke out into the side of a huge and roughly vertical shaft this chimney had the look of a natural formation it was about ten meters wide here at a level well below the citadel it seemed to widen gradually as it curved upward through the rock what must be sunlight came reflecting down through it from what must be an opening at the unseen top beyond a curve a precarious ledge made a narrow pathway going up and down winding round the inside of the shaft at the level where chup and the chamberlain now stood this ledge widened and from it several little rooms like cells had been dug back into the rock and fitted with heavy doors only one of these doors was now closed gesturing at it the chamberlain in the manner of one imparting necessary information said in there lies she who was the lady charmian when chup had nodded his understanding of this fact if not of its importance the chamberlain said quite solemn ly come and started down the rough helix of a path that wound both up and down the chimney chup followed the two of them were quite alone on all the path as far as chup would see peering down a long drop from below round a lower curve in the gradually narrowing chimney there came up a roseate glow as the sunlight came down from above where are we going chup asked the silent figure ahead of him what lies down there the chamberlain glanced back with evident surprise and in a low voice answered below us dwells the high lord zapranoth master of all demons in the domain of som the dead chups feet that had been slowing down now stopped completely what business have we visiting the demon lord why i thought you understood good chup it is the business of your pledging today i will explain how your initiation is to be accomplished i must take you nearly to the bottom to make sure you are familiar with the ground chup drew a deep breath he might have known theyd put demons into this the one peril that could make him sweat from only thinking of it tell me now what is the test to be he listened frowning while the chamberlain told him on the surface of it it sounded easier than chup had ex pected hed have to face zapranoth but not for long and not in any kind of contest on the surface nothing very difficult but there was something wrong about it still scowling chup asked is there not some mistake in this i am to serve som as a fighting man i assure you there is no mistake you will not suffer at the hands of the high lord zapranoth if you do properly what you are sent to do i dont mean that the chamberlain looked at him blankly what then chup struggled to find words but he could not make it clear in his own mind what was bothering him the whole business is not to my liking i think there must be some mistake indeed not to your liking the chamberlains haughty glare could have withered many a man no it is not indeed something is wrong with this scheme why am i to do this because it is required of you if you wish to participate fully in the powers of the east if you cannot give me any more definite reason let us go back to som and i will question him it cost chup some further argument and the nearly in credulous displeasure of the chamberlain but at last he was led upward again and admitted to see som once more this time he found the viceroy apparently quite alone in a small chamber below the audience hall in spite of half a dozen torches on the walls the place seemed dim and cold it was a clammy room nearly empty of furniture except for the plain chair som was sitting in and the small plain table before him on that table there stood upright mirrors and at the focus of the mirrors a candle guttered topped with a wavering tongue of darkness instead of flame casting all around it an aura of night instead of luminance soms face turned toward the candle was all but invisible and what little chup could see of it looked less human than before in answer to the silent interrogation of that face turned toward him chup came to attention in a clear voice he said high lord som i have taken and given orders enough to understand that orders must be followed but when i think an order is mistaken then it is my duty to question it if there is time i question the usefulness of this initiation in the form i am told it is to follow som the dead was silent for a little time as if such an objection were something unheardof and he had no idea how to deal with it but when he answered his dry voice was hard to read what is it you dislike about the pledg ing excuse me high lord som that i dislike it is beside the point i can carry out orders that i find unpleasant but this i see no benefit in this for you for me for anyone that sounded weak excuse me if i speak clumsily i am no courtier yes thats just it high lord i am a fighter what can a thing like this prove of my ability soms voice did not change his face remained unreadable exactly what did my chamberlain tell you was required of you chup stood a little more at ease i am to take the wom an charmian from her cell tell her that im helping her escape then i am to lead her down into the pit where dwells our high lord zapranoth there i am to give her to the demon to be devoured possessed whatever zapra noth may do with human folk the answer was quick and cold the chamberlain spoke our will correctly then that is what we require of you lord chup a good soldier supposing he had ever gotten himself in this deep would know that this was the moment to salute turn and leave chup knew it yet he lingered the hollows of darkness that were soms eyes remained aimed at him steadily then som said the strong magic of a lovecharm once bound you to that woman but my magicians tell me you are free of that what are your feelings for her now in a flash of relief chup understood or thought he did demons im sorry lord do you mean have i affection for her hah thats what youre testing he almost laughed if you want me to feed her to the demons well and good ill drag her to the pit and toss her in and sing about my work in that case what is your objection soms voice was still cold and hard but reasonable i high lord what good will it do to test my skill in lying and intrigue to see if she believes me when i promise to help her youll have other men in your service far more cunning in such matters than i am but youll have few or none wholl fight like me the test seems useless to you then yes sir does a good soldier argue all orders that seem to him useless or as you said before only those that seem mis taken silence stretched out following the question chups stub born dissatisfaction remained but his will was wavering the more he tried to pin down what was bothering him and put it into words the more foolish his objections seemed what harm could he suffer in obediently carrying out this test that could compare with all he stood to gain from it yet encouraged by soms seeming patience he made an effort and tried once more to speak his inner feelings this thing that you would have me do is small and mean then try as he might he could not form his shape less revulsion any further he made a weak and futile gesture and fell silent despite the clamminess of the chamber sweat was trickling down his ribs now his coming here to argue seemed nothing but a hideous blunder why shouldnt he do anything to the woman they wanted done had she bewitched him yet again but no it wasnt that he cared what happened to her the face of som was growing hard to look at and there were no perfumes here but chup was long used to the air of battlefields the viceroy shifted in his seat and lo was very manlike once again the dark flame that had risen burned down to only a spark of night som said my loyal chup as you say your talents are not those of a courtier but they are considerable therefore will i not punish you for this in solent questioning therefore will i condescend this once to explanation the test you do not like is given you because you do not like it because you have shown reluctance to do things that you think of as small and mean to pledge yourself formally to the east is no meaningless ritual in your case it will mean changing yourself importantly and i realize full well it can be very difficult it is to do violence to your old self in the name of that which you are going to become time was stretching on in the odd little room until it seemed to chup almost as if the raw presence of a demon had come to perch between him and som like a man dreaming or entranced chup asked what am i going to become a great lord with the full powers of the east to call upon the master of all that you have ever craved but how shall i change myself to what to become as i am no no not dead and leathery i was playing with the woman when i told her she would be so that is given only to me here in the black mountains i mean you shall become as i am in your mind and inward self now will you take the test my lord i will you are obedient som leaned closer looking intently from his sunken eyes but in your case i wish for more than that loyal chup if you still had some affection for the woman then merely to throw her to the demons might well suffice for your initiation but as things are it is not the woman it is something else within yourself you must de stroy ere you are ours completely som rose from his chair he was not tall but he seemed to tower above chup as he leaned yet closer with his smell of old death you must be for once not brave but cowardly small and mean as you describe it it will be this difficult only once you must learn to cause pain for the sake of nothing but causing pain only thus will you be bound to us entirely only thus will there be opened for you the inner secrets of power and the inner doors of wealth and how can i give command of my guard to one who is not bound to me and to the east the guard yes the present guard commanders aged and scarred well past his peak of usefulness and you know thomas of the broken lands who is planning to assail us here you know him and how he thinks and fights not only an officer but once again the commander of an army in the field my high lord i will do it i hesitate no morel when chup had gone the viceroy returned to brooding on his other problems what power was it almost equal to his own that dwelt in the circlet of gold hair and almost woke in him the old desires of life his wizards would find out in time in all their divinations lately a threatening sign the name of ardneh loomed up from the west a name with nothing real as yet attached to it but it was in that sign they said that the broken lands and other satrapies along the sea coast had been lost chapter it was the hour before the dawn the army of the west was gathered in the moonless night close below the cliffs that supported and protected the citadel of som the dead it had been a long night for the westerners already of traveling by scattered bands and companies in long thin files each man keeping just in sight of the one ahead so that an army was invisibly reassembled here in the shadow of the cliffs a long night already and a longer day about to start thomas had been right about the reptiles rolf was think ing now as he trudged up a small hillock to where his com mander stood looking upward at the black nightshrouded cliffs rolfs breath steamed in the air before his face the onset of winters chill more noticeable at this altitude than it had been near the seashore had kept the reptiles close to their roosts had prevented their scouting out the army of the west during the days as it lay hiding in a hundred fragments night by night they had crept closer to soms citadel rolf reached the spot where thomas stood alone for once his head tipped back there seemed little to be seen gazing upward except the stars above the cliffs whose tops seemed but little below the twinkling sparks i think its going to work rolf reported he then went into some detail while thomas listened rolf had recently been given his first command a work party of men to set in order and inspect the ballooncraft that the djinn pro duced all through this night the technologydjinn had la bored at grays direction making airships loford and the other wizards had concentrated on preventing the armys discovery by demon or diviner dwelling on the cliffs above it seemed that gray had now learned to manage the djinn successfully rolf reported at the foot of the cliffs were twenty balloons tugging gently at their mooring ropes each of the twenty capable of carrying five armed men the balloons were to ascend connected in pairs by stout lines and longer cords would fasten each pair to the ones be hind it and ahead so the hundred men would find them selves together at the top not scattered into ineffectiveness once we begin it it had better work said thomas nod ding when rolf had finished detailing his report thomas himself was one of the hundred men ascending by balloon to seize a foothold on the cliffs to which the rest of the army hopefully could climb rolf was going up to order the maneuvering and landing of balloons and gray as wizard and technologist both the other ninetyseven had been handpicked from the fiercest warriors at first thomas had contemplated lifting his whole army in an aerial assault but testing and maneuvering by night and day on various smaller cliffs between here and the broken lands had dis suaded him the number of things that could go wrong had proven almost limitless and the time available for practicing was not in maneuvers the stunt had been worked success fully with as many as fifteen balloons he had decided to risk twenty and his hundred finest men to seize the upper ending of the pass and hold it open for his army to march up thomas now had nothing more to say rolf who had known him from his earliest days of leadership not so long ago wanted to offer more encouragement but hesitated to interrupt what might be a necessary pause for thought the pause was not long before thomas turned suddenly and strode off down the hill rolf hurried after most of thomass other officers were waiting for him in a body and he strode in among them briskly all here who are supposed to be once more our flares will burn with a green fire to signal you to start to climb the pass well sound horns at the same time as weve rehearsed once you get the word by sound or light or both that weve seized the top of the pass come up as if a hundred demons were behind you instead of waiting for us at the top aye there were sounds of nervous laughter grays tall figure loomed up in one hand he raised what appeared to be a quite ordinary satchel the demons at soms command number far fewer than a hundred and i have the lives of two of the strongest of them in here zapranoth zapranoths life the murmured question came from several of the men at once gray perhaps irritated raised his voice slightly these are the lives of yiggul and of kion i have had them in my possession for some time though for the sake of secrecy i have said nothing about them until now and i have let them live so i can destroy them when som has called them up thrown them into battle and is depending on them i am sure many of you know their names they are both formidable powers there was silence gray lowered his satchel you will see me blow them away like clouds of mist before they have had time to do us the least harm not zapranoths life one lowvoiced listener said no gray snapped his life eludes us still but these two are the strongest of the other demons with these two gone we can beat off the smaller fry like insects my brother and i with other good men here to help us we will not need the lesser demons lives to drive them off there was no comment gray went on a little louder still then with all the others gone we will be free to deal with him myself loford the other stout wizards here zapranoth is mighty well so are we we will hold off him or any other power until your swords have won the day and that we will do thomas put in with great firmness any questions remember what youve been told about the valkyries lets move the light is coming he gripped hands all round with his officers and led the way toward the moored balloons thomas planned to go up with the ninth pair of airships or perhaps the last thinking this would give him the best opportunity of judging if the attack should be abandoned or pressed home rolf trotted to take his place in the basket of the leading balloon he felt weak in the knees as usual before a fight but he knew that it would pass it crossed his mind as he and gray were boarding their separate balloons that he had never seen the wizard sleep if gray felt any fatigue from his nightlong supervision of the djinn he did not show it gray was compelling the djinn to accompany his balloon and had even forced it somehow to dim the intensity of its fiery image rolf could see it like a floating patch of camp fire embers in the shadow of the great hulking gasbag of grays balloon some thirty meters distant tests had shown that the lifting gas provided by the djinn would not burn but the problem of arrowproofing the bags had not been entirely solved they were protected to some extent by draped sheets of chainmail whose rings were lighter than metal made as were the bags themselves of something that the djinn called plastic rolf had argued at some length for using to the full the tremendous powers of the djinn delaying the campaign as long as necessary to exercise its abilities and try out the results it seemed to him that in a few months enough old world arms armor and techniques might be acquired and understood to give the army an overwhelming advantage against the east but gray had vetoed such a plan for two reasons first not all old world devices will work now as neatly and reliably as they did in the old world this is true in particular of certain advanced weapons i do not fully un derstand myself why this should be but i have my means of knowledge and it is so we could experiment with devices far more perilous than balloons no i do not think that we are ready the second reason and perhaps the stronger here gray paused for a moment looking round as if to make sure that he was not overheard is the chance that our djinn will perish in this battle we are facing zapra noth and such a blow is far from impossible it would leave us without help in operating and maintaining our old world weapons no better that we fight with means we under stand depending on no one but ourselves once battle is joined waiting now in the basket for the signal to ascend rolf grinned nervously at the impassive mewick at his side mewick will you one day teach me to use weapons he asked in a low voice it was something of an old joke be tween them for rolf at least mewick could joke but not about his craft of killing he had already taught rolf most of what rolf knew along that line now he only shook his head at rolf in faint reproach and let his expression deepen into gloom the first balloons had their full complements of men aboard the crews who were to do the launching were mov ing about briskly and capably in the gloom it was an army practiced in night actions and many of its men had followed thomas before on seemingly mad assaults they were going forward now like workmen to their trade rolf did not see when thomas gave the final signal for the attack but those who were required to see did so two men standing by the mooring ropes each tugged and re leased a knot and rolf beheld the dim cliffside ten meters from his face begin abruptly to slide down in silence grays balloon kept pace its basket rocking gently the dim fire of the image of the djinn suspended near it the line con necting rolfs balloon to grays drew gently taut then slack ened again the longer lines that the next craft were to follow up were paid out from their reels outside the baskets the edge of sky that rolf could see past the bottom of his balloon was now brightening with a hint of dawn higher the two baskets swung moving in the perfect silence of a dream emerging now from the deeper shadows at the base of the cliffs so that the rocky walls before them grew rapid ly more distinct turning for a moment to the west rolf could see the plains and desert nightbound still stretching far into vague retreating darkness his homeland and the ocean would be visible from here by day but there was no time now to think of that up and up he gave a start that was a literal jump and his drawn sword snapped up in his hand to guard position as the utter quiet was shattered by the strident cawing of a reptile the creature had been dozing on the cliff face a pebbles toss from the balloons and it had wakened to see the strange shapes soaring past sluggish with chill wings laboring it came out in a dark and slow explosion from the rocks and fled them upward strainingly mewick and others who had their arrows nocked were quick to draw and loose at it and it was hit but only hurt it seemed clamoring all the louder it flew on up above the great gasbags and out of sight from somewhere farther up there came a slowvoiced caw ing answer and then another higher yet then there was silence once more until it almost seemed that the citadel might have returned to sleep up and up the men hanging in the baskets straining to see and hear had little to say to one another rolf found himself gripping the baskets wicker rim inside the quilted armorpadding trying to lift the craft into a faster climb he could see gray murmuring to the djinn rolf was expecting that at any moment they would top the cliff but they had not done so before there came sure proof that the enemy had awakened it was a small squadron of reptiles on reconnaissance their cawing and snarling was heard above and then the soft thumps of their bodies striking atop the gasbags the craft continued to rise steadi ly it seemed that the mail of plastic links had proven too tough for reptilian teeth and claws and their bodies were not weighty enough to hold down the balloons perhaps gray had ordered the djinn to pump more lifting gas into the bags when the reptiles flew down below the bags to find the baskets arrows and slung stones bit at them accurately they screamed and raged and fled some fell transfixed by shafts turned into weights with fluttering fringes drop ping through the brightening sky and now came the first sign that soms fighting men were reacting to the attack rolf saw men in blacktrimmed uniforms running on ledges of the cliffs a slung stone thunked on the paddingarmor right in front of him and he crouched lower a furclad northman in rolfs basket loosed an arrow in reply and on the cliff face a man dropped toppled and slid on the steep slope trying to cling to it with the shaft in him plowing up a little avalanche the balloon carried rolf above the scene before he saw its outcome he knew they could not have much farther to ascend but still the top came as a surprise the cliff face ended fell back abruptly into a tableland rough and split by many crevices but essentially flat at the rear of this horizontal reach soms lowwalled citadel sprawled backed by the next leap upward of the mountain across the little distance that separated his balloon from grays rolf heard the wizard barking orders to the djinn the two balloons each trailing a long spiderfilament of line behind it slowed and stopped their ascent just above the rim of the cliff just here almost beneath rolf now the narrow pass delivered the road it had caught up on the plain below this the head of the pass was what the aerial assault must take and hold modest earthworks on one side of the debouching road defended the pass against a climbing army and in fact formed the only real defense short of the citadels own walls these works manned by half a hundred men might easily hold the road it seemed against thomass four thou sand so great was their advantage of position ten or twelve men were in the trenches now pulling on black helmets and gaping confusedly at the balloons their fortification offered no protection against men dropping from the sky gray was smoothly ordering the operations of the djinn gas hissed from the bag above rolfs head the basket he was riding skimmed the rock just in from the cliffs edge he pitched out a metal grapple on a line and leaped right after it the balloon bobbed up with the removal of his weight for a moment he stood there alone the sole invader of soms stronghold but in the moment it took him to catch the grapple and fix it in one of the many crevices in the rock mewick was standing beside him short sword and battlehatchet at the ready then with thudding sandals others were landing at their right and at their left gray swung from his bobbing basket agileseeming as a youth across ten meters of empty ground the ten invaders faced the unfortified rear of the strong point that looked so in domitably down the pass ten blackhelmeted guardsmen more or less stared back as if uncertain they were real excepting rolf and gray the aerial troops had been hand picked for guts and viciousness and those proved first in fighting skill had been selected for the first balloons the struggle for the earthwork began without an order in the space of one short breath and it was over in the time one might draw a long breath and release a sigh only one of the west had been cut down rolf sprang forward with the rest but all the enemy were slaughtered before he had a chance to strike a blow still gripping his unmarred sword he turned to gray the towering wizard with a mo tion of his arm was already sending out the signal of green fire bright as a small sun in the morning sky leaping and shining in the air above the pass rolf turned and cried out sound the horn a north man blood from a scalp wound running in his eyes had the twisting beasthorn already at his lips he gave a nod and winded it with all his might sheathing his weapon rolf ran back to his balloons made them secure with double grapples and deciding where the second pair should land he was none too soon for they were close below and rising rapidly when they arrived he helped to land them pulling on the thin ropes that the first balloons had trailed while their fierce passengers leaped out and set themselves to hold the pass and landing place rolf stayed at the landing place seeing that the new balloons were tied down and looking for the next when he glanced toward the citadel he heard alarms and signals there and saw men running on the walls and reptiles in a sluggish swarm above them the main gates had been open and still were at any moment a force must sally out to push the westerners from the cliff rolf looked the other way down the road that became a twisty ribbon marking the bottom of the pass but the army of the west was still in visible it would be hours before their legs could bring them to this height in the earthworks men had already methodically sepa rated the slaughtered guardsmens heads from their bodies gathered the freed collars and thrown them down the cliff the valkyries coming down from the high mountain hov ered and sniffed but could find no one to save rolf and the others taught by gray to expect the flying things still stared at them rolf with particular fascination again he could not shake the feeling that thomas should have waited to attack delayed his campaign until they could have forced the djinn to give them some far more certain means of winning than balloons demons someone called out it was not an expletive but a warning faces turned to gray he had already seen the disturb ances in the air a little way from the citadel hanging low more like the roiling of heat above fires than like rainclouds opening his satchel he pulled out of it a flowery but weed like little vine wrapped as if for sustenance around a piece of what looked like damp and maggoty wood from some where there came into grays other hand a silverygleam ing knife as the two presences drifted nearer in the lower air sweeping reptiles in a timid swarm before them gray brought the blade near the tender innocent green tendrils of the vine he muttered a few words in a low voice and cut silver flashed in the sky above the citadel like a reflec tion or mirage of an enormous axe the blow that struck one of the demons came in utter silence but was irresistible nonetheless its image in the air split in two spinning halves gray scarcely looked up his hands like those of some aging maddened gardener kept at their work severing and pluck ing leaf from stem slicing splitting and demolishing the vine gray breathed upon the rotten wood and green flame sprouted from it in unburned hands he held it up watch ing the clean flame devour the clinging fragments of the petals leaves and stems yiggul he said with feeling trou ble our fair world no more and he chanted verses in a language rolf did not know fire burned now in the sky as well consuming the scat tered pieces of the demon its companion paused in his advance but then came drifting on again now kion gray addressed the demon remaining let us say farewell to you he reached into his satchel once more the roiling disturbance in the air the size of a small house shook for a moment as if with fear or rage then came toward gray like a hurled missile some of the men around the wizard threw up their arms or ducked their heads others just as uselessly raised shield and blade gray shot forth his arm and the object he had pulled from his satchel it looked like some trinket of cheap metal was held above the chunk of burning wood the hurtling demon was transformed into a ball of glowing heat rolf heard more in his mind than in his ears a scream of pain beyond anything he had yet heard upon the field of war kions course was bent from what he had intended he struck the earth far from the western men spattering flames and rock about his point of impact where he left a molten scar he bounded up again twisting and spinning like an unguided firework and all the while the scream went on unbreathingly and grays unburning hand held the bauble in the fire the metal of it tin or lead mayhap melted in beautiful silvery drops that fell into the flame and there unnaturally disappeared and as the bauble melted so diminished the fireball that had been the mighty demon kion flashing madly from one part of the sky to another until it vanished in a final streak of brilliance gray pressed his hand down on the fiercely burning wood and it went out like a candle what are these others here gray asked in a low voice do they propose to try our strength after what we have just done rolf saw that there were indeed a scattering of other disturbances in the air mansized waverings visible to him only now when the larger two were gone he heard or felt the thrummings of their power alone he might have fallen down or fled be fore the least of them standing here with gray and loford now he found he minded these minor demons no more than so many sweatbees or mosquitoes and now as if they had heard grays challenge and chose not to accept it the swarm of them began to disappear rolf could not have said just how one moment the air above the citadel was thick with them then they were fewer and soon they were no more so then masters of the black mountains mused gray still in the same low tone of conversation that you would not think was audible ten meters off he stood straight dusting his hands absently against one another so do you mean then to let our differences be settled by the sword in the name of my bold companions here i challenge you march out and try with blades to pry us from this rock rolf heard no answer from the citadel only a shouting from behind him where more balloons were ready to dis charge their fighting men he ran back to take charge of the docking thomas in a gleaming barbuthelm had come impatiently ahead of schedule to see what was going on atop the cliff and take charge of the fighting when rolf turned back toward the citadel he could see through the open gates that men were marshalling inside as if to sally out in strength the evidences of confusion had been replaced by the appearance of purpose som is on the battlement said someone see there i think he wears a crown of gold rolf shivered the day was chill winter was near at hand and this place was high if he takes the field warned loford do not strike at him but only ward his blows the wound you would inflict on som the dead is likely to become your own to bear gray too was shivering calling for a cloak of course it should be cold but why should the sun seem dimmer when there were no clouds and rolf had a feeling in his guts like that of being lost alone at night amid a host of enemies and now why should he think there might be something wrong with the mountain that it might crumble and collapse be neath his feet loford thomas all of them were beginning to look at one another with eyes of dread gray in his low voice said zapranoth is coming chapter chup nodded once to the expectantlooking jailor not a guardsman who stood near the door of charmians cell on the wide part of the ledge that wound both up and down the demons chimney there was no one else in sight the man responded with a facial contortion that might represent a smile and took two steps backward to a spot well shaded from the feeble glimmerings of dawn now prob ing down the chimney there he let himself down carefully and lay still only his feet remaining clearly visible to look like those of a man laid low by stealthy violence half a dozen strides brought chup to the cell door where he paused a moment to try the seating of his new sword in its sheath and give a loosening shake to the nervetight muscles of his shoulders he thought in wonder that if he were plotting a real escape for charmian instead of this safe pledging trickery he would not be quite as tense as this he stood his lighted torch against the wall the heavy bar grated as he raised it from the door of charmians cell and he reminded himself to strive more realistically for si lence cautiously he put the key he had been given into the lock and turned it with only a faint squeaking of hinges the massive door swung outward at his pull chups shadow jumping in the torchlight fell before him into the uncleanness of the cell there in his shadow charmian huddled on the floor wearing the same black clothing of her audience with som the shimmering garments slit revealingly seemed wild ly out of place when she recognized chup the sharp terror in char mians face turned dull she had evidently expected visitors even more menacing than he he stepped back from the doorway and said in a low voice come out and quickly when she did not move at once he added im going to try to set you free the words sounded so utterly false in his own ears that it seemed to him impossible for clever charmian to believe them for a moment but she stood up and came toward him though hesitantly at first her blond hair hung dis heveled halfconcealing her face without a word she came out of the cell and stood against the wall her face averted from him while he played the game of dragging the sham ming guard into the cell and barring up the door again then at a motion of chups head she followed close behind him as he set foot upon the path that spiraled downward through the chimney chup had picked up his torch again and it was useful now though the trickle of morning light was slowly brightening how could she have believed him but whether she did or not she was following they had gone down perhaps two hundred paces when charmian in a small voice broke the silence where are we going he answered without turning we must go down in order to get out her footsteps behind him stopped but down there is where the demons nest there is no way out down there startled he too stopped and turned how do you know have you come this way before she in turn seemed to be startled by the question no no how could i have uncharacteristically she was not looking directly at him then follow me he growled and turned away and started down again after a moment her soft footfalls fol lowed she must believe his masquerade or she would be screaming at him or pleading but the evidence of success brought him no satisfaction pretending to be cautious and alert looking this way and that pausing now and then as if to listen he led her down toward the pit he felt weary and awkward he was not cut out for this game it will mean changing yourself som had said you must do violence to your old self yet what he was supposed to do was basically quite simple and on the surface there was nothing in it difficult for a bold man he was to bring her down by fair words and promises not by force that had been emphasized to the demonlords chamber at the bottom of this hole there where she ex pected a door to freedom he was to give her to the demon and then he was to run away if he did not run away and briskly the chamberlain had warned him zapranoth in his demonic humor might nip him too his pledging was a task for one who giggled and ran away and chup now liked it less than ever he did not see how he could succeed how charmian could fail from one moment to the next to guess the truth well let her but no she followed him obediently he realized suddenly how desperate she must have been how ready to grasp at any hope his pretended alertness suddenly became real from be low where all had been ominous silence there arose now a murmuring strange sound which he did not at once identify but which he did not like the first whisper of it froze charmian in her tracks be hind him demons she whimpered in a voice of certainty and resignation chup had been assured there would be no interference no distractions while they were going down he took a step back fighting his own fear of demons trying to think think ing was not easy the sound grew rapidly louder and at the same time more plainly wrong it put chup in mind of the gasping of some unimaginable animal it made him think of a terrible wind come blowing through the solid earth now there was a light below a pinkish glow as well as sound chup could make no plan as if by instinct seeking each others humanity he and charmian put their arms around each other and crouched down on the narrow path the sound was almost deafening now a climbing clamor flying upward from the pit with it came the aura of sick ness that accompanied demonic power an aura stronger than chup had ever felt before the brightening roseate light seemed to quench the torch that he had dropped and to drive back the feebly growing glimmerings of the sun he clenched his eyes shut held his breath and the rush as of a multitude of beings passed by them and was gone demons charmian once more whimpered yes oh it seems that i remember them rushing by me in this place but how what do you remember have you been down this pit he rasped at her he wondered if she was planning some deception but she only shook her head continuing to avert her face he pulled her to her feet and led her down the curving path once more what else could he do his torch was gone but there was daylight enough now trickling down to show the path they came to a doorway but when he peered in there was nothing but an alcove no way out no way out but he must go on to pass his pledging to reach the power of the inner circles of the east what else could he do down and down they went though very slowly now soon it began again the noise far down below the climbing fast it is zapranoth said charmian this time a bass quaver that told of madness rampant in the foundation of the world this time the whole world shud dered and sickened with the coming up and the light it cast before was blue and horrible charmian began to scream lord z chup grabbed her stifling her mouth beneath his palm and cast himself and her once more down upon the narrow curving ledge this time at full length with both their faces turned toward the wall of rock with a twisting and a stretching of the universe with impacts of great footfalls smit ing air and rock the blaring glaring lord of demons tram pled past them if they were seen they were ignored as two ants might have been chup did not see the demon his eyes had shut them selves and at the moment of the demons closest presence all his bones seemed turned to jelly this must be zapranoth against this no use to think of showing bravery compared to this the demons rising earlier had been small and the demon who days ago had entered his beggars hovel to heal and threaten him that one had been a nasty child making faces nothing more when the world was still and sane and tolerable once more he raised his head gripped charmian by the hair and turned her face toward him how did you know that it was him from far away when first he started up she looked convincingly bewildered i dont know my lord chup i do not know by his sound but how could i have heard him met him ever and forgotten it you are right i knew at once that it was he but i dont know how i knew chup got slowly to his feet there was one small comfort the game he was to play could not proceed until the demon lord came back from whatever unforeseen errand had called him out chup would have to find some means of stalling until then but at the moment he could think of no plausible excuse for staying where they were slowly he led char mian downward once again they had gone but two more turns around the gradually narrowing chimney when there came a different and more human sound from far above it was faint but to chups ears unmistakable the cry and clash of men at war chup listened knowing now what had called the demons forth no one in the citadel had thought it possible for thomas to make a direct assault well it was not the first time he had been underestimated so the wait for zapranoth might prove to be a long one though it seemed a safe prediction that he ultimately would return triumphant it was hard to imagine that thomas could raise a power equal to the demonlord even if he could get his army up the pass chup grinned the way he did when he felt pain he led charmian on down until they came to another doorway into another blind alcove there he took her by the arm and pulled her in what is it she whispered terrified anew nothing just that we must wait a bit he expected her to ask him why and wondered how he could answer but she only stood there with her eyes down cast face halfhidden by her hair surely this behavior was a pose part of some plan she was evolving he had seen her terrified before but never meek and silent considering what to do next he sat down with his back against the wall watching the entrance to their alcove al most timidly she slid down beside him in her new small voice she said lord chup when i was in the cell i hoped it would be you who came for me he grunted then asked why oh not that you would come to help me i didnt dare hope that even now but i knew that if you came to take revenge you would be quick and clean about it not like som not like any of the others he grunted again suddenly anxious to know what it would feel like now freed of all enchantments he pulled her near so that their mouths and bodies were crushed together she gasped and tensed as if surprised and then responded with all her skill and much more willingness than ever before and he discovered that to him the touch of her meant nothing it was no more than hugging some huge breathing doll he let her go to his surprise she clung to him it seemed that she was weeping he had never seen her do this act before puz zled he waited to learn its point now between her sobs she choked out you you find me then not too much changed changed then he remember certain things that made a pattern with the pieces of her puzzling behavior and sud denly that behavior was understandable no no you are not changed at all our mighty viceroy was lying about the destruction of your beauty you look as good as ever except for a little dirt for the first time in a long while chup could hear his own voice as an easy natural thing charmian stared at him for a moment and dared to believe him her sobs changed abruptly into cries of joy and relief oh chup you are my lord my high and only lord she choked on fragments of strange laughter feelings chup had not known were his came fastening on him now like mad familiars he could not sort them out or put them down he groaned aloud jumped up and pulled charmian to her feet he seized her shoulders grip ping them until it seemed that bones might crunch while she gasped uncomprehendingly then still holding her with his left hand he drew back his right and swung it open palmed but with all his rage that for betraying me for using me for trying to have me killed the blow stretched her out flat and silenced all her cries a little time passed before she stirred and groaned and sat up for once ungracefully her hair no longer hid her face blood dripped from her mouth and there was a lump already swelling on her cheek she finally could ask him in the most dazed and tiniest of voices why now why hit me now why better late than never i take my revenge my own way as you said not like som nor any of the others here gripping his sword hilt he looked out of the alcove up and down the spiral path let them come against him now he was chup his own man and so he meant to die when he saw no understanding in her dazed face he went on shake your head and get it clear i was not to lead you out of this foul place i was to play the court jester for som and zapranoth thus should i prove my fitness to join the elite of the east no a free mans service they will not have they must have pledgings and grovelings and for all i know kissings of their hinder parts as well then will they open to their tested slave the secrets of pow er and the doors of wealth so they say liars gigglers at cripples and pullers of wings from flies i know not if som stinks of death or only loadbeastdroppings he felt better for that lengthy speech and better still for the action that had just preceded it now there ensued a silence while his breathing slowed and charmians grew steadier and she ceased to moan and now once more he heard from far above the clash and cry of many men at arms charmian her voice now nearly normal asked is that thomass assault we hear the one our generals thought could not be made chup grunted they of the west bear me great hatred charmian said but if ive any choice ill go to them instead of som youd be wise if you could do so they in the west are living men and many would fall down swooning at a flutter of your eyelids what is it now some thought or memory had brought a look of new surprise into her face chup i have never been down into this cave before and yet i think i have things as they hap pen seem familiar the winding path these alcoves the sounds the demons make in passing and the feelings that they bring the wretched feelings most of all she shivered but how can i have known them and not remember plain ly his thought was practical if you have been in this cavern or seen it in some vision then remember a way out of it that we can use she gave him a long probing look with something in it of her old haughtiness her bruised face did somewhat spoil the effect have you finished now with taking your revenge on me i have more important things to think of getting out of here now that ive spoiled my pledging yes ill help you out if youll help me but turn treacherous again and ill kick you down the pit at once she nodded to him soberly then ill help you all i can for i know what to expect from som what must we do you ask me i thought you might recall an exit from this hole and quickly while the battles fierce were probably forgotten doubtfully and anxiously she stared at him and through him i think whether it is memory or a vision that i have i think that there is no way out for us below her voice grew dreamy at the bottom of this chimney there are only huge blind chambers in the blackened rock and strange lights and the demons roaring past i would have run back screaming but my father gripped my she broke off with a little cry her blue eyes widening your father led you down here ekuman chup did not bother trying to understand that if it was part of some new and elaborate deception he could not see the point of it he prompted how did you get out if theres no way below we must go up again where does the top of this shaft break out of the mountain she had to make an effort to recall herself to answer him i dont know i dont think that i was ever at the top of this chimney it seems to me we entered and left it at the level of the cells chup why would my father bring me here not answering chup led her out of the alcove and started on the long ascent at a good pace little was said between them until they drew near the level of the cells again here chup proceeded cautiously but there was still no one else in sight the cell that had been charmians was once more unbarred and open every available man must have been mobilized to fight but how long that situation might last was impossible to guess he gripped charmian by the arm you say you entered and left the shaft here remember a way out of the citadel that we can use i she rubbed her head wearily i can remember no such way we should go on to the top there must be some exit there to sunlight if not freedom the demons at least went out that way chup went up quickly the occasional sounds of combat were noticeably louder here still they met no one the chimney widened around them as they climbed passed more and more below them and straightened to show them the grayblue sky over a mouth ringed by ragged outcroppings of rock the path seemed to go right up to the mouth and out to unbarred freedom chup and charmian had only one more circuit of the chimney to climb to its outlet barely ten meters above them when there appeared there against the sky the head of a man in guardsmans helm and collar looking down before chup could react in any way the man had seen them he called out something as if to others behind him and withdrew from sight perhaps i should go first suggested charmian in a whisper i think so he would rather not try to fight his way up this narrow path against unknown odds ill walk a step behind you as your aide it was unspoken between the two of them that the men above could not be certain of chups and charmians current power and status not even if they knew she was a prisoner last night so things went in the intrigueridden courts of the east charmian ran combing fingers through her hair put on a smile and took the lead with chup following impas sively they marched another halfturn up the chimney which brought them into plain view of the pathways narrow exit at the top and of the men who guarded it these were looking down with to say the least considerable suspicion there were eight or ten of the guard in view and chup noted with inward discouragement that they included pike men and archers anger in her voice charmian called up to them you there officer why do you stare in insolence bring cool water to me we have slipped and fallen and nearly killed ourselves upon your miserable path for there must be an explanation of her soiled garments and of chups anger marked upon her cheek and lips the faces of the soldiers turned from hard suspicion to noncommittal blankness on chups breast the chain that som had given him still swung massive and golden and he made sure it could be seen at the same time he favored the officer with his best haughty and impatient stare the guards officer a lieutenant softened considerably from his first hard pose he could not keep his new per plexity from showing my lady charmian i had heard that you he shifted his stance that is you or no one else is to be allowed to pass this way according to the orders i have been given the lady wanted a good look at the fighting chup said guiding her forward with a touch from the way some of the soldiers kept glancing over their shoulders he guessed that the action was in plain sight from where they stood the lieutenant protested lord why did you not watch from the battlement instead but he made no attempt to block their way instead he turned to one of his men order ing here find some water for the lady charmian and chup had now come right up to the top of the path and stood among the soldiers they had emerged in the midst of the broken plain roughly halfway between the citadel and the sudden dropoff of the cliffs looking out over a breastwork of piled rocks they had a good view of the fighting perhaps three hundred meters distant the fight was not at the moment being carried on with blades but it was none the less a deadly struggle hold ing the roadhead at the pass were some fourscore men of the west chup saw along with the balloons that he guessed had somehow allowed them to surprise the defenders the guard or most of it was drawn up on the plain in battle ranks but only waiting now above the ground between the battle lines drifting like some foul cloud of smoke was zapranoth the power of the demonlord was being turned away from chup but still he thought he felt its backlash here and looked away to ward the citadel small figures were on the parapet he thought he could see som above the fort a single valkyrie droned toward its lofty home charmian finished her thirsty drinking from a canteen handed to her by an awkward soldier oh captain she now smiled dabbing prettily at her sore lips i had heard you were a man of gallantry and i believed it true and i have climbed that horrible path to reach you i wish to see the ending of the battle close at hand not stand with all the timid females behind a wall surely if i go out a little way a little closer i will still be safe with you and all these stalwart men of yours at hand i the lieutenant floundered trying to be firm it was so easy for her chup marveled in silence shaking his head slightly while he took his turn at the canteen distant guardsmen chanted a war cry and somewhere a reptile cawed charmian was going on we do not mean that you should leave your post the lord chup will go with me but a little way out upon the plain here i will tell you the truth there is a wager involved and i feel i must reward you if you can help me win it the lieutenant had no more chance than if chup had come upon him here unarmed and alone in the space of half a dozen more breaths charmian was being helped over the barricade of stones her escorting lord beside her as they walked out upon the empty creviceriven field that stretched away toward the fighting he heard the reptile again cawing somewhere behind them and this time he thought he could make out a word or two within its noise chup took his bride by the arm as if to steady her on the hazardous ground and she heeded the silent increase of his fingers pressure they walked faster with a stride and a stride and another stride the barricade the soldiers and the power of the east fell meter by meter behind them not that the way in front was clear escaaaaped came the raw reptile cry much louder now rewaaards for their bodies double reward for them alive trrraitor chup of the northern provinces prisoners escaped charrrmian of the broken lands chup ran dodging with every second or third stride to spoil the archers aim charmian close behind him screamed as if they had caught her already now ahead of him there loomed across his way a chasm one of the splits that ran in deeply from the mountains edge it was too wide at this point for even a desperate man to try to jump the farther chup ran the more treacherously uneven grew the footing and he dropped to all fours to scramble over it even as an arrow sang past his ear from the officers bawled orders not far behind he knew that close pursuit was right at hand the reptile now shrieked in triumph right above him char mian cried out her panic with each breath but her cries stayed right at chups heels he reached the edge of the deep crevice to follow along it on this footing of broken tilting rocks would be a slow and tortuous process and the pursuit could not fail to catch up to easy arrow range at once to jump across the chasm was impossible to attempt to scramble down its nearly vertical side would have seemed at any other time like madness but now chup unhesitatingly began to slide and grab better a quick fall than the demonpits below the cita del but all was not lost yet on a slope this steep there must be overhangs to offer some protection against missiles from above and chup could see now that at the distant bottom the crevice ran out in a dry watercourse and got away from som chup swung from handholds danced and bounded leap ing down the slope another arrow twirred past him going almost straight down and after it the hurtling blur of an almostsilent rock he started falling slid and grabbed in desperation and got his feet upon a ledge that was not much wider than his soles a moment later he was clutched by charmian sliding down beside him and almost pulled into the abyss to his left the ledge all but vanished then widened into what looked like opportunity a sizable flat spot under a large overhang with charmian still clutching at his garments he lunged that way somehow the two of them scrambled to that spot of comparative safety on foot holds that would have been suicidal if attempted with cold calculation they were sheltered from missiles on a flat space big enough to sprawl on carelessly while they gasped for breath somewhere ten or twenty meters above them but out of sight the lieutenant was bawling out a confusion of new orders the reptile found them almost instantly it hovered over the chasm on deft and leathery wings screaming its loathing and alarm carefully staying out farther than a sword might sweep charmian with a wide swing of her arm threw out a fistsized rock through luck or skill it caught a wing the beast screamed and fell away struggling in pain to stay in the air but it had already screamed out their location to the men above chup stood up and drew his sword and waited for the men to come from the renewed sounds of battle farther off he soon picked out a closer sound the scraping and sliding of sandalled feet on rock too desperately concerned with footholds to be completely furtive both sides charmian cried out a man was sliding down toward them on each side of their almost cavelike shelter but each attacker had to think first of his own foot ing chup put the first one over easily before the man could do more than wave his arms for balance then turned quick ly enough to catch the other still at a disadvantage this one going over dropped his sword and managed to catch himself with his hands only his fingers showed clinging stubbornly to the ledge until charmian screaming pounded and shattered them with a rock chup sat down once more to rest and wait to charmian kneeling beside him he said theyll have a hard time get ting at us here so they may just wait us out he leaned out for a quick glance at the slope below them it was worse than that above i dont suppose you got out by this route the last time you were here i dont know somewhat to chups surprise she lost herself again for a time in silent thought i was only a child then twelve years old perhaps my father led us her face turned up wideeyed with another shock of mem ory my sister and i my sister carlotta i have not thought of her from that day till this carlotta i had forgotten that she ever lived so but how did you get out down this cliff some how wait let me think how very strange so many memories wiped out she was six years younger than i now it comes back my father took us both down the long spiral path into the demon chambers at the bottom there he pushed us both forward so we fell and he turned and ran away himself lying on the warm rocks i twisted round to look and saw his flying robes while carlotta lay beside me crying ah yes that would have been my fathers initiation his pledging to the east ah yes i understand it now what happened charmian almost calmly now stared into the depth of time we lay there frightened and before we could get up he came for us he lord zapranoth our father for his initiation had to give us to the demonlord charmians eyes now turned on chup but still her mind was in the past lord zapranoth reached for us and i jumped to my feet and took carlotta and pushed her in front of me and i cried out take her i am yours already already i serve the east charmian gig gled a pearly ripple of pure music yet it made chup draw back slightly i cried now take carlotta as my pledging and zapranoth stayed his hand that had been reaching for us charmians merriment faded suddenly and then he laughed that was a thing most horrible to hear then he put out his hand again and stroked my h breaking off with a little shriek charmian clutched at her golden hair that hung disheveled before her eyes as if it were some alien creature settled on her head then she recovered herself somewhat brushed back her hair and let it go yes zapranoth stroked my hair and later when elslood tried to make a lovecharm from it she stopped all elsloods magic was confounded and reversed chup finished and he and every man who carried the charm was drawn to you by it but never mind that now he put out his hand slowly not quite far enough to touch the gold that he had handled with rough carelessness not long ago he said do you suppose that on that day the demonlord might have left this life in this the thought was no surprise to charmian no chup no hann examined my hair closely when we were planning how best to use the charm trying to find the source of its unusual power hann would have found a demons life if it were there we could have made the demonlord our servant she smiled no zapranoth would not have been fool enough to give his life into my keeping he understood me far too well when he had touched my hair he said to me go freely from this cave and serve the east it has great need of such as you yes now all the memories come back my father was much amazed when i caught up with him much amazed to see me and not entirely pleased oh he looked back hopefully enough to see if my sister had also been released she was the one he favored truly cared for but her the demon kept and i think my father also was made to forget what happened here at least he never spoke of it or of carlotta chup what is it he had gotten to his feet as if to face the enemy again but he did not raise his weapon only stared down fixedly at charmian without taking his eyes from her he sheathed his sword and gripped her hands and pulled her to her feet she twisted as if expecting another blow but he only held her fast demanding tell me this what was his aspect when you saw him then whose zapranoths chups voice had dropped until it was not much louder than a whisper what did he look like then what form did he take his eyes still bored relentlessly at her why the form of a tall man a giant in dark armor it matters little what form a demon takes i knew him today even at a distance because the feeling he brought with him the sickness was the same yes yes he let her go caught by a powerful thought he turned away then turned right back you said that she was six years old your sister when the demon took her i dont know about that yes and was she fair of face some thought so yes that could be changed a small thing for the demon lord he murmured staring past her into space what was the season of the year chup i what does it matter now i tell you it does matter now he glared at charmian again she closed her eyes and lined her perfect forehead with a frown then opened them and looked at him warily it must have been six years ago i think no it was in spring six and a half years ago to this very season i do not think i can calculate it any more closely enough chup slapped his hands together rough triumph in his face and voice it must be so it must be the young fool said she came to them in springtime what are you babbling of charmians temper edged her voice how can this help us now i dont know yet what happened to your sister before chup could finish the question there came a faint sound behind him and he had turned sword drawn and ready but the shape that dropped now to the narrow ledge was not a soldier and did not seem menacing it was only a small brown furry creature half the length of a sword from head to tail chupchupchupchup stretched as if in supplication on the ground just outside of thrusting range it opened a harmlesslooking flattoothed mouth to make a noise be tween repeated gasps and hiccups it took chup a moment to understand this was a repetition of his name chupchupchup the high lord draffut bids you come the creatures speech was almost one long word like some thing memorized and all but meaningless to the speaker a beast as small as this one could not have much intelligence i should come to the lord draffut chup demanded where how chup come chup come tell man chup now he is hunted the high lord draffut bids him come to sanctu ary haste and tell man chupchupchup how am i to come to him where show me the way as if to show chup how the little fourfooted animal spun around and bounded off going up the side of the cliff again with ease darting between rocks where a man could not easily have thrust an arm chup took one step and then could only stare after it hoping it might realize he could not follow he turned to charmian how do you reckon that if its a trap the baits being kept safely out of my reach so distant i cant grab for it she shook her head and seemed both envious and mysti fied it seems that you are genuinely offered sanctuary ive heard that the small animals run the beastlords errands now and then does draffut know you as an enemy of demons that might account for it before he could reply there came again the whispery slide of men trying to get at them from the right and from the left perhaps they had seen the little messenger run past and feared their prey was plotting an escape as be fore chup smote the foe upon his right before the man could get his weapons up this time the man on the left side was impeded by charmians falling at his feet she had ducked for safety and lost her footing and now she was clutching at her enemys ankles while he was forced to concentrate on chup much good his concentration did him with his feet immobilized chups swordpoint tore him open and he toppled charmian let go his ankles quickly as his weight cleared the edge chup spun back purposefully to the man he had struck down upon his right it was the lieutenant of the guards whom they had duped into letting them pass he now had dropped his weapons and clung with bloodslippery fin gers to the rock chup cautiously pulled him in from the brink and cut his throat charmian watched at first without understanding as chup continued cutting through the neck gorily separating head from body when the seamlesslooking collar of old world metal was free he wiped it clean on the lieutenants uniform and held it up with two motions of his foot he sent the headless body into the abyss by now she understood or thought she did anger was in her voice perhaps from envy or from fear of being left alone you are a fool the valkyrie will take no unhurt man to the lord draffut and none who does not wear the collar properly around his neck you are not entirely right in that my lady i have talked with the soldiers the valkyries will take a man whose collar is off provided he is so wounded that his head is severed from his trunk and now her face showed that she fully understood his plan her anger grew not every dead man is brought to lord draffuts domain in time to be restored nor heals prop erly nor has a personal invitation from the high lord draffut listen lady i think you will not be worse off if i go if more soldiers scramble down here you may do as well with your eyelashes and sweet voice as i would with a sword as things stand now you cant get out of here that was true now she was listening he pressed on your situation may be greatly helped if i can go what i was saying when the animal came is more important now than ever what happened to your sister the lord of demons took her as i said devoured her i suppose you saw the tall black man do that i no he laid his hand upon her and her screams were quieted i did not linger to see more with a quick movement chup reversed his sword and held the pommel of it out to charmian take this she stood in hesitation chup said if the beastlord hates demons as you say i had better go to him and quickly why to tell him where to find the life of zapranoth now take this and cut off my head holding out the sword and waiting chup felt content true she might murder him for good or his plan might fail for other reasons but since he had turned his back on som and on the east he felt like his own man again and that feeling was enough perhaps it was all that a man like him should try to get from life he fought on now to win to live because that was his nature but he was tired and saw no future beyond this battle death in itself had never been a terror for him if it came now well he was tired half a year of paralytic near death he had endured out of sheer pride unwillingness to give in then when as if by miracle his strength and free dom had been returned to him he had come near throwing them away again to serve the east and why what power or treasure could they offer that was worth the price they asked strike off my head he said to charmian a valkyrie must be coming for this collar by now thered be one al ready here if they werent having a busy day she was still hesitating fearing hoping thinking des perately deciding what course was best for her own welfare she reached out and took the sword then asked him where is the demons we concealed lady i would not trust you with my beheading save that you must see how it is in your own interest for me to reach draffut with what i know if we can kill or threaten zapranoth and tip the battle to the west then you may sit here safely until som is no longer dangerous unless of course you would rather bear the message in which case i must cut off your no i thought not he turned and knelt down slowly face toward the cliff charmian was at his right holding the long blade point down on the ground he said now about this little surgery i need i suppose a single stroke would be too much to ask for but more than two or three should not be needed the blade is heavy and quite sharp without turn ing to see her face he added you are most beautiful and most desirable by far of all the women i have ever known from the corner of his eye he saw charmian losing her hesitation gathering resolve straightening her thin wrists in a tight twohanded grip to lift the weapons weight chup studied the details of the rock wall straight before him he had knelt down facing this way so that his head would not roll over enough of that he was chup he would not even close his eyes on its way the sword sang thinly his muscles cried for the signal to roll away his nerves screamed that there was still time to dodge his ruling mind held his neck stretched and motionless chapter out near the middle of the tableland that divided the forces of the east and west in a part of the rough plateau that was shattered and split into a dozen peninsulas divided by abyssal crevices the high lord zapranoth came bursting up into the morning air like some foul pall of smoke from a huge chimneyopening in the ground rolf turning from his work of grappling down great gasbags looked up at zapranoth and saw that which made him squint his eyes half shut and turn away though he could not have said what it was about the smoke that was so terrible looking around him he saw that all the other soldiers of the west had been compelled to drop their eyes before that image and so it was with all their minor wizards also only gray and loford who now stood beside his brother faced the demon with their heads raised and eyes wide open they were standing in the rear of the invaders little line near rolf and the balloons looking up at the great flying devices in his charge rolf saw the smoky image of the technology djinn fluttering and darting to and fro above the gasbags like some frantic bird between the bars of an invisible cage now gray raised both his arms and something changed looking back rolf saw that before the face of zapranoth there had appeared a haze or reflection of light gray a screen as insubstantial as a rainbow but as persistent it stood steadily before the demon as he drifted gently nearer now it was possible for the soldiers of the west to look to ward him and toward the citadel where now the guard and its armed auxiliaries were pouring out quickmarch through the open gate arrows began at once amoving both ways across the field when the guard quick and practiced had finished its deployment in four ranks rolf guessed there might be near a thousand of them he was too busy to give much time to pondering the odds for the last balloons were landing now and he and his assistants had all they could do with work and dodging arrows each wore on his left arm a light shield woven of green limber branches such shields were thought capable of squeezing and stopping piercing shafts that could bite through a coat of mail sound the trumpet once more thomas now ordered with a shout turning back his big head in the gleaming barbuthelm the northman with the horn his head now bandaged turned back in turn to face the pass its thread of road still empty and once more blasted out the signal this time there came an answering horn from down the pass though it sounded dishearteningly far away there is our army coming friends thomas shouted in a great voice to his hundred men lets see if we can do the job before they get here as if the distant horn had been a signal for them too the guard swayed now in formation to the shouting of its officers and as one man stepped forward to attack at a range of a hundred fifty meters there came from their rear ranks a volley of arrows rolf and those around him finished at last with tying down balloons took up their weapons and moved into their places for the fight some holding large shields raised them to protect gray and loford the two wizards still were standing motionless and gazing steadfastly upon the ominous but also nearly motionless bulk of zapranoth high in the air above the middle of the field loford was swaying slight ly on his feet there was no other overt sign as yet of the struggle of invisible powers that had been joined the horn from down below within the pass now sounded once more noticeably closer and again as if its signal had been meant for them the guard of som the dead began to run and came on in a yelling charge the broken ground delayed them and unequally so that their lines were bent rolf with bow in hand and arrows laid out before him on the ground knelt in the middle of a line of archers taking his shafts up one by one he did his best to make them count he took little time to aim but loosed into the oncoming swarm of men in black nocked and drew and loosed again the air was thick with dust and missiles and his targets moved confusingly so it was difficult to tell what damage his own shots were doing certainly many of the west were shooting to good effect for the ranks of black were thinning as they came a steady droning sprang up in the air above as the valkyries whirred and blurred industriously to their work in madly methodical calm they dipped into the fury of the fight below to lift the fallen warriors of som and take them to the high place of the high lord draffut some machines flew through the image of the demonlord with no awareness shown on either side it was as if each were unreal to the other and only men must know and deal with both rolf and the other bowmen fired rapidly until their arrows were all gone if this attack was not stopped there would be no need to worry about the next the man next to rolf went down killed instantly by a flung stone others were falling in the western ranks but those thin lines did not pull back behind them was the cliff edge or defeat and death retreating down the pass they braced themselves instead and readied pike and battleaxe and sword by now some of the enemy were come so close to rolf that he could hear them gasping with their running and excitement and see the hair on hands that lifted swords to strike a mass of them was charging in at rolfs part of the line to get at the balloons he thought rolf threw his bow behind him and rose up in a crouch shield on arm and sword in hand and now the mass of black its decimated ranks dis solved into a howling mob was just before him an east ern officer marked by the plume upon his helmet came run ning past in front of rolf with great armwavings urging his men on rolf leaped forward to get in striking range but was checked by another guardsman charging at him this foe was running blindly berserk with battle already his eyes seeming to look unseeing through rolf even as he swung a manypointed mace at him rolf dodged back then stepped in not as neatly as the nimblest warriors could but well enough to avoid this weapon only halfcontrollable before the mace could be swung back rolf cut his sword into the guardsmans running legs felt shin bones splinter saw the man go plowing forward on his face now on rolfs left one of the northmen started his own countercharge striding into the foe making a desert round him with a great twohanded blade those of the enemy who did not fall back before this giant tried to spread around him and get at him from the sides rolf hung back a step until he had outflanked the liveliest of these flankers then lunged in for the kill the man was more than half armored but rolfs sword point found a soft place in be tween the hipbone and the ribs as that man fell another came but this one straight at rolf this new opponent was the better swordsman but rolf would not yield an inch he warded one stroke after another somehow until the northmans long sword on its backswing wounded his enemy from behind the odds were more than evened and the foe went staggering back until the ranks of black had hidden him then all at once there were no more of the enemy menac ing but only the retreating horde of their black backs what what is it rolf demanded mewick had come from somewhere and had taken him by the arm bind it up mewick was saying what all the world for rolf was still quivering with the shock of battle he could not feel nor hear nor think of anything else you are hurt see here not bad but we must bind it up ah looking down rolf saw that it was so a small gash on the upper part of his left arm was running blood though he could not feel the slightest pain his shield woven of green limber withes that had been on his left arm was all but gone now hacked to bits he could not recall now which of his enemies had dealt these blows nor how he had avoided being killed by them the soldiers on both sides were reforming lines just out of easy arrow range and binding wounds and while the valkyries went droning on without rest or hesitation some men of the west hurried at thomass orders to behead the enemy who had fallen among them gather their metal col lars and throw them over the cliff this was the only way they had discovered to prevent their foemens restoration no blow from any weapon that a man could wield could stay a valkyrie from gathering up a fallen man the western ers learned this quickly and then saved their breath and effort and the edges of their blades they only grumbled and dodged the vicious blurring rotors that smashed the pikemens weapons down and broke their fingers when they tried to interfere one of mewicks countrymen was calling look our boys in sight now at the bottom of the pass look men turned and gathered looking down the pass rolf joined them his arm now bandaged and his mind a little clearer he felt no great emotion at the sight of reinforce ments coming theyre running now that theyre in sight said someone but it seems theyve been all day about it only a few in sight yet with light weapons the mass of em are still far down there was short time to celebrate even had there been greater inclination the guard was fast reforming their ranks while thinner than before were still impressively su perior in size to those of the invaders whose small force seemed to rolfs eyes to have been drastically diminished he started to count those still on their feet and then decided he would rather not men were looking up now once again the demonlord was drifting slowly closer his image rolling like a troubled cloud the screen of protective magic that gray had thrown up before zapranoth yielded to the demons pressure but stayed squarely in his path neither loford nor gray had ducked or dodged or moved a hand to save themselves as yet but they had survived the storm of missiles through the fight around them tall protective shields had been held up by the minor wizards who had abandoned any thought of dueling zapranoth themselves and by others more than one had fallen by stone or arrow of the men protecting gray and loford with their shields neither one of the two strong wizards had been struck by any material weapon but anyone looking at their faces now might think that both were wounded a darkness like the dying of the sun fell round the two tall magicians now it was the shadow cast by zapranoth as he loomed nearer and now for the first time on this field his voice came booming forth are these the wizards of the west who seek to murder me ho gray where is my life will you pull it out now from your little satchel still the thin gray screen before him held but now it flared and flickered raggedly and still he slowly pressed it back come now boomed zapranoth favor me with an an swer mighty magicians admit me to your august company let me speak to you let me touch you if only timidly at that the wizard loford gave a weak cry and toppled senseless and would have struck the ground headlong if men who were standing near him had not caught him first now gray alone was standing against the pressure of the dark shape above he cried out too and swayed but did not fall instead he straightened himself up with some reserve of inner strength and with his arms flung wide set his fingers moving in a pattern as intricate as that a musician makes upon a keyboard there sprang up gusts of wind as sudden and violent as the firing of catapults so men who stood near gray were thrown to the ground and dust and pebbles were blasted into the air in savage streams that crisscrossed through the heart of zapranoth before they lost velocity and fell in a rain of dirt into the citadel three hundred meters distant the image of the demon did not waver in the least but these howling shafts of wind were only the forerunners the scouts and skirmishers of the tremendous power that gray in his extremity had set in motion rolf saw this glancing behind him over the cliff edge to the west there where the sky some moments earlier had been azure and calm there now advanced a line of clouds roiling and galloping at a pace far faster than a bird could fly these clouds confined to a thin flat plane a little above the level of the citadel con verged like charging cavalry upon the waiting looming bulk of zapranoth an airelemental thought rolf with awe and fear and hope commingled he would have shouted it aloud but no one could have heard him through the screaming wind the violence of that wind was concentrated at the level of the demonlord well above the field where humans walked and fought men found that they could stand and swing their weapons though they staggered with the heavier gusts and now the guard came charging on again rolf put on his arm a shield taken from a fallen easterner gripped his sword hard and waited in the line while over their heads a torrent of air and cloudforms thundered from the west to beat like surf upon the image of the demon men lowered their eyes and worked to injure one another with their blades like ants at war on some tumultuous wave pounded beach the earlier fight had seemed to rolf quite short this one seemed endless and he several times despaired of coming through alive mewick howling like the wind fought this time on rolfs right hand and saved him more than once when he would otherwise have been caught hopelessly be tween two of the enemy somehow he was not caught or killed or even wounded in this attack which failed as the first one had to throw the western men back down the pass while the warriors fought the violence of the wind gradually abated and even as the host of blackclad men fell back once more in disarray the weightless bulk of zapranoth once more came pressing forward gray thomas stumbling on a wounded leg came forc ing his way through to the wizards side hang on out men are coming up even now the first gasping and ex hausted troops of the climbing western army were nearing the top of the pass the bulk of that army on its thousands of laboring legs was now in sight though far below gray slowly with the movement of an old old man turned his head to thomas in grays face that seemed to be aging by the moment there was at first no hint of understanding thomas raised his voice you and you support him on his feet gray do not fail us now what can we do the answer came feebly as from the lips of a dying man you had better win with the sword and quickly i will hold the demon off till my last breath that is not far away thomas looked round to see that the first men of his main army were just arriving at the top of the pass brave men too exhausted for the moment by their running climb to do anything but sit and gasp for air and squint up doubtfully at the looming shape of zapranoth the winds had driven the demon some distance from the field whether they had inflicted pain or injury upon him no one could tell save gray perhaps of the screen of white magic gray had earlier thrown before the demon there were only traces left flickering and flaring like the last flames of a dying fire rolf found it was no longer bearable to look straight at the demonlord one man run down thomas was ordering pointing with a long arm down the pass to the approaching reinforce ments tell any with the least skill in magic to push on before the others and hurry he turned his helmets t shaped opening toward rolf ready the balloons for the attack upon the citadel itself we must not sit here waiting for the demon to set the course of battle rolf sheathed his sword and turned and ran shouting to rally his working crew to the balloons he who had fought without distinction in the ranks now took the role of officer again at his direction men put down weapons eased off armor took up tools and ropes the technology djinn still constrained by the spells that gray had put upon it obeyed rolfs orders when he called them out when he could look up from his work again rolf saw that the guard of som had been reformed once more on the plain the ranks of black were not greatly smaller than they had been at the start of the days carnage guard re placements were trotting out from the citadel wearing torn and bloodstained garments in which they had already been slain once today but the guard had missed its chance to push the stubborn west from its small foothold on the height the trickle of reinforcement up the pass had thick ened steadily soon it would become a flow of hundreds and of thousands there were wizards of diverse but minor skills ascending with the army each of these as he arrived was hurried to the side of gray who still was conscious though standing only with the help of strong men on each side but one by one these lesser magicians fell away nearly as fast as they arrived and sought to relieve gray of some part of the invis ible power of zapranoth some crumpled soundlessly some leaped and fell groaning as if struck by arrows one man tore with his nails at his flesh screamed wildly and before he could be stopped leaped from the precipice rolf took it all in with a glance we are ready he shouted to thomas in answer the commander waved his arm toward the citadel then fill your baskets with good men and fly we will be with you there most of the survivors of the original assault force being the type of men they were had already boarded for the next attack the wind seemed right but zapranoth was coming rushing now toward them like a toppling wall rolf in the act of boarding his balloon looked up and cried out at the sight with the majesty and darkness of a thunder cloud great zapranoth now passed above them it was as if the skirts of his robe spilled madness and dragged lightning two of the balloons burst thunderously even as the djinn in its invisible cage became a blur of terror above the djinn there lowered a drifting fringe of cloud that in the winking of an eye became a closing pair of massive jaws with the devouring of the djinn gray cried out in despair and pain and his head rolled loosely on his neck men were running falling waving weapons in the air in the confusion rolf lost sight of thomas who had not yet given the last order to cast off but there was no doubt that it must be done the balloons were ready a little wind still held even without the djinn they could rise up and drop again upon the citadel cast off rolf shouted left and right ropes were let go and his flotilla rose and flew the demon that had just passed by now turned but did not strike at the balloons perhaps gray was not yet wholly overcome as the craft passed over the formation of the guard stones and arrows made a thick buzzing swarm around them shafts pierced every gasbag though the padded baskets shielded the men inside but their flight was not intended to be far lowering again they reached the citadels low wall and for the most part cleared it along the top of the wall be hind its parapet one lean man in black came running toward the invaders as if to fight them all while others ran away by his behavior rolf knew som the dead but in another moment som was left behind inside the walls the silent flyers skimmed above a dif ferent world one that was still ordered peaceful pleasant to the eye trees hedges and the rooftops of low sprawling buildings skimmed the basket bottoms there fled before them women in rich silks and furs and a few men and women servants in drab dress only one person besides som remained at first to watch them boldly one young servant girl had mounted a low roof and gazed at the balloons and past them at the battle rolf passed near enough to get a good look at her face it was his sister lisa chapter there was a steady swell of sound a moaning endless tone so long prolonged in his strange loneliness that chup could not imagine or remember when he had begun to hear it and this odd swelling was a light as well of which he could not remember his first sight so bright he did not need his eyes to see it but not too bright for eyes in spite of that and it was a touch a pressure of an intensity to make it unendurable if it had been felt in one place or even many but it bore in all directions on every fiber inward and out ward so all the infinity of opposing pressures balanced and there was no pain chup lived encompassed in this swelling thing like a fish within the sea immersed and saturated and supported by inexhaustible sound pressure light odor taste heat of fire and cold of ice all balanced to a point of nothingness and adding up to everything so he lived without remembering how he had come to be so living remembering only the soft and singing promise of the sword he did not waken for he had not slept then i am chup he thought this is what the beheaded see what had jogged him into thinking was the feel of some one prosaically pulling on his hair he did not open his eyes now for they were already open he could see light and soft pleasant colors flowing downward up he rose pulled by his hair until he broke with a slow splash of glory back into the world of air in which his senses once more functioned separately he was in a cave he could not at once be certain of its size but he thought it was enormous the overhead curve of its roof was too smoothly rounded to be natural the upper part of the cave was filled with light though its rounded sides and top were dark the lower part up to what was perhaps the middle was filled with the glowing fluid from which chup had just been lifted an enclosed lake of restless energy chup knew now that he had reached his goal what he had heard the soldiers call the lake of life like some gigantic bear reared on two legs immersed to his middle in the lake there stood the shaggy figure of a beast his fur was radiant of many colors or of none as if of the same substance as the lake chup could not see his face as yet because he could not turn or lift his head chups head swung like a pendulum neckless and bodiless from what must be this great beasts grip on his long hair he could however move his eyes and did so where his body should have been below his chin there was nothing to be seen except receding strings of droplets not gore but drops of multicolored glory from the lake falling dripping from his neck stump out of sight beneath his chin the droplets splashed and merged into the glowing lake whence they had come chup understood now that he his head had been immersed and saturated in the lake and that had been enough to restore life with no least sense of shock or pain the grip upon his hair turned his pendulumhead around and now he saw the high lord draffuts face it was a countenance of enormous ugliness and power more beast than human certainly but gentle in repose and now chup saw that in his other hand the beastlord held like a doll the nude and headless body of a man like a child washing a doll he held the body down continually dipping and sloshing it in the lake of life with the splashing and the motion the brilliance of the liquid intensified into soft explosions of color modulating in waves of light the steady gentle lumination of the air inside the cave and now in his enormous shaggy hand very like a human hand in shape but far more powerful and beautiful the high lord draffut raised the headless thing and like a craftsman turned it for his own inspection like that of one newborn or newly slain the muscular body writhed and floundered uncontrolled on its skin chup could count his old scars like a history of his life he marked the hagged ness of the neck stump where charmian had hacked and sliced unskillfully from the great severed veins there the elixir of the lake came pumping out like blood and tinged with blood the hand that held chups head up by its hair now shifted its grip slightly turning his eyes down once again he beheld his own headless living body being brought up close beneath his head its hands grasping clumsily like a babys at draffuts fur when they could feel it closer the raw neck stump came till chup could hear the burbling of its severed arteries and closer yet until there came a pres sure underneath his chin his head had not been breathing nor felt any need to breathe now there came a choking feeling but it entailed no pain it ended as the first rush of lungdrawn air caught coldly in his mouth and throat then with a sharp tingle came the feelings of his body awareness of his fingers clutched in fur of his feet kicking freely in the air of the gentle pressure of the great hand closed around his ribs that hand now bore him down to immerse him complete ly in the lake once more once he was below the surface his breathing stopped again not by any choking or impedi ment but simply because it was not needed there a man plunged into clearest purest water would not call for a cup of muddy scum to drink so it was his lungs made no demand for air then in two hands chup was lifted out to be held high before an ugly gentle face that watched him steadily i came chup began to speak with a shout before he realized there was no need for loudness the lake gave the impression of filling all the cave with waterfallvoices as sweet as demons noise was foul but yet in fact a whisper might be heard i came as quickly as i could lord draffut he said more normally i thank you for my life you are welcome to what help i have to give it is long since any thanked me for it the voice of draffut deep and deliberate was fit for a giant his hands turned chup like a naked babe undergoing a midwifes last inspection then draffut set him still dripping with the lake upon a ledge that chup now saw seemed to run all the way around the cavern this ledge and the huge caves walls and curving roof were of some substance dark and solid as the goblet in which the demon had brought him his healing draught long days ago the ledge was at a level but little higher than the surface of the lake seeing at a distance was difficult in the caverns glowing air but at its farthest point from chup the ledge seemed wider like a beach and there were other figures moving on it perhaps of other beasts who tended other men the beastlord said i cannot command the valkyries or i would have sent them for you if i could choose what men i help i would help first those who fight against the demons chup opened his mouth to answer but now that he was no longer bathed in the fluid of life a great weakness came over him and he could only lean back against the wall and feebly nod rest said draffut you will grow stronger quickly here then we will talk i would give all men sanctuary and heal them but i cannot i sent for you because you are the first man in the black mountains in many years who has cared for a fellow creatures suffering a small beast brought me the news that you had saved it from a demon in some cave for a moment chup could not remember but then it came to him in the cavern of soms treasure hoard still he was too feeble to do more than nod he tried again to study the figures moving in the caverns farthest reaches but could not see them clearly so vibrant was the air with light and life the ledge chup rested on was of a dull and utter black but covered tightly with a film as thin and bright as sunlight a glowing transparent skin formed of the fluid of the lake the film was never still at one spot there would begin a thickening in the film a thickening that swelled and pulsed rose up and broke away becoming a living separation that went winging like a butterfly and from some other place there would spring a similar fragment perhaps bigger than the first big enough to be a bird flying up and sagging as its wings melted but not dying or collapsing only putting out new wings of some different and more complex shape and flying on to collide in the singing luminous air with the butterfly the two of them clinging together and trembling seeming on the verge of growing into something still bigger and more wonderful but then diving deliberately together and melting back into the gracefully swirling body of the lake with their plunge splashing up droplets that fell again into the patterned film that glided shining and without ceasing over the black sub stance of the ledge feeling some strength returning chup raised one hand to touch his neck running his fingers all the way around he followed the scar thin jagged and painless of his death wound once more he tried to talk lord draffut is the battle over draffut turned his head toward the far end of the lake my machines are still working without pause gathering up men and healing them the battle goes on from what i have heard from beasts and men the foul demon is likely to prevail though if the issue were left to swords alone the west would win then there is little time for us to act chup tried to rise but felt no stronger than the splashing butterflies of light and had to sit again your healing is not finished wait you soon will be strong enough to stand what do you mean we must act we must act against the one you call foul demon if you are as much the demons enemy as you claim and i have heard draffut lifted his great forearms high then let them down like falling trees with a huge splash demons they are the only living things that i would kill if i could they devour mens lives and waste their bodies for no need of their own but out of sheer malignity they steal the healing fluid from my lake and taunt me when i rage and cannot come to grips with them chup was now able to sit straighter on the ledge and his voice had grown stronger you would kill zapranoth him soonest of them all of all the demons that i know he has done men the greatest harm why do you talk to me of killing zapranoth how can that be i know where he has hidden his life all was silent except for the sweet seashell roaring of the lake draffut standing absolutely still looked down steadily at chup for so long that chup began to wonder if a trance had come upon him then draffut spoke at last here in the citadel where we can reach it here in the citadel he hid it where he could keep his eye upon it every day where we can reach it if we are strong and fierce enough the beastlords hands knotted into barrelsized fists rose dripping from the lake fierce i can be fierce enough for anything against obstacles that do not live or against demons or even beasts if there is need i cannot injure men not even when it must be done i can and will again with a great effort chup rose up swaying to his feet som and his demonloving crew as soon as i can hold a sword again lord draffut the human lords of the east are more like demons than like men lifting a weak arm chup pointed to the distant beachlike place where men were being cared for by tall figures that were not men who are they those my machines at least they were machines when i was young we all have changed since then working in this cave in constant contact with the lake of life now they are alive chup had no time for marveling at that i mean the men there who are being healed if you would fight the demons fight the men who help them turn against the east order your machines beasts whatever they are to stop healing soms troops now at that lord draffuts eyes blazed down upon him i have never seen som nor acknowledged him as lord and i care nothing for him men come and go around my lake and use it i remain long before there was an east or west i lived and healed men from the days of the old world i have healed their wounds weapons were different then but wounds were much the same and men change not at all though to me they then were gods were what chup wondered fleetingly he had not heard that word before draffut spoke on as if relieving himself of thoughts and words too long pent up i was not in the old world as you see me now then i could not think i was much smaller and ran behind men on four legs but i could love men and i did and i must love them still turn against the east you say i am no part of that abomination i was here before som came long before and i mean to be here when he has gone i walked here when the healing lake was made by men who thought their war would be the last when they went mad and ran away i was locked in with the machines i grew and when men came again new tribes of them i was ready to lend them the collars and the valkyries help that they might be healed when they fought and after them came others the high lord draffut slowed his angry speech enough of that where is the life of zapranoth chup told him things that he had heard and seen and how the pieces seemed to fall together the telling was quickly finished but chup was standing straight before hed finished he felt his strength increasing by the moment the girls name is the same you see lisa though i would wager that her face and memory have been changed and she has been here just half a year draffut pondered but a moment more then come lord chup and i will give you arms if there are men i cannot frighten from our path then you will fight them if what you say is true no other obstacle can keep me from the life of zapranoth come swim and draffut turned and swam away cleaving the lake with stretching overhand strokes chup dove in and followed faster than he had ever splashed through water chapter the balloon that rolf was riding in skimmed lower dragged in tall shrubbery scraped free but then continued sinking in the quiet he could hear the gas escaping from a dozen arrow punctures in the bag mewick pointed silent ly at the next hedge ahead of them this one they would not clear rolf swung up to the baskets rim and leaped in the instant before they struck the hedge he hit the ground with sword already drawn this time there was no need to think of anchoring but there were no opponents yet in sight it seemed that the enemy were as unprepared to meet this balloon attack as they had been for the first in all directions other balloons were coming down seed ing armed desperate fighters throughout the inner courts and buildings of soms citadel but some balloons had missed the walls or were still going up lacking the djinns help or guiding ropes to follow there was no pattern in the landing mewick was to assume leadership of the five man squad in rolfs balloon once they had landed but mewick like the rest now stood perplexed for a moment beside the hedge it was hard to see which was the best way to move to join up most effectively with other elements of the assaulting force and from this garden there was no vulnerable target to be seen where they might hurt som with a quick attack only rolf had glimpsed a goal and he turned toward it when it seemed as likely a direction to take as any other he ran toward the place where he had seen his sister mewick and the others pounding after him across empty lawns and over deserted terraces the girl was still on the roof her face was turned away toward the battlefield where the demonlord hung in the air like the smoke of burning villages rolf could faintly hear men screaming over there lisa she looked round when he shouted out her name and he knew he had not been mistaken but there was no recogni tion in her eyes when they met his only confusion and alarm rolf stared toward her but then stopped as a squad of men in black appeared coming in single file round the corner of the building where she was he called out once more lisa try to come this way but there was no way for her to manage that right now the eastern squad was coming on to block the way they were only auxiliaries without the collars of the guard and armed with a varied selection of old weapons but they were eight to face rolf and his four companions the eight soon proved to lack the willingness for battle of the five they started backing up as soon as mewick bounded forward screeching his battlehatchet twirling in one hand long dag ger ready in the other rolf and three others came pacing forward right at mewicks heels their enemies delayed for one brief clash then fled one of their number they left behind bleeding his life out in a flowerbed and others fleeing clutched at wounds and yelled and left red trails rolf tried to get another look at lisa on her roof but there was no time beyond a tall hedge and a wall of masonry some thirty meters distant a huge collapsing gas bag showed where another western squad had landed these now seemed heavily beset to judge by the shouts and noises there another force in black ten or twelve men maybe could be glimpsed through hedges as they hurried in that direction drops of gore flew from mewicks hatchet as he motioned for a charge that way and they were off the shortest route to this new fight and the way that mewick chose lay over a decorative stone wall head high rolf sheathed his sword to hurl himself up at full speed and with two hands free to grab he drew again even as he lunged onward from his crouch atop the wall and as he leaped struck downward with full force to kill a guardsman from behind they were in a walledin garden with more than a score of men contending in a wild melee rolf landed awkwardly off balance but bounced up into a crouch at once just in time to parry a hard blow that nearly knocked his sword away above the garden the huge gasbag draped with its plastic mail was steadily collapsing threatening to make a tem porary peace by smothering the fight but yet there was room to wield weapons and men took the chance to do so the five beleaguered crewmen of this balloon welcomed with shouts the arrival of mewick and his squad and doubled their own strokes but this time the enemy were guardsmen and more numerous by far than the squad of auxiliaries had been the fight was savage and protracted men avoided the settling gasbag and tried to drive their opponents under it the west could gain no advantage until the crew of a third balloon had managed to reach the scene and fell upon the guardsmens flank when at last the guard re treated they left bodies in black strewn thickly on the ground but in the garden there were but nine men of the west still on their feet and several of these were weak with wounds rolf bearing only the one light wound suffered earlier helped others with their bandages he then began to hack off fallen guardsmens heads but mewick stopped him we must move on and find some heart or brain within this citadel where we can strike let dead men be one of the northmen had gotten up into a tree to look around more of our fellows over there lets link with them over the wall again they went and back more or less in the direction whence mewicks crew had come there an other dozen or fifteen westerners had joined together and were setting fires in apartments and in some unimportant looking storerooms mewick was quick to argue with the leader of these men that what they were doing had little purpose that some target more vital must be found to make his point he gestured toward the battlefield outside the citadel there the high lord zapranoth remained im mobile above the western force and what the demon might be doing to the men who swarmed like ants beneath his feet was not something that rolf cared to think about the leader of the vandalizing crew in turn gestured to the clouds of smoke his men were causing to go up these he shouted were bound to have an effect when they were seen and he was right a hundred blackclad men or more diverted from the fight outside came pouring back into the citadel som dared not let his fortress and its contents fall this eastern counterattack came with a volley of arrows then a charge rolf once more caught sight of som himself entering the fight in person in defense of what might be his own sprawling manor the lord of the black mountains gaunt and holloweyed wearing no shield or armor shouting orders came striding at the head of his own troops swinging a twohanded sword a western crossbowman atop a wall let fly a bolt at som rolf saw the missile blur halfway to its blackclad target spin neatly in midair then fly back with the same speed it had been fired it tore a hole clear through the bowmans throat after that there were few weapons raised at som though he ran straight at the western line hack and thrust as he might hoping to provoke a counter those of the west who came within his reach restricted themselves to parrying and dodging his blows fortunately he was no great swordsman and could do little damage to such a line as faced him now shields at the ready once his sword was knocked out of his hands he grabbed it up again his face a mask of rage and leaped once more to the attack this time the western line divided just in front of him mewick had quickly hatched a scheme to cut off som and capture him by a ring of shields pressed round him till he could be immobilized and disarmed but the opening appeared too neatly before som or perhaps some magic warned him he fell back into the shelter of his own mens ranks and thenceforward was con tent to let them do his fighting they came on sturdily enough once more for a time the fighting was without letup then there came another small body of western troops fighting their way into the mass bettering the odds just when it seemed they were about to worsen too severely the forces separated briefly the west dragging back their wounded where they had the chance rolf looking again for lisa saw that she had remained at her vantage point on the roof perhaps she felt safer up there looking beyond her he saw the sign of defeat still in the sky the brooding shape of zapranoth one of the party who had just joined them had thrown himself down exhausted and was answering questions about the progress of the battle outside rolf realized that this man and his group had just come from there had somehow managed to fight their way over the citadels wall or through its gate but it does not go well the old man withstands the demon still how i do not know surely he cannot live much longer then zapranoth will have us all already half our army has gone mad they throw away their weapons chew on rocks still we have numbers on our side and we might win if it were not for zapranoth none can withstand the demon none his voice fell silent the men around were looking at him no longer but up toward the mountain rolf craned his neck there on the high barren un climbable slope amid the doors where valkyries shuttled in and out a new door had been opened rolf at the distance could not be sure but it looked as if an outer layer of rock had been cracked away by the door it was of heavy dull black stuff and had been swung out framed now within the opening there stood what seemed to be the figure of a man but having a beasts head and garbed in fur as radiant as fire from behind this figure from inside the mountain there streamed out a coruscating light that made rolf think of molten metal and now he saw that the figure could not be a man for there was a real man beside him no bigger than an infant by comparison but armed with a bright needle of a sword and clothed in black like some lord of the east lord draffut cried out someone in the eastern force who will heal us if he should fall another called other shouts of astonishment came from the guard they like their enemies facing them were lowering their weapons momentarily and looking up to marvel the easterners were if anything more surprised than their opponents lord draffut bent picked up the man beside him in one hand and held him cradled in one arm then striding down the slope lord draffut came walking boldly on two legs where it seemed no man could have climbed it was as if he walked in snow or gravel instead of solid stone for at his touch rock melted not with heat but as if quickening briefly into crawling life to quiet again when he had passed though the lord draffut carried no weapon but one armed man his attitude and pace were those of one who came on eagerly to enter battle yet from the ranks of the east there came no cheers all men still watched in blank surprise half of them with weapons dragging in the dirt som himself was peering up as if he could not credit what was happening before his eyes draffuts great strides quickly brought him close to the citadel then he had entered it sliding down the last near vertical face of rock that served as its rear wall behind him stretched a line of tracks left in the dead solidity of the mountain the men of the west who were inside the citadel con tracted their defensive line now and gripped their weapons tightly there was no place for them to run then gradually they understood that draffut and his rider were not coming straight toward them not quite the tinylooking man in black raised his bare sword and pointed and the striding lord he rode accommodatingly made a slight correction in his course the riders black garments it could now be seen were trimmed with such a motley of other colors as should belong to no proper eastern uniform rolf was perhaps the first to recognize this man in black andmotley garb as chup and no doubt the first to under stand that chup was pointing straight at lisa on her roof top now the girl had turned round to face chup and in the lower sky beyond her the weightless bulk of zapranoth was turning too like a tower of smoke caught in a shifting wind the guardsmen as draffut approached their ranks be gan shifting to and fro uncertainly not knowing what the beastlord meant to do still unable to imagine what had called him forth draffut majestically ignored them they scampered from his path and like a moving siegetower he passed through where their ranks had been lisa on her rooftop sprang to her feet but made no move toward draffut or away her building was not oc cupied at the moment by either east or west but the eastern forces were the closer to it draffut after he had passed them paused briefly to set down chup who stood with his sword in hand and glaring at the guard draffut himself strode on toward the girl taller than the roof he reached toward he stretched out one mighty arm toward her and recoiled beneath rolfs feet the ground leaped like a drumhead beaten by the shock that had made the lord of beasts go staggering back between the girl upon her building and the high lord draffut there now stood one who was the tallest of the three seemingly sprung from nowhere this figure was cov ered in dark armor even to segmented gauntlets and closed visor in the reflections of this metal armor silent lightnings seemed to come and go the world around this dark lord seemed askew to rolf and rolf had the impression that under the dark lords feet the rocks had stretched like taut canvas bearing weights and in the instant of his appearance the cloudimage of zapranoth that had for so long loomed above the battle field in domination had vanished from the sky now scattered all across the plateau inside the citadel and out of it bodies of fighting men let weapons rest and held their breaths waiting for they knew not what only the valkyries above still droned on imperturbably taking up the slain and mangled and returning to find more had there been listeners a kilometer away the high lord draffuts voice would no doubt have reached them plainly when he spoke lord of demons drinker of mens lives i hear no taunting from you now you must maintain a solid form if you will try to stop what i intend to do today a solid form that i can grasp the voice of zapranoth even louder than draffuts voice began before the other had ceased foul upstart beast cub calling yourself lord lord of vermin lord of cripples though it may be that i cannot end your me you will soon wish that it had ended yesterday the two blurred toward each other rolf did not truly see them come together for there flashed out from their contact a moment of blind blackness to engulf him the men around rolf were all blinded too if he could judge by the multitudinous outcry that sprang up even as the men were blinded came the shock rolf once more felt it in the mountain underneath his feet and this time in the air around him too more like a blow than like a noise he fell and blindly clutched the earth when vision came back it was to show a world gone mad where the great beings had grappled one another there had grown some thing almost like the sun too brilliant for the eye to bear for long shapes within this brilliance moved slowly as if with tremendous effort rolf had to turn away from it to save his eyes around him other men were crawling from the light that threw their shadows long before them not one man there seemed to be left upon his feet men of east and west were intermingled for the moment without fighting as predator and prey seek safety from a flood upon a floating log and keep a truce rolf tried to rise to get away but before he could regain his feet there sounded an awesome bellow of rage unmis takably in the voice of zapranoth with this cry the moun tain lurched beneath rolf seeming to rise a meter or more and fall back as it lurched the mountains surface split like a torn garment a fine crevice nowhere wider than a mans body ran faster than the eye might follow it across the walls and gardens and terraces of the citadel in one direc tion it shattered the outer battlemented wall revealing the field before the citadel where the army of the west had been stopped and where most of its soldiers still lay stunned in the other direction the flying split raced up through the upper mountain defining hidden faults by making them its path the splitting ceased before it reached the domain of the lord draffut up there the coruscating light still flooded from an open giants doorway and through their smaller passages the valkyries still flew in and out the zone of radiance around the mighty figures bad dimmed and now when he looked back at them rolf saw their two figures plain the lord of beasts was biting down upon the armored shoulder of the lord in black draffuts drawnback lips revealed enormous fangs and these were sunken in rolf saw that wherever draffut touched the black armor it moved and flowed and yielded to the resistless life that poured from him around the demons waist his huge beastforearms bright with glowing fur were locked like mortised logs to hold and crush and yet the being in black seemed mightier for all the dark lord showed of pain he might have felt nothing from the bite that seemed to pierce his armor with his own great arms zapranoth strove to loosen the hold about his waist he tested out one countergrip and then another working without haste or hesitation at last he got both his dark metaled hands clamped to his satisfaction upon one arm of glowing fur if the metal of his gauntlets ran and dripped with life he did not heed now zapranoths enormous shoul ders tilted and he strained slowly very slowly he be gan to win rolf cried out and bit his lip and tried to move some power would not let him take a step toward the fight he threw his sword at zapranoth the spinning blade vanished in midair slowly ever so slowly zapranoth was breaking the grip about his waist when that was done maintaining his own grip on draffuts arm he bent it farther draffuts jaws did not relax their bite but through them came the muffled outcry of a titans pain rolf yelled again and hurled a rock and picked up an other larger one somehow his frenzied rage enabled him to run forward caring nothing now for his own fate he tried to strike the demon with a rock turning in their struggle the giants brushed him aside unnoticed he felt an impact and his body soaring the ground flying up to meet him was the last part of the battle that he knew chup like all other mortal men had been knocked down by the repeated rolling of the earth he had continued to keep in sight the ugly young girl who clung to the swaying rooftop her bright eyes fixed now on the giants struggle then the opening crevice had split the mountain between chup and the object of his attention even while the earth was still heaving like a ships deck under him chup gathered his resolve and crossed the narrow chasm with a lunge nearly falling into it though it was scarcely wider than his body behind him he heard draffuts muffled cry of agony as his arm was mangled in the demons grip chup did not look round he ran on toward the building where lisa was now it was so close that the roof and the girl on it were out of his field of vision will you still nurse at my shoulder beast it was the roaring voice of zapranoth i have no milk to yield bah if i tore your arms off no doubt you would nuzzle at me still a brief pause but i can see a way to cause you greater pain than that vile animal all you care for is your lake of life now look see what i do chup did not look but jumped to grab the roof his fin gers slid on marble and he fell while falling he did look back despite the untroubled speeches of the demon his right arm in its armor was now hanging almost motionless below the unrelenting pressure of draffuts fangs but za pranoths left arm was free and with a barrelsized armored fist he now smote down into the split that climbed the mountain twice he struck a third time and a fourth with each blow the mountain shook and rumbled with each rumbling the crack widened by a little and lengthened generously draffut his limbs brokenlooking his fur now dulled and matting seemed helpless to do anything but cling to the demon with his jaws with the last blow of the demons fist the lengthening crevice broke into the doorway from which draffut had come down and with that the rumbling of the tortured mountain ended in a sound as of a great clear bell for a moment all was still then through the broken distant door way the lake of life came spurting a flood of fiery radiance leaping pouring down dazzling even in full sun at the draining of the lake there came from draffuts tightclamped jaws a howl more terrible than anything that chup had ever heard beneath the loose fur of the beast lords neck his muscles bulged as if he tried to tear the demons shoulder off now zapranoth too let out a word less cry struggling as savagely as ever the two of them rolled away while men of both armies fled in panic from their path meanwhile the lake came down the mountain in a thin but violent stream sliding into crevices and up from them again leaving in its pathway rock that knew the taste of life and moved before it sank as if reluctantly into being notalive again at this latest shuddering of the earth the building before chup like many others in the citadel collapsed the walls bulged out and crumpled almost gently the roof caved in ward with a noise that was not loud amid the greater thun ders of the mountain chup stayed on all fours crawling forward into the fresh ruin he quickly found the girl cov ered with dust from the masonry that had collapsed be neath her but showing no sign of any great hurt sprawled on her belly on a mound of stones she drew in gasps of air as if readying a scream a place on her forehead bled a trickle and she stared dazedly at chup and past him a burning brazier inside the structure had been crushed and chup poked together its spilled coals lighted no doubt when this day had been a peacefully chilly autumn morn ing he fed in splinters from a broken beam until he had a hardy little fire when the girl looked at him with some understanding and began to sob he asked remember me young lisa she only sobbed on in her fear and minor hurt she moved a little but she was still dazed dont be afraid this will not hurt you much he tried to hide the dagger from her with his arm as he moved it toward her head there seemed to be no doubt where the exact place of hiding was the dark brown mass of lisas hair was bound up carefully like the hair of ten thousand other peasant girls across the countryside this was the girl who had appeared seemingly from no where at the house of rolfs parents at the same time that charmians sister had been left with the lord of demons rolfs people were obscure farmers then seemingly remote and safe from wars and magic no one searching for a hidden thing of power would have had reason to search them but six years passed and war came there tarlenot by accident carried off the girl as he had taken others what ever rough disposal he might have made of her her hair would not have been so tidily cared for in a dream or vision the dark lord came and worked hypnotically and tarlenot forgot his own designs and took the girl right to the citadel there were no more safe farms zapranoth would hide his life where he could see it and be quick in its defense so lisa had been taken to serve a sister who did not know her because both of their minds had been altered by the demon and because the appearance of the younger girl had probably been changed as well she closed her eyes and moaned when chup set his dag gers edge to the tough cord by which her hair was bound when the cord parted a feeling like the shock of combat ran up the dagger to his hand it was the first hard evidence that he was right lord draffut he implored in silence clamp down your bite and hold the demon occupied hold him but a little longer the dagger draffut had given chup was virginally sharp he held it like a razor and severed the first long strands the girl came out of her daze then to scream and try to fight and in an instant he reversed his grip on the dagger and clubbed her quiet with the hilt he dragged her limp form closer to his little fire and laid the first of the cut hair carefully beside the flame with proper shaving gear or at least water the business would have gone more smoothly but chup had little inclination and no time to be squeamish beads of blood came upwell ing from the scalp as he shaved rapidly and thoroughly the girl moaned but did not move chup noticed first a strange deep silence all around him but he did not look round then somewhere nearby there spoke the voice of zapranoth in all its power and majesty little man what do you think that you are doing there chups hands began to shake but without looking up or pausing he forced them to shave another swath he could sense the power of zapranoth above him descending onto him the full power of zapranoth whose mere passing in the cave had turned his bones to jelly chup sensed also that as long as he kept his full attention to his task he could balance on a perilous point above annihilation what you are doing is a nuisance to me cease it at once and i will see to it that your death is quick and clean one pause in this stage of his work and he would never work again nor fight nor play nor love chup knew it by some inner warning do not stop look turn hands that had mangled the lord of beasts would close upon his merely human flesh though chups own hands threatened to dis obey him he made them shave more hair and set it by the fire put down your knife and walk away zapranoths voice now was not loud so much as it was overwhelming it seemed impossible that anyone could say or even think or hope a word in contradiction chup felt his concentration slip ping in a moment he would answer he would turn he would face zapranoth and die powers of the west he cried aloud come to my help his hands meanwhile kept at their work i am the only power who can reach you now and what you are doing arouses my displeasure put down your knife and walk away i repeat you shall have a clean death if you do clean and far in the future after a long and pleasant me lisacarlottas face was changing as the last of her hair was taken off the ugly proportions of her nose and jaw and forehead flowed and melted into shapes of beauty as some pressure that had steadily deformed them was re moved she whimpered in a new and lighter voice in spite of her dirt and her raw oozing scalp chup thought he could see charmians sister in the unconscious face put down your knife said zapranoth or i devour you you will join your whining beastlord in my gut where both of you can cry forever chup turned but just enough to feed a little more wood into the fire still not looking up toward the demon then between thumb and finger chup lifted a lock of zapranoths life from the dark brown pile beside the flame he tried to think how western wizards worded their spells but he could not remember ever hearing one of them true it might not be necessary to say anything at all with zapranoths life right in his hands but he suspected that against such an adversary all the help that he could get would not be too much in his insistent overwhelming voice the demon said far from here is a mountain that i know of having hidden in it gold in amounts undreamed of even by som the dead i see now chup of the north that i have greatly under estimated you i am prepared to bargain to avoid the trouble you can cause me and chup fed the first of zapranoths life into the fire saying you will fall by the flame the knife of fire is in your head the words were rather good chup thought pleased at his own unexpected power of invention from outside there came what might have been an indrawn breath but was a sound too deep for human ears to fully register then zapra noth said i am convinced lord chup from now on we must deal as equals very good thought chup what to say next your ears are cut off i submit to you lord chup you are my master and i will serve no other so long as you permit me to survive as good beginning to my service let me take you to the golden mountain that i spoke of deeper inside it even than the vault of gold lies buried an emerald so great chup opened his mouth and found words coming to him opening him with this knife of fire separating flesh the scream began in the mighty voice of zapranoth but ended in the shrilling of a woman she cried out then ah mercy master burn me no more to you i must show my self in my true form and chup without stopping to think looked out of his ruined building and saw a young woman stretched out on the ground clothed scantily in her own long hair of fiery red and in her one body she was all the women he had ever yearned to have yes charmian among them to chup she stretched out her imploring arms ah spare me lord he craved no more the gold and emeralds of the east but this temptation could have moved him still he knew better than to heed another lie he burned more hair separating flesh piercing hide i give him to the flames the woman screamed again and in midscream her voice belonged to something else surely nothing human and sure ly not the powerful lord of demons but yet it was zapra noths with shaking hands chup fed more hair into the crackling flame he was somehow making up the words he needed or they were being sent to him in the name of ardneh where had that name come from where had he heard it before now in the name of hewhowieldsthelightning breaker of citadels i fetter zapranoth i fetter him with metal i make his members so that he cannot struggle i force him to vomit what is in his stomach chup looked outside the image of the woman was gone and its place lay something huge that made chup think of greasy ashes and a mound of corpses on a field of war the thing was fettered in mighty hoops of shining metal and the labored breathing of it sounded like the wind the greasy ashes stirred and struggled made heads and tails and manyjointed limbs but could not get from out the binding bands and now a mouth larger than any of the others appeared yawning as if forced open from inside and from it there tumbled forth all manner of wretched people and beasts the people wore the clothes of many lands or none at all and rolled about and lay stunned and crying like newborn babes though most of them were grown among them were some soldiers of the west their weapons still in hand and there was one huge figure that chup recog nized the high lord draffut tumbling back to life from what had seemed the bitterest of nightmares gave no immediate thought to his own condition or to the outcome of the battle or to anything except the ruin of his lake disregard ing the ruin and confusion that surrounded him he raised his eyes at once to what had been his high domain the radiant cascade of the lake had slowed to a mere trickle it was draining with the new finality of death he rushed at once to climb the slope behind the citadel power remained in him to melt the rock of life and make it form holds for his hands and feet the power absorbed through ages of his dwelling in and near the lake that would not let him die that healed his bones almost as fast as they were broken only this lifepower let him bear the shock when he had mounted to his lake and found it a drained shell cracked at the bottom like a broken egg the dull black fabric of its inner lining the only material the old world had devised that could resist the quickening force of pure lifeprinciple this shell remained now for the first time in his memory marked by no shifting patterns or gay butterflies the healing machines their lives already fading hopped and struggled feebly like dying frogs in a drained pond draffut did not stand long within the broken doorway gazing at the utter ruin of his life and purpose the cries from down the slope came to his ears human cries from the battlefield of men in deadly need and fear he moved to answer them without stopping to consider what he might be able to do down the slope again he went walking at first then quickening his strides into a run before him like a trodden anthill lay the demolished citadel and its swarming men here and there they were still fighting one another but there were no more valkyries in the air close before draffut one of them lay motionless smashed by a fall rotors bent and body broken with the violence of its crash a look through the sprungopen belly doors showed draffut that the man inside was cold and dead draffut raging picked up the machine shook it and shouted at it where his hands touched the metal it stirred with faint life but that was all only now did the magnitude of what had happened come home to the lord draffut with full force even if he could somehow repair or vivify this ma chine there was nowhere for it to go no healing possible for the dead man inside nor for any of the others who now lay upon the field or might fall tomorrow far down the mountainside near where the great crack in the mountain had shattered the citadels outer wall a bright gleam caught lord draffuts eye it was the many colored radiance of the lake trapped in a small pool in the rocks at once he tore the battered flyer apart pulled out the corpse inside cradling the body tenderly in one arm he hurried on reaching the small pool not much bigger than a bathtub he found that some of the wounded of both armies had sought it out already were sprawled beside it drinking or splashing the fluid on their wounds picking his way care fully among these injured men lord draffut reached a spot beside the radiant pool he dropped into it the dead man he carried then set himself to disperse healing to as many as he could with every passing moment more men mostly easterners were crawling and staggering to the place a groaning de manding throng grew rapidly around the lord of beasts the level of the fluid in the pool sank rapidly as well rock could not hold it for long and draffut crouched low be side it scooping up healing handfuls which he poured into mouths or onto wounds the dead man he had carried here was sitting up and groaning now draffut splashed a remnant of the lake onto a mangled armstump whose owner shouted with the ending of his pain perhaps a new and proper arm would grow another man his belly opened came sliding in blood to reach the pool and draffut poured for him an end of agony amid the general cries of pain and with his dazed concen tration on his task lord draffut did not notice when a dif ferent heartier voice raging and commanding was raised in the rear of the rapidly growing throng about him back to your ranks malingerers the enemy still holds the field you who can walk rejoin your units cowards or ill give you wounds guardsmen take up your arms and fight for me nor did lord draffut in his dazed state fully notice what was happening when this shouter came raving scatter ing wounded guardsmen from the pool with blows of the flat of his sword draffut was aware only of one more victim reeling toward him with sunken eyes and the stink of ter rible gangrene draffut scooped up for this one a generous handful and threw it accurately from his hand the fluid of the lake leaped out a clear and innocent serpent in the air only in that instant did the sunken eyes of the raving raging man meet those of draffut in a look that the beastlord would long remember and only in that instant did draffut know who this man was the splash of liquid struck a maddened shout ceased in midsyllable a sword dropped clanging on the ground then nothing more was heard or seen of som the dead he and his portion of the lake of life had vanished from the world of men with the knife of fire i cut off feet and hands shut his mouth and his lips the bellowing of zapranoth grew louder and more desper ate and at the same time became more muffled blunted his teeth cut his tongue from his throat thus i took away his speech blinded his eyes stopped his ears cut his heart from its place the fire swam before chups eyes and the exhaustion of the magician a feeling new to him seemed to weaken his every bone once more he begged the power of the west to send him words for it was growing very hard to think then summoning his strength he shouted i made him as if he had never been silence had fallen all across the riven plateau of the bat tlefield in silence the army of the east had begun to turn to desperate flight or to surrender looking where zapranoth had been chup could see no more metal hoops no more heap of greasy ashes nothing but in his mind still spoke the demonlord master yet a very little of my life remains save that and from it all the rest can be remade my powers can be restored to raise for you an army to lead to build for you your kingdom chup with great care gathered the last hairs while be side him lisacarlotta moved her mistreated head and once more opened her eyes his name is not any more his children are not he existeth no more nor his kindred he existeth not nor his record he existeth not nor his heir his egg cannot grow nor is his seed raised it is dead and his spirit and his shadow and his magic thus was the lord of demons zapranoth destroyed and thus did chup of the north earn a place in the army of the west his bride was searched for especially where some said they had seen her pass descending along a new path created by the splitting of the mountain but she was not found the great beast draffut fled when the last drops of his lake were gone to somewhere where there were no cries of wounded men lisa rolf of the broken lands had come to speak to the unrecognizable girl who they said had been his sister once rolf she knew him but her voice was dull she was inconsolable not for her own pain not for the easts defeat nor for any of the fallen save one my dark lord she said my strong protector he was all i had
