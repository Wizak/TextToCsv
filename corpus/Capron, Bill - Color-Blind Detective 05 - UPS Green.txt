ups green a continuing adventure of the colorblind detective by bill capron it had been a rough morning id delivered an emmytype performance at the police station lying for my client the police knew i was lying and they knew i knew they knew just out of principle it made them mad it almost didnt matter that my lie put a neat bow on their case taking it right where the da wanted it to go no some days they just didnt like me the way i straddled the truth until the scales of justice were in a proper balance its not that cops are against justice it was just that their hands were tied every inch of the way and watching me stride unimpeded through their curious world of arcane laws made their blood boil they wanted to be them and they wanted to be me protect and serve that was their job but the citizens theyd been hired to serve had through the years constructed rules that seemed at times only to protect the victim it was almost as if they the good guys couldnt do good no matter which way they turned legally hamstrung by the system still thats the way it should be fifty years ago the cops had a lot more leeway but it was too much operating room for the bad apples that find a place in any organization no the maze of the law wasnt constructed to help good cops do their job but instead to stop bad cops from gaming the system and sorry to say at the expense of those they were hired to protect i like to think of myself as a good cop unencumbered by the rules no thats not quite far enough i think of myself as a selfcontained justice system when possible i work with the authorities but never at the expense of justice i dont make myself judge jury and executioner but i create an environment an agarculture where justice will play out to its logical conclusion so i would wait to see where the mornings little drama led i had a pretty good idea if i was wrong it would just unravel and all the parties would go their separate ways oblivious to the threat to their freedom but then i knew that wasnt how it was going to end justice would be served i made some notes in the file and slipped it into the pending drawer i reached over and hit the play button on my answer phone hideyho bro this is green got a big problem and need your advice my brother dave twenty years with ups we had a running joke when i first saw him in his truck i asked him what color it was and he said green green truck green pants shirt and belt lots of green stuff well of course it was all gray to me then two years later cant remember who i was talking to i pointed out the green ups truck and lo and behold i learned it was brown i told dave what i thought of his little joke i mean were brothers and hes not supposed to make fun of my handicap and since then he calls himself green to everyone not just me and when they ask him why he tells his little story me i calls them likes i sees them hey gray whats the problem he tells me to fly in that he has a use for my special talent no more i caught one of those midsized jets to spokane then a puddlejumper to kalispell montana just north of flathead lake i took my fishing gear just in case dave picked me up at the airport and was content to talk about the fishing until we got to the house hed only moved up there three months ago and it was the first time id seen the place he was on the outskirts of the small town of browning overlooking the casinosupported indian slums of rural america from a distance they looked almost picturesque if it wasnt for the damned rusting cars jacked up on blocks behind too many dilapidated singlewides the view in the opposite direction was expansive and beautiful especially through my ansel adams blackandwhite eyes when i asked him what was up he told me it would wait until after dinner so i passed the time with his wife debbie and ten yearold son harry the meal properly stashed within we packed up the rods and drove east to cut bank then parked on a bluff overlooking a large box canyon he reached under his seat and pulled out a pair of binoculars then focused them through the front windshield he handed them to me take a look theres a man and a woman down there and a little girl i refocused the lenses a tall aging hollywoodlooking type guy with grayish hair that looked bleached a pretty young wife with her whitegray hair flowing in the wind and an equally pretty little girl about two with darker hair they looked like the allamerican happy family so what am i looking for that man is edgerton fulleriii id never seen him before but when i lived in tucson i delivered a lot of packages to his house from his employer i got to know his wife and their then oneyearold daughter pretty well and the daughter is the same little girl but its the wrong woman you sure its the same edgerton fulleriii lots of kids look alike at that age gotta be the same guy like i said same little girl and the packages i take him here are from the same company the one he works for biorad research hes a salesman you know im the only person who would have noticed i kept my eyes on the pretty woman noticed what a matteroffact that he killed his wife i lowered the binoculars and eyeballed his face he wasnt kidding come on that seems a little melodramatic maybe he got a divorce he shook his head no thats not it im sure he killed her i gave him my best skeptical voice so what makes you so sure he pointed down the cliff the woman her name is tamarella at least thats how she answers the phone and her daughter is elouise neither one particularly common he read the confusion on my face its the same name as the wife in tucson and the daughters the same girl they even got the same dog its just not possible i shrugged my agreement okay i agree it sounds fishy but the world is full of strange coincidences well get on the internet tomorrow and see what we can find out we fished the cut bank river until nightfall caught and released a lot of large striated gray rainbows then made our way back to browning in the dark my mind returned to edgerton fuller iii but until i knew more there were only dead ends the next day long after dave left for his morning deliveries for big green i blocked his phone id then placed a call to biorad research using the number dave got from the delivery envelopes a perky voice answered biorad research how can i help you hi my names carter jackson and im with the internal revenue service im needing some information on one of your employees an edgerton fuller the third yeah thats the guy she transferred me to personnel hi this is jackie thomas kathy says youre with the irs and you need some information on edgerton is there a problem i gave her my guarded confidential voice well there might be but were not really sure yet we learned his wife tamarella received a large insurance award but it wasnt reported on their joint return we need to ask him a few questions i heard her scratching on paper i tried calling him in tucson but the line was disconnected does he still work for you i could feel her thinking over the line how much to tell me yes but edgertons been transferred i waited to the rocky mountain states region hes in montana can you give me an address id need that request in writing mr jackson i said then look just give mr fulleriii a call and ask him to ring me up my number is she said she would fuller would get the offices of my company started built and sold in a previous life hed maybe try information to see if the irs number was close if maybe it was just a mistake by jackie thomas but it wouldnt be hed start to worry and i wanted him worried i got onto daves computer and adjusted the color palate so the screen was readable to my sensitive though restricted vision i used one of the peoplefinder search engines but fullers new address was not listed i did a national search on the first name tamarella i got only three hits two in the same town in kentucky kettle and one of course in tucson the first kentucky number was for a tamarella kelly a man with booming voice answered i asked for tamarella he said he didnt know where she was and for all he cared she could be dead the second number for tamarella tubutz was disconnected the town was tiny so i tried the city hall a woman with the old voice of a lifelong public servant answered kettle city hall it sounded like a single word hello my names carter jackson and im trying to locate one of your former citizens a miss tamarella tubutz can you help me her voice took a reflexive institutional guarded tone well just what is it youre looking for her for young man seems a bob tubutz in tennessee died and left her a bundle of cash she whistled jesus h some people get all the luck what do you mean the reservation id noted in her voice was gone we were friends well young miss tamarella was in town about four months ago her daddy died a year ago and the estate mostly stocks and bonds stolen from when he ran the bank here was finally settled she was the last surviving issue of that lying thieving old coot so to speak had to sign some paperwork so she could transfer her fortune to some foreign bank offshore i asked no arizona she chuckled did it take a long time to process the estate sure nuf did her exhusband jack kelly made a claim said shed never properly divorced him a short silence didnt stop jack from getting married again sorta think that weighed against him with the court and youre sure it was the same tamarella tubutz sure was saw her with my own eyes tamarella was never so pretty but she had the cutest little girl with her i could almost see her shaking her head and now she goes and lands another fortune out of the kettle and into the chips some people got all the luck i didnt inform her that the original unmixed metaphor was more correct does she still have any friends in kettle she laughed out loud friends in kettle when people move out of kettle they never look back she was still laughing as i hung up the phone the next day was sunday and dave and i went back to the bluff overlooking casa fuller a more furtive edgerton fulleriii left early after putting an overnight bag in the car i called the house and told the woman edgerton had been in a fenderbender and she needed to come into town to give him a ride home we waited while she packed the kid and started the car we kept our eyes on the trail of dust until she intersected the main road dave kept lookout on the bluff and i worked my way down into the canyon the house was relatively new and judging by the amount of grass it had a pretty good well one of the master bedroom windows was unlocked i took off my shoes and climbed through i did a quick casing of the large ranchstyle house then went to the home office at the end of the westernmost wing it had a beautiful panoramic view of the craggy ridge of the canyon everything in there belonged to edgerton business and private papers his bank receipts showed a deposit of more than nine hundred grand in march i found one of those retirement asset calculation sheets hed filled out he was worth a million and a half with about four hundred thousand in debt not so bad for a sales guy i searched the living room and kitchen then went back to the master bedroom i found it under the bed a metal box from some california winery that once held three bottles merlot cabernet and chardonnay no wine now just a collection of letters and cards misty cantarra of smallston idaho was a very popular girl and if the letters were any indication a little too free with her sexual favors i wrapped the metal box in a towel and tucked it under my arm i made the six hour drive to smallston and arrived in town about four oclock i took a quick pass through there were two bars i turned around at the city limits and stopped in the back water saloon the wall was covered with license plates from the last sixty years from what looked to be all fifty states there was no one there but the barmaid a busty blonde with pretty features washed plain by hard living and not all of it in a vertical position they only had michelob and budweiser on draft i begrudgingly ordered a bottled beer nice little town i lied she didnt look up from washing glasses yeah as long as you dont live here great conversationalist that i am i took that as an opening so why are you here she turned to me with a whothehellgivesashit kind of look saw my disarming smile and grinned i been out screwed up big time came home now im afraid to go anywhere else i was sympathetic that happens lifes tough you aint seen tough til youve seen smallston tough she cast her arm in a wide circle trees and lumberjacks rednecks and idiots you know what i mean i nodded she continued you gotta be mean to live here mean to stay the men are mean and if the women are to survive they get mean too i carried my end its hard work no room for creampuffs and softies someones got to do it she softened up a bit yeah well its like natural selection here darwind be proud only the fittest and the meanest survive the rest leave in search of humanity must have been big trouble to bring you back its the only kind of trouble there is she dried the glasses but kept her steady gaze on me you obviously got some reason to be talking mister she made it a question i didnt shillyshally around her perception yes im looking for a person she waited not helping me out any misty cantarra you know her she frowned now there was a girl mean enough for smallston she downright scared the men round these parts what do you want with her just trying to find her thats all she returned to the glasses well youre a day late and a dollar short you police not really private gosh never met a pi before i shrugged mistys dead or at least we think she is went off hiking one day never came back you should have seen the men of this town searching youdve thought the president was lost they looked for two weeks found her backpack in an old tree house overlooking the gorge site of some of her favorite conquests gotta tell you been a whole lot less sex in these parts since she done disappeared any chance she just skipped town she shook her head no way she was having too damn much fun she just loved lumberjack nooky no other way to put it i pulled out a picture of edgerton fulleriii id taken with my telephoto ever see this guy before she held the picture at arms length then took reading glasses from her jeans pocket and looked more closely yeah ive seen him maybe six months ago she seemed to rummage through her memories yeah he and misty got it on she banged him in the woodshed out back she motioned over her shoulder with her thumb i think he took it more seriously than he should have why i shrugged my shoulders cant tell you but my guess is youll hear soon enough i finished my beer left a tip thanks for the information i patted the back of her wet hand names maria if youre ever back in these parts the next day i was daves assistant a new substitute driver we pulled the big green truck into fulleriiis driveway with a halfmile widening band of dust behind us he skidded to a stop in front of the house the little girl was playing with a beach ball on the thick grassed front lawn dave knelt down beside her and pushed the ball away from her she laughed and chased after it as the woman came out the front door dave said to the daughter hey elouise dont you remember me from tucson dave turned and looked at the woman i have a package for tamarella fuller instant suspicion clouded her face but she was quick ill give it to her dave continued i havent seen her around since i got transferred from down south is she okay another quick adlib she was injured a while back shes been in the hospital for a while but shes getting better she looked at the envelop scanning the address label it was from the back water saloon in smallston idaho she blanched an ashy white dave gave her his best smile gee whens she due back we were pretty good friends in tucson id like to say hi yeah sure the woman turned without another word and walked into the house she slammed the door behind her an emphatic goodbye when he got back to the truck dave had a sudden attach of doubt what if she really is in the hospital what if im wrong i used my cell phone to call the number hi im looking for tamarella fuller we both listened this is she i hung up the phone dave dropped me off at the top of the canyon again and headed for kalispel to get the cops we figured itd be better for dave facetoface than trying to explain it over the phone anyway i didnt want to be involved sometimes the cops not without good reason dont take so well to my meddling ways as i was getting myself comfortable under a wide fir i saw edgertons big silver caddy come roaring down the driveway my guess was shed called him on his cell phone i didnt like the look of it the hen had panicked the chickens were coming home to roost i started making my way down the bluff working hard not to trip and break a leg the little girl was still on the lawn i kept her in sight as i slid down the hill the third didnt even look at her as he went by i wished i had a gun but whod have thought it i was at the corner of the house when i heard the shot i dashed for elouise grabbed her put my hand over her mouth and stuffed her under my arm pushed by a strong following wind i ran for the line of trees on the north end of the canyon a hundred yards from the house the womans voice pitched high with fear screeched into the wind elouise where are you elouise squirmed but i held her tight tamarella aka misty walked around the house with the revolver at her side the hammer was cocked we waited fifteen minutes later the caddy went screaming out to the main road i took the little girl back to the front yard set her down and told her to play ive got a real way with kids yeah right misty had torn the place apart looking for her metal box probably before edgerton had arrived pots pans plates and silverware were all over the kitchen floor the closets were emptied sheets blankets clothes everywhere edgerton fulleriii was dead in the bedroom a bullet hole in the back of his head i went out to the garage and pulled the garbage bag from beneath the crawl space i put the precious box back under the bed about four inches from fulleriiis outstretched hand i scurried back up the bluff the sirens wail pushed me faster i breasted the top just as two cruisers braked to a stop dave jumped out of the back door of the first one and rushed to elouise he lifted her to his crooked arm she was laughing sometimes in life things end like they begin at least if the newspaper accounts were to be believed i recalled the barmaids words i been out screwed up big time came home now im afraid to go anywhere else so it was that misty returned home and at the first sign of the cops was back on that hiking trail trying to lose them the cops got no help from the lumberjacks for some in their mean world theyd probably make her a patron saint but they found her huddled in that tree house above the gorge she babbled all the way down the mountain blaming that smoothtalking city feller poor fullertoniii she claimed fullertoniii shot himself then when she realized the evidence was against her she said he attacked her was going to kill her that she defended herself of course that was another lie the coroner showed fullertoniii had been dead from a blow to the back of the head before the bullet scrambled his brains eventually misty led the cops to where she and fulleriii had buried poor tamarella two months later my brother sent me a newspaper article from one of the idaho dailies an investigative report on the fullerton murders he highlighted the comment from the barmaid maria cantarra sister of the little killer just a couple days before misty showed up this big man comes into the bar wanting to know about misty and this guy fullertoniii he said he was a private investigator a pi just couldnt be you know what i mean brown socks black shoes blueblack pants and a reddishbrown shirt i mean a pi hed dress cool right i think it was the devil hisself coming after my bad baby sister
