series prologue they called for me that is all i really know they called for me and i went to them i could not do otherwise the will of the whole of humanity was a strong thing it smashed through the ties of time and the chains of space and dragged me to itself why was i chosen i still do not know though they thought they had told me and now it is done and i am here i shall always be here and if as wise men tell me time is cyclic then i shall one day return to the part of the cycle i left and which i knew as the twentieth century ad in the age of men for i am immortal chapter one a call across time between wakefulness and sleeping we have most of us had the illusion of hearing voices scraps of conversation phrases spoken in unfamiliar tones sometimes we attempt to attune our minds so that we can hear more but we are rarely successful these illusions are called hypnagogic hallucinationsthe beginning of the dreams we shall later experience as we sleep there was a woman a child a city an occupation a name john daker a sense of frustration a need for fulfilment though i loved them i know i loved them it was in the winter i lay miserably in a cold bed and i stared through the window at the moon i do not remember my exact thoughts something to do with mortality and the futility of human existence no doubt then between wakefulness and sleeping i began every night to hear voices at first i dismissed them expecting to fall immediately asleep but they continued and i began trying to listen to them thinking perhaps to receive some message from my unconscious but the most commonly repeated word was gibberish to me erekosл erekosл erekosл i could not recognise the language though it had a peculiar familiarity the closest language i could place it with was the language of sioux indians but i knew only a few words of sioux erekosл erekosл erekosл each night i redoubled my efforts to concentrate on the voices and gradually i began to experience much stronger hypnagogic hallucinations until one night it seemed that i broke free from my body altogether had i hung for an eternity in limbo was i alivedead was there a memory of a world that lay in the far past or the distant future of another world which seemed closer and the names was i john daker or erekosл was i either of these many other namescorom bannan flurrun aubec elric rackhir simon cornelius asquinol hawkmoonfled away down the ghostly rivers of my memory i hung in darkness bodiless a man spoke where was he i tried to look but had no eyes with which to see erekosл the champion where are you another voice father it is only a legend no lolinda i feel he is listening erekosл i tried to answer but i had no tongue with which to speak then there were swirling halfdreams of a house in a great city of miraclesa swollen grimy city of miracles crammed with dullcoloured machines many of which bore human passengers there were buildings beautiful beneath their coatings of dust and there were other brighter buildings not so beautiful with austere lines and many windows there were screams and loud noises there was a troop of riders galloping over an undulating countryside flamboyant in armour of lacquered gold coloured pennants draped around their bloodencrusted lances their faces were heavy with weariness then there were more faces many faces some of them i halfrecognised others were completely unfamiliar many of these were dressed in strange clothes i saw a whitehaired man in middle age he wore a tall spiked crown of iron and diamonds upon his head his mouth moved he was speaking erekosл it is iking rigenos defender of humanity you are needed again erekosл the hounds of evil rule a third of the world and humankind is weary with the war against them come to us erekosл lead us to victory from the plains of melting ice to the mountains of sorrow they have set up their corrupt standard and i fear they will advance yet further into our territories come to us erekosл lead us to victory come to us erekosл lead us the womans voice father this is only an empty tomb not even the mummy of erekosл remains it became drifting dust long ago let us leave and return to necranal to marshal the living peers i felt like a fainting man who strives to fight against dizzy oblivion but however much he tries cannot take control of his own brain again i tried to answer but could not it was as if i wavered backwards through time while every atom of me wanted to go forward i had the sensation of vast size as if i were made of stone with eyelids of granite that measured miles acrosseyelids which i could not open and then i was tiny the most minute grain in the universe and yet i felt i belonged to the whole far more than did the stone giant memories came and went the whole panorama of the twentieth century its discoveries and its deceits its beauties and its bitterness its satisfactions its strifing its selfdelusion its superstitious fancies that it gave the name of science rushed into my mind like air into a vacuum but it was only momentary for the next second my entire being was flung elsewhereto a world which was earth but not the earth of john daker not quite the world of dead erekosл there were three great continents two close together divided from the other by a vast sea containing many islands large and small i saw an ocean of ice which i knew to be slowly shrinkingthe plains of melting ice i saw the third continent which bore lush flora mighty forests blue lakes and which was bound along its northern coasts by a towering chain of mountainsthe mountains of sorrow this i knew to be the domain of the eldren whom king rigenos had called the hounds of evil now on the other two continents i saw the wheatlands of the west on the continent of zavara with their tall cities of multicoloured rock their rich citiesstalaco calodemia mooros ninadoon and dratarda there were the great seaportsshilaal wedmah sinana tarkarand noonos with her towers cobbled in precious stones then i saw the fortress cities of the continent of necralala with the capital city necranal chief among them built on into and about a mighty mountain peaked by the spreading palace of its warrior kings now i began to remember as in the background of my awareness i heard a voice calling erekosл erekosл erekosл the warrior kings of necranal kings for two thousand years of a humanity united at war and united again the warrior kings of whom king rigenos was the last livingand ageing now with only a daughter lolinda to carry on his line old and weary with hatebut still hating hating the unhuman folk whom he called the hounds of evil mankinds ageold enemies reckless and wild linked it was said by a thin line of blood to the human racean outcome of a union between an ancient queen and the evil one azmobaana hated by king rigenos as soulless immortals slaves of azmobaanas machinations and hating he called upon john daker whom he named erekosл to aid him with his war against them erekosл i beg thee answer me are you ready to come his voice was loud and echoing and when after a struggle i could reply my own voice seemed to echo also i am ready i replied but seem to be chained chained there was consternation in his voice are you then a prisoner of azmobaanas frightful minions are you trapped upon the ghost worlds perhaps i said but i do not think so it is space and time which chain me i am separated from you by a gulf without form or dimension how may we bridge that gulf and bring you to us the united walls of humanity may serve the purpose already we pray that you may come to us then continue i said i was falling away again i thought i remembered laughter sadness pride then suddenly more faces i felt as if i witnessed the passing of everyone i had known down the ages and then one face superimposed itself over the othersthe head and shoulders of an amazingly beautiful woman with blonde hair piled beneath a diadem of precious stones which seemed to light the sweetness of her oval face lolinda i said i saw her more solidly now she was clinging to the arm of the tall gaunt man who wore the crown of iron and diamonds king rigenos they stood before an empty platform of quartz and gold and resting on a cushion of dust was a straight sword which they dared not touch neither did they dare step too close to it for it gave off a radiation which might slay them it was a tomb in which they stood the tomb of erekosл my tomb i moved towards the platform hanging over it ages before my body had been placed there i stared at the sword which held no dangers for me but i was unable in my captivity to pick it up it was my spirit only which inhabited that dark placebut the whole of my spirit now not the fragment which had inhabited the tomb for thousands of years that fragment had heard king rigenos and had enabled john daker to hear it to come to it to be united with it erekosл called the king straining his eyes through the gloom as if he had seen me erekosл we pray then i experienced the dreadful pain which i supposed must be like that of a woman experiencing childbirth a pain that seemed eternal and yet was intrinsically its own vanquisher i was screaming writhing in the air above them great spasms of agonybut an agony complete with purposethe purpose of creation i shrieked but there was joy in my cry i groaned but there was triumph there i grew heavy and i reeled i grew heavier and heavier and i gasped stretching out my arms to balance myself i had flesh and i had muscle and i had blood and i had strength the strength coursed through me and i took a huge breath and touched my body it was a powerful body and tall and fit i looked up i stood before them in the flesh i was their god and i had returned i have come i said i am here king rigenos i have left nothing worth while behind me but do not let me regret that leaving you will not regret it champion he was pale exhilarated smiling i looked at lolinda who dropped her eyes modestly and then as if against her will raised them again to regard me i turned to the dais on my right my sword i said reaching for it i heard king rigenos sigh with satisfaction they are doomed now the dogs he said chapter two the champion has come they had a sheath for the sword it had been made days before king rigenos left to get it leaving me alone with his daughter now that i was here i did not think to question how i came and why it should have been possible neither it seemed did she question the fact i was there it seemed inevitable we regarded one another silently until the king returned with the scabbard this will protect us against your swords poison he said he held it out to me and for a moment i hesitated before stretching my own hand towards it and accepting it the king frowned and looked at the ground then he folded his arms across his chest i held the scabbard in my two hands it was opaque like old glass but the metal was unfamiliar to meor rather to john daker it was light flexible and strong i turned and picked up the sword the handle was bound in gold thread and was vibrant to my touch the pommel was a globe of deep onyx and the hilt was worked in strips of silver and black onyx the blade was long and straight and sharp but it did not shine like steel instead in colour it resembled lead the sword was beautifully balanced and i swung it through the air and laughed aloud and it seemed to laugh with me erekosл sheath it cried king rigenos in alarm sheath it the radiation is death to all but yourself i was reluctant now to put the sword away the feel of it awakened a dim remembrance erekosл please i beg you lolindas voice echoed her fathers sheath the sword reluctantly i slid the sword into its scabbard why was i the only one who could wear the sword without being affected by its radiation was it because in that transition from my own age to this i had become constitutionally different in some way was it that the ancient erekosл and the unborn john daker had metabolisms which had adapted to protect themselves against the power which flowed from the sword i shrugged it did not matter the fact itself was enough i was unconcerned it was as if i was aware that my fate had been taken out of my hands to a large extent i had become a tool if only i had known then to what use the tool would be put then i might have fought against the pull and remained the harmless intellectual john daker but perhaps i could not have fought and won the power that drew me to this age was very great at any rate i was prepared at that moment to do whatever fate demanded of me i stood there where i had materialised in the tomb of erekosл and i revelled in my strength and in my sword later things were to change i will need clothes i said for i was naked and armour and a steed i am erekosл clothes have been prepared said king rigenos he clapped his hands here the slaves entered one carried a robe another a cloak another a white cloth which i gathered had to serve for underwear they wrapped the cloth around my lower quarters and slipped the robe over my head it was loose and cool and felt pleasant on my skin it was deep blue with complicated designs stitched into it in gold silver and scarlet thread the cloak was scarlet with designs of gold silver and blue they gave me soft boots of doeskin to put on my feet and a wide belt of light brown leather with an iron buckle in which were set rubies and sapphires and i hung my scabbard on this then i gripped the sword with my left fist i am ready i said lolinda shuddered then let us leave this gloomy place she murmured with one last look back at the dais on which the heap of dust still lay i walked with the king and the princess of necranal out of my own tomb and into a calm day that while warm had a light breeze blowing we were standing on a small hill behind us the tomb apparently built of black quartz looked timeworn and ancient pitted by the passing of many storms and many winds on its roof was the corroded statue of a warrior mounted on a great battlecharger the face had been smoothed by dust and rain but i knew it it was my face i looked away below us a caravan was waiting there were the richly caparisoned horses and a guard of men dressed in that same golden armour i had seen in my dreams these warriors however were fresher looking than the others their armour was fluted embellished with raised designs ornate and beautiful but according to my sparse reading on the subject of armour coupled with erekosлs stirring memory totally unsuitable for war the fluting and embossing acted as a trap to catch the point of a spear or sword whereas armour should be made to turn a point this armour for all its beauty acted more as an extra danger than a protection the guards were mounted on heavy warhorses but the beasts that knelt awaiting us resembled a kind of camel from which all the camels lumpen ugliness had been bred these beasts were beautiful on their high backs were cabins of ebony ivory and motherofpearl curtained in scintillating silks we walked down the hill and as we walked i noticed that i still had the ring on my finger that i had worn as john daker a ring of woven silver that my wife had given me my wife i could not recall her face i felt i should have left the ring behind meon that other body but perhaps there is no body left behind we reached the kneeling beasts and the guards stiffened their backs to acknowledge our arrival i saw curiosity in many of the eyes that looked at me king rigenos gestured towards one of the beasts would you care to take your cabin champion though he himself had summoned me he seemed to be slightly wary of me thank you i climbed the little ladder of plaited silk and entered the cabin it was completely lined with deep cushions of a variety of hues the camels climbed to their feet and we began to move swiftly through a narrow valley whose sides were lined with evergreen trees which i could not namesomething like spreading monkeypuzzle trees but with more branches and broader leaves i had lain my sword across my knees i inspected it it was a plain soldiers sword having no markings on the blade the hilt fitted perfectly into my right hand as i gripped it it was a good sword but why it was poisonous to other humans i did not know presumably it was also lethal to those whom king rigenos called the hounds of evilthe eldren on we travelled through the soft day and i drowsed on my cushions feeling strangely weary until i heard a cry and pushed back the curtains of my cabin to look ahead there was necranal the city which i had seen in my dreams far away still it towered upwards so that the entire mountain upon which it was built was hidden by its wondrous architecture minarets steeples domes and battlements shone in the sun and above them all loomed the huge palace of the warrior kings a noble structure manytowered the palace of ten thousand windows i remembered the name i saw king rigenos peer from his cabin and cry katorn ride ahead and tell the people that erekosл the champion has come to drive the evil ones back to the mountains of sorrow the man he addressed was a sullenfaced individual doubtless the captain of the imperial guard aye sire he growled he drew his horse out of line and galloped speedily along the road of white dust which wound now down an incline i could see the road stretching for many miles into the distance towards necranal i watched the rider for a while but wearied of this eventually and instead strained my eyes to make out details in that great city structure the cities of london new york or tokyo were probably bigger in area but not much necranal was spread around the base of the mountain for many miles surrounding the city was a high wall upon which turrets were mounted at intervals so at last we came to the great main gate of necranal and our caravan halted a musical instrument sounded and the gates began to swing open we passed through into streets packed with jostling cheering people who shouted so loudly i was forced at times to cover my ears for fear they would rupture chapter three the eldren threat now the cheering gradually fell away as the little caravan ascended the winding road to the palace of ten thousand windows a silence settled and i heard only the creak of the howdah in which i sat the occasional jingle of harness or the clatter of a horses hoof i began to feel discomforted there was something about the mood of the city that was not altogether sane and which could not be explained away in conventional terms certainly the people were afraid of enemy attack certainly they were weary with fighting but it seemed to me that this mood held something morbida mixture of hysterical elation and melancholic depression that i had sensed only once before in my previous life during my single visit to a mental hospital or perhaps i was merely imposing my own mood on my surroundings after all it could be argued that i was in a classic paranoidschizophrenic situation a man with two or more welldefined identities who also happened to be considered in this world the potential saviour of mankind for a moment i wondered if in fact i had not gone completely insaneif this were not some monstrous delusionif i were not actually at this moment in the very madhouse i had once visited i touched the draperies my scabbarded sword i peered out at the vast city now stretched out below me i stared at the huge bulk of the palace of ten thousand windows above me i attempted to see beyond them deliberately assuming that they were an illusion expecting to see the walls of a hospital room or even the familiar walls of my own apartment but the palace of ten thousand windows remained as solid as ever the city of necranal had none of the qualities of a mirage i sank back in my cushions i had to assume that this was real that i had been transported somehow across the ages and through space to this earth of which there were no records in any history book i had ever read and of which there were only echoes in myths and legends i was no longer john daker i was erekosлthe eternal champion a legend myselfcome to life i laughed then if i were madthen it was a glorious madness a madness of which i would never have considered myself capable of inventing at length our caravan arrived at the summit of the mountain and the jewelled gates of the palace opened for us and we passed inside a splendid courtyard in which trees grew and fountains played feeding little rivers spanned by ornamental bridges fish swam in the rivers and birds sang in the trees as pages came forward to make our beasts kneel down and we stepped out into the evening light king rigenos smiled with pride as he gestured around the great courtyard you like this erekosл i had it built myself shortly after i came to the throne the courtyard was a gloomy sort of place until thenit did not fit with the rest of the palace it is very beautiful i said i turned to look at lolinda who had joined us and not the only beautiful thing you have helped createfor here is the most beautiful adornment to your palace king rigenos chuckled you are a courtier as well as a warrior i see he took my arm and lolindas and guided us across the courtyard of course i have little time these days to consider the creation of beauty it is weapons we must create now instead of plans for gardens i must concern myself with battle plans he sighed perhaps you will drive the eldren away for ever erekosл perhaps when they are destroyed we shall be able to enjoy the peaceful things of life again i felt sorry for him at that moment he only wanted what every man wantedfreedom from fear a chance to raise children with a reasonable certainty that they would be allowed to do the same a chance to look forward to the future without the knowledge that any plans made might be wrecked for ever by some sudden act of violence his world after all was not so different from the one i had so recently left i put my hand on the kings shoulder let us hope so king rigenos i said i will do what i can he cleared his throat and that will be a great deal champion i know it will be a great deal we shall soon rid ourselves of the eldren menace we entered a cool hall whose walls were lined with beaten silver over which tapestries were draped it was a pleasant hall though very large off the hall led a wide staircase and down the staircase now descended a whole army of slaves servants and retainers of all kinds they drew themselves up in ranks at the bottom and knelt to greet the king this is lord erekosл king rigenos told them he is a great warrior and my honoured guest treat him as you would treat meobey him as you would obey me all that he wishes shall be his to my embarrassment the assemblage fell to its knees again and chorused greetings lord erekosл i spread my hands they rose i was beginning to take this sort of behaviour for granted there was no doubt that part of me was used to it i shall not burden you with ceremony for tonight rigenos said if you would like to refresh yourself in the apartments we have set aside for your use we shall visit you later very well i said i turned to lolinda and put out my hand to take hers she extended it after a moments hesitation and i kissed it i look forward to seeing you both again in a little time i murmured looking deep into her marvellous eyes she dropped her gaze and withdrew her hand and i allowed the servants to escort me upstairs to my apartments twenty large rooms had been set aside for my use these contained quarters for a staff of some ten personal slaves and servants and they were most of them extravagantly furnished with an eye to luxury that it seemed to me the people of the twentieth century had lost opulent was the word that sprang to mind i could not move but a slave would come forward and take my surcoat or help me pour a glass of water or arrange the cushions of a divan yet i was still somewhat uneasy and it was a relief when exploring the apartments to come upon the more austere rooms these were weaponlined warriors rooms without cushions or silks or furs but with solid benches and blades and maces of iron and steel brassshod lances and razorsharp arrows i spent some time in the weapon rooms and then returned to eat my slaves brought me food and wine and i ate and drank heartily when i had finished i felt as if i had been asleep for a long time and had awakened invigorated again i paced the rooms exploring them further taking more interest in the weapons than in the furnishings which would have delighted even the most jaded sybarite i stepped out on to one of the several covered balconies and surveyed the great city of necranal as the sun set over it and deep shadows began to flow through the streets the faraway sky was full of smoky colour there were purples oranges yellows and blues and these colours were reflected in the domes and steeples of necranal so that the entire city seemed to take on a softer texture like a pastel drawing the shadows grew blacker the sun set and stained the topmost domes scarlet and then the night fell and fire flared suddenly all around the distant walls of necranal the yellow and red flames leaping upward at intervals of a few yards and illuminating much of the city within the walls lights appeared in windows and i heard the calls of nightbirds and insects i turned to go in and saw that my servants had lit lamps for me it had grown colder but i hesitated on the balcony and decided to stay where i was thinking deeply about my strange situation and trying to gauge the exact nature of the perils which humanity faced there came a sound behind me i looked back into the apartments and saw king rigenos entering moody katorn captain of the imperial guard was with him instead of a helmet he now wore a platinum circlet on his head and instead of a breastplate a leather jerkin stamped with a design in gold but the absence of armour did not seem to soften his general demeanour king rigenos was wrapped in a white fur cloak and still wore his spiked crown of iron and diamonds the two men joined me on the balcony you feel rested i hope erekosл king rigenos enquired almost nervously as if he had expected me to fade into air while he was away i feel very well thank you king rigenos good he hesitated time is valuable katorn grunted yes katorn yes i know king rigenos looked at me as if he hoped i already knew what he wished to say but i did not and could only stare back waiting for him to speak you will forgive us erekosл said katorn if we come immediately to the matter of the human kingdoms the king would outline to you our position and what we require of you of course i said i am ready i was in fact very anxious to learn the position we have maps said king rigenos where are the maps katorn within sire shall we i nodded and we entered my apartments we passed through two chambers until we came to the main livingroom in which was a large oak table here stood several of king rigenoss slaves with large rolls of parchment under their arms katorn selected several of the rolls and spread them one on top of the other on the table he drew his heavy dagger to weight one side and picked up a metal vase studded with rubies and emeralds to hold the other side i looked at the maps with interest i already recognised them i had seen something similar in my dreams before i had been called here by king rigenoss incantations now the king bent over the maps and his long pale index finger traced over the territories shown as i told you in youryour tomb erekosл the eldren now dominate the entire southern continent they call this continent mernadin there his finger now hovered over a coastal region of the continent five years ago they recaptured the only real outpost we had on mernadin here their ancient seaport of paphanaal there was little fighting your forces fled i asked katorn came in again i admit that we had grown complacent when they suddenly swept out of the mountains of sorrow we were unprepared they must have been building their damned armies for years and we were unaware of it we could not be expected to know their planstheyre aided by sorcery and we are not you were able to evacuate most of your colonies i take it i put in katorn shrugged there was little evacuation necessary mernadin was virtually uninhabited since human beings would not live in a land which had been polluted by the presence of the hounds of evil the continent is cursed inhabited by fiends from hell i rubbed my chin and asked innocently then why did you drive the eldren back to the mountains in the first place if you had no need of their territories because while they had the land under their control they were a constant threat to humanity i see i made a tiny gesture with my right hand forgive me for interrupting you please continue a constant threat began katorn that threat is once again imminent the kings voice broke in it was thick and trembling his eyes were suddenly full of fear and hatred we expect them at any moment to launch an attack upon the two continentsupon zavara and necralala do you know when they plan this invasion i asked how long have we to ready ourselves theyll attack katorns black eyes came to life the thin beard framing his pale face seemed to bristle theyll attack agreed king rigenos they would have overrun us now if we did not constantly war against them we have to keep them back added katorn once a breach is made they will engulf us king rigenos sighed humanity though is battleweary we needed one of two thingsthough ideally bothfresh warriors to drive the eldren back or a leader to give the warriors we have new hope and you can train no fresh warriors i asked katorn made a short guttural sound in his throat i took this to be a laugh impossible all mankind fights the eldren menace the king nodded so i called you erekosлthough believing myself to be a desperate fool willing to think a mirage reality katorn turned away at this it seemed to me that this had been his private theorythat the king had gone mad in his desperation my materialisation seemed to have destroyed this theory and made him in some way resentful of me though i did not think i could be blamed for the kings decision the king straightened his shoulders i called you and i held you to your vow i knew of no vow i was surprised what vow i said now the king looked astonished why the vow that if ever the eldren dominated mernadin again you would come to decide the struggle between them and humanity i see i signed to a slave to bring me a cup of wine and i sipped it and stared at the map as john daker i saw a meaningless war between two ferocious blindly hating factions both of whom seemed to be conducting a racial jihad one against the other yet my loyalties were clear i belonged to the human race and should use all my power to help defend my kind humanity had to be saved the eldren i looked up at king rigenos what do they say what do you mean katorn growled say you speak as if you do not believe our king i am not questioning the truth of your statements i told him i wish to know the exact terms in which the eldren justify their war against us it would help if i had a clearer idea of their ambitions katorn shrugged they would wipe us out he said is that not enough to know no i said you must have taken prisoners what do the prisoners tell you i spread my hands how have the eldren leaders justified their war against humanity king rigenos smiled patronisingly you have forgotten a great deal erekosл if you have forgotten the eldren they are not human they are clever they are cold and they have smooth deceitful tongues with which they would lull a man into a false sense of tranquillity before tearing his heart from his body with their bare fangs they are brave though ill give them that under torture they die refusing to tell us their true plans they are cunning they try to make us believe their talk of peace of mutual trust and mutual help hoping that we will drop our defences long enough so that they may turn and destroy us or get us to look them full in the face so that they can work the evil eye upon us do not be naive erekosл do not attempt to deal with an eldren as you would deal with a human being for if you did so you would be doomed they have no souls as we understand souls they have no love save a cold loyalty to their cause and to their master azmobaana realise this erekosлthe eldren are demons they are fiends to whom azmobanna in his dreadful blasphemy has granted something like a human form but you must not be blinded by the form that which is inside an eldren is not humanit is everything in fact that is unhuman katorns face twisted you cant trust an eldren wolf they are treacherous immoral and evil we shall not be safe until their whole race is destroyed utterly destroyedso that not a fragment of their flesh not a droplet of their blood not a splinter of their bone not a strand of their hair is left to taint the earth and i speak literally erekosл for while one fingerclipping of an eldren survives upon our world then there is the chance that azmobanna can recreate his servants and attack us again that demon brood must be burnt to the finest ashevery man every female and every youngling burntthen cast to the winds the clean winds that is our mission erekosл the mission of humanity and we have the good ones blessing for that mission then i heard another voice a sweeter voice and i glanced towards the door it was lolinda you must lead us to victory erekosл she said candidly what katorn says is trueno matter how fiercely he declaims it the facts are as he tells you you must lead us to victory i looked again into her eyes i drew a deep breath and my face felt hard and cold i will lead you i said chapter four iolinda the next morning i awoke hearing the sounds of the slaves preparing my breakfast or was it the slaves was it not my wife moving about the room getting ready to wake the boy up as she did every morning i opened my eyes expecting to see her i did not see her nor did i see my room in my apartment where i had lived as john daker nor did i see slaves instead i saw lolinda she was smiling down at me as she prepared the breakfast with her own hands i felt guilty for a moment as if i had betrayed my wife in some obscure way then i realised that there was nothing i could be ashamed of i was the victim of fateof forces which i could not hope to understand i was not john daker i was erekosл i realised that it would be the best for me if i were to insist on that a man divided between two identities is a sick man i resolved to forget john daker as soon as possible since i was erekosл now i should concentrate on being erekosл only in that i was a fatalist lolinda brought a bowl of fruit towards me would you eat lord erekosл i selected a strange soft fruit with a reddish yellow skin she handed me a small knife i tried to peel it but since the fruit was new to me i was not sure how to begin she gently took it from me and began to peel it for me sitting on the edge of my low bed and concentrating rather excessively in my opinion on the fruit she held at last the fruit was peeled and she quartered it and placed it on a plate and handed the plate to me still avoiding my direct gaze but smiling a little mysteriously as she looked about her i picked up a piece of the fruit and bit it it was sharp and sweet at the same time and very refreshing thank you i said it is good i have never had this fruit before have you not she was genuinely surprised but the ecrex is the commonest fruit in necralala you forget i am a stranger to necralala i pointed out she put her head on one side and looked at me with a slight frown she pushed back the flimsy blue cloth that covered her golden hair and made a great play of arranging her matching blue gown she really did seem to be puzzled a stranger she murmured a stranger i agreed butshe pausedbut you are the great hero of humanity lord erekosл you knew necranal as it was in its greatest glorywhen you ruled here as the champion you knew the earth in ancient times when you set it free from the chains the eldren had bound around it you know more of this world than i do erekosл i shrugged i admit that much of it is familiarand growing increasingly familiar but until yesterday my name was john daker and i lived in a city very different from necranal and my occupation was not that of warrior or indeed anything like it i do not deny that i am erekosлthe name is familiar and i am comfortable with it but i do not know who erekosл was any more than do you he was a great hero of ancient times who before he died swore that he would return to decide the issue between eldren and mankind if he were needed he was placed in a rather gloomy tomb on a hillside along with his sword which only he could wield the sword kanajana murmured lolinda it has a name then ayekanajana itit is more than a name i believe it is some sort of mystic descriptiona description of its exact natureof the powers it contains and is there any legend that explains why only i can bear that blade i asked her there are several she said which do you prefer i smiled then for the first time that morning she looked directly at me and her voice lowered and she said i prefer the one that says that you are the chosen son of the good one the great onethat your sword is a sword of the gods and that you can handle it because you are a godan immortal i laughed you do not believe that she dropped her gaze if you tell me that it is not true then i must believe you she said of course i admit that i feel extremely healthy i told her but that is a long way from feeling as a god must feel besides i think i would know if i were a god i would know other gods i would dwell in some place where the gods dwell i would count goddesses among my friends i stopped she seemed disturbed i reached out and touched her and said softly but then perhaps you are right perhaps i am a godfor i am certainly privileged to know a goddess she shrugged off my hand you are making mock of me my lord no i swear it she got up i must appear foolish to such a great lord as yourself i apologise for wasting your time with my chatter you have not wasted my time i said you have helped me in fact her lips parted helped you yes you have filled in part of my somewhat peculiar background i still do not remember my past as erekosл but at least i know as much about that past as anyone here which is not a disadvantage perhaps your centuries long sleep has washed your mind free of memory she said perhaps i agreed or perhaps there have been so many other memories during that sleepnew experiences other lives what do you mean well it seems to me that i have been more people than just john daker and erekosл other names spring to mindstrange names in unfamiliar tongues i have a vagueand perhaps stupid notionthat while i slept as erekosл my spirit took on other shapes and names perhaps that spirit cannot sleep but must forever be active i stopped i was getting deep into the realms of metaphysicsand metaphysics had never been my strong point i considered myself a pragmatist in fact such notions as reincarnation i had always scoffed atstill scoffed at really in spite of the evidence such as it was but lolinda pressed me to continue what i considered to be pointless speculation go on she said please continue lord erekosл if only to keep the beautiful girl beside me for a short while longer i did as she asked well i said while you and your father were attempting to bring me here i thought i remembered other lives than this one as erekosл or the other one as john daker i remembered very dimly other civilisationsthough i could not tell you whether they existed in the past or in the future in fact the idea of past and future seems meaningless to me now i have no idea for instance whether this civilisation lies in the future that i knew as john daker or in the past it is here i am here there are certain things that i will have to do that is all i can say but these other incarnations she said what do you know of them i shrugged nothing i am attempting to describe a dim feeling not an exact impression a few names which i have now forgotten a few images which have almost completely faded away as dreams fade and perhaps that is all they ever werejust dreams perhaps my life as john daker which in its turn is beginning to fade in my memory was merely that a dream certainly i know nothing of any supernatural agencies of whom your father and katorn have spoken i know of no azmobaana no good and great one no demons or indeed angels i know only that i am a man and that i exist her face was grave that is true you are a man you exist i saw you materialise but from where did i come from the other regions she said from the place where all great warriors go when they dieand where their women go to join themto live in eternal happiness again i smiled but then smothered the smile for i did not wish to offend her beliefs i remembered no such place i remember only strife if i have been away from here it was not in some land of eternal happinessit was in many landslands of eternal warfare suddenly i felt depressed and weary eternal warfare i repeated and i sighed her look became sympathetic do you think that that is your fateto war for ever against the enemies of humanity i frowned not quitefor i seem to remember times when i was not human as you would understand the word if i have a spirit as i said that inhabits many forms then there have been times when it has inhabited forms that weredifferent i rejected the thought it was too difficult to grasp to frightening to tolerate it disturbed lolinda she rose and darted a look of incomprehension at me notnot as an i smiled an eldren i do not know but i do not think so for the name is not familiar to me in that respect she was relieved it is so hard to trust she said sadly to trust what words to trust anything she said i once thought i understood the world perhaps i was too young now i understand nothing i do not know whether i shall even be alive next year i think that may be described as a common fear to all we mortals i said gently we mortals her smile was without humour you are not mortal erekosл i had not up to now considered it after all i had been summoned into existence in thin air i laughed we shall soon know whether i am or not i said when we have joined battle with the eldren a little moan escaped her lips then oh she cried do not consider it she moved towards the door you are immortal erekosл you are invulnerable you areeternal you are the only thing of which i can be sure the only person i can trust do not joke so do not joke so i beg you i was astonished at this outburst i would have risen from the bed to hold her and comfort her but i was naked admittedly she had seen me naked once before when i had originally materialised in erekosлs tomb but i did not know enough of the customs of these people to guess whether it would shock her or not forgive me lolinda i said i did not realise what had i not realised the extent of the poor girls insecurity or something deeper than that do not go i begged she stopped by the door and turned and there were tears in her huge wide eyes you are eternal erekosл you are immortal you can never die i could not reply for all i knew i would be dead in the first encounter with the eldren suddenly i became aware of the responsibility i had a responsibility not just to this beautiful woman but to the whole human race i swallowed hard and fell back on my pillows as lolinda rushed from the room could i possibly bear such a burden did i wish to bear such a burden i did not i had no great faith in my own powers and there was no reason to believe that those powers were any more potent than say katorns katorn was after all far more experienced in warfare than i he had a right to be resentful of me i had taken over his role robbed him of his power and of a responsibility which he had been prepared to shoulderand i was unproven suddenly i saw katorns point of view and sympathised with it what right had i to lead humanity in a war that could decide its very existence none and then another thought came to mea more selfpitying thought what right had humanity to expect so much of me they had let us say awakened me from a slumber which i had earned leading the quiet decent life of john daker and now they were imposing their will upon me demanding that i give back to them the selfconfidence andyesselfrighteousness that they were losing i lay there in the bed and for a while i hated king rigenos katorn and the rest of the human raceincluding the fair lolinda who had been the one to bring this question to my mind erekosл the champion defender of humanity greatest of warriors lay wretched and snivelling in his bed and felt very sorry for himself indeed chapter five katorn i arose at last and dressed myself in a simple tunic having been washed and shavedmuch to my embarrassmentby my slaves i went by myself into the weapons rooms and there took down my sword from where it hung in its scabbard on a peg i unsheathed the blade and again a sort of exultation filled me immediately i forgot my qualms and scruples and laughed as the sword whistled around my head and my muscles flexed with the weight of it i feinted with the sword and it seemed that it was part of my very body that it was another limb whose presence i had been unaware of until now i thrust it out at full reach pulled it back swung it down it filled me with joy to wield it it made me into something greater than i had ever felt i was before it made me into a man a warrior a champion and yet as john daker i had handled swords perhaps twice in my lifeand handled them most clumsily according to those friends of mine who had considered themselves experts at last i reluctantly sheathed the sword as i saw a slave hovering some distance away i remembered that only i erekosл could hold the sword and live what is it i said the lord katorn master he would speak with you i put the sword back on its peg bid him enter i told the slave katorn came in rapidly he appeared to have been waiting some time and was in no better a mood than when i had first encountered him his boots which seemed to be shod with metal clattered on the flagstones of the weapons room good morning to you lord erekosл he said i bowed good morning lord katorn i apologise if you were made to wait i was trying out that sword the sword kanajana katorn looked at it speculatively the sword kanajana i said would you have some refreshment lord katorn i was making a great effort to please himnot only because it would not do to have so experienced a warrior as an enemy when plans of battle were being prepared but because i had as i said come to sympathise with his situation but katorn refused to be mollified i broke my fast at dawn he said i have come to discuss more pressing matters than eating lord erekosл and what are those manfully i restrained my own temper matters of war lord erekosл what else indeed and what specific matters would you wish to discuss with me lord katorn it seems to me that we should attack the eldren before they come against us attack being the best form of defence eh he looked surprised at this he had plainly not heard the phrase before eloquently put my lord one would think you an eldren yourself with such a way with words he was deliberately trying my temper but i swallowed the insinuation so i said we attack them where that is what we shall have to discuss with all those concerned in planning this war but it seems there is one obvious point and that is he wheeled and strode into another chamber returning with a map which he spread on a bench it was a map of the third continent the one entirely controlled by the eldren mernadin with his dagger he stabbed at a spot i had seen indicated the night before paphanaal i said while it is the logical point of an initial attack in a campaign of the sort we plan it seems to me unlikely that the eldren will expect us to make so bold a move knowing that we are weary and under strength but if we are weary and weak i said would it not seem a good idea to attack some less important city first you are forgetting my lord that our warriors have been heartened by your coming katorn said dryly i could not help grinning at this cut but katorn scowled angry that i had not taken offence i said quietly we must learn to work together my lord katorn i bow to your great experience as a warrior leader i acknowledge that you have had much more recent knowledge of the eldren than have i i need your help surely as much as king rigenos believes he needs mine katorn seemed slightly comforted by this he cleared his throat and continued once paphanaal province and city are taken we shall have a beachhead from which other attacks inland can be made with paphanaal again in our hands we can decide our own strategyinitiate action rather than react to the eldrens strategy only once we have pushed them back into the mountains will we have the wearying task of clearing them all out it will take years but it is what we should have done in the first place that however will be a matter for ordinary military administration and will not concern us directly and what kind of defences has paphanaal i asked katorn smiled she relies almost entirely on her warships if we can destroy her fleet then paphanaal is as good as taken he bared his teeth in what i gathered was a grin and he looked at me his expression changing to one of sudden suspicion as if he had revealed too much to me i could not ignore the expression what is on your mind lord katorn i asked do you not trust me he controlled his features i must trust you he said flatly we all must trust you lord erekosл have you not returned to fulfil your ancient promise i gazed searchingly into his face do you believe that i must believe it do you believe that i am erekosл the champion returned i must believe that also you believe it because you surmise that if i am not erekosлthe erekosл of the legendsthen the human race is doomed he lowered his head as if in assent and what if i am not erekosл my lord katorn looked up you must be erekosлmy lord if it were not for one thing i would suspect what would you suspect nothing you would suspect that i were an eldren in disguise is that it lord katorn some cunning unhuman who had assumed the outer appearance of a man do i read your thoughts correctly my lord too correctly katorns thick brows came together and his mouth was thin and white the eldren are said to have the power to probe mindsbut not human beings and are you then afraid lord katorn of an eldren by the good one ill show you and katorns heavy hand rushed to the hilt of his sword i raised my own hand and then pointed at the sword that hung sheathed on the peg on the wall but that is the one fact that does not fit your theory isnt it if i am not erekosл then how is it that i can handle erekosлs blade he did not draw his sword but his grip remained on the hilt it is true is it not that no living creaturehuman or eldrencan touch that blade and live i said quietly that is the legend he agreed legend i have never seen an eldren try to handle the sword kanajana but you must assume that it is true otherwise otherwise there is little hope for humanity the words were dragged from his lips very well lord katorn you will assume that i am erekosл summoned by king rigenos to lead humanity to victory i have no choice but to assume that good and there is something that i too must assume for my part lord katorn you what i must assume that you will work with me in this enterprise that there will be no plots behind my back that there will be no information withheld from me that might prove vital that you will not seek to make allies against me within our own ranks you see lord katorn it could be your suspicions that might wreck our plans a man jealous and resentful of his leader is capable of doing more harm than any enemy he nodded his head and straightened his shoulders the hand falling away from his sword i had considered that question my lord i am not a fool i know you are not a fool lord katorn if you were a fool i should not have bothered to have had this conversation his tongue bulged in his cheek as he mulled this statement over eventually he said and you are not a fool lord erekosл thank you i did not suspect that you judged me that hmph he removed his helmet and ran his fingers through his thick hair he was still thinking i waited for him to say something further but then he replaced his helmet firmly on his head dug his thumb into the side of his mouth and picked at a tooth with the nail he withdrew the thumb and stared at it intently for a moment then he looked at the map and murmured well at least we have an understanding with that it will be easier to fight this stinking war i nodded much easier i think he sniffed how good is our own fleet i asked him its a good fleet still not as large as it was but we are remedying that too our shipyards work night and day to build more and larger menowar and in our ironworks up and down the land we forge powerful guns with which to arm those ships and what of men to crew them we are recruiting all we can even women are used in certain tasksand boys you were told that lord erekosл and it was truethe whole of humanity fights the eldren warriors i said nothing but i have begun to admire the spirit of this people i was less divided in my mind concerning the rights or wrongs of what i did the folk of this strange time and place in which i found myself were fighting for nothing more nor less than the survival of their species but then another thought came to me could not the same be said of the eldren i dismissed the thought at least katorn and i had that in common we refused to concern ourselves with speculation on moral and sentimental issues we had a task to perform we had assumed the responsibility for that task we should do it to the best of our ability chapter six preparing for war and so i talked with generals and with admirals we pored over maps and discussed tactics logistics available men animals and ships while the fleets massed and the two continents were scoured for warriors from boys of ten years old to men of fifty or older from girls of twelve to women of sixty all were marshalled beneath the double banner of humanity which bore the arms of zavara and necralala and the standards of their king rigenos and their war champion erekosл as the days passed we planned the great landsea invasion of mernadins chief harbour paphanaal and the surrounding province which was also called paphanaal when not conferring with the commanders of the armies and navies i practised weaponry riding until i became skilled in those arts it was not a question of learning so much as remembering just as the feel of my strange sword had been familiar so was the sensation of a horse between my legs just as i had always known my name was erekosл so i had always known how to pull an arrow on a bowstring and let fly at a target as i galloped past on horseback but lolindashe was not familiar in this way though there was some part of me that seemed able to travel through time and space and assume many incarnations they were plainly not the same incarnations i was not living an episode of my life over again i had merely become the same person again going through a different series of actions or so it seemed i had a sense of free will within those terms i did not feel that my fate was preordained but perhaps it was perhaps i am too much of an optimist perhaps i am after all a fool and katorn was wrong in his assessment of me the eternal fool certainly i was willing to make a fool of myself where lolinda was concerned her beauty was almost unbearable but with her i could not be a fool she wanted a heroan immortaland nothing less so i must play the hero for her to comfort her though it went ill with my preferred manner which has always been pretty casual sometimes in fact i felt more like her father than her wouldbe lover and with my pat twentiethcentury notions of human motivation wondered if i were really nothing more than a substitute for the strong father she expected in rigenos i think that she secretly despised rigenos for not being more heroic but i sympathised with the older man for rigenos bore a great responsibility and bore it pretty well as far as i could make out after all he was a man who would rather plan pleasant gardens than plan battles it was not his fault that he had been born a king without a close male successor to whom he could have if he had been luckier transferred responsibility and i had heard that he bore himself well in battle and never backed away from any responsibility king rigenos was meant for a gentler life maybethough he could be fierce enough when it came to hating the eldren i was to be the hero that he felt incapable of being i accepted that but i was much more reluctant to be the father than he could not be i wanted a much healthier relationship with lolinda or so i told myself i did not want one at all i am not sure i had a choice i was mesmerised by her i would probably have accepted her on any terms we spent whatever time we could together whenever i could get away from the military men and my own martial training we would wander arm in arm along the closed balconies that covered the palace of ten thousand windows like a creeping plant winding from top to bottom of the great palace and containing a great variety of flowers shrubs and caged and uncaged birds that fluttered through the foliage of these spiralling passages and perched among the branches of the vines and the small trees and sang to us as we wandered i learned that this too had been king rigenoss idea to make the balconies more pleasant but that had been before the coming of the eldren slowly the day approached when the fleet would gather together and sail for the distant continent where the eldren ruled i had begun by being impatient to get to grips with the eldren but now i was becoming more and more reluctant to leavefor it would mean leaving lolinda and my lust for her was growing quite as strongly as my love although i gathered that day by day the society of humankind was becoming less and less open more and more bound by unpleasant and unnecessary restrictions it was still not considered wrong for unwed lovers to sleep together so long as they were of an equal social standing i was much relieved when i discovered this it seemed to me that an immortalas i was assumed to beand a princess were quite decently matched but it was not the social conventions that hampered my ambitionit was lolinda herself and that is one thing that no amount of freedom or license or permissiveness or whatever the old fogies call it can cope with that is the odd assumption the twentieth century makesthat if the laws that man makes concerning moralityparticularly sexual moralityare done away with then one huge orgy will begin it forgets that people are generally speaking only attracted to a few other people and only fall in love with one or two in their whole lives and there may be many other reasons why they may not be able to make love even if their love is confirmed where lolinda was concerned i hesitated because as i have said i did not wish to be merely a substitute for her fatherand she hesitated because she needed to be absolutely sure she could trust me john daker would have called this a neurotic attitude perhaps it was but on the other hand was it neurotic for a relatively normal girl to feel a bit peculiar about someone she had only lately seen materialise from thin air but enough of this all i should say is that although we were both deeply in love at this point we did not sleep togetherwe did not even discuss the matter though it was often on the tip of my tongue what in fact began to happen was oddly that my lust began to wane my love for lolinda remained as strongif not strongerthan ever but i did not feel any great need to express it in physical terms it was not like me or perhaps i should say that it was not like john daker however as the day of departure came closer i began to feel a need to express my love in some way and one evening as we wandered through the balconies i paused and put my hand under her hair and stroked the back of her neck and gently turned her to face me she looked sweetly up at me and smiled her red lips parted slightly and she did not move her head as i bent my own lips to hers and kissed her softly my heart leapt i held her close against me feeling her breasts rise and fall against my chest i lifted her hand and held it against my face as i looked down at her beauty i thrust my hand deep into her hair and tasted her warm sweet breath as we kissed again she curled her fingers in mine and opened her eyes and her eyes were happytruly happy for the first time we drew apart her breathing was now much less regular and she began to murmur something but i cut her off short she smiled at me expectantly with a mixture of pride and tenderness when i return i said softly we shall be married she looked surprised for a moment and then she realised what i had saidthe significance of what i had said i was trying to tell her that she could trust me it was the only way i could think of to do it perhaps a john daker reflex i dont know she nodded her head drawing off her hand a wonderfully worked ring of gold pearls and rosecoloured diamonds this she placed on my little finger a token of my love she said an acceptance of your proposal a charm perhaps to bring you luck in your battles something to remind you of me when you are tempted by those unhuman eldren beauties she smiled when she made this last retort it has many functions i said this ring as many as you wish she replied thank you i love you erekosл she said simply i love you lolinda i paused then added but i am a crude sort of lover am i not i have no token to give you i feel embarrassed and a bit inadequate your word is enough she said swear that you will return to me i looked at her nonplussed for a second naturally i would return to her swear it she said ill swear it there is no question swear it again ill swear it a thousand times if once is not enough i swear it i swear that i will return to you lolinda my love my delight good she seemed satisfied there came the sound of hurried footsteps along the balcony and we saw a slave i recognised as one of my own rushing towards us ah master there you are king rigenos has asked me to bring you to him it was late and what does king rigenos want i asked he did not say master i smiled down at lolinda and tucked her arm in mine very well we shall come chapter seven the armour of erekosл the slave led us to my apartments they were empty of anyone save my retinue but where is king rigenos i asked he said to wait here master i smiled at lolinda again she smiled back very well i said we shall wait we did not wait long presently slaves began to arrive at my apartments they were carrying bulky pieces of metal wrapped in oiled parchment and they began to pile it in the weapons room i watched them with as little expression as possible though i was greatly puzzled then at last king rigenos entered he seemed much more excited than usual and katorn was not this time with him greetings father said lolinda i but king rigenos raised a hand and turned to address the slaves strip off the coverings he said hurry king rigenos i said i would like to tell you that forgive me lord erekosл first look at what i have brought it has lain for centuries in the vaults of the palace waiting erekosлwaiting for you waiting then the oiled parchment was torn away and lay in curling heaps on the flagstones revealing what was to me a magnificent this said the king is the armour of erekosл broken from its tomb of rock deep beneath the palaces lowest dungeons so that erekosл can wear it again the armour was black and it shone it was as if it had been forged that day and forged by the greatest smith in history for it was of exquisite workmanship i picked up the breastplate and ran my hand over it unlike the armour worn by the imperial guard this was smooth without any kind of raised embellishment the shoulder pieces were grooved fanning high and away from the head to channel a blow of sword axe or lance away from the wearer the helmet breastplates greaves and the rest were all grooved in the same manner the metal was light but very strong like that of the sword but the black lacquer shone it shone brightlyalmost blindingly in its simplicity the armour was beautifulas beautiful as only really fine craftsmanship can be its only ornament was a thick plume of scarlet horsehair which sprang from the crest of the helmet and cascaded down the smooth sides i touched the armour with the reverence one has for fine art in this case it was fine art designed to protect my life and my reverence was if anything that much greater thank you king rigenos i saidand i was honestly grateful i will wear it on the day we set sail against the eldren that day is tomorrow said king rigenos quietly what the last of our ships has come in the last member of the crew is on board the last cannon has been fitted it will be a good tide tomorrow and we cannot miss it i glanced at him had i been misled in some way had katorn prevailed upon the king not to let me know the exact time of sailing but the kings expression showed no sign of a plot i dismissed the idea and accepted what he said i turned my gaze to lolinda she looked stricken tomorrow she said tomorrow confirmed king rigenos i bit my lower lip than i must prepare she said father he looked at her yes lolinda i began to speak and then paused she glanced at me and was also silent there was no easy way of telling him and suddenly it was as if we should keep our love our pact a secret neither of us knew why tactfully the king withdrew i will discuss last minute matters with you later lord erekosл i bowed he left somewhat stunned lolinda and i stared at each other and then we moved into each others arms and we wept john daker would not have written this he would have laughed at the sentiments just as he would have scoffed at anyone who considered the arts of war important john daker would not have written this but i must i began to feel a rising sense of excitement for the coming war the old exultant mood started to sweep through me again overlaying my excitement was my love for lolinda this love seemed to be a calmer purer love so much more satisfying than casual carnal love it was a thing apart perhaps this was the chivalrous love which the peers of christendom were said to hold above all other john daker would have spoken of sexual repression and of swords as substitutes for sexual intercourse and so forth perhaps john daker would have been right but it did not seem to me that he was right though i was well aware of all the rationalist arguments that supported such a view there is a great tendency for the human race to see all other times in its own terms the terms of this society were subtly differenti was only dimly aware of many of the differences i was responding to lolinda in those terms it is all i can say and later events i suppose were also played out in those terms i took lolindas face in my two hands and i bent and i kissed her forehead and she kissed my lips and then she left shall i see you before i leave i asked as she reached the door yes she said yes my love if it is possible when she had gone i did not feel sad i inspected the armour once again and then i went down to the main hall where king rigenos stood with many of his greatest captains studying a large map of mernadin and the waters between it and necralala we start here in the morning rigenos told me indicating the harbour area of necranal the river droonaa flowed through necranal to the sea and the port of noonos where the fleet was assembled there must be a certain amount of ceremony i fear erekosл various rituals to perform i have already sketched them to you i believe you have i said the ceremony seems more arduous than the warfare the captains laughed though somewhat distant and a trifle wary of me they liked me well enough for i had proved to have a natural grasp of tactics and the warlike arts but the ceremony is necessary rigenos said for the people it makes a reality for them you see they can experience something of what we shall be doing we i said am i wrong i thought you implied that you were sailing too i am rigenos said quietly i decided that it was necessary necessary yes he would say no moreparticularly in front of his marshals now let us continue we must all of us rise very early tomorrow morning as we discussed these final matters of order and tactics and logistics i studied the kings face as best i could no one expected him to sail with his armies he would lose no face at all by remaining behind in his capital yet he had made a decision which would put him in a position of extreme danger and make him take actions for which he had no palate why had he made the decision to prove to himself that he could fight perhaps yet he had proved it already because he was jealous of me because he did not altogether trust me i glanced at katorn but saw nothing in katorns face to indicate satisfaction katorn was merely his usual surly self mentally i shrugged speculation at thispoint would get me nowhere the fact was that the king not an altogether robust man now was coming with us it might give extra inspiration to our warriors at least it might also help control katorns particular tendencies eventually we dispersed and went our ways i went straight to my bed and before i slept lay there peacefully thinking of lolinda thinking of the battleplans i had hatched wondering what the eldren would be like to fighti still had no completely clear idea of how they fought or even what they looked like i knew i would soon have some of the answers at any rate soon i was asleep my dreams were strange dreams on that night before we sailed for mernadin i saw towers and marshes and lakes and armies and lances that shot flames and metallic flying machines whose wings flapped like those of gigantic birds i saw monstrously large flamingos strange masklike helmets resembling the faces of beasts i saw dragonshuge reptiles with fiery venom flapping across dark moody skies i saw a beautiful city tumbling in flames i saw unhuman creatures that i knew to be gods i saw a woman about whom i could not name a small redheaded man who seemed to be my friend a sworda great black sword more powerful than the one i know owneda sword that perhaps oddly was myself i saw a world of ice across which strange great ships with billowing sails ran and black beasts like whales propelled themselves over endless plateaux of white i saw a worldor was it a universethat had no horizon and was filled with a rich jewelled mosaic atmosphere which changed all the time and from which people and objects emerged only to disappear again it was somewhere beyond the earth i was sure yesi was aboard a spaceshipbut a ship that travelled through no universe conceived of by man i saw a desert through which i stumbled weeping and i was alonelonelier than any man had ever been i saw a junglea jungle of primitive trees and gigantic ferns and through the ferns i saw huge bizarre buildings and there was a weapon in my hand that was not a sword and was not a gun but it was more powerful than either i rode strange beasts and encountered stranger people i moved through landscapes that were beautiful and terrifying i piloted flying machines and spaceships and i drove chariots i hated i fell in love i built empires and caused the collapse of nations and i slew many and was slain many times i triumphed and i was humiliated and i had many names the names roared in my skull too many names too many and there was no peace there was only strife chapter eight the sailing next morning i awoke and my dreams went away and i was left in an introspective mood and there was only one thing that i desired that thing was an upmanns coronas major cigar i kept trying to push the name from my mind to my knowledge john daker had never smoked an upmanns he would not have known one cigar from another where had the name come from another name came into my headjeremiah and that too was vaguely familiar i sat up in bed and i recognised my surroundings and the two names merged with the other names i had dreamed of and i got up and entered the next chamber where slaves were finishing preparing my bath with relief i got into the bath and as i washed my body i began to concentrate once again on the problem at hand yet a sense of depression remained with me and again for a moment i wondered if i were mad and involved in some complicated schizophrenic fantasy when the slaves brought in my armour i began to feel much better again i marvelled at its beauty and its craftsmanship and now the time had come to put it on first i donned my underclothes then a sort of quilted overalls and then i began to strap the armour about me again it was easy to find the appropriate straps and buckles it was as if i had clad myself in this armour every morning of my life it fitted perfectly it was comfortable and no weight at all though it completely covered by body next i strode to the weapons room and took down the great sword that hung there and i drew the belt of metal links around my waist and settled the poisonous sword in its protecting scabbard against my left hip tossed the scarlet plume on my helmet lifted the visor and was ready slaves escorted me down to the great hall where the peers of humanity had assembled to make their final leavetaking with necranal the tapestries which had earlier hung on the walls of beaten silver had now been removed and in their place were hundreds of bright banners these were the banners of the marshals the captains and the knights who were gathered there in splendid array assembled according to rank on a specially erected dais the throne of the king had been placed the dais was hung with a cloth of emerald green and behind it were the twin banners of the two continents i took my place before the dais and we waited tensely for the arrival of the king i had already been coached concerning the responses i was to make in the forthcoming ceremony at last there came a great yelling of trumpets and beating of martial drums from the gallery above us and through a door came the king king rigenos had gathered stature it seemed for he wore a suit of gilded armour over which was hung a surcoat of white and red set into his helmet was his crown of iron and diamonds he walked proudly to the dais and ascended it seating himself in his throne with both arms stretched along the arms of the seat we raised our hands in salute hail king rigenos we roared and then we kneeled i kneeled first behind me kneeled the little group of marshals behind them were a hundred captains behind them were five thousand knights all kneeling and surrounding us along the walls were the old nobles the ladies of the court menatarms at attention slaves and squires the mayors of the various quarters of the city and from the various provinces of the two continents and all watched rigenos and his champion erekosл king rigenos rose from his throne and took a step forward i looked up at him and his face was grave and stern i had never seen him look so much a king before now i felt that the attention of the watchers was on myself alone i erekosл champion of humanity was to be their saviour they knew it in my confidence and pride i knew it also king rigenos raised his hands and spread them out and began to speak erekosл the champion marshals captains and knights of humanitywe go to wage war against inhuman evil we go to fight something that is more than an enemy bent on conquest we go to fight a menace that would destroy our entire race we go to save our two fair continents from total annihilation the victor will rule the entire earth the defeated will become dust and will be forgottenit will be as if he had never existed this expedition upon which we are about to embark will be decisive with erekosл to lead us we shall win the port of paphanaal and its surrounding province but that will only be the first stage in our campaigns king rigenos paused and then spoke again into the almost absolute silence that had fallen in the great hall more battles must follow fast upon the first so that the hated hounds of evil will once and for all be destroyed men and womeneven childrenmust perish we drove them to their holes in the mountains of sorrow once but this time we must not let their race survive let only their memory remain for a little whileto remind us what evil is still kneeling i raised both my hands above my head and clenched my fists erekosл said king rigenos you who by the power of your eternal will made yourself into flesh again and came to us at this time of need you will be the power with which we shall destroy the eldren you will be humanitys scythe to sweep this way and that and cut the eldren down as weeds you will be humanitys spade to dig up the roots wherever they have grown you will be humanitys fire to burn the waste to the finest ash you erekosл will be the wind that will blow those ashes away as if they had never existed you will destroy the eldren i will destroy the eldren i cried and my voice echoed through the great hall like the voice of a god i will destroy the enemies of humanity with the sword kanajana i will ride upon them with vengeance and hatred and cruelly in my heart and i will vanquish the eldren from behind me now came a mighty shout we shall vanquish the eldren now the king raised his head and his eyes glittered and his mouth was hard swear it he said we were intoxicated by the atmosphere of hate and rage in the great hall we so swear we roared we will destroy the eldren hatred now boiled from the kings eyes seared in his voice go now paladins of mankind godestroy the eldren offal clean our planet of the eldren filth as one man we rose to our feet and yelled our battlecries turned in precision and marched from the great hall out of the palace of ten thousand windows and into a day noisy with the swelling cheers of the people but as we marched one thought preyed on my mind where was lolinda why had she not come to me there had been so little time before the ceremony and yet i would have thought she would have sent a message at least down the winding streets of necranal we marched in glorious procession through die cheering day with the bright sun shining on our weapons and our armour and our flags of a thousand rich colours waving in the wind and i led them i erekosл the eternal the champion the vengeance bringeri led them my arms were raised as if i was already celebrating my victory pride filled me i knew what glory was and i relished it this was the way to liveas a warriora leader of great armiesa wielder of weapons on we marched down towards the waiting ships which were ready on the river and a song came to my lipsa song that was in an archaic version of the language i now spoke i sang the song and it was taken up by all the warriors that marched behind me drums began to beat and trumpets to shout and we cried aloud for blood and death and the great red reaping that would come to mernadin that is how we marched that is how we felt do not judge me until i have told you more we reached the wide part of the river where the harbour was and there were the ships there were fifty ships stretched along both quays on either side of the river fifty ships bearing the fifty standards of fifty proud paladins and these were only fifty the fleet itself waited for us to join it at the port of noonos noonos of the jewelled towers the people of necranal lined the banks of the river they were cheering cheeringso that we became used to their voices as men became used to the sounds of the sea scarcely hearing them i regarded the ships richly decorated cabins were built on the decks and the ships of the paladins had several masts bearing furled sails of painted canvas already oars were being slipped through the ports and dipped into the placid river waters strong men three to a sweep sat upon the rowing benches these men were not as far as i could see slaves but free warriors at the head of this squadron of ships lay the kings huge battle bargea magnificent manowar it had eighty pair of oars and eight tall masts its rails were painted in red gold and black its decks were polished crimson its sails were yellow dark blue and orange and its huge craved figurehead representing a goddess holding a sword in her two outstretched hands was predominantly scarlet and silver ornate and splendid the deck cabins shone with fresh varnish which had been laid over pictures of ancient human heroes and ancient human victories of mythical beasts and demons and gods detaching myself from the main force that had drawn itself up on the quayside i walked to the tapestrycovered gangway and strode up it and boarded the ship sailors rushed forward to greet me one said the princess lolinda awaits you in die grand cabin excellency i turned and then paused looking at die splendid structure of the cabin smiling slightly at the representations of myself painted upon it then i moved towards it and entered a comparatively low door into a room which was covered floor walls and ceiling with thick tapestries in deep reds and blacks and golds lanterns hung in the room and in the shadows clad in a simple dress and a thin dark cloak stood my lolinda i did not wish to interrupt the preparations this morning she said my father said that they were importantthat there was little time to spare so i thought you would not want to see me i smiled you still do not believe what i say do you lolinda you still do not trust me when i proclaim my love for you when i tell you that i would do anything for you i went towards her and held her in my arms i love you lolinda i shall always love you and i shall always love you erekosл you will live forever but there is no proof of that i said gently and i am by no means invulnerable lolinda i sustained enough cuts and bruises in my weapons practice to realise that you will not die erekosл i would be happier if i shared your conviction do not laugh at me erekosл i will not be patronised i am not laughing at you lolinda i am not patronising you i only speak the truth you must face that truth you must very well she said i will face it but i feel that you will not die yet i have such strange premonitionsi feel that something worse than death could befall us your fears are natural but they are baseless there is no need for gloom my dear look at the fine armour i wear the powerful sword i bear the mighty force i command kiss me erekosл i kissed her i kissed her for a long time and then she broke from my arms and ran to the door and was gone i stared at the door half thinking of running after her of reassuring her but i knew that i could not reassure her her fears were not really rationalthey reflected her constant sense of insecurity i promised myself that later i would give her proof of security i would bring constants into her lifethings she could trust trumpets sounded king rigenos was coming aboard a few moments later the king entered the cabin tugging off his crowned helm katorn was behind him as sullen as ever the people seem enthusiastic i said the ceremony seemed to have the effect you desired king rigenos rigenos nodded wearily aye the ritual had plainly taken much from him and he slumped into a hanging chair in the corner and called for wine well be sailing soon when katorn within the quarter hour my lord king katorn took the jug of wine from the slave who brought it and poured rigenos a cup without offering one to me king rigenos waved his hand would you have some wine lord erekosл i declined you spoke well in the hall king rigenos i said you fired us with a fine bloodlust katorn sniffed let us hope it lasts until we get to the enemy he said we have some raw soldiers sailing on this expedition half our warriors have never fought beforeand half of those are boys there are even some women in some detachments ive heard you seem pessimistic lord katorn i said he grunted it is as well to be all this finery and grandeur is all right for cheering up the civilians but its best you dont believe it yourself you should know erekosл you should know what real war is all about pain fear death theres nothing else to it you forget i said my memory of my own past is clouded katornsniffed and gobbled down his wine he replaced the cup with a clatter and left ill see to the casting off the king cleared his throat you and katorn he began but broke off you we are not friends i said i dislike his surly mistrustful mannerand he suspects me of being a fraud a traitor a spy of some sort king rigenos nodded he has hinted as much to me he sipped his wine i told him that i saw you materialise with my own eyes that there is no question you are erekosл that there is no reason not to trust youbut he persists why do you think he is a sane sensible soldier he is jealous i said i have taken over his power but he was as agreed as any of us that we needed a new leader who would inspire our people in the fight against the eldren in principle perhaps i said i shrugged it does not matter king rigenos i think we have worked out a compromise king rigenos was lost in his own thoughts there again he murmured it could have nothing to do with war at all what do you mean he gave me a candid look it might concern matters of love erekosл katorn has always been pleased by lolindas manner you could be right but again there is nothing i can do lolinda seems to prefer my company katorn might see it as mere infatuation with an ideal rather than a real person do you see it as that i do not know i have not talked to lolinda about it well i said perhaps we shall see when we return if we return said king rigenos in there i must admit im in agreement with katorn overconfidence has often been the main cause of many defeats i nodded perhaps you are right there came shouts and cries from outside and the ship lurched suddenly as the ropes were cast off and the anchors hauled in come said king rigenos let us go out on deck it will be expected of us hastily he finished his wine and placed his crowned helmet upon his head we left the cabin together and as we came out the cheering on the quayside swelled louder and louder we stood there waving to the people as the drums began to pound out the slow rowing rhythm i saw lolinda seated in her carriage her body half turned to watch as we left i waved to her and she raised her own arm in a final salute goodbye lolinda i murmured katorn darted me a cynical look from the corner of his eye as he passed to supervise the rowing goodbye lolinda the wind had dropped i was sweating in my wargear for the day was oppressed by a great flaming sun blazing in a cloudless sky i continued to wave from the stern of the swaying vessel keeping my gaze on lolinda as she sat there erect in her carriage and then we had rounded a bend in the river and saw only the rearing towers of necranal above and behind us heard only the distant cheering we beat down the droonaa river moving fast with the current towards noonos of the jewelled towersand the fleets chapter nine at noonos oh these blind and bloody wars really bishop you fail to understand that human affairs are resolved in terms of action brittle arguments pointless causes cynicism disguised as pragmatism would you not rest my son i cannot rest father while the paynim horde is already on the banks of the danube peace will they be content with peace perhaps they wont be satisfied with vietnam they wont be content until the whole of asia is theirs and after that the world we are not beasts we must act as beasts they act as beasts but if we tried we have tried have we fire must be fought with fire is there no other way there is no other way the children there is no other way a gun a sword a bomb a bow a vibrapistol a flamelance an axe a club there is no other way on board the flagship that night as the oars rose and fell and the drum continued its steady beat and the timbers creaked and the waves lapped at the hull i slept poorly fragments of conversations phrases images they tumbled in my tired brain and refused to leave me in peace a thousand different periods of history a million different faces but the situation was always the same the argumentmade in myriad tonguesdid not change only when i rose from my bunk did my head clear and at length i resolved to go on deck what sort of creature was i why did it seem that i was forever doomed to drift from era to era and act out the same role wherever i went what trickwhat cosmic joke had been played upon me the night air was cool on my face and the moonlight struck through the light clouds at regular intervals so that the beams looked like the spokes of some gigantic wheel it was as if the chariot of a god had sunk through the low cloud and become embedded in the coarser air beneath i stared at the water and saw the clouds reflected in it saw them break to reveal the moon it was the same moon i had known as john daker the same bland face could be made out staring down in contentment at the antics of the creatures of the planet it circled how many disasters had that moon witnessed how many foolish crusades how many wars and battles and murders the clouds moved together again and the waters of the river grew black as if to say that i would never find the revelation i sought i looked to the banks we were passing through a thick forest the tops of the trees were silhouetted against the slightly lighter darkness of the night a few night animals voiced their cries from time to time and it seemed to me that they were lonely cries lost cries pitiful cries i sighed and leaned against the rail and watched the water creamed grey by the slashing oars i had better accept that i must fight again again where had i fought before what did my vague memories mean what significance had my dreams the simple answerthe pragmatic answer was that i was mad my imagination was overwrought perhaps i had never been john daker perhaps he too was another crazed invention i must fight again that was all there was to it i had accepted the role and i must play it to the finish my brain began to clear as the moon set and dawn lightly touched the horizon i watched the sun rise a huge scarlet disc moving with steady grandeur into the sky as if curious to discover the sounds that disturbed the worldthe beat of the drum the crack of the oars you are not sleeping lord erekosл you are eager i see to do battle i felt i did not need katorns banter added to the burden i thought i would enjoy watching the sun rise i said and the moon set katorns voice implied something that i could not quite grasp you seem to like the night lord erekosл sometimes i said it is peaceful i added as significantly as i could there is little to disturb a mans thoughts in the night true you have something in common with our enemies then i turned impatiently regarding those dark features with anger what do you mean i meant only that the eldren too are said to prefer the night to the day if it is true of me my lord i said then it will be a great asset to us in our war with them if i can fight them by night as well as by day i hope so my lord why do you mistrust me so lord katorn he shrugged did i say that i did we struck a bargain remember and i have kept my part of it and i mine i will follow you do not doubt that whatever i suspect i will follow you then i would ask you to discontinue these little jibes of yours they are naive they serve no purpose they serve a purpose for me lord erekosл they ease my temperthey channel it into a suitable area i have sworn my oath to humanity i told him i will serve king rigenoss cause i have my own burdens to bear lord katorn i am deeply sympathetic i turned away i had come close to making a fool of myselfappealing to katorn for mercy almost by claiming my own problems as an excuse thank you lord katorn i said coldly the ship began to turn a bend in the river and i thought i could see the sea ahead i am grateful for your understanding i slapped at my face the ship was passing through a cloud of midges hovering over the river these insects are irritating are they not perhaps it would be best if you did not allow yourself to be subjected to their intentions my lord katorn replied indeed i think you are right lord katorn i will go below good morrow my lord good morrow lord katorn i left him standing on the deck and staring moodily ahead in other circumstances i thought i would slay that man as it was there seemed a growing chance that he would do his utmost to slay me i wondered if rigenos were correct and katorn was doubly jealous of me jealous of my reputation as a warrior jealous of lolindas love for me i washed and dressed myself in my wargear and refused to bother myself with all these pointless thoughts a little later i heard the helmsman shout and went on deck to see what his call signified noonos was in sight we all crowded the rails to get a glimpse of this fabulous city we were halfblinded by the glare from the towers for they were truly jewelled the city flared with lighta great white aura speckled with a hundred other coloursgreen and violet and pink and mauve and ochre and redall dancing in the brighter glow created by a million gems and beyond noonos lay the seaa calm sea gleaming in the sunshine as noonos came closer the river widened until it was clear that this was where it opened into the ocean the banks became more and more distant and we kept closer to the starboard bank for that was the bank on which noonos was built there were other towns and villages dotted among the wooded hills overlooking the river mouth some of them were picturesque but they were all dominated by the port we were approaching now seabirds began to squeal around our topmast and with a great flapping of wings settle in the yards and began squabbling it appeared for the best spot in the rigging the rhythm of the oars became slower and we began to back water as we approached the harbour itself behind us the squadron of proud ships dropped anchor they would join us later when the pilot had come out to give them their mooring order leaving our sister ships behind we rowed slowly into noonos flying the standard of king rigenos and the standard of erekosлa black field supporting a silver sword and the cheering began again held back by soldiers in armour of quilted leather the crowds craned their necks to see us as we disembarked and then as i walked down the gangplank and appeared on the quayside a huge chanting began that startled me at first when i realised what the word was that they were chanting erekosл erekosл erekosл erekosл i raised my right arm in salute and almost staggered as the noise increased until it was literally deafening i could barely refrain from covering my ears prince bladagh overlord of noonos greeted us with due ceremony and read out a speech that could not be heard for the shouting and then we were escorted through the streets towards the quarters we were to use while making our brief stay in the city the jewelled towers were not disappointing though i noticed that the houses built closer to the ground made a great contrast many of them were little better than hovels it was quite plain where the money came from to encrust the towers with rubies pearls and emeralds i had not noticed this great disparity between the rich and the poor in necranal either i had been too impressed by the newness of the sights or the royal city took pains to disguise any areas of poverty if they indeed existed and there were ragged people here to go with the hovels though they cheered as loudly as the restif not louder perhaps they blamed the eldren for their misery prince bladagh was a sallowfeatured man of about fortyfive he had a long drooping moustache and rather blank eyes and he moved rather like a fussy vulture it emerged and i was not surprised that he would not be joining us in our expedition but would remain behind to protect the cityor his own gold most likely i thought ah now my liege he muttered as we reached his palace and the jewelled gates swung back to admit us ah nowmy palace is yours king rigenos and yours too lord erekosл of course anything you need a hot mealand a simple one king rigenos said echoing my own sentiments no banquetsi warned you not to make a large ceremony of this bladagh and i have not my liege bladagh looked relieved he did not seem to me to be a man who enjoyed spending money i have not the meal was simple though not particularly wellprepared we ate it with prince bladagh his plump stupid wife princess lonante and their two scrawny children privately i was amused at the contrast between the city seen from a distance and the appearance and way of life of its ruler a short while later the various commanders who had been assembling in noonos for the past several weeks arrived to confer with rigenos and myself katorn was among them and was able to outline very succinctly and graphically the battleplans we had worked out between us in neciranal among the commanders were several famous heroes of the two continentscount roldero a burly aristocrat whose armour was as workmanlike and free from decoration as my ownalso there was prince malihar and his brother duke ezak both of whom had been through many campaigns earl shanura of karakoa one of the furthest provinces and one of the most barbaric shanura wore his hair long in three plaits that hung down his back his pale features were gaunt and crisscrossed with scars and he spoke seldom and usually to ask specific questions the variety of the faces and the costumes surprised me at first at least i thought ironically humanity was united on this world which was more than could be said for the world john daker had left but perhaps they were only united for the moment to defeat the common enemy after that i thought their unity might well suffer a setback earl shanura for instance did not seem too happy about taking orders from king rigenos who he probably considered soft i hoped that i could keep so disparate a group of officers together in the battles that were to follow at last we were finished with our discussions and i had spoken a word or two with every commander there king rigenos glanced at the bronze clock that stood on the table and which was marked with sixteen divisions it will be time to put to sea soon he said are all ships ready mine have been ready for months earl shanura said gruffly i was beginning to feel they would rot before they saw the others agreed that their ships would be able to sail with little more than an hours notice rigenos and i thanked bladagh and his family for their hospitality and they seemed rather more cheerful now that we were leaving instead of marching from the palace we now hurried in coaches to the quayside and rapidly boarded our ships the kings flagship was called the lolinda a fact which i had not noticed before my thoughts being full of the woman who bore that name our other ships from necranal were now in port and their sailors were refreshing themselves in the short time they had while slaves took on board the last provisions and armaments that were needed there was still a mood of slight depression hanging over me from my strange halfdreams of the previous night but it was beginning to disperse as my excitement grew it was still a months sailing to mernadin but already i was beginning to relish the chance of action at least action would help me forget the other problems i was reminded of something that pierre told andrei in war and peacesomething about all men finding their own ways of forgetting the fact of death some womanised some gambled some drank and some paradoxically made war well it was not the fact of death that obsessed meindeed it seemed that it was the fact of eternal existence that was preying on my mind an eternal life involving eternal warfare would i at some stage discover the truth i was not sure that i wanted to know the truth the thought frightened me perhaps a god could have accepted it but i was not a god i was a man i knew i was a man my problems my ambitions my emotions were on a human scalesave for the one abiding problemthe question of how i came to exist in this formof how i had become what i was or was i truly eternal was there no beginning and no end to my existence the very nature of time was held in question i could no longer regard time in linear terms as i had once done as john daker time could not be conceived of any more in spatial terms i needed a philosophera magiciana scientist to help me on that problem or else i could forget it but could i forget it i would have to try the seabirds squawked and circled as the sails smacked down and swelled in the sultry wind that had started to blow the timbers creaked as the anchors were weighed and the mooring ropes cast off from the capstans and the great flagship lolinda heaved herself from the port her oars still rising and falling but making faster speed now as she sailed towards the open sea chapter ten first sign of the eldren the fleet was huge and contained great fighting ships of many kinds some resembling what john daker would have called nineteenthcentury teaclippers some that looked like junks some with the lateen rig of mediterranean craft some that were very like elizabethan caravels sailing in their separate formations according to their province or origin they symbolised the differences and the unity of mankind i was proud of them excited tense alert and confident of victory we sailed for paphanaal gateway to mernadin and conquest yet i still felt the need to know more of the eldren my cloudy memory of the life of an earlier erekosл could only confer an impression of confused battles against them and also perhaps somewhere a feeling of emotional pain that was all i had heard that they had no orbs to their eyes and that this was their chief distinguishing unhuman characteristic they were said to be inhumanly beautiful inhumanly merciless and with inhuman sexual appetites they were slightly taller than the average man had long heads with slanting cheekbones and slightly slanting eyes but this was not really enough for me there were no pictures of eldren anywhere on the two continents pictures were supposed to bring bad luck particularly if the evil eyes of the eldren were depicted as we sailed there was a great deal of shiptoship communication with commanders being rowed or hauled in slings to and from the flagship depending on how good the weather was we had worked out our basic strategy and had contingency plans in case it should not prove possible to exercise this strategy the idea had been mine and seemed a new one to the others but they soon grasped it and the details had now all been decided upon each day the warriors of every ship were drilled in what they were to do when the eldren fleet was sighted if it was sighted if it was not we should despatch part of the fleet straight to paphanaal and begin the attack on the city however we expected the eldren to send out their defence fleet to meet us before we reached paphanaal and it was on this probability that we based our main plan katorn and i avoided each other as much as possible there were in those first few days of sailing none of the verbal duels of the sort we had had in necranal and on the droonaa river i was polite to katorn when we had need to communicate and he in his surly way was polite to me king rigenos seemed to be relieved and told me that he was glad we had settled our differences we had not of course settled anything we had merely waived those differences until such time as we could decide them once and for all i knew eventually that i must fight katorn or that he would try to murder me i took a liking to count roldero of stalaco though he was perhaps the most bloodthirsty of all when it came to discussing the eldren john daker would have called him a reactionarybut he would have liked him he was a staunch stoical honest man who spoke his mind and allowed others to speak theirs expecting the same tolerance from them as he gave to them when i had once suggested to him that he saw things too plainly in black and white he had smiled wearily and replied erekosл my friend when you have seen what i have of the events that have taken place in my lifetime on this planet of ours then you would see things quite as clearly in black and white as i do you can only judge people by their actions not by their protestations people act for good or they act for ill and those who do great ill are bad and those who do great goodthey are good but people may do great good accidentally though with evil intentionsand conversely people may do great evil though having the best of intentions i said amused by his assumption that he had lived longer and seen more than i hadthough i think his assumption was meant in jest exactly count roldero replied you have only repeated my point i do not care as i said what people protest their intentions to be i judge them by the results they achieve take the eldren i raised my hand laughing i know how wicked they are everyone has told me of their cunning their treachery their black powers ah you seem to think i hate eldren individuals i do not for all i know they may be kind to their own children love their wives and treat their animals well i do not say that they are as individuals monsters it is as a force that they must be consideredit is what they do that must be judgedit is on the threat of their own ambitions that we must base our attitude towards them and how do you consider that force i asked it is not human therefore its interests are not human therefore in terms of its own selfinterest it needs to destroy us in this case because the eldren are not human they threaten us merely by existing and by the same token we threaten them they understand this and would wipe us out we understand this and would wipe them out before they have the chance to destroy us you understand the argument seemed convincing enough to the pragmatist that i considered myself to be but one thought came to mind and i voiced it are you not forgetting one thing count roldero you have said it yourselfthe eldren are not human you are assuming that they have human interests they are flesh and blood he said they are beasts as we are beasts they have those impulses just as we have them but many species of beast seem to live together in basic harmony i reminded him the lion does not constantly war with the leopardthe horse does not war with the coweven among themselves they rarely kill each other no matter how important the issue to them but they would said count roldero undaunted they would if they could anticipate events they would if they could work out the rate at which the rival animal is consuming food breeding expanding its territory i gave up i felt we were both on shaky ground now we were seated in my cabin looking out at a beautiful evening and a calm sea through the open porthole i poured count roldero more wine from my dwindling store count roldero quaffed the wine and stood up its getting late i must return to my ship or my men will think ive drowned and be celebrating i see youre running short of wine ill bring a skin or two on my next visit farewell friend erekosл your hearts in the right place im sure but youre a sentimentalist for all you say to the contrary i grinned good night roldero i raised my halffull wine cup lets drink to peace when this business is over roldero snorted aye peacelike the cows and the horses good night my friend he left laughing rather drunkenly i removed my clothes and fell into my bunk chuckling foolishly at rolderos parting remark like the cows and the horses hes right who wants to lead a life like that heres to war and i flung the wine cup through the open porthole and fell to snoring almost before my eyes had closed and i dreamed but this time i dreamed of the wine cup i had hurled through the porthole i imagined i saw it bobbing on the waves its gold and jewels glittering i imagined i saw it caught by a current and borne far away from the fleetout to a lonely place where ships never sailed and land was never in sighttossed for ever on a bleak sea for the whole month of our sailing the sea was calm the wind good and the weather on the whole fine our spirits rose higher we took this to be a sign of good luck all of us were cheerful all that is save katorn who grumbled that this could well be the calm before the storm that we must expect the worst of the eldren when we eventually engaged they are tricky he would say those filth are tricky even now they could know of our coming and have planned some manoeuvre we are not expecting they might even be responsible for the weather i could not help laughing openly at this and he stalked off up the deck in anger you will see lord erekosл he called back you will see and the next day the opportunity came according to our charts we were nearing the coasts of mernadin we posted more lookouts arranged the fleets of humanity in battle order checked our armament and cut our speed the morning passed slowly as we waited the flagship in the forefront rocking on the waves its sails reefed its oars raised and then around noon the lookout in our topmast yelled through his megaphone ships forard five sails king rigenos katorn and i stood on the foredeck staring ahead i looked at king rigenos and frowned five ships five ships only king rigenos shook his head perhaps they are not eldren ships theyll be eldren craft katorn grunted what else could they be in these waters no human merchants would trade with the creatures and then the cry of the lookout reached us again ten sails now twenty its the fleetthe eldren fleet they are sailing fast upon us and now i thought i glimpsed a flash of white on the horizon had it been the crest of a wave no it was the sail of a ship i was sure look i said there and i pointed rigenos screwed up his eyes and shielded them with his hand i see nothing it is your imagination they could not be coming in so fast katorn too peered ahead yes i see it too a sail they are that swift by the sea gods scalesslimy sorcery aids them it is the only explanation king rigenos seemed sceptical they are lighter craft than ours he reminded katorn and the wind is in their favour katorn in turn was not convinced maybe he growled perhaps you are right sire have they used sorcery before i asked him i was willing to believe anything i had to if i was to believe what had happened to me aye spat katorn many times all kinds ooph i can smell sorcery on the very air when i asked him what kind i wish to know so that i can take counter measures they can make themselves invisible sometimes thats how they took paphanaal so its said they can walk on watersail through the air you have seen them do this not myself but ive heard many tales tales i can believe from men who do not lie and these men have experienced this sorcery not themselves but they have known men who did so their use of sorcery remains a rumour i said ach say what you like katorn roared do not believe meyou who are the very essence of sorcerywho owes his existence to an incantation why do you think i supported the notion to bring you back erekosл because i felt we needed sorcery that would be stronger than theirs what else is that sword at your side than a sorcerous blade i shrugged let us wait then i said and see their sorcery king rigenos called up at the lookout how bigs the fleet you see about half our size my liege he shouted back his words distorted by the megaphone certainly no larger and i think it is their whole fleet i see no more coming they do not seem to be coming any closer at this moment i murmured to king rigenos ask him if theyre moving has the eldren fleet hove to master lookout called king rigenos aye my liege it no longer speeds hither and they seem to be furling their sails they are waiting for us katorn muttered they want us to attack them well we shall wait too i nodded that is the strategy we agreed and we waited we waited as the sun set and night fell and far away on the horizon we caught the occasional glimpse of silver that could have been a wave or a ship hasty messages were sent by swimmers back and forth among the vessels of the fleet and we continued to wait sleeping as best we could wondering when if at all the eldren would attack katorns footsteps could be heard pacing the deck as i lay awake in my cabin trying to do the sensible thing and preserve my energy for the next day of all of us katorn was the most impatient to engage the enemy i felt that if it had been up to him we should even now be sailing on the eldren having thrown our carefully worked out battleplans overboard but luckily it was up to me even king rigenos did not have the authority except under exceptional circumstances to countermand any of my orders i rested but i could not sleep i had my first glimpse of an eldren craft but i still did not know what the ships really looked likeor what my impression of their crews would be i lay there praying that our battle should soon begin a fleet of only half our size i smiled without humour i smiled because i knew we should be victorious when would the eldren attack it might even be tonight katorn had said that they loved the night i would not care if it was at night i wanted to fight a huge battlelust was building within me i wanted to fight chapter eleven the fleets engage a whole day passed and another night and still the eldren remained on the horizon were they deliberately hoping to tire us makes us nervous or were they afraid of the size of our fleet perhaps i thought their own strategy depended on us attacking them on the second night i did sleep but not the drink sodden slumber i had trained myself to there was no drink left count roldero had never had a chance to bring his wineskins on board and the dreams if anything were worse than ever i saw entire worlds at war destroying themselves in senseless battles i saw earth but this was an earth without a moon an earth which did not rotate which was half in sunlight half in a darkness relieved only by the stars and there was strife here too and a morbid quest that as good as destroyed me nameclarvis something of the sort i grasped at these names but they almost always eluded me and i suppose they were really the least important parts of the dreams i saw eartha different earth again an earth which was so old that even the seas had begun to dry up and i rode across a murky landscape beneath a tiny sun and i thought about time i tried to hang on to this dream this hallucination this memory whatever it was i thought there might be a clue here to what i was what had begun it all another namethe chronarch then it faded there seemed to be no extra significance to this dream than to the rest then this dream had faded and i stood in a city beside a large car and i was laughing and there was a strange sort of gun in my hand and bombs were raining from planes and destroying the city i tasted an upmann cigar i woke up but was almost at once dragged back into my dreams i walked insane and lonely through corridors of steel and beyond the walls of the corridors was empty space earth was far behind the steel machine in which i paced was heading for another star i was tormented i was obsessed with thoughts of my family john daker nojohn and then as if to confuse me further the names began i saw them i heard them they were spelled in many different forms of hieroglyphics chanted in many tongues aubec byzantium cornelius colvin bradbury london melnibone hawkmoon lanjis liho powys marca elric muldoon dietrich arflane simon kane allard corom traven ryan asquinol pepin seward mennell tallow hallner kцln the names went on and on and on i awoke screaming and it was morning sweating i got out of my bunk and splashed cold water all over my body why did it not begin why i knew that once the fighting started the dreams would go away i was sure of it and then the door of my cabin burst open and a slave entered master a trumpet voiced a brazen bellow there were the sounds of running men all over the ship master the enemy ships are moving with a great sigh of relief i dressed myself buckling on my armour as quickly as i could and strapping my sword about me then i ran up on deck and climbed to the forward deck where king rigenos stood clad in his own armour his face grim everywhere in the fleet the war signals were being flown and voices called from ship to ship trumpets snarled like metallic beasts and drums began to beat now i could see for certain that the eldren ships were on the move our commanders are all prepared rigenos murmured tensely see our ships are already taking their positions i looked with pleasure as the fleet began to form itself according to our much rehearsed battleplan now if only the eldren would behave as we had anticipated we should be the victors i looked forward again and gasped as the eldren ships drew closer marvelled at their rare grace as they leapt lightly over the water like dolphins but they were not dolphins i thought they were sharks they would rend us all if they could now i understood something of katorns suspicion of everything eldren if i had not known that these were our enemies that they intended to destroy us i would have stood there entranced at their beauty they were not galleons as most of our craft were they were ships of sail onlyand the sails were diaphanous on slim masts white hulls broke the darker white of the surf as they surged wildly without faltering towards us i studied their armament intently they mounted a few cannon but not so many as ours their cannon however were slender and silver and when i saw them i feared their power katorn joined us he was snarling with pleasure ah now he growled now now see their guns erekosл beware of them there is sorcery if you do not believe me sorcery what do you mean but he was off again shouting at the men in the rigging to hurry their work i began to make out tiny figures on the decks of the eldren ships i caught glimpses of eldritch faces but still could not at that distance discern any special characteristics they moved swiftly about their ships as they swam steadily towards us now our own fleets manoeuvres were almost complete and the flagship began to move into position i myself gave the orders to heave to and we rocked in the sea awaiting the eldren sharkships rushing towards us as planned we had manoeuvred to form a square that was strong on three sides but weak on the side facing the eldren fleet some hundred ships were at the far end of the square set stem to stern with cannon bristling the two other strong sides also had about a hundred ships a piece and were at a far enough distance from each other so that their cannon could not accidentally sink one of their own craft we had placed a thinner wall of shipsabout twentyfiveat the side of the square where the eldren were drawing in we hoped to give the impression of a tightly closed square formation with a few ships in the middle flying the royal colours to give the impression that this was the flagship and its escorts these ships were bait the true flagshipthe one on which i stoodhad temporarily taken down its colours and lay roughly in the middle of the starboard side of the square closer and closer now the eldren ships approached it was almost true what katorn had said they did seem to fly through the air rather than through the waves my hands began to sweat would they take the bait the plan had struck the commanders as original which meant that it was not the classical manoeuvre it had been in some periods of the earths history if it did not work i would lose katorns confidence still further and it would not make my position with the king whose daughter i hoped to marry any better but there was no point in worrying about that i watched and the eldren took the bait cannon roaring the eldren craft smashed in a delta formation into the thin wall and under their own impetus sailed on to find themselves thickly surrounded on three sides raise our colours i shouted to katorn raise the colours let them see the originator of their defeat katorn gave the orders my own banner went up firstthe black field with the silver swordand then the kings we moved to tighten the trap to crush the eldren as they realised they had been tricked i had never seen such highly manoeuvrable sailing craft as those slender ships used by the eldren slightly smaller than our menowar they darted about seeking an opening in the wall of ships but there was no opening i had seen to that now their cannon bellowed fiercely gouting balls of flame was this what katorn had meant by sorcery the eldren ammunition was firebombs rather than solid shot of the sort we used like comets the fireballs hurtled through the noonday air many of our ships were fired they blazed crackling and groaning as the flames consumed them like comets they were and the ships were like flashing sharks but they were sharks caught in a net that could not be broken inexorably we tightened the trap our own guns booming heavy iron that tore into those white hulls and left black gaping wounds that ripped through those slim masts and brought the yards splintering down the diaphanous sails flapping and faing like the wings of dying moths our own monstrous menowar their heavy timbers clothed in brass their huge oars churning the water their dark painted sails bulging drew in to crush the eldren then the eldren fleet divided into two roughly equal parts and dashed for the far corners of the net of shipsits weakest points many eldren craft broke through but we were prepared for this and with monumental precision our ships closed around them the eldren fleet was now divided into several groups and it made our work easier implacably we sailed in to crush them now the skies were filled with smoke and the seas with flaming wreckage and the air was populated by screams yells and warshouts the whine of the eldren fireballs the roar of our own shot the shattering bellowings of the cannon my face was covered by a film of grease and ash from the smoke and i sweated in the heat from the flames from time to time i caught a glimpse of a tense eldren face and i wondered at their beauty and feared that perhaps we had been overconfident in our assumption of our victory they were clad in light armour and moved about their ships as gracefully as trained dancers and their silver cannon did not once pause in their bombardment of our craft wherever the fireballs landed the decks or rigging became instantly alight with a shrieking allconsuming flame that burnt green and blue and seemed to devour metal as easily as it did wood i gripped the rail of the foredeck and leaned forward trying to peer through the stinging smoke all at once i saw an eldren ship sideon immediately ahead of us prepare to ram i yelled prepare to ram like many of our ships the lolinda possessed an ironshod ram lying just below the waterline now was our chance to use it i saw the eldren commander on his poopdeck shout orders to his men to turn the ship but it was too late even for the speedy eldren we bore down on the smaller craft and our whole ship reverberated with the mighty roar we drove into its side iron and timber screamed and ruptured and foam lashed skyward i was thrown back against the mast losing my footing and as i clambered to my feet i saw that we had broken the eldren craft completely in two i looked on the sight with a mixture of horror and exultation i had not guessed the brutal power of the lolinda on either side of our flagship i saw the two halves of the enemy ship rear in the water and begin to go down the horror on my face seemed matched by that on the eldren commanders as he fiercely strove to hold himself erect on his sloping poopdeck while his men threw up their arms and leapt into the dark surging sea that was already full of smashed timbers and drifting corpses swiftly now the sea swallowed the slim ship and i heard king rigenos laughing behind me as the eldren drowned i turned his face was smeared by soot and his redrimmed eyes stared wildly out of his haggard skull the helmetcrown of iron and diamonds was askew on his head as he continued to laugh in his morbid triumph good work erekosл the most satisfying method of all when dealing with these creatures break them open send them to the depths of the ocean so that they can be that much closer to their master the lord of hell katorn climbed up his face too was exultant ill give you that lord erekosл you have proved you know how to kill eldren i know how to kill many kinds of men i said quietly i was disgusted by their response i had admired the way in which the eldren commander had died i merely took an opportunity i said there is nothing clever in a ship of this size crushing lighter craft but there was no time to dispute the issue our ship was moving through the wreckage it had created surrounded by orange tongues of flame shrieks and yells thick smoke which obscured vision in all directions so that it was impossible to tell how the fleets of humanity fared we must get out of this i said into clearer sea we must let our own ships know that we are unharmed will you give the orders katorn aye katorn went back to his duties my head was beginning to throb with the din of the battle it became one great wall of noise one huge wave of smoke and flame and the stench of death and yetit was all familiar to me up to now my battletactics had been somewhat notionalintellectual rather than instinctive but now it did seem that old instincts came into play and i gave orders without working them out first and i was confident that the orders were good even katorn trusted them thus it had been with the order to ram the eldren craft i had not stopped to think it was probably just as well its oars pulling strongly the lolinda cleared the worst of the smoke and her trumpets and drums called out to announce her presence to the rest of the fleet a cheering went up from some of the nearby ships as we emerged into an area relatively free of smoke wreckage or other ships a few of our craft had begun to single out individual eldren vessels and were hurling out their grappling irons towards the shark ships the savage barbs cut into the white rails ripped through the shining sails bit into flesh even and tore off arms and legs the great menowar dragged the eldren craft towards them as whalers haul in their halfdead prey arrows began to fly from deck to deck as archers their legs twisted in the rigging shot at enemy archers javelins rattled on the decks or pierced the armour of the warriors eldren and human and threw them prone now the sound of cannon could still be heard but it was not the steady pounding it had been the shots became more intermittent and were replaced by the clash of swords the shouts of warriors fighting hand to hand smoke still formed acrid blossoms in the air above that watery battlefield and when i could see through the murk to the green wreckagestrewn ocean itself i saw that the foam was no longer white it was red the sea was covered by a slick of blood as our ship beat on to join battle once again i saw upturned faces staring at me from the sea they were the faces of the dead both eldren and human and they seemed to share a common expressionan expression of astonished accusation after a while i tried to ignore the sight of those faces chapter twelve the broken truce two more ships fell to our ram and we sustained hardly any damage at all the lolinda moved through the battle like a dignified juggernaut as if assured of her own invulnerability it was king rigenos who saw it first he screwed up his eyes and pointed through the smoke his open mouth red in the blackness of his sootcovered face there see it erekosл there i saw a magnificent eldren ship ahead of us but i did not know why rigenos singled it out it is the eldren flagship erekosл rigenos said the eldren flagship it could be that their leader himself is aboard if that cursed servant of azmobaana does ride his own flagship and if we can destroy him then our cause will be truly won pray that the eldren prince rides her erekosл pray for it katorn snarled from behind us i would like to be the one to bring him down he had a heavy crossbow in his mailed hands and he stroked its butt as another man might stroke a favourite kitten oh let prince arjavh be there let him be there hissed rigenos thirstily i paid them little heed but shouted the order for grappling irons to be readied luck it seemed was still with us our huge vessel reared up on a surging wave at exactly the right moment and we rode it down upon the eldren flagship our timbers scraping its sides and turning it so that it lay in a perfect position for our grapples to seize it the iron claws snaked out on thick ropes clamped in the rigging stabbed into the deck snatched at the rails now the eldren craft was bound to us we held it close like a lover holds his mistress and that same smile of triumph began to cross my face i had the sweet taste of victory on my lips it was the sweetest taste of all i erekosл signed for a slave to run forward and wipe my face with a damp cloth i drew myself up proudly on my deck just behind me was king rigenos on my right on my left was katorn i felt a comradeship with them suddenly i looked proudly down on the eldren deck the warriors looked exhausted but they stood ready with arrows strung on bows with swords clenched in white fists and shields raised they watched us silently making no attempt to cut the ropes waiting for us to make the first move when two flagships locked in this way there was always a pause before fighting broke out this was to enable the enemy commanders to speak and if both desired it decide a truce and the terms of that truce now king rigenos bellowed across the rail of his high deck calling out to the eldren who looked up at him their strange eyes smarting with the smoke as much as ours did this is king rigenos and his champion the immortal erekosл your ancient enemy come again to defeat you we would speak with your commander for a moment in the usual truce from beneath a canvas awning on his poopdeck a tall man now emerged through the shifting smoke i saw dimly at first a pointed golden face with milky blueflecked eyes staring sadly from the sockets of the slanting brow an eldritch voice like music sang across the sea i am duke baynahn commander of the eldren fleet we will make no complicated peace terms with you but if you let us sail away now we will not continue to fight rigenos smiled and katorn snorted how gracious katorn grunted he knows he is doomed rigenos chuckled at this then he called back to duke baynahn i find your proposal somewhat naive duke baynahn baynahn shrugged wearily then let us finish this he sighed he raised his gloved hand to order his men to loose their arrows hold a moment rigenos shouted there is another way if you would spare your men slowly baynahn lowered his hand what is that his voice was wary if your master arjavh of mernadin is aboard his own flagsnipas he should belet him come out and do battle with lord erekosл humanitys champion king rigenos spread out his palms if arjavh should winwhy you will go in peace if erekosл should win then you will become our prisoners duke baynahn folded his arms across his chest i have to tell you that our prince arjavh could not get to paphanaal in time to sail with our fleet he is in the westin loos ptokai king rigenos turned to katorn kill that one katorn he said quietly duke baynahn continued however i am prepared to fight your champion if no i cried to katorn stop king rigenos that is dishonourableyou speak during a truce there is no question of honour erekosл when exterminating vermin that you will soon learn kill him katorn duke baynahn was frowning plainly puzzled at our muted argument striving to catch the word i will fight your erekosл he said is it agreed and katorn brought up the crossbow and the bolt whirred and i heard a soft gasp as it penetrated the eldren speakers throat his hand went up towards the quivering bolt his strange eyes filmed he fell i was enraged at the treachery shown by one who so often spoke of treachery in his enemies but now there was no time to remonstrate for already the eldren arrows were whistling towards us and i had to ensure our defences and prepare to lead the boarding party against the betrayed crew of the enemy ship i grasped a trailing rope unsheathed my glowing sword and let the words come from my lips though i was still full of anger against katorn and the king for humanity i shouted death to the hounds of evil i swung down through the heated air that slashed against my face in that swift passage and i dropped with howling human warriors behind me among the eldren ranks then we were fighting my followers took care to stay away from me as the sword opened pale wounds in the eldren foes destroying all whom it even lightly cut many eldren died beneath the sword kanajana but there was no battlejoy in me as i fought for i was still furious with my own peoples actions and there was no skill needed for such slayingthe eldren were shocked at the death of their commander and they were plainly halfdead with weariness though they fought bravely indeed the slender shark ships seemed to hold more men than i had estimated the longskulled eldren well aware that my sword touch was lethal flung themselves at me with desperate and ferocious courage many of them wielded longhafted axes swinging at me out of reach of my sword the sword was no sharper than any ordinary blade and although i hacked at the shafts i succeeded only in splintering them slightly i had constantly to duck stab beneath the whirling axe blades a young goldenhaired eldren leapt at me swung his axe and it smashed against my shoulder plate knocking me off balance i rolled trying desperately to regain my footing on the bloodsmeared deck the axe smashed down again on to my breastplate winding me i struggled up into a crouching position plunged forward beneath the axe and slashed at the eldrens bared wrist a peculiar sobbing grunt escaped his lips he groaned and died the poison of the blade had done its work yet again i still did not understand how the metal itself could be poisoned but there was no doubting its effectiveness i straightened up my bruised body throbbing as i stared down at the brave young eldren who now lay at my feet then i looked about me i saw that we had the advantage the last pocket of fiercely fighting eldren was on the main deck back to back around their bannera scarlet field bearing the silver basilisk of mernadin i stumbled towards the fray the eldren were fighting to the last man they knew they would receive no mercy from their human enemies i stopped the warriors had no need of help from me i sheathed my sword and watched as the eldren were engulfed by our forces and although all badly wounded continued to fight until slain i looked about me a peculiar silence seemed to surround the two locked ships though in the distance the sound of cannon could still be heard then katorn who had led the attack on the last eldren defenders snatched down their basilisk banner and flung it into the flowing eldren blood insanely he began to trample the flag until it was completely soaked and unrecognisable thus will all the eldren perish he screamed in his mad triumph all all all he stumbled below to see what loot there was the silence returned the drifting smoke began to dissipate and hang higher in the air above us obscuring the sunlight now that the flagship was taken the day was won not one prisoner would be taken in the distance the victorious human warriors were busy firing the eldren vessels there seemed to be no eldren ships left uncaptured none fleeing over the horizon many of our own ships had been destroyed or were sinking in flames both sides craft were stretched across a vast expanse of water and the ocean itself was covered by a great carpet of wreckage and corpses so that it looked as if the remaining ships were trapped in it as if in some sargasso sea i for one felt trapped by it i wanted to leave this scene as soon as possible the smell of the dead choked me this was not the battle i had expected to fight this was not the glory i had hoped to win katorn reemerged with a look of satisfaction on his dark face youre emptyhanded i said why so pleased he wiped his lips duke baynahn had his daughter with him is she still alive not now i shuddered katorn stretched up his head and looked around him good weve finished them ill give orders to fire the remaining vessels surely i said that is a waste we could use those ships to replace those we have lost use these cursed craftnever he spoke with a twist of his mouth and strode to the rail of the eldren flagship shouting to his men to follow him back to their own vessel i came reluctantly looking back to where the corpse of the betrayed duke baynahn still lay the crossbow bolt projecting from his slender neck then i clambered aboard our ship and i gave the orders to save what grapples we could and cut away the rest king rigenos greeted me he had taken no part in the actual fighting you did well erekosл why you could have taken that ship singlehanded i could have done i said i could have taken the whole fleet singlehanded he laughed you are very confident the whole fleet aye there was one way he frowned what do you mean if you had let me fight duke baynahnas he suggestedmany lives and many ships would have been saved our lives our ships you surely did not trust him the eldren will always try some trick like that doubtless if you had agreed to his plan you would have stepped aboard his ship and been cut down by a hundred arrows believe me erekosл you must not be deceived by them our ancestors were so deceivedand look how we suffer now i shrugged maybe you are right of course i am right king rigenos turned his head and called to our crew fire the ship fire that cursed eldren craft hurry up you luggards he was in a good humour was king rigenos a great good humour i watched as blazing arrows were accurately shot into bales of combustible materials which had been placed in strategic parts of the eldren ship the slender vessel soon caught the bodies of the slain began to burn and oily smoke struck upward to the sky the ship drifted away its silver cannon like the snouts of slaughtered beasts its glistening sails dropping in flaming ribbons to the already flaming deck it gave a long shudder suddenly as if expiring the last of its life put a couple of shots below the waterline katorn shouted to his gunners lets make sure the thing sinks once and for all our brazen cannon snarled and the heavy shot smashed into the eldren flagship sending up gouts of water and crashing through the timbers the flagship yawed but still seemed to be trying to stay upright her drifting went slower and slower as she settled lower in the water until she had stopped altogether and then all at once she sank swiftly and was gone i thought of the eldren duke i thought of his daughter and in a way i now envied them they would know eternal peace just as it seemed i should know nothing but eternal strife our fleet began to reassemble we had lost thirtyeight menowar and a hundred and ten smaller craft of different types but nothing remained of the eldren fleet nothing but the burning hulks which we now left sinking behind us as we sailed in battlethirsty glee for paphanaal chapter thirteen paphanaal for the rest of our sailing towards paphanaal i avoided both katorn and king rigenos perhaps they were right and the eldren could not be trusted but should we not set some kind of example on the second night of the voyage after the big battle with the eldren count roldero visited me you did well there he said your tactics were superb and i hear you accounted well for yourself in the handtohand fighting he looked about him in mock fear and whispered jerking his thumb at a vague spot above him but i hear rigenos decided that it was best he did not put the royal person in danger lest we warriors lose heart oh i said rigenos has a fair point he came with us dont forget he could have stayed behind we all expected him to did you hear of the order he gave while the truce was on with the enemy commander roldero sniffed had him shot by katorn right yes well roldero grinned at me you make allowances for rigenoss cowardice and ill make allowances for his treachery he burst into gusty laughter thats fair eh i could not help smiling but later more seriously i said would you have done the same roldero oh i expect so war after all but baynahn was prepared to fight me he must have known his chances were slim he must have known too that rigenos could not be trusted to keep his word if he did then he would have acted as rigenos acted it was just that rigenos was quicker merely tactics you seethe trick is to gauge the exact moment to be treacherous baynahn did not look like one who would have acted treacherously he is probably a very kind man and treated his family well i told you erekosл it is not baynahns character i dispute i just say that as a warrior he would have tried what rigenos succeeded in doingeliminating the enemys chief it is one of the basic principles of warfare if you say so roldero i do say so now drink up i did drink up and i drank deep and i drank myself stupid now there were not merely the dream memories to contend with but more recent memories too another night came before we reached the harbour city of paphanaal and we lay at anchor a sea league or so offshore then in the shifting dawn of the morrow we upped anchors and rowed in towards paphanaal for there was no wind to fill our sails nearer we came to land i saw cliffs and black mountains rising nearer i saw a flash of brighter colour to the east of us paphanaal shouted the lookout from his precarious perch in the top trees nearer and there was paphanaal she was undefended as far as we could make out we had left her defenders on the bottom of the ocean far behind there were no domes on this city no minarets there were steeples and buttresses and battlements all close together they made the city seem like one great palace the materials of their construction were breathtaking there was white marble veined with pink blue green and yellow orange marble veined with black marble faced with gold basalt and quartz and bluestone in abundance it was a shining city as we came closer we saw no one on the quaysides no one in the streets or on the battlements i assumed that the city had been deserted i was wrong we put in to the great harbour and disembarked i formed our armies into disciplined ranks and warned them of a possible trap although i did not really believe there could be one the warriors had spent the rest of the voyage repairing their clothes and their armour cleaning their weapons and making repairs to their ships all the ships crowded the harbour now their banners waving in the light breeze that had come up almost as soon as we set foot on the cobblestones of the quay cloud came in with the breeze and made the day grey the warriors stood before king rigenos katorn and myself rank upon rank they stood their armour bright banners moving sluggishly in the breeze there were seven hundred divisions each hundred divisions commanded by a marshal who had as his commanders his captains who controlled twentyfive divisions each and his knights who controlled one division the wine had helped fade the memory of the battle and i felt a return of my old pride as i stood looking at the paladins and armies of humanity assembled before me i addressed them marshals captains knights and warriors of humanity you have seen me to be a victorious war leader aye they roared jubilant we shall be victorious here and elsewhere in the land of mernadin go now with caution and search these buildings for eldren but be careful this city could hide an army remember count roldero spoke up from the front rank and booty lord erekosл what of that king rigenos waved his hand take what booty you desire but remember what erekosл has saidbe wary for such things as poisoned food even the winecups could be smeared with poison anything in this damned city could be poisoned the divisions began to march past us each taking a different direction i watched them go and i thought that while the city received them into its heart it did not welcome them i wondered what we would find in paphannal traps hidden snipers everything poisoned as rigenos had said we found a city of women not one eldren man had remained not one boy over twelve not one old man of any age we had slain them all at sea chapter fourteen ermizhad i did not know how they slew the children i begged king rigenos not to give the order i pleaded with katorn to spare themto drive them from the city if he must but not to kill them but the children were slain i do not know how many we had taken over the palace which had belonged to duke baynahn himself he had it transpired been warden of paphanaal i shut myself in my quarters while the slaughter went on outside i reflected sardonically that for all their talk of the eldren filth they did not seem to mind forcing their attentions on the eldren women there was nothing i could do i did not even know if there was anything i should do i had been brought here by rigenos to fight for humanity not to judge it i had agreed to answer his summons after alldoubtless with reason but i had forgotten any reason i sat in a room that was exquisitely furnished with delicate furniture and fine light tapestries on walls and floor i looked at the eldren craftsmanship and i sipped the aromatic eldren wine and i tried not to listen to the cries of the eldren children as they were butchered in their beds in the houses in the streets beyond the thin palace walls i looked at the sword kanajana which i had propped in a corner and i hated the poisoned thing i had stripped myself of my armour and i sat alone and i drank more wine but the wine of the eldren began to taste of blood and i tossed the cup away and found a skin that count roldero had given me and sucked it dry of the bitter wine it contained but i could not get drunk i could not stop the screams from the streets i could not fail to see the flickering shadows on the tapestries i had drawn over the windows i could not get drunk and therefore i could not even begin to try to sleep for i knew what my dreams would be and i feared those almost as much as i feared thinking of the implications of what we were doing to those who were left in paphanaal why was i here oh why was i here there was a noise outside my door and then a knock enter i said no one entered my voice had been too low the knock sounded again i rose and walked unsteadily to the door flinging it open can you not leave me in peace a frightened soldier of the imperial guard stood there lord erekosл forgive me for disturbing you but i bear a message from king rigenos whats the message i said without interest he would like you to join him he says that there are still plans to discuss i sighed very well i will come down shortly the soldier hurried off along the corridor at last reluctantly i rejoined the other conquerors all the marshals were there lounging on cushions and celebrating their victory king rigenos was there and he was so drunk that i envied him and to my relief katorn was not there doubtless he was leading the looters as i came in to the hall a huge cheer went up from the marshals and they raised their winecups in a toast to me i ignored them and walked to where the king was seated alone staring vacantly into space you wish to discuss further campaigns king rigenos i said are you sure ah my friend erekosл the immortal the champion the saviour of humanity greetings erekosл he put a hand drunkenly on my arm you disapprove of my unkingly insobriety i see i disapprove of nothing i said i have been drinking much myself but youan immortalcan contain your he belched can contain your liquor i took pains to smile and said perhaps you have stronger liquor if so let me try it slave screamed king rigenos slave more of that wine for my friend erekosл a curtain parted and a trembling eldren boy appeared he was bearing a wineskin almost as large as himself i see you have not slain all the children i said king rigenos giggled not yet not while there are uses for them i took the wineskin from the child and nodded to him you may go i held the skin and put the opening to my lips and began to drink deeply but still the wine refused to dull my brain i hurled the skin away and it fell heavily and slopped wine over the tapestries and cushions covering the floor king rigenos continued to giggle good good these people were barbarians suddenly i wished that i was john daker again studious unhappy john daker living his quiet cutoff life in the pursuit of pointless learning i turned to leave stay erekosл ill sing you a song its a filthy song about the filthy eldren tomorrow its already tomorrow i must rest i am your king erekosл you own your material form to me do not forget that i have not forgotten the doors of the hall burst open then and they dragged in the katorn was in the lead and he was grinning like a sated she was a blackhaired elfinfaced girl her alien features were composed against the fear she felt she had a strange shifting beauty which was always there but which seemed to change with every breath she took they had torn her garments and bruised her arms and face erekosл katorn followed his men in he too was very drunk erekosлrigenos my lord kinglook the king blinked and looked at the girl with distaste why should we take interest in an eldren wanton get hence katorn use her as you willthat is your private decisionbut be sure she is not still alive when we leave paphanaal no laughed katorn look look at her the king shrugged and inspected the wine swilling in his cup why have you brought her here katorn i asked quietly katorn rocked with laughter his thick lips opened wide and he roared in our faces you know not who she is thats plain take the eldren wench away katorn the kings voice rose in drunken irritation my lord kingthisthis is ermizhad what the king leaned forward and stared at the girl what ermizhad that whore ermizhad of the ghost worlds katorn nodded the same the king grew more sober shes lured many a mortal to his death so ive heard she shall die by torture for her lustful crimes the stake shall have her katorn shook his head no king rigenosat least not yet forget you that shes prince arjavhs sister the king nodded in a mockery of gravity of course arjavhs sister and the implications my lord we should keep her prisoner should we not she will make a good hostage eh a good bargaining counter should we need one ah of course yes you did right katorn keep her prisoner the king grinned a silly grin no it is not fair you deserve to enjoy yourself further this night who does not wish to enjoy himself he looked at me erekosлerekosл who cannot get drunk she shall be put in your charge champion i nodded i accept the charge i said i pitied the girl whatever terrible crimes she had committed katorn looked at me suspiciously do not worry lord katorn i said do as the king sayscontinue to enjoy yourself slay some more rape some more there must be plenty left katorn drew his brows together then his face cleared a little a few maybe he said but weve been thorough only she will live to see the sun rise i think he jabbed a thumb at his prisoner then signed to his men come lets finish our task he stalked out count roldero got up slowly and came towards me where i stood looking at the eldren girl the king looked up good keep her from harm erekosл he said cynically keep her from harm shell be a useful piece in our game with arjavh take her to my apartments in the east wing i told the guards and make sure shes unmolested and has no chance to escape they took her away and almost as soon as she had left king rigenos made to stand up swayed and fell with a crash to the floor count roldero gave a slight smile our liege is not himself he said but katorn is right the eldren bitch will be useful to us i understand her usefulness as a hostage i said but i do not understand this reference to the ghost worlds ive heard them spoken of once before what are they roldero the ghost worlds why we all know of them i should have thought that you would too but we do not often speak of them why so humankind fear arjavhs allies so much that they will rarely mention them in terror of conjuring them up by their words you understand i do not understand roldero rubbed his nose and coughed i am not superstitious erekosл he said like yourself i know but what are the ghost worlds roldero seemed nervous ill tell you but im uncomfortable about doing so in this cursed place the eldren know better than we what the ghost worlds are we had thought at first that you yourself were a prisoner there that was why i was surprised where are they the ghost worlds lie beyond the earthbeyond time and beyond spacelinked to the earth only by the most tenuous of bonds rolderos voice dropped but he whispered on there on the torn ghost worlds dwell the manycoiled serpents which are the terror and the scourge of the eight dimensions here also live ghosts and menthose who are manlike and those who are unlike menthose who know that their fate is to live without time and those who are unaware of their doom and there also do kinfolk to the eldren dwellthe halflings but what are these worlds i asked impatiently roldero licked his lips they are the worlds to which human sorcerers sometimes go in search of alien wisdom and from which they draw helpers of horrible powers and disgusting deeds it is said that within those worlds an initiate may meet his longslain comrades who may sometimes help him his dead loves and his dead kin and particularly his enemiesthose whom he has caused to die malevolent enemies with great poweror wretches who are halfsouled and incomplete his whispered words convinced me perhaps because i had drunk so much was it these ghost worlds that were the origin of my strange dreams i wanted to know more but what are they roldero where are they roldero shook his head i do not concern myself with such mysteries erekosл i have never been much of a mystic i believebut i do not probe i know of no answer to either of your questions they are worlds full of shadow and gloomy shores upon which drab seas beat the populace can sometimes be summoned by powerful sorcery to visit this earth to haunt to helpor to terrorise we think that the eldren came originally from these halfworlds if they were not as our legends say spawned from the womb of a wicked queen who gave her virginity to azmobaana in return for immortalitythe immortality which her offspring inherited but the eldren are material enough for all their lack of souls whereas the ghost armies are rarely solid flesh and ermizhad the wanton of the ghost worlds why is she called that it is said that she mates with ghouls muttered count roldero he shrugged and drank more wine and in return for giving her favours to them she receives special powers over the halflings who are friends with the ghouls the halflings love her im told as far as its possible for such creatures to love i could not believe it the girl seemed young innocent i said as much roldero gestured dismissively how can you tell the age of an immortal look at yourself how old are you erekosл thirty you look no older but i have not lived for ever i said at least not in one body i do not think but how do you tell i could not answer him of course well i think theres a great deal of superstition mixed up in your tale roldero i said i would not have expected it of you old friend believe me or not roldero muttered but you would do better to believe me until i am proved a liar eh possibly youre right i sometimes wonder at you erekosл he said here you are owing your own existence to an incantation and you are the most sceptical man i know i smiled at this yes roldero i should believe more i should believe more come said roldero moving towards the prone king who lay on his face in a pool of wine lets get our lord to bed before he drowns together we picked up the king and called for soldiers to help us as we hauled rigenos up the stairs and dumped him on his bed roldero put a hand on my shoulder and stop brooding friend it will do no good think you that i enjoy the slaughter of children the rape of young girls he rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand as if to rid it of a foul taste but if it is not done now erekosл it will be done at some time to our children and our young girls i know the eldren are beautiful but so are many snakes so are some kinds of wolf that prey on sheep it is braver to do what has to be done than it is to pretend to yourself that you are not doing it you follow me we stood there in the kings bedchamber staring at each other you are very kind roldero i said its well meant advice he told me i know it is it was not your decision to slaughter the children he said but it was my decision to say nothing of it to king rigenos i replied at the mention of his name the king stirred and began to mumble in his stupor come grinned roldero lets get out of here before he remembers the words of that dirty song he promised to sing us we parted in the corridor outside the chamber count roldero looked at me with some concern these actions must be made he said it has befallen us to be the instruments of a decision made some centuries ago do not bother yourself with matters of conscience the future may see us as bloodyhanded butchers but we know we are not we are men we are warriors and we are at war with those who would destroy us i said nothing but put my hand on his shoulder then turned and walked back to my lonely apartments in my mental discomfort i had all but forgotten the girl until i saw the guard at my door is the prisoner secure i asked him there is no way out the guard said no way at least lord erekosл that a human could take but if she were to summon her halfling allies well concern ourselves with those when they materialise i told him he unlocked the door for me and i entered there was only one lamp burning and i could barely see i took a taper from a table and with it lit another lamp the eldren girl lay on the bed her eyes were closed but her cheeks were stained with tears so they cry like us too i thought i tried not to disturb her but she opened her eyes and i thought i saw fear in them though it was difficult to tell for the eyes really were strangewithout orbs and flecked with gold and blue seeing those eyes i remembered what roldero had told me and i began to believe him how are you i asked somewhat inanely her lips parted but she did not speak i do not intend to harm you i said weakly i would have spared the children if i could i would have spared the warriors in the battle but i have only the power to lead men to kill each other i have no power to save their lives she frowned i am erekosл i said erekosл the word was music when she spoke it she pronounced it more familiarly than i did myself you know who i am i know who you were i am reborn i said do not ask me how you do not seem happy to be reborn erekosл i shrugged erekosл she said again and then she voiced a low bitter laugh why do you laugh but she would not speak again i tried to converse with her further she closed her eyes i left the room and went to the bed next door the wine had worked at lastor something hadfor i slept reasonably well chapter fifteen the returning next morning i arose washed myself dressed and knocked on ermizhads door there was no reply thinking that she had perhaps escaped and that katorn would be instantly suspicious that i had helped her i flung open the door and entered she had not escaped she still lay on the bed but now her eyes were open again as she stared at the ceiling those eyes were as mysterious to me as the starflecked depths of the universe did you sleep well i asked she did not reply are you unwell was my next rather stupid question but she had plainly decided to communicate with me no further i made one last attempt and the left going down to the great hall of the slain warden here roldero was waiting for me and there were a few other marshals looking the worse for wear but king rigenos and katorn were not present rolderos eyes twinkled there are no drums beating in your skull by the look of you he was right i had not considered it but i had no after effects from the huge quantities of wine drunk the night before i feel very well i said ah now i believe you are an immortal he laughed i have not escaped so lightly neither it seems have king rigenos and lord katorn or some of the others who were enjoying themselves so much last night he drew closer and said quietly and i hope you are in better spirits today my friend i suppose i am i said i felt drained of emotion in fact good and what of that eldren creature still safe still safe she did not try to seduce you on the contraryshe will not speak to me at all just as well roldero looked around impatiently i hope they get up soon theres much to discuss do we carry on inland or what i thought we agreed that the best plan was to leave a good force here strong enough to defend the city and get back to the two continents to reequip and to check any attempt to invade us while our fleets at paphanaal roldero nodded its the most sensible plan but i do not like it very much while it has logic it does not suit my impatience to get at the enemy as soon as possible i agreed with him i would like to have done with this as soon as i could i told him but we had little clear idea where the rest of the eldren forces were marshalled there were four other major cities on the continent of mernadin the chief of these was loos ptokai which lay near to the plains of melting ice this was arjavhs headquarters and from what the eldren on the flagship had said he was either there now or marching to recapture paphanaal it seemed to us that he would attempt this because paphanaal was the most important position on the coast with it in our hands we had a good harbour in which to bring our ships and land our men and if arjavh did march against us then all we had to do was save our energy and wait we thought that we could leave our main force in paphanaal return to our own base at noonos bringing back the divisions of warriors who because of insufficient ships had been unable to come with us on the preliminary expedition but roldero had something else on his mind we must not forget the sorcerous fortress of the outer islands he told me they lie at worlds edge the outer islands should be taken as soon as possible what exactly are the outer islands why are they so strategic i asked him and why havent they been mentioned before in our plans ah said count roldero ah it is because of our reluctance particularly when at home to discuss the ghost worlds i made a sign of mock despair the ghost worlds again the outer islands lie in the gateway to the ghost worlds roldero said seriously from there the eldren can summon their ghoulish allies perhaps now paphanaal is taken we should concentrate on smashing their strength in the westat worlds edge had i been wrong to be so sceptical or was roldero overestimating the power of the ghost world denizens rolderohave you ever seen these halflings i asked him oh yes my friend he replied you are wrong if you believe them legendary beings they are in one sense real enough i became more convinced i trusted rolderos opinions more than most then perhaps we should alter our strategy slightly i said we can leave the main army here to wait for arjavh to march against the city and waste his strength trying to take it from the land side we return to noonos with the large portion of the fleet add any new ships that are ready to our force take fresh warriors aboardand sail against the outer islands while if we are right arjavh expends his own force trying to retake paphanaal roldero nodded it seems a wise plan to me erekosл but what of the girlour hostage how shall we use her to our best advantage i frowned i did not like the idea of using her at all i wondered where she would be safest i suppose we should keep her as far away from here as possible i said necranal would be best there is little chance of her people being able to rescue her and she would have a difficult time getting back if she managed to escape what do you think roldero nodded i think you are right thats sensible we must discuss all this with the king of course i said gravely of course said roldero and winked and katorn i added and katorn he agreed especially katorn it was well after noon before we had a chance to speak with katorn or the king both were palefaced and were quick to agree with our suggestions as if they would agreed to anything so long as they were left alone well establish our position here i told the king and set sail back to noonos within the week we should waste no time now that we have gained paphanaal we can expect savage counterattacks from the eldren aye muttered katorn he was red eyed and you are right to try to block off arjavhs summoning of his frightful ghost armies i am glad you approve of my plan lord katorn i said his smile was twisted youre beginning to prove yourself my lord ill say that for you still a little soft towards our enemies but youre beginning to realise what theyre like i wonder i said there were minor details of the plan to discuss and while the victorious warriors continued to pleasure themselves on eldren spoils we talked of these matters until they were completely settled it was a good plan it would work if the eldren reacted as we expected and we were sure that they would we agreed that i and king rigenos would return with the fleet leaving katorn to command the army at paphanaal roldero also elected to return with us the bulk of the warriors would remain behind we had to hope that the eldren did not have another fleet in the vicinity for we would be sailing back with just the minimum crews and would be hardpressed to defend ourselves if attacked at sea but there were risks to all the different possibilities and we had to decide which actions the eldren were most likely to take and act accordingly the next few days were spent in preparation for the voyage back and soon we were ready to sail we sailed out of paphanaal on a dawn tide our ships moving sluggishly through the water for they groaned with captured eldren treasure begrudgingly the king had agreed to giving ermizhad decent quarters next to mine his attitude towards me seemed to have changed since the first drunken night in paphanaal he was reserved almost embarrassed by my presence doubtless he remembered vaguely that he had made some sort of fool of himself perhaps he remembered my own refusal to celebrate the victory perhaps the glory that i had won for him made him jealous though the gods knew i wanted nothing of that tainted glory or perhaps he sensed my own disgust with the war i had agreed to fight for him and was nervous that i might suddenly refuse to be the champion he felt he so desperately needed i had no opportunity to discuss this with him and count roldero could offer no explanation save to say in the kings favour that the slaughter might have wearied the king just as it had wearied me i was not sure of this for the king seemed to hate the eldren even more than before as was made evident by his treatment of ermizhad ermizhad still refused to speak she hardly ate and she rarely left her cabin but one evening as i strolled on deck i saw her standing at the rail and staring down into the sea as if she contemplated hurling herself into its depths i increased my pace so that i should be near if she did attempt to throw herself overboard she half turned as i approached and then looked away again at this point the king emerged on the poopdeck and called down to me i see youve taken pains to make sure the winds behind you when you get near to the eldren bitch lord erekosл i stopped and looked up at first i hardly understood the reference i glanced at ermizhad who pretended not to have heard the kings insult i too pretended i had not understood the significance of the remark and gave a slight polite bow then deliberately i walked past ermizhad and paused near the rail staring out to sea perhaps you have no sense of smell lord erekosл the king called again i ignored the remark it seems a pity that we must tolerate vermin on our ship when we took such pains to scrub our decks free of their tainted blood the king went on at last furious i turned round but he had left the poopdeck i looked at ermizhad she continued to stare down into the dark waters as they were pierced by our oars she seemed almost mesmerised by the rhythm i wondered if she really had not heard the insults there were several more occasions of that kind on board the flagship lolinda as we sailed on for noonos whenever king rigenos got the opportunity he would speak of ermizhad in her presence as if she were not there spoke disdainfully of her and his disgust for all her kind increasingly i found it harder to control my anger but control it i did and ermizhad for her part showed no sign that she was offended by the kings crude references to her and her race i saw less of ermizhad than i wished but in spite of the kings warnings came to like her she was certainly the most beautiful woman i had ever seen her beauty was different from the cool beauty of lolinda my betrothed what is love even now now that the whole pattern of my particular destiny seems to have been fulfilled i do not know oh yes i still loved lolinda but i think that while i did not know it i was falling in love with ermizhad too i refused to believe in the stories told about her and held affection for her though at that time i had no thought of letting this affect my attitude towards her that attitude had to be of a gaoler for his prisoneran important prisoner at that a prisoner who could help decide the war against the eldren in our favour i did pause once or twice to wonder about the logic of keeping her as a hostage if as king rigenos insisted the eldren were coldhearted and unhuman then why should arjavh care if his sister were murdered by us ermizhad if she were the creature king rigenos believed her to be showed no signs of her evil rather she seemed to be to exhibit a singular nobility of soul that was in excellent contrast to the kings rude banter and then i wondered if the king realised the affection i felt for ermizhad and was afraid that the union between his daughter and his immortal champion was threatened but i remained loyal to lolinda it did not occur to me to question that we should not be married on my return as we had agreed there must be countless forms of love which is the form which conquers the rest i cannot define it i shall not try ermizhads beauty had the fascination of being an unhuman beauty but close enough to my own races ideal to attract me she had the long pointed eldren face that john daker might have tried to describe as elfin and failed to do justice to its nobility she had the slanting eyes that seemed blind in their strange milkiness the slightly pointed ears the high slanting cheekbones and a slender body that was almost boyish all the eldren women were slender like this smallbreasted and narrowwaisted her red lips were fairly wide curving naturally upwards so that she always seemed to be on the point of smiling when her face was in repose for the first two weeks of our voyage she continued to refuse to speak although i showed her every courtesy i saw that she had everything for her comfort and she thanked me through her guards that was all but one day i stood outside the set of cabins where she the king and myself had our apartments leaning over the rail and looking at a grey sea and an overcast sky and i saw her approach me greetings sir champion she said halfmockingly as she came out of her cabin i was surprised greetings lady ermizhad said i she was dressed in a cloak of midnight blue flung around a simple smock of pale blue wool a day of omens i think she said looking at the gloomy sky which boiled darkly now above us full of heavy greys and dusty yellows why think you i enquired she laughed it was lovely to hearcrystal and goldstrung harps it was the music of heaven not of hell forgive me she said i sought to disturb youbut i see you are not so prone to suggestion as others of your race i grinned you are very complimentary my lady i find their superstitions a trifle tedious i must admit not to mention their insults one is not troubled by those she said they are sad little insults really you are very charitable we eldren are a charitable race i think i have heard otherwise i suppose you have i have bruises that prove otherwise i smiled your warriors did not seem particularly charitable in the seafight beyond paphanaal she bowed her head and yours were not charitable when they came to paphanaal is it true am i the only survivor i licked my lips they were suddenly dry i believe so i said quietly then i am lucky she said her voice rising a little there was of course no reply i could make we stood there in silence looking at the sea later she said quietly so you are erekosл you are not like the rest of your race in fact you do not seem wholly of that race aha i replied now i know you are my enemy what do you mean my enemiesthe lord katorn in particularsuspects my humanity and are you human i am nothing else i am sure of that i have the problems of any ordinary mortal i am as confused as the rest though my problems are perhaps different how i came here i do not know they say i am a great hero reborn come to aid them against your people they brought me here by means of an incantation but then it sometimes seems to me in dreams at night that i have been many heroes and all of them human i am not sure i do not think my basic character has altered in any of those incarnations i have no special wisdom no special powers as far as i know would you not think that an immortal would have gathered a great store of wisdom she nodded slightly i would think so my lord i am not even sure where i am i continued i do not know if i came here from the far future or from the far past the terms mean little to the eldren she said but some of us believe that past and future are the samethat time moves in a circle so that the past is the future and the future is the past an interesting theory i said but a rather simple one is it not i think i would agree with you she murmured time is a subtle thing even our wisest philosophers do not fully understand its nature the eldren do not think very much about timewe do not have to normally of course we have our histories but history is not mine history is merely a record of certain events i understand you i said now she came and stood by the ships rail one hand resting lightly upon it at that moment i felt the affection that i suppose a father might have for a daughter a father who delights in his offsprings assured innocence she could not have been i felt much more than nineteen yet her voice had a confidence that comes with knowledge of the world her carriage was proud also confident i realised then that king rigenos might well have spoken the truth how indeed could you gauge the age of an immortal i thought at first i said that i came from your future but now i am not sure perhaps i come from your pastthat this world is in relation to what i call the twentieth century in the far future this world is very ancient she agreed is there a record of a time when only human beings occupied the earth we have no such records she smiled there is an echo of a myth the thread of a legend which says that there was a time when only the eldren occupied the earth my brother has studied this i believe he knows more i shivered i did not know why but my vitals seemed to chill within me i could not easy continue the conversation though i wanted to she appeared not to have noticed my discomfort at last i said a day of omens madam i hope to talk with you again soon i bowed and returned to my cabin chapter sixteen confrontation with the king that night i slept without my usual precaution of a jug of wine to send me into deeper slumber i did it deliberately though with trepidation erekosл i heard the voice calling as it had called once before to john daker but this time it was not the voice of king rigenos erekosл this voice was more musical i saw green swaying forests and great green hills and glades and castles and delicate beasts whose names i did not know erekosл my name is not erekosл i said it is prince coram prince coramprince coram bannan flurunn of the scarlet robeand i seek my people o where are my people why is there no cessation to this quest i rode a horse the horse was mantled in yellow velvet and hung about with panniers two spears a plain round shield a bow and a quiver holding arrows i wore a conical silver helm and a double weight of chainmail the lower layer of brass and the upper of silver and i bore a long strong sword that was not the sword kanajana erekosл i am not erekosл erekosл i am john daker erekosл i am jerry cornelius erekosл i am konrad arflane erekosл what do you want i asked we want your help you have my help erekosл i am karl glogauer erekosл the names did not matter i knew it now only the fact mattered the fact that i was a creature incapable of dying a creature eternal doomed to have many shapes to be called many names but to be for ever battling and perhaps i had been wrong perhaps i was not truly human but only assumed the characteristics of a human being if i were caught in a human body it seemed to me that i howled in misery then what was i what was i if i was not a man the voice was still calling but i refused to heed it how i wished i had not heeded it before as i lay in my comfortable bed in the comfortable identity of john daker i awoke and i was sweating i had found out nothing more about myself and the mystery of my origin it seemed i had only succeeded in confusing myself further it was still night but i dared not fall asleep again i peered through the darkness i looked at the curtains pulled across the windows the white coverlet of the bed my wife beside me i began to scream erekosлerekosлerekosл i am john daker i screamed looki am john daker erekosл i know nothing of this name erekosл my name is elric prince of melnibone elric the kinslayer i am known by many names many namesmany namesmany names how was it possible to possess dozens of identities all at the same time to move from period to period at random to move away from the earth itself out to where the cold stars glared there was a rushing noise and now i plunged through dark airless places down down down and there was nothing in the universe but drifting gas no gravity no colour no air no intelligence save my ownand perhaps somewhere one another again i screamed and i refused to let myself know further whatever the doom upon me i thought next morning i would never understand it and it was probably for the best i went on deck and there was ermizhad standing in the same place at the rail as if she had not moved all night the sky had cleared somewhat and sunlight pushed thick beams through the clouds the rays slanting down on the choppy sea so that the world seemed half dark half light a moody day we stood for a while in silence leaning out over the rail watching the surf slide by watching the oars smash into the waters in monotonous rhythm again she was the first to speak what do they plan to do with me she asked quietly you will be a hostage against the eventuality of your brother prince arjavh ever attacking necranal i told her it was only half the truth there were other ways of using her against her brother but there was no point in detailing them you will be safeking rigenos will not be able to bargain if you are harmed she sighed why did not you and the other eldren women flee when our fleets put in to paphanaal i asked this had puzzled me for some time the eldren do not flee she said they do not flee from cities that they build themselves they fled to the mountains of sorrow some centuries ago i pointed out no she shook her head they were driven there that is the difference that is a difference i agreed who speaks of difference a new harsher voice broke in it was king rigenos he had come silently out of his cabin and stood behind us feet apart on the swaying deck he did not look at ermizhad but stared directly at me he did not look well greetings sire i said we were discussing the meaning of words youve become uncommon friendly with the eldren bitch he sneered what was it about a man who had shown himself kind and brave in many ways that when the eldren were concerned he became an uncouth barbarian sire i said for i could no longer be polite sire you speak of one who though our enemy is of noble blood again he sneered noble blood the vile stuff which flows in their polluted veins cannot be termed thus beware erekosл i realise that you are not altogether versed in our ways or our knowledge that your memory is hazybut remember that the eldren wanton has a tongue of liquid gold which can beguile you to your doom and ours pay no heed to her it was the most direct and most portentious speech he had made thus far sire i said shell weave such a spell that youll be a fawning dog at her mercy and no good to any of us i tell you erekosл beware gods ive half a mind to give her to the rowers and let them have their way with her before shes thrown over the side you placed her under my protection my lord king i said angrily and i am sworn to protect her against all dangers fool i have warned you i do not want to lose your friendship erekosлand more i do not want to lose our war champion if she shows further signs of enchanting you i shall sky her none shall stop me i am doing your work king i said at your request but remember you thisi am erekosл i have been many other champions what i do is for the human race i have taken no oath of loyalty to you or to any other king i am erekosл the war championchampion of humanitynot rigenoss champion his eyes narrowed is this treachery erekosл it was almost as if he hoped it was no king rigenos disagreement with a single representative of humanity does not constitute treachery to mankind he said nothing but just stood there seeming to hate me as much as he hated the eldren girl his breathing was heavy and rasped in his throat give me no reason to regret my summoning of thee dead erekosл he said at length and turned away going back into his cabin i think it would be for the best if we discontinued our conversation said ermizhad quietly dead erekosл eh i said and then grinned if im dead then im strangely prone to emotion for a corpse i made light of our dispute yet events had taken a turn which caused me to fear that he would not among other things allow me the hand of lolindafor he still did not know that we were betrothed she looked at me strangely and moved her hand as if to comfort me perhaps i am dead i said have you seen any creatures like me on the ghost worlds she shook her head not really so the ghost worlds do exist i said really i had been speaking rhetorically of course they exist she laughed you are the greatest sceptic i have ever met tell me about them ermizhad what is there to tell she shook her head and if you do not believe what you have heard already then theres little point if i tell you more that you will not believe is there i shrugged i suppose not i felt she was being unduly secretive but i did not press the matter answer one thing i said would the mystery of my existence be found on the ghost worlds she smiled sympathetically how could i answer that erekosл i dont knowi thought the eldren knew more ofof sorcery now you are showing yourself to be as superstitious as your fellows she said you do not believe madam i said i do not know what i should believe the logic of this worldboth human and eldrenis i am afraid a mystery to me chapter seventeen necranal again although the king refrained from further outbursts against either myself or ermizhad it could not really be said that he warmed to me again though he grew more relaxed as the shores of necralala drew closer and eventually noonos was sighted and we left the better part of the fleet there to refit and reprovision and sailed back up the river droonaa to come again to necranal the news of our great sea victory was already in necranal indeed it had been amplified and it seemed that i had sunk some score of ships and destroyed their crews singlehanded i did nothing to deny the truth of this for the reason that i was worried king rigenos would begin to work against me the adulation of the people however meant that he could not be seen to deny me anything my power had grown on my return for i had achieved a victory i had proved myself the champion the people wanted it now seemed that if king rigenos acted against me he would arouse the wrath of the people against himand that wrath would be so great it could lose him his crownand his head this did not mean of course that he had to like me but in fact when we had once again reached the palace of ten thousand windows he was almost in an affable mood i think he had begun to see me as a threat to his throne but the sight of his palace his people and his daughter reassured him that he was still the king and would always be the king i was not interested in his crownonly his daughter guards escorted ermizhad away to her quarters when we arrived and she had departed before lolinda came running down the stairs into the great hall her face radiant her carriage graceful kissing first her father and then myself have you told father of our secret she asked i think he knew before we left i laughed turning to rigenos upon whose face there had come something of an abstracted look we would be betrothed sire do you give us your consent king rigenos opened his mouth wiped his forehead and swallowed before nodding of course my blessings to you this will make our unity even stronger a slight frown came to lolindas brow fatheryou are pleased are you not of cyes naturally i am pleasednaturally but i am weary with travelling and with fighting my dear i need to rest forgive me oh i am sorry father yes you must rest you are right you do not look well i will have the slaves prepare some food for you and you can dine in bed yes he said yes when he had gone lolinda looked at me curiously you too seem to have suffered from the fighting erekosл you are not hurt are you no the battle was bloody and i did not enjoy much of what we had to do warriors kill menthat is the way aye i said hoarsely but do they kill women lolinda do they kill children babies she moistened her lips with her tongue then she said come lets eat in my apartments it is more restful there when we had eaten i felt better but i was still not completely at ease what happened she asked at mernadin there was a great sea fight we won it that is good yes you took paphanaal you stormed it and took it who told you we stormed it i asked in astonishment why you dothe returning warriors we heard the news shortly before you came back there was no resistance in paphanaal i told her there were some women there and there were some children there and they were butchered by our troops some women and children always get harmed in the storming of a city said lolinda you must not blame yourself if we did not storm the city i repeated it was undefended there were no men there every one of the male inhabitants of paphanaal had sailed with the fleet we destroyed she shrugged evidently she could not visualise the true picture perhaps it was just as well but i could not resist one further comment and although we should have won anyway part of our sea victory was due to our treachery i said you were betrayed did you say she looked up eagerly some treachery of the eldren the eldren fought honourably we slaughtered their commander during a truce i see she said then she smiled well we must help you forget such terrible things erekosл i hope you can i said the king announced our betrothal the next day and the news was received with joy by the citizens of necranal we stood before them on the great balcony overlooking the city we smiled and waved but when we went inside again the king left us with a curt word and hurried away father really does seem to disapprove of our match lolinda said in puzzlement in spite of his consent a disagreement about tactics while at war i said you know how important we soldiers think these things he will soon forget but i was perturbed here i was a great hero loved by the people marrying the kings daughter as a hero should and something was beginning to strike me as being not quite right i had had the feeling for some time but i could not trace the source i did not know whether it was to do with my peculiar dreams my worries concerning my origin or merely the crisis that seemed to be building between the king and myself it was probably very little and my anxiety was baseless lolinda and i now went to the bridal bed together as was the custom in the human kingdoms but that first night we did not make love halfway through the night i felt my shoulder being touched and i straightened up almost instantly i smiled in relief oh it is you lolinda it is i erekosл you moaned and groaned so in your sleep that i thought it better to wake you aye i rubbed my eyes i thank you my memory was unclear but it seemed to me that i had been experiencing the usual dreams tell me something of ermizhad lolinda said suddenly ermizhad i yawned what of her you have seen much of her i heard you conversed with her i have never conversed with an eldren usually we do not take prisoners i smiled well i gather its heresy to say sobut i found her quitehuman oh erekosл thats a joke in bad taste they say shes beautiful they say she has a thousand human lives to account for shes evil is she not she had lured many men to their deaths i did not ask her about that i said we discussed matters of philosophy mainly she is very clever then i do not know she seemed almost innocent to me i added hastily diplomatically but perhaps thats her clevernessto seem innocent lolinda frowned innocent ha i was disturbed i only offer my impression lolinda i have no opinions really concerning ermizhad or the rest of the eldren for that matter do you love me erekosл of course you would notyou would notbetray me i laughed and took her in my arms how could you fear such a thing we fell again asleep next morning king rigenos count roldero and myself got down to the serious business of planning our strategy concerning ourselves with maps and battleplans it became less strained and rigenos was almost cheerful we were in unison about what should be done by now it was quite likely that arjavh would be attempting to retake paphanaaland assuredly failing probably he would lay siege to it but we could bring in supplies and weapons by ship and he would waste his time meanwhile our expedition to the ghost worlds would attack eldren positions there and roldero and rigenos assured me make it impossible for them to call on their halfling allies the plan of course depended on arjavhs attacking paphanaal but he would have been already on his way when when we sailed in rigenos reasoned it would be pointless for him to turn back what could he achieve by doing that roldero agreed i think its pretty certain that hell concentrate on paphanaal he said another two or three days and our fleets will be ready to sail again well soon have the outer islands subdued then we move on to loos ptokai itself with luck arjavh will still have his main force concentrated on paphanaal by the end of this year every eldren position will have fallen to us i was a trifle pessimistic about his overconfidence i would give that to katornhe would have been less sure i half wished in fact that katorn was here i respected his advice as a soldier and strategist and it was the next day while we still pored over maps that the news came it astonished us it altered every plan we had made it made nonsense of our strategy it put us in a frightening position arjavh prince of mernadin ruler of the eldren had not attacked paphanaal a great proportion of our troops waited there to greet him but he had not deigned to pay them a visit perhaps he had never intended to march on paphanaal perhaps he had always planned to do what he had done now and it was we who were the dupes outmanoeuvred fooled i said that the eldren were clever said king rigenos when we received the news i told you erekosл i believe you now i said softly trying to grasp the enormity of what had happened now how do you feel about them my friend roldero said are you still divided i shook my head my loyalties lay with humanity there was no time for conscience no point in trying to understand these unhuman people i had underestimated them and now it seemed that humanity itself might have to pay the price eldren ships had beached on the coasts of necralala on the eastern seaboard and reasonably close to necranal an eldren army was pushing towards necranal herself and it was said none could stand against it i cursed myself then rigenoskatornrolderoeven lolindahad all been right i had been deceived by their golden tongues their alien beauty and there was hardly a warrior in necranal half our available force was in paphanaal and it would take a month to bring them back the fleet eldren craft had probably crossed the ocean in half that time we thought we had defeated their fleet at paphanaal we had only defeated a fraction of it there was fear on all our faces as we made hasty contingency plans theres no point in recalling the troops in paphanaal at this stage i said by the time they got here the battle would have been decided send a fast messenger there roldero tell them what has happened and let katorn decide his own strategy tell him i trust him very well roldero nodded but our available warriors are scarce in number we can get a few divisions by sending fast to zavara there are troops at stalaco calodemia and some at dratarda perhaps they can reach us in a week then we have some men at shilaal and sinana but i hesitated to recommend their withdrawal i agree i said the ports must be defended at all costs who knows how many other fleets the eldren have i cursed if only we had had some means of gathering intelligence some spies thats idle talk roldero said who among our people could disguise himself as an eldren who would be able to stomach their company long enough for that matter rigenos said the only large force we have is at noonos well have to send for them and pray that noonos is not attacked in their absence he looked at me this is not your fault erekosл i sympathise with you we expected too much of you well i promised him you can expect more of me now king rigenos ill drive the eldren back rigenos scowled thoughtfully theres one thing we have to bargain with he said the eldren bitcharjavhs sister and then an idea began to dawn on me arjavhs sister we had thought that he must certainly march on paphanaal and he had not we had never expected him to invade necralala but he had arjavhs sister what of her i said could we not use her in this waytell arjavh that if he does not retreat we will slay her would he trust us that depends on how much he loves his sister eh king rigenos grinned his spirits rising yes try that anyway erekosл but do not go to him in weakness take all the divisions you can muster naturally i said i have a feeling that arjavh will not let sentiment stop him while there is a chance he can capture the capital king rigenos ignored this even i wondered about the truth of it particularly since i was beginning to think there might be something more to arjavhs decision king rigenos put his hand on my shoulder we have had our differences erekosл but now we are united go do battle with the hounds of evil win the battle kill arjavh this is your opportunity to strike the head from the monster that is the eldren and if battle seems impossibleuse his sister to buy time for us be brave erekosл be cunningbe strong i will try i said i will leave at once to rally the warriors at noonos ill take all available cavalry and leave a small force of infantry and artillery to defend the city do as you think fit erekosл i went back to our apartments and said farewell to lolinda she had been full of sorrow i did not call on ermizhad and tell her what we planned chapter eighteen prince arjavh i rode out in my proud armour at the head of my army my lance flaunted my banner of silver sword on a black field my horse pranced my stance was confident and i had five thousand knights at my back and no idea of the size of the eldren army we rode from noonos eastwards to where the eldren were said to be marching our idea was to cut them off before they reached necranal well before we met arjavhs forces we heard stories of their progress from fleeing villagers and townspeople apparently the eldren were marching doggedly for necranal avoiding any settlements they came to there were no reports so far of eldren atrocities they seemed to be moving too fast to bother to waste rime on civilians arjavh seemed to have only one ambitionto reach necranal in me shortest possible time i knew little of the eldren prince save that he was reputedly a monster incarnate a slayer and torturer of women and children i was impatient to meet him in battle and there was one other rumour concerning prince arjavhs army they said it was partly comprised of halflingscreatures from the ghost worlds this story had terrified my men but i had tried to assure diem that the rumours were false roldero and rigenos were not with me roldero had returned to supervise die defence of necranal should we be unsuccessful and it was in necranal that rigenos also stayed for the first time now i was on my own i had no advisors i felt i needed none the armies of the eldren and the forces of humanity saw each other at last when they both reached a vast plateau known as the plain of olas after an ancient city that had once stood there the plateau was surrounded by the peaks of distant hills it was green and the hills were purple and we saw the banners of the eldren as the sun set and those banners shone as if they were flags of fire my marshals and captains were all for rushing upon the eldren as soon as morning came to our relief it seemed that their numbers were smaller than ours and it now looked likely we could defeat them i felt relieved it meant that i did not need to use ermizhad for bartering with arjavh and i could afford to stand by the code of war which the humans used among themselves but refused to extend to the eldren my commanders were horrified when i told them but i said let us act well and with nobility let us set an example to them now mere was no katorn no rigenosnot even rolderoto argue with me and tell me that we must be treacherous and quick where eldren were concerned i wanted to fight this battle in the terms that erekosл understood for i was following erekosлs instincts now i watched our herald ride into die night under a flag of truce i watched him ride away and then on an impulse spurred after him my marshals called after me lord erekosлwhere do do you go to the eldren camp i called back and laughed at their consternation the herald turned in his saddle hearing the hoofbeats of my horse lord erekosл he said questioningly ride on heraldand ill ride with you and so together we came at last to the eldren camp and we stopped as the outer guards hailed us what would you here humans some lowranking officer asked peering with his blueflecked eyes through the gloom the moon came out and shone silver i took my banner from where it lay against my horses side i raised it and i shook it out the moon picked up the motif that is erekosлs banner said the officer and i am erekosл i said a look of disgust crossed the eldrens face we heard what you did at paphanaal if you were not here under the truce flag i would i did nothing at paphanaal i am ashamed of i said no you would not be ashamed my sword was sheathed during the whole stay at paphanaal eldren ayesheathed in the bodies of babes think what you will i said lead me to your master ill not waste time with you we rode through the silent camp until we came to the simple pavilion of prince arjavh the officer went inside then i heard a movement in the tent and from it stepped a lithe figure dressed in halfarmour a steel breastplate strapped over a loose shirt of green leather hose beneath leg greaves also of steel and sandles on his feet his long black hair was kept away from his eyes by a band of gold bearing a single great ruby and his facehis face was beautiful i hesitate to use the word to describe a man but it is the only one that will do justice j those fine features like ermizhad he had the tapering skull the slanting orbless eyes but his lips did not curve upwards as lid hers his mouth was grim and there were lines of weariness about it he passed his hand across his face and looked up at us i am prince arjavh of mernadin he said in his liquid voice what would you say to me erekosл you who abducted my sister i came personally to bring the traditional challenge from the hosts of humanity i said he raised his head to look about him some plot i gather some fresh treachery i speak only the truth i told him there was melancholy irony in his smile when he replied very well lord erekosл on behalf of the eldren i accept your gracious challenge we will battle then shall we we will kill each other tomorrow shall we you may decide when to begin i said for it is we who made the challenge he frowned it has been perhaps a million years since the eldren and humanity fought according to the code of war how can i trust you erekosл we have heard how you butchered the children i butchered no children i said quietly i begged that they be spared but at paphanaal i was advised by king rigenos and his marshals now i control the battle forces and i choose to fight according to the code of war the code of war i believe that i originally drew up aye arjavh said thoughtfully its sometimes called erekosлs code but you are not the true erekosл he was a mortal like all men only the eldren are immortal i am mortal in many respects i said shortly and immortal in others now shall we decide the terms of battle arjavh spread his arms oh how can i trust all this talk how many times have we agreed to believe you humans and have been betrayed time after time how can i accept that you erekosл the champion of humanity our ancient enemy whom even in our legends we respect as a noble foe i would believe you you who calls himself erekosл but i cannot afford to may i dismount i asked the herald glanced at me in astonishment if you wish i clambered from the back of my armoured horse and unbuckled my sword and hung it over the pommel of the saddle and i pushed the horse to one side and walked forward and stood there confronting prince arjavh face to face we are a stronger force than you i said we stand a good chance of winning the battle tomorrow it is possible that within a week even the few who escape the battle will be dead at the hands of our soldiers or our peasants i offer you the chance to fight a noble battle prince arjavh a fair battle i suggest that the terms can include the sparing of prisoners medical treatment for all captured wounded a counting of the dead and of the living i was remembering it all as i spoke you know erekosлs code well he said i should he looked away and up at the moon is my sister still alive she is why did you come thus with your herald to our camp curiosity i suppose i told him i have spoken much with ermizhad i wanted to see if you were the devil i heard you wereor the person ermizhad described and what do you see if you are a devil you are a weary one not too weary to fight he said not too weary to take necranal if i can we expected you to march on paphanaal i told him we thought it logical that you would try to recapture your main port ayethats what i planned until i learned that you had abducted my sister he paused how is she well i said she was placed under my protection and i have seen to it that she has been treated with courtesy wherever possible he nodded we come of course to rescue her he said i wondered if that was your reason i half smiled we should have expected it but we did not you realise that they will should you win tomorrows battle threaten to kill her if you do not retreat arjavh pursed his lips they will kill her anyway will they not they will torture them i know how they treat eldren prisoners i could say nothing to the contrary if they kill my sister prince arjavh said i will burn down necranal if i am the only one left to do it i will kill rigenos his daughter everyone and so it goes on i said softly arjavh looked back at me i am sorry you wished to discuss the terms of battle very well erekosл i will trust you i agree to all your proposalsand offer a term of my own that is deliverance of ermizhad from captivity if we should win it will save you and us many lives it would i agreed but it is not for me to make that bargain i regret it prince arjavh but it is the king who holds her if she were my prisoner and not just under my protection i would do as you suggest if you win you must go on to necranal and lay siege to the city he sighed very well sir champion we shall be ready at dawn tomorrow i said hurriedly we outnumber you prince arjavh you could go back nowin peace he shook his head let the battle be fought until dawn then prince of the eldren he moved his hand tiredly in assent farewell lord erekosл farewell i wheeled my horse and rode back to our camp in a sorrowful mood the puzzled herald at my side once again i was divided were the eldren so clever they could deceive me so easily tomorrow would tell that night in my own pavilion i slept as badly as ever but i accepted the dreams the vague memories and i did not attempt to fight them to interpret them it had become clear to me that there was no point to it i was what i wasi was the eternal championthe everlast wager of war i would never know why before dawn our trumpets warned us to awake and make ourselves ready i buckled on my armour my sword and my lances cover was ripped off to reveal the long metalshod spear i went out into the chill of the dying night the day was not yet with us silhouetted against what little light there was my cavalry were already mounting there was a cold clammy sweat on my forehead i wiped it with a rag time after time but it remained there i raised my helm and brought it down over my head strapping it to my shoulder plates my squires handed me my gauntlets and i pulled them on then stifflegged in my armour i stalked towards my steed was helped into the saddle was handed my shield and my lance and cantered up the line to the head of my troops it was very quiet when we began to movea steel sea lapping at the coast that was the eldren camp as the watery dawn broke our forces sighted each other the eldren were still by their camp but when they saw us they too began to move very slowly it seemed but implacably i lifted my visor to get a wider view of the surroundings the ground seemed good and dry there appeared to be no places with superior advantages the horses hooves thumped the turf the arms of the riders clattered at their sides their armour clashed and their harness creaked but in spite of this a silence seemed to fill the air nearer we came and nearer a flight of swallows flew high above us and then glided away towards the faroff hills i closed my visor the back of the horse jogged beneath me the cold sweat seemed to cover my body and clog my armour the lance and the shield seemed suddenly very heavy i smelled the stink of other sweating men and horses before long i would smell their blood too because of our need for speed we had brought no cannon the eldren also wishing to travel rapidly had no artillery either perhaps i thought their siege machines were following behind at a slower pace nearer now i could make out arjavhs banner and a little cluster of flags that were those of his commanders i planned to depend upon my cavalry they would spread out on two sides to surround the eldren while another arrowhead of horsemen pierced the centre of their ranks and pushed through to the rear so that we would surround them on all sides nearer still my stomach grumbled and i tasted bile in my mouth close i reined in my horse and raised my lance and gave the order for the archers to shoot we had no crossbows only longbows which had a greater range and penetrating power and could shoot many more arrows at a time the first flight of arrows screamed overhead and thudded down into the eldren ranks and then were almost instantly followed by another flight and then another our shafts were answered by the slim arrows of the eldren horses and men shrieked as the arrows found their marks and for a moment there was consternation among our men as their ranks became ragged but then with great discipline they reformed again i raised my lance on which fluttered my black and silver pennant cavalry advance at full gallop the trumpets sounded the order the air was savaged by the sound the knights spurred their warsteeds forward and began line upon line of them to fan out on two sides while another division rode straight towards the centre of the eldren host these knights were bent over the necks of their fastmoving horses lances leaning at an angle across their saddles some held under the right arm and aimed to the left and others secure under left arms aimed at the right their helmet plumes fluttered behind them as they bore down on the eldren their cloaks streamed out and their pennants waved and the dim sunlight gleamed on their armour i was almost deafened by the thunder of hooves as i kicked my charger into a gallop and with a band of fifty picked knights behind me they themselves surrounding the twin standards of humanity rode forward straining my eyes for arjavh whom at that moment i hated with a terrible hatred i hated him because i must fight this battle and possibly kill him with a fearful din made up of shouts and clashing metal we smashed into the eldren army and soon i was oblivious to all but the need to kill and defend my life against those who would kill me i broke my lance early on it smashed right through the armoured body of an eldren noble and split with the impetus i left it in him and drew my sword now i hewed about me with savage intensity seeking sight of arjavh at last i saw him a huge mace swinging from his gauntleted hand battering at the infantrymen who sought to pull him from his saddle arjavh he glimpsed me from the corner of his eye as i waited for him a moment erekosл i have work here arjavh the word i screamed was a challenge nothing else arjavh finished the last of the footsoldiers and he kicked his horse towards me still flailing around him with his giant mace as two mounted knights came at him then the men drew back as they saw we were about to engage we came close enough to fight now i aimed a mighty blow at him with my poisoned sword but he pulled aside in time and i felt his mace glance off my back as i leaned so far forward in my saddle after the wasted blow that my sword almost touched the churned ground i brought the sword up in an underarm swing and the mace was there to deflect it for several minutes we fought until in my astonishment i heard a voice some distance away rally the standard rally knights of humanity we had not succeeded in our tactics that was obvious from the cry our forces were attempting to consolidate and attack afresh arjavh smiled and lowered his mace they sought to surround the halflings he said and laughed aloud well meet again soon arjavh i shouted as i turned my horse back and spurred it through the press forcing my way through the milling embattled men towards the standard which swayed to my right there was no cowardice in my leaving and arjavh knew it i had to be with my men when they rallied that was why arjavh had lowered his weapon he had not sought to stop me chapter nineteen the battle decided arjavh had mentioned the halflings i had noticed no ghouls among his men what were they then what kind of creatures could not be surrounded the halflings were only part of my problem fresh tactics had to be decided upon hurriedly or the day would be soon lost four of my marshals were desperately trying to get our ranks closed as i came up to them the eldren enclosed us where we had planned to enclose them and many groups of our warriors were cut off from the main force above the noise of the battle i shouted to one of my marshals whats the position why did we fail so quickly we outnumber them its hard to tell what the position is lord erekosл the marshal answered or how we failed one moment we had surrounded the eldren and the next moment half their forces were surrounding usthey vanished and reappeared behind us even now we cannot tell which is material eldren and which halfling the man who answered me was count maybeda an experienced old warrior his voice was ragged and he was very much shaken what other qualities do these halfling possess i asked they are solid enough when fighting lord erekosл and they can be slain by ordinary weaponsbut they can disappear at will and be wherever they wish on the field it is impossible to plan tactics against such a foe in that case i decided we had best keep our men together and fight a defensive action i think we still outnumber the eldren and their ghostly allies let them come to us the morale of my warriors was low they were disconcerted and were finding it difficult to face the possibility of defeat when victory had seemed so certain through the milling men i saw the basilisk banner of the eldren approaching us their cavalry came in swiftly with prince arjavh at their head our forces came together again and once more i was doing battle with the eldren leader he knew the power of my swordknew that the touch of it could slay him if it fell on a break in his armourbut that deadly mace wielded with the dexterity with which another would wield a sword warded off every blow i aimed i fought him for halfanhour until he showed signs of dazed weariness and my own muscles ached horribly and again our forces had been split again it was impossible to see how the battle went for most of the time i was uncaring oblivious to the events around me as i concentrated on breaking through arjavhs splendid guard then i saw count maybeda ride swiftly past me his golden armour split his face and arms bloody in one red hand he carried the torn banner of humanity and his eyes stared in fear from his wounded head flee lord erekosл he screamed as he galloped past flee the day is lost i could not believe it until the ragged remnants of my warriors began to stream past me in ignominious flight rally humanity i called rally but they paid me no heed again arjavh dropped his mace to his side you are defeated he said reluctantly i lowered my sword you are a worthy foe prince arjavh you are a worthy foe erekosл i remember our battle terms go in peace necranal will need you i shook my head slowly and drew a heavy breath prepare to defend yourself prince arjavh i said he shrugged swiftly brought up the mace against the blow i aimed at him and brought it down suddenly upon my metalgauntleted wrist my whole arm went numb i tried to cling to the sword but my fingers would not respond it dropped from my hand and hung by a thong from my wrist with a curse i flung myself from my saddle straight at him my good hand grasping at him but he turned his horse aside and i fell face forward in the bloody mud of the field i attempted once to rise failed and lost consciousness chapter twenty a bargain who am i you are erekosл the eternal champion what is my real name whatever it happens to be why am i as i am because that is what you have always been what is always always will i ever know peace you will sometimes know peace for how long for a while where did i come from you have always been where will i go where you must for what purpose to fight to fight for what to fight for what fight for what i shivered aware that i was no longer clad in my armour i looked up arjavh stood over me i wonder why he hated me then he was murmuring to himself then he realised i was awake and his expression altered he gave a light smile youre a ferocious one sir champion i looked into his moody milky eyes my warriors i said what those that were left have fled we released the few prisoners we had and sent them after their comrades those were the terms i believe i struggled up then you are going to release me i suppose so although although you would be a useful bargaining prisoner i took his meaning and relaxed sinking back on to the hard bed i thought deeply and fought the idea which came to me but it grew too large in me at length i said almost against my will trade me for ermizhad his cool eyes showed surprise for an instant you would suggest that but ermizhad is such a strong hostage for humanity damn you eldren i told you to trade me for her youre a strange human my friend but with your permission granted that is what i shall do i thank you you really do remember the old code of war dont you i think you are who you say you are i closed my eyes my head ached he left the tent and i heard him instructing a messenger make sure the people know i shouted from the bed the king may not agree but the people will force his hand im their hero theyll willingly trade me for an eldrenno matter who that eldren is arjavh instructed the messenger accordingly he came back into the tent it puzzles me i said at length he was sitting on a bench on the other side of the tent it puzzles me that the eldren have not conquered humanity before now with those halfling warriors i should think youd be invincible he shook his head we rarely make use of our allies he said but i was desperate you can understand that i was prepared to go almost to any measures to rescue my sister i can i told him we would never have invaded he continued had it not been for her it was said so simply that i believed him i had already been fairly certain of that i took a deep breath it is hard for me i said i am forced to fight like this with no clear idea about the rights or the wrongs of that fighting with no true knowledge of this world with no opinions of those who inhabit it simple facts turn out to be liesand unbelievable things turn out to be true what are the halflings for instance again he smiled sorcerous ghouls he said that is what king rigenos told me it is no explanation what if i told you they were capable of breaking up their atomic structure at will and assembling again in another place you would not understand me sorcery you would say i was surprised at the scientific nature of his explanation i would understand you better i said slowly he raised his slanting eyebrows you are different he said well the halflings as you have seen are related to the eldren not all the dwellers on the ghost worlds are our kinsome are more closely related to men and there are other baser forms of life the ghost worlds are solid enough but exist in an alternate series of dimensions to our own on these worlds the halflings have no special powersno more than we havebut here they have we do not know why they do not know why on earth different laws seem to apply for them more than a million years ago we discovered a means of bridging the dimensions between earth and these other worlds we found a race akin to our own who will at times come to our aid if our need is especially great this was one of those times sometimes however the bridge ceases to exist when the ghost worlds move into another phase of their weird orbit so that any halflings on earth cannot return and any of our people are in the same position if they are on the ghost worlds therefore you will understand it is dangerous to stay on either side overlong is it possible i asked that the eldren came originally from these ghost worlds i suppose it is possible he answered there are no records though perhaps that is why the humans hate you as aliens i suggested that is not the reason he told me for the eldren occupied the earth for ages before humankind ever came to the planet what it is true he said i am an immortal and my grandfather was an immortal hex was slain during the first wars between the eldren and humanity when the humans came to earth they had incredible weapons of terrible destructive potential in those days we also used such weapons the wars created such destruction that the earth seemed like a blackened ball of mud when the wars were ended and the eldren defeated such was the destruction that we swore never again to use our weapons whether we were threatened with extermination or not we could not assume the responsibility for destroying an entire planet you mean you still have these weapons they are locked away yes and you have the knowledge to use them of course we are immortal we have many people who fought in those ancient wars some even built new weapons before our decision was made then why i have told you we swore not to what happened to the humans weaponsand their knowledge of them did they make the same decision no the human race degenerated for a while wars between themselves occurred at one time they almost wiped themselves out completely at another they were barbarians and at another they seemed to have matured at last to be at peace with their own souls and with one another during one of those stages they lost the knowledge and the remaining weapons in the last million years they have climbed back from absolute savagery the peaceful years were short a false lulland id predict theyll sink back again soon enough they seem bent on their own destruction as well as ours we have wondered if the humans who must surely exist on other planets than this are the same perhaps not i hope not i said how do you think the eldren will fare against the humans badly he said particularly since the humans are inspired by your leadership and the gateway to the ghost worlds is due soon to close again previously humanity was split by quarrels you see king rigenos could never get his marshals to agree and he was too uncertain of himself to make the large decisions but you have made decisions for him and you have united the marshals you will win i think you are a fatalist i said i am a realist he said could not peace terms be arranged he shook his head what use is it to talk he asked me bitterly you humans i pity you why will you always identify our motives with your own we do not seek poweronly peace peace but that i suppose this planet shall never have until humanity dies of old age i stayed with arjavh for a few more days before he released me on trust and i rode back towards necranal it was a long lonely ride and i had a great deal of time to think i was hardly recognised this time for i was dusty and my armour was battered and the people of necranal had become used to seeing beaten warriors returning to the city i reached the palace of ten thousand windows and a gloomy quiet had settled on it the king was not in the great hall and lolinda was not in her quarters in my old apartments i stripped off my armour when did the lady ermizhad leave i asked a slave leave master is she not still here what where in the same quarters surely i still had my breastplate on and i donned my sword as i strode through the corridors until i got to ermizhads apartments and brushed past the guard on the door ermizhadyou were to be traded for me those were the terms where is the king why has he not kept his word i knew nothing of this she said i did not know arjavh was so close otherwise i interrupted her come with me well find the king and get you on your journey back i half dragged her from room to room of the palace until at last i found the king in his private apartments he was in conference with roldero as i burst in upon them king rigenos what is the meaning of this my word was given to prince arjavh that ermizhad was to leave here freely upon my release he allowed me to leave his camp on trust and now i return to find the lady ermizhad still in captivity i demand that she be released immediately the king and roldero laughed at me come now erekosл said roldero who needs to keep his word to an eldren jackal now we have our war champion back and still retain our chief hostage forget it erekosл there is no need to regard the eldren as human ermizhad smiled do not worry erekosл i have other friends she closed her eyes and began to croon at first the words came softly but the volume rose until she was giving voice to a weird series of harmonies roldero jumped forward dragging out his sword sorcery i stepped between them out of the way erekosл the bitch invokes her demon kind i drew my own sword and held it warningly in front of me protecting ermizhad i had no idea what she was going but i was going to give her the chance now to do whatever she wanted her voice changed abruptly and then stopped then she cried brethren brethren of the ghosts worldsaid me chapter twentyone an oath quite suddenly there materialised in the chamber some dozen or so eldren their faces but slightly different from others i had seen i recognised them now as halflings there shouted rigenos evil sorcery she is a witch i told you a witch the halflings were silent they surrounded ermizhad until all their bodies touched hers and one anothers then ermizhad shouted away brethrenback to the camp of the eldren their forms began to flicker so that they seemed half in our dimension half in some other goodbye erekosл she cried i hope we shall meet in happier circumstances i hope so i shouted back and then she vanished traitor cursed king rigenos you aided her escape you should die by torture added roldero disgusted im no traitor as well you know i said evenly you are traitorstraitors to your wordsto the great tradition of your ancestors you have no case against me you stupidstupid i stopped turned on my heel and left the chamber you lost the battlewar champion screamed king rigenos after me as i stalked out the people do not respect defeat i went to find lolinda she had been walking in the balconies and had now returned to her apartments i kissed her needing at that moment a womans friendly sympathy but i seemed to meet a block she was not it seemed prepared to give me help although she kissed me dutifully a length i ceased to embrace her and stood back a little looking into her eyes whats wrong nothing she said should there be you are safe i had feared you dead was it me then was it i pushed the thought from me but can a man force himself to love a woman can he love two women at the same time i was desperately clinging to the strands of the love i had felt for her when first we met ermizhad is safe i blurted she called her halfling brothers to her aid and when she returns to the eldren camp arjavh will take his forces back to mernadin you should be pleased i am she said and then and you are pleased no doubt that our hostage escaped what do you mean my father told me how youd been enchanted by her wanton sorcery you seemed to be more anxious for her safety than ours that is foolish talk you seem to like the company of the eldren too holidaying with our greatest enemy stop all foolish talk is it i think my father spoke true erekosл her voice was subdued now she turned from me but lolinda i love you you alone i do not believe you erekosл what is it in me that i became what i became then it was the moment that i gave an oath that was to affect all our destinies why as my love for her began to fade and i saw her as a selfish grasping fool did i protest a greater love for her i do not know i only know that that is what i did i love you more than life lolinda i said i would do anything for you i do not believe you i do i will prove it i cried in agony she turned there was pain and reproach in her eyes there was a bitterness that went so deep it had no bottom there was anger and there was revenge how will you prove it erekosл she said softly i swear i shall kill all the eldren all every single eldren life you will spare none none none i want it to be over and the only way i can finish it is to kill them all then it will be overonly then including prince arjavh and his sister including them you swear this you swear it i swear it and when the last eldren dies when the whole world is ours then i will bring it to you and we shall be married she nodded very well erekosл i will see you later she glided swiftly from the room i unstrapped my sword and flung it savagely to the floor i spent the next few hours fighting my own agony of spirit but i had made the oath now soon i became cold i meant what i had said i would destroy all the eldren rid the world of them rid myself of this continual turmoil in my mind chapter twentytwo the reaving the less of a man i became the more of an automaton so the dreams and half memories ceased to plague me it was as if they had forced me into this mindless role that while i continued to be a creature without remorse or conscience they would reward me with their absence if i showed signs of being an ordinary human being they would punish me with their presence but that is a notion it is no nearer the truth i suppose than any other one might also argue that i was about to achieve the catharsis that would rid me of my ambivalence banish my nightmares in the month i spent preparing for the great war against the eldren i saw but little of my betrothed and finally ceased to seek her out but concentrated on the plans for the campaigns we intended to fight i developed the strictly controlled mind of the soldier i allowed no emotion whether it was love or hate to influence me i became strong and in my strength i became virtually inhuman i knew people remarked upon it but they also saw in me the qualities of a great battle leader and although all avoided my company socially they were glad that erekosл led them arjavh and his sister had gone back to their ships and in their ships sailed back to their own land now doubtless they awaited us readying themselves for the next battle we continued with our original plans and at length were ready to sail for the outer islands at worlds edge the gateway to the ghost worlds we intended to close that gate then we sailed it was a long and arduous sailing that one before we sighted the bleak cliffs of the outer islands and prepared ourselves for the invasion roldero was with me but it was a grim roldero a silent roldero who had made himself as i had into nothing but an instrument of war warily we sailed in but it seemed the eldren had known of our coming and had all but deserted their towns this time there were no women and no children there were naught but a few handfuls of eldren whom we slew and of halflings there were none arjavh had spoken the truth when he said the gates were closing to the ghost worlds we ripped the towns to rubble burning and pillaging as a matter of course but without lust we tortured captured eldren to discover the meaning for this desertion but secretly i knew the meaning our troops became possessed of a sense of anticlimax and although we left no building standing no eldren alive the men could not rid themselves of the notion that they had been thwarted in some wayas an ardent lover is thwarted by a coy maiden and because of the eldrens refusal to give them a mighty battle our soldiers grew to hate the eldren that much more when our work was done in the outer islands and every building was dust every eldren a corpse we sailed almost immediately for the continent of mernadin and put into paphanaal which was still held by our forces under the lord katorn but in the meantime king rigenos had joined them and was waiting for us to arrive we landed our troops and pushed outwards across the continent bent on victorious conquest i remember few incidents in detail the days merged one into the other and wherever we went we slew eldren it seemed that no eldren fortress could withstand our grim thrusting i was tireless in my murdering insatiable in my bloodlust humanity had wanted such a wolf as i and now they had him and they followed him though they feared him it was a year of fire and steel and mernadin seemed at times to be a sea of smoke and blood the troops were all physically weary but the spirit of slaughter was in them and that spirit gave them a terrible vitality a year of pain and death and everywhere that the banners of humanity met the standards of the eldren the basilisk standards were torn down and trampled we put all we found to the sword we mercilessly punished deserters in our own ranks we flogged our troops to greater endurance we were the horsemen of death king rigenos lord katorn count roldero and myself we grew as gaunt as hungry dogs and it seemed we fed on eldren flesh lapped at eldren blood fierce dogs we were wildeyed and panting dogs sharpfanged dogs for ever restless for the scent of freshspilled blood towns burned behind us cities fell and were crushed stone by stone to the ground eldren corpses littered the countryside and the fairest of our campfollowers were carrion birds and sleekcoated jackals a year of bloodshed a year of destruction if i could not force myself to love then i could force myself to hate and this i did all feared me humans and eldren alike as i turned beautiful mernadin into a funeral pyre on which i sought in my own terrible bewilderment and grief to burn my own dead humanity it was in the valley of kalaquita where stood the garden city of lakh that king rigenos was killed the city looked peaceful and deserted and we rode down upon it with little caution we howled one great concerted howl and instead of the disciplined army that had landed at paphanaal we were a horde in bloodencrusted armour and dustingrained flesh waving our weapons and galloping wildly upon the garden city of lakh it was a trap the eldren were in the hills and had used their beautiful city as bait silversnouted cannon suddenly shouted from surrounding spinneys and sent a searing shower of shot into our astonished soldiers midst slender arrows whistled in a wave of sharptipped terror as the hidden eldren archers took their vengeance with their bows horses fell men screamed we turned in confusion but then our own bowmen began to retaliate concentrating not on the enemy archers but on their cannoneers gradually the silver guns went silent and the archers melted back into the hills retreating back once again to one of their few remaining fortresses i turned to king rigenos who sat beside me on his big warsteed he was rigid staring up at the sky and then i saw then an arrow had pierced his thigh and imbedded itself in his saddle pinning him to his horse roldero i shouted get a doctor for the king if we have one roldero rode up from where he had been taking account of our dead he pushed back the kings visor and shrugged then he stared significantly at me he has not breathed for several minutes by the look of him nonsense an arrow in the thigh doesnt kill not normally at any rateand not so quickly get the doctor a peculiar smile crossed rolderos bleak features it was the shock i think that killed him then he laughed brutally and pushed at the armoured corpse with his hand so that it tilted over wrenching the arrow free and crashing into the mud your betrothed is queen now erekosл said roldero still laughing i congratulate you my horse stirred as i stared down at rigenoss corpse then i shrugged and turned my steed away it was our habit with the dead to leave them no matter whom they had been where they lay we took rigenoss horse with us it was a good horse the loss of the king did not disturb our warriors though katorn himself seemed a little perturbed perhaps because he had had such great influence over the monarch but the king had been a puppet of authority particularly in this last year for humanity followed a grimmer conqueror whom it regarded with awe dead erekosл they called methe vengeful sword of humanity i did not care what they called mereaver bloodletter berserkerfor my dreams no longer plagued me and my ultimate goal came closer and closer until it was the last fortress of the eldren left undefeated then i dragged my armies behind me as if by a rope i dragged them towards the principal city of mernadin by the plains of melting ice arjavhs capitalloos ptokai and at last we saw its looming towers silhouetted against a red evening sky of marble and black granite it rose mighty and seemingly invulnerable above us but i knew we should take it i had arjavhs word for it after all he had told me we should win the night after we had camped beneath the walls of loos ptokai i sprawled in my chair and could not sleep but stared into the darkness brooding this was not my habit normally i would now slump into my bed and snore till dawn wearied by the days killing but tonight i brooded and then at dawn the next day my features cold as stone i rode beneath my banner as i had ridden a year before into the camp of the eldren with my herald at my side we came close to the main gate of loos ptokai and then we slopped eldren looked down my herald raised his golden trumpet to his lips and blew an eerie blast upon it which echoed among the black and white towers of loos ptokai eldren prince i called in my dead voice arjavh or mernadin i have come to slay you then on the battlements over the great main gate i saw arjavh appear he looked down at me a sadness in his strange greetings old enemy he called you will have a long siege before you break this the last of our strength so be it i said but break it we shall arjavh paused then he said we once agreed to fight a battle according to the erekosian code of war do you wish to discuss terms again i shook my head we shall not stop until every eldren is slain i have sworn an oath to rid the earth of all your kind then said arjavh before the battle commences i invite you to enter loos ptokai as my guest and refresh yourself you seem in need of refreshment at this i bridled but then my herald sneered they become ingenuous in their defeat master if they think they can deceive you by such a simple trick but now my mind had suddenly become a battleground of conflicting emotions be silent i ordered the herald i took a deep breath well called arjavh i accept i said hollowly and then i added is the lady ermizhad therein she isand is eager to see you again there was an edge to arjavhs voice as he answered this last question for a moment i was again suspicious perhaps the herald was right arjavh loved his sister i knew perhaps arjavh was aware of my own buried affection for his sister that affection which i did not now admit but which of course secretly contributed to my decision to enter loos ptokai the herald said in astonishment my lord surely you cannot be serious once inside the gates you will be slain there were stories once that you and prince arjavh were not on unfriendly terms for enemies but after the havoc you have caused in mernadin he will kill you immediately who would not i shook my head i was in a new and quieter mood he will not i said i am sure of it and this way i can find an opportunity to judge the eldren strength it will be useful to us but disastrous for us if you should die i will not die i said and all the ferocity the hate the mad battleanger seemed to swell out of me leaving me as i turned away from the herald so he should not see with tears in my eyes open your gates prince arjavh i called in shaking tones i come to loos ptokai as your guest chapter twentythree in loos ptokai i rode my horse slowly into the city having left my sword and lance with the herald who was now in astonishment galloping back to our own camp to give the news to the marshals the streets of loos ptokai were silent as if in mourning as arjavh came down the steps from the battlements to greet me i saw now that he was closer that he too wore the expression which showed upon my own harsh features his step was not so lithe and his voice not quite so lilting as when we had first met a year before i dismounted he gripped my hand so he said in attempted gaiety the barbarian battlemonger is still material my people had begun to doubt it i suppose they hate me i said he seemed a little surprised the eldren cannot hate he said as he led me towards his palace i was shown by arjavh to a small room containing a bed a table and a chair of wonderful workmanship all slender and seemingly of precious metal but in fact of cunningly wrought wood in one corner was a sunken bath water steaming in it when arjavh had gone i stripped off my blood and dustencrusted armour and climbed out of the underclothes i had worn for much of the past year then i sank gratefully into the water since the initial emotional shock i had received when arjavh had issued his invitation my mind had become numbed but now for the first time in a year i relaxed mentally and physically washing all the grief and hatred from me as i washed my body i was almost cheerful as i donned the fresh clothes which had been laid out for me and when someone knocked at my door called lightly for them to enter greetings erekosл it was ermizhad my lady i bowed how are you faring erekosл in war as you know i am faring well and personally i feel better for your hospitality arjavh sent me to bring you to the meal i am ready but first tell me how you have fared ermizhad well enoughin health said she then she came closer to me involuntarily i leaned back slightly she looked at the ground and raised her hands to touch her throat and tell meare you now wed to queen lolinda we are still betrothed i told her deliberately then i looked into ermizhads eyes and added as levelly as i could we are to be married when when when loos ptokai is taken she said nothing i stepped forward so that we were separated by little more than an inch those are the only terms on which she will accept me i said i must destroy all the eldren your trampled banners will be my wedding gift to her ermizhad nodded and gave a queer sad and sardonic look that is your oath you swore you must abide by it you must slay every eldren every one i cleared my throat that is the oath come she said the meal grows cold at dinner ermizhad and i sat close together and arjavh spoke wittily of some of the stranger experiments of his scientist ancestors and for a little while we managed to drive away the knowledge of the forthcoming battle but later as ermizhad and i talked softly to one another i caught a look of pain in arjavhs eyes and for a moment he was quiet he broke into our conversation suddenly we are beaten as you know erekosл i did not want to speak of these things any more i shrugged and tried to continue the lighter talk with ermizhad but arjavh was insistent we are doomed erekosл to fall beneath the swords of your great army i drew a deep breath and looked him full in the face yes you are doomed prince arjavh it is a matter of time before you raze our loos ptokai this time i avoided his urgent gaze and merely nodded soyou he broke off i became impatient many emotions mingled in me my oath i reminded him i must do what i swore i would do arjavh i do not fear to lose my own life he began i know what you fear i told him could not the eldren admit defeat erekosл could they not acknowledge mankinds victory surely one city i swore an oath now sadness filled me but you cannot ermizhad gestured with her slim hand we are your friends erekosл we enjoy each others company wewe are friends we are of different races i said we are at war i am not asking for mercy arjavh said i know that i replied i do not doubt eldren courage i have seen too many examples of it you abide by an oath given in anger offered to an abstraction that leads you to slay those you love and respect ermizhads voice was puzzled are you not tired of killing erekosл i am very tired of killing i told her then but i began this thing i continued sometimes i wonder if i really do lead my menof if they push me ahead of them perhaps i am wholly their creation the creation of the will of humanity perhaps i am a kind of patchwork hero that they have manufactured perhaps i have no other existence and when my work is done i will fade as their sense of danger fades i think not said arjavh soberly i shrugged you are not me you have not had my strange dreams you still have those dreams ermizhad asked not recently since i began this campaign they have gone away they only plague me when i attempt to assert my own individuality when i do what is required of me they leave me in peace i am a ghost you see nothing more arjavh sighed i do not understand this i think you are suffering from selfpity erekosл you could assert your own willbut you are afraid to instead you abandon yourself to hate and bloodshed to this peculiar melancholia of yours you are depressed because you are not doing what you really desire to do the dreams will come again erekosл mark my wordsthe dreams will come again and they will be more terrible than any you have experienced before stop i shouted do not spoil this last meeting of ours i came here because because arjavh raised a slim eyebrow because i needed some civilised company to see your own kind ermizhad said softly i turned on her rising from the table you are not my own kind my race is out therebeyond those wallswaiting to vanquish you we are kin in spirit arjavh said our bonds are finer and stronger than bonds of blood my face twisted and i buried it in my hands no arjavh put a hand on my shoulder you are more substantial than you will allow yourself to be erekosл it would take a great deal of a particular kind of courage if you would pursue the implications of another course of action i let my hands fall to myself you are right i told him and i do not have that courage i am just a sword a force like a whirlwind there is nothing else to menothing i would allow nothing i am allowed ermizhad interrupted fiercely for your own sake you must allow that other self to rule forget your oath to lolinda you do not love her you have nothing in common with the bloodthirsty rabble that follows you you are a greater man than any you leadgreater than any you fight stop it she is right erekosл arjavh said it is not for our lives that we argue it is for your spirit i slumped down into my seat i sought to avoid confusion i said by taking a simple course of action you are right that i feel no kinship with those i leador those who thrust me before thembut undeniably they are my kin my duty let them fare how they will ermizhad said your duty is not to them it is to yourself i sipped some wine then i said quietly i am afraid arjavh shook his head you are brave it is not your fault who knows i said perhaps i committed some enormous crime at some stage now i am paying the price that is a selfpitying sort of speculation arjavh reminded me it is notit is notmanly erekosл i inhaled deeply i suppose not then i looked at him but if time is cyclicin some form at leastit could be that i have not yet committed that crime it is idle to speak of crime in this way ermizhad said impatiently what does your heart tell you to do my heart i have not listened to it for many months listen to it now she said i shook my head i have forgotten how to listen to it ermizhad i must finish what i set out to do what i was called here to do are you sure it was king rigenos who called you who else arjavh smiled this too is idle speculation you must do what you must do erekosл i will plead for my people no longer thank you for that i said i rose staggered slightly and screwed up my eyes gods i am so weary rest here tonight ermizhad said quietly rest with me i looked at her with me she said arjavh began to speak changed his mind and left the room i realised then that i wanted nothing else but to do as ermizhad suggested but i shook my head it would be weakness no she said it would give you strength it would enable you to make a clearer decision i have made my decision besides my oath to lolinda you swore an oath of faithfulness i spread my hands i cannot remember she moved towards me and stroked my face perhaps it would end something she suggested perhaps it would restore your love for lolinda now physical pain seemed to seize me i even wondered for a moment if they had poisoned me no it would help she said i know it would help how i am not sure i do not even know if it suit my own desires but i cannot weaken now ermizhad erekosл it would not be weakness still she turned away from me and said in a soft strange tone then rest here anyway sleep in a good bed so that you will be fit for tomorrows fighting i love you erekosл i love you more than i love anything i will aid you in whatever course of action you decide upon i have already decided i reminded her and you cannot aid me there i felt dizzy i did not want to return to my own camp in that condition for they would be sure i had been drugged and would lose all confidence in me better to stay the night and greet my troops refreshed very well i will stay here tonight i said alone as you wish erekosл she moved towards the door a servant will come to show you were to sleep ill sleep in this room i told her have someone bring in a bed as you wish it will be good to sleep in a real bed i said my thoughts will be sharper in the morning i hope so good night erekosл had they known that the dreams would return that night was i the victim of immense and subtle cunning such as only the unhuman eldren possessed i lay on my bed in the eldren fortress city and i dreamed but this was not a dream in which i sought to discover my true name i had no name in this dream i did not want a name i watched the world turning and i saw its inhabitants running about its surface like ants in a hill like beetles in a dung heap i saw them fighting and destroying making peace and buildingonly to drag those buildings down again in another inevitable war and it seemed to me that these creatures had evolved only so far from the beast state and that some quirk of destiny had doomed them to repeat over and over again the same mistakes and i realised that there was no hope for them these imperfect creatures that were halfway from the animals halfway from the godsthat it was their fate like mine to struggle for ever and for ever fail to be fulfilled the paradoxes that existed in me existed in the whole race the problems for which i could find no solution in fact had no solution there was no point in seeking an answer one could only accept what existed or else reject it as one pleased it would always be the same oh there was much to love them for and nothing at all to hate them for how could they be hated when their errors resulted from the quirk of fate that had made them the halfcreatures that they werehalfblind halfdeaf halfdumb i woke up and felt very calm and then gradually a sense of terror possessed me as the implications of my thoughts began to dawn on me had the eldren sent this dreamwith their sorcery i did not think so this dream was the dream that the other dreams had sought to hide from me i was sure of it this was the stark truth and the stark truth horrified me it was not my fate to wage eternal warit was the fate of my entire race as part of that raceas its representative in facti too must wage eternal war and that is what i wished to avoid i could not bear the thought of fighting for ever wherever i was required and yet whatever i did to try to end the cycle would be hopeless there was only one thing i could do i buried the thought but what else try for peace see if it would work let the eldren live arjavh had expressed impatience with idle speculation but this too was idle speculation the human race was sworn to destroy the eldren this done of course it would then turn upon itself and begin the perpetual squabbling the constant warring that its peculiar destiny decreed for it and yetshould i not at least attempt to make the compromise or should i continue with my original ambition destroy the eldren let the race resume its fratricidal sport in a way it seemed to me that while some eldren lived the race might hold together if the common enemy remained at least some sort of unity would exist in the human kingdoms it seemed critical to me then that some eldren be sparedfor the sake of humanity i suddenly realised that there was no conflict in my loyalties all what i had thought was contradictory was in fact two halves of a whole the dream had merely helped me unite them and see everything clearly perhaps this was a complex piece of rationalisation i shall never know i feel that i was right though it is possible that subsequent events proved me wrong at least i tried i sat up in my bed as a servant came in with water for me to wash and my own clothes freshly laundered i washed dressed myself and when a knock came at the door i called out for the person to enter it was ermizhad she brought me my breakfast and set it on the table i thanked her and she looked at me oddly you seem to have changed since last night she said you seem more at one with yourself i think i am i told her as i ate i had another dream last night was it as terrifying as the others more terrifying in certain aspects i said but it did not raise problems this time it offered me a solution you feel you can fight better if you like i think it would be in the interests of my race if we made peace with the eldren or at least declared a permanent truce you have realised at last that we offer you no danger on the contrary it is the very danger you offer that makes your survival necessary to my race i smiled remembering an old aphorism from somewhere if you did not exist it would be necessary to invent you a look of intelligence brightened her face she smiled too i think i understand you therefore i intend to present this conclusion to queen lolinda i said i hope to persuade her that it is in our interest to end this war against the eldren and your terms i see no need to make terms with you i said we will merely stop fighting and go away she laughed will it be so easy i looked squarely at her deliberated for a moment and then i shook my head perhaps not but i must try you have become very rational suddenly erekosл i am glad your sleep here did do you some good then and the eldren too perhaps she smiled again perhaps i will return to necranal as soon as possible and speak with lolinda and if she agrees you will marry her i felt weak then at last i said i must do that everything would be negated if i did not you understand entirely she said and there were tears in her eyes as she smiled arjavh came in a few minutes later and i told him what i intended to do he received the news rather more sceptically than ermizhad you do not think i mean what i say i asked him he shrugged i believe you completely erekosл but i do not think the eldren will survive what is it some disease something in you that he laughed shortly no no i think you will propose a truce and that the people will not let you make it your race will only be satisfied when every eldren has perished you said that it is their destiny always to fight could it not be that secretly they resent the eldren because the presence of the eldren means that they cannot go about their normal activitiesi mean by that their fighting among themselves could this not be nothing more than a pause while they wipe us out and if they do not wipe us out now they will do it very soon whether you lead them or no still i must try i said try by all means but theyll hold you to your vow im sure lolinda is intelligent if she listens to my arguments she is one of them i doubt if she will listen intelligence has little to do with it last night when i pleaded with you i was not myselfi panicked i know really that there can be no peace i must try i hope you succeed perhaps i had been beguiled by the charms of the eldren but i did not think so i would do my best to bring peace to the wasted land of mernadin though it meant i could never see my eldren friends againnever see ermizhad i put the thought from my head and resolved to dwell upon it no longer then a servant entered the room my herald accompanied by several marshals including count roldero had presented himself outside the gates of loos ptokai half certain that i had been murdered by the eldren only sight of you will reassure them arjavh murmured i agreed and left the room i heard the herald calling as i approached the city wall we fear that you have been guilty of great treachery let us see our masteror his corpse he paused then we shall know what to do arjavh and i mounted the steps to the battlements and i saw relief in the heralds eyes as he noted i was unharmed i have been talking with prince arjavh i said and i have been thinking deeply our men are weary beyond endurance and the eldren are now only a few with just this city in their possession we could take loos ptokai but i see no point to it let us be generous victors my marshals let us declare a truce a truce lord erekosл count rolderos eyes widened would you rob us of our ultimate prize our final fierce fulfilment our greatest triumph peace yes i said peace now go back tell our warriors i am safe we can take this city easily erekosл roldero shouted theres no need to talk of peace we can destroy the eldren once and for all have you succumbed to their cursed enchantments again have they beguiled you once more with their smooth words no i said it was i who suggested it roldero swung his horse around in disgust peace he spat as he and his comrades headed back to the camp our champions gone mad arjavh rubbed his lips with his finger already i see there is trouble they fear me i told him and theyll obey me theyll obey mefor a while at least let us hope so he said chapter twentyfour the parting this time there were no cheering crowds in necranal to welcome me for news of my mission had gone ahead of me the people could hardly believe it but where they did believe it they disapproved i had shown weakness in their eyes i had not seen lolinda of course since she had become queen she had a haughty look now as she strode about her throne room awaiting me privately i was a little amused i felt like the man who as an old rejected suitor returns to see the object of his passion married and become a shrew i was therefore somewhat relieved it was a small relief well erekosл she said i know why you are herewhy you have forsaken your troops gone against your word to me that you would destroy every eldren katorn has told me katorn is here he came here as soon as he heard your pronouncement from the battlements of loos ptokai where you stood with your eldren friends lolinda i said urgently i am convinced that the eldren are weary of war that they never intended to threaten the two continents at all they want only peace peace we shall have when the eldren race is perished lolinda if you love me you will listen to me at least what if i love you and what of the lord erekosл does he still love his queen i opened my mouth but i could not speak and suddenly there were tears in her eyes oh erekosл her tone softened can it be true no i said thickly i still love you lolinda we are to be married but she knew she had suspected but now she knew however if peace could result from my action i was still prepared to pretend to lie to declare my passion for her to marry her i still want to marry you lolinda i said no she said no you do not i will i said desperately if peace with the eldren comes about again her wide eyes blazed you insult me my lord not on those terms erekosл never you are guilty of high treason against us the people already speak of you as a traitor but i conquered a continent for them i took mernadin all but loos ptokaiwhere your wanton eldren bitch waits for you lolinda that is not true but it was true you are unfair i began and you are a traitor guards as if they had been prepared for this a dozen of the imperial guards rushed in led by their captain lord katorn there was a hint of triumph in his eyes and then at once i knew why he had always hated me he desired lolinda then i knew that whether i drew my sword or not he would slay me where i stood so i drew my sword the sword kanajana it glowed and the glow was reflected in katorns black eyes take him katorn cried lolinda and her voice was a scream of agony i had betrayed her i had failed to be the strength she needed so desperately take him alive or dead he is a traitor to his kind i was a traitor to her that was what she really meant that was why i must die but i still hoped to save something it is untrue i began but katorn was already cautiously advancing his men spreading out behind him i backed to a wall near a window the throne room was on the first storey of the palace outside were the private gardens of the queen think lolinda i said retract your command you are driven by jealousy im no traitor slay him katorn but i slew katorn as he came rushing at me my sword flicked across his writhing hatefilled face he screamed staggered his hands rushed up to his head and then he toppled in his golden armour toppled and fell with a crash to the flagstones he was the first human i was to slay the other guards came on but more warily i fought off their blades slew a couple more drove the others back glimpsed queen lolinda watching me her eyes full of tears and leapt to the sill of the window goodbye queen you have lost your champion now i jumped i landed in a rosebush that ripped at my skin broke free and ran hastily towards the gate of the garden the guards behind me i tore the gate open and rushed down the hill and into the twisting streets of necranal with the guards in pursuit their ranks joined by a howling pack of citizens who had no idea why i was wanted or even who i was they chased me for the sheer pleasure of the hunt so it was thus that things turned lolindas pain and jealousy had clouded her mind and soon her decision would be the cause of more bloodshed than even she had demanded but now i ran blindly at first and then towards the river my crew i hoped were still loyal to me if they were then there was a faint chance of escape i gained the ship just before my pursuers i leaped aboard screaming prepare to sail only half the crew was aboard the rest was on shore in the taverns but those remaining hurriedly shipped out the oars while we held the guards and the citizens at bay then we shoved off and began our hasty flight down the droonaa river it was some time before they managed to commandeer a ship for pursuit and by that time we were safely outdistancing them my crew asked no questions they were used to my silences my actions which sometimes seemed peculiar but a week after we were on course over the sea bound for mernadin i told them briefly that i was now an outlaw why lord erekosл asked my captain it seems unjust it is unjust i think call it the queens malice i suspect katorn spoke against me making her hate me they were satisfied with the explanation and when we put in at a small cove near the plains of melting ice i bade them farewell mounted my horse and rode swiftly for loos ptokai knowing not what i should do when i got there knowing only that i must let arjavh have the information concerning the turn events had taken we had been right humanity would not let me show mercy my crew bid me farewell with a certain amount of affection they did not knowand neither did ithat they were soon to be killed because of me now i crept into loos ptokai i sneaked through the great siege camp that we had constructed there and at night entered the city of the eldren arjavh rose from his bed when he heard i had returned well erekosл he looked searchingly at me then he said you were not successful were you you have been riding hard and you have been fighting what happened i told him he sighed well our advice was foolish now you will die when we die i would rather that i think i said two months passed two ominous months in loos ptokai humanity did not attack the city immediately and it soon emerged that they were awaiting orders from queen lolinda she it appeared had refused to make a decision the inaction was oppressive in itself i fretted often at the battlements looking out over the great camp and wishing that the thing would start and be finished only ermizhad eased my unhappiness we openly acknowledged our love now and because i loved her i began to want to save her i wanted to save her and i wanted to save myself and i wanted to save all the eldren in loos ptokai for i wanted to stay with ermizhad for ever i did not want to be destroyed desperately i tried to think of ways in which we could defeat that great force but every plan i made was a wild one and could not work and then one day i remembered i remembered a conversation i had had with arjavh on the plateau after he had defeated me in battle i went looking for him and found him in his study he was reading erekosл are they beginning their attack no arjavh but i remember you told me once about some ancient weapons your race once hadthat you still have what the old terrible weapons i said the ones you swore never to use again because they could destroy so much he shook his head not those use them this once arjavh i begged him make a show of strength that is all they will be ready to discuss peace then he closed his book no they will never discuss peace with us they would rather die anyway i do not think that even this situation merits the breaking of that old vow arjavh i said i respect the reasons for refusing to use the weapons but i have grown to love the eldren i have already broken one vow let me break anotherfor you he still shook his head just agree to this then i said if the time comes when i feel we could use them will you let me decidetake the decision out of your hands make it my responsibility he looked searchingly at me the orbless eyes seemed to pierce me perhaps he said arjavhwill you we eldren have never been motivated by the same amount of selfinterest such as you humans havenot to the extent of destroying another race erekosл do not confuse our values with those of mankind i am not i replied that is my reason for asking you this i could not bear to see your noble race perish at the hands of such beasts as those beyond our walls arjavh stood up and replaced the book in the shelves lolinda spoke the truth he said quietly you are a traitor to your own race race is a meaningless term it was you and ermizhad who told me to be an individual i have chosen my loyalties he pursed his lips well i seek only to stop them continuing in their folly i said he clenched his thin pale hands together arjavh i ask you because of the love i have for ermizhad and the love she has for me because of the great friendship you have given me for all the eldren left alive i beg you to let me take the decision if it becomes necessary for ermizhad he raised his slanting eyebrows for you for me for my people not for revenge no i said quietly i do not think so very well i leave the decision to you i suppose that is fair i do not want to die but rememberdo not act as unwisely as others of your kind i will not i promised i think i kept my promise chapter twentyfive the attack and the days continued to pass until they began to get chill and it was plain that winter was coming if winter arrived we would be safe until spring for the invaders would be fools to attempt a heavy siege in winter they realised this too it seemed lolinda must have come to a decision she gave them permission to attack loos ptokai after much bickering among themselves i learned the marshals elected one of themselves the most experienced to act as their war champion they elected count roldero the siege commenced in earnest their massive siege engines were brought forward including the giant cannon known as the firedrakes great black things of iron decorated with fierce reliefs roldero rode up and his herald announced his presence and i went to speak with him from the battlements greetings erekosл the traitor he called we have decided to punish youand all the eldren within these walls we would have slaughtered the eldren cleanly but now we intend to put to slow death all those we capture i was saddened roldero roldero i begged we were friends once you were perhaps the only true friend i had we drank together and fought together made jokes together we were comrades roldero good comrades his horse fidgeted beneath him pawing at the earth that was an age ago he said without looking up at me an age ago little more than a year roldero but we are not those two friends any longer erekosл he looked up shielding his eyes with a gauntletted hand i saw that his face had grown old and it bore many new scars doubtless i looked as different in my own way we are different men roldero said and wrenching at his reins drove his horse away digging his long spurs savagely into its flanks now there was nothing we could do but fight the firedrakes boomed and their solid shot slammed against the walls blazing fireballs from captured eldren artillery screamed over the walls and into the streets these were followed by thousands of arrows that came in a black shower and then a million men rushed against our handful of defenders we replied with what cannon we had but we relied mainly on archers to meet that first wave for we were short of shot and we repelled them after ten hours of fighting they fell back then next day and the day after they continued to attack but loos ptokai the ancient capital of mernadin loos ptokai held firm during those first days battalion upon battalion of yelling warriors mounted the siege towers and we again replied with arrows with molten metal and economically with the firespewing cannon of the eldren we fought bravely arjavh and i leading the defenders and whenever they sighted me the warriors of humanity screamed for vengeance and died striving for the privilege of slaying me we fought side by side like brothers arjavh and i but our eldren warriors were tiring and after a week of constant barrage we began to realise that we could not much longer hold back that tide of steel that night we sat together after ermizhad had gone to bed we massaged our aching muscles and we spoke little then i said we shall all be dead soon arjavh you and i ermizhad the rest of your folk he continued to dig his fingers into his shoulder kneading it to loosen it yes he said soon i wanted him to raise the subject that was on the tip of my tongue but he would not the next day scenting our defeat the warriors of humanity came at us with greater vigour than ever the firedrakes were brought in closer and began steadily to bombard the main gates i saw roldero mounted on his great black horse directing the operation and there was something about his stance that made e realise that he was sure he would break our defences that i turned to arjavh who stood beside me on the wall and i was about to speak when several of the firedrakes boomed in unison the black metal shook the shot screamed from their snouts hit the main gates which were of metal and split the left one down the middle it did not fall but it was so badly weakened that one more cannonade would bring it completely down arjavh i yelled we must break out the old weapons we must arm the eldren his face was pale but he shook his head arjavh we must another hour and well be driven off these battlements another three and well be overwhelmed entirely he looked to where roldero was directing the cannoneers and this time he did not remonstrate he nodded very well i agreed that you would decide come he led me down the steps i only hoped he had not overestimated their power arjavh led me to the vaults that lay at the core of the city we moved along bare corridors of polished black marble lighted by small bulbs which burned with a greenish light we came to a door of dark metal and he pressed a stud beside it the door moved open and we entered an elevator which bore us yet further downwards i was again astonished at the eldren they had deliberately given up all these marvels because of some strange sense of justice then we stepped into a great hall full of weirdly wrought machines that looked as if they had just been manufactured they stretched for nearly half a mile ahead of us these are the weapons said arjavh hollowly around the high walls were arranged handguns of various kinds rifles and things that looked to john bakers eye like antitank weapons of some sort there were squad machines on caterpillar treads that really did look like ultrastreamlined tanks with glass cabins and couches for a single man to lie flat upon and operate the controls i was surprised that there were no flying machines of any kindor none that i recognised as such i mentioned this to arjavh flying machines it would be interesting if such things could be invented but i do not think it is possible we have never in all our history been able to develop a machine that will safely stay in the air for any length of time i was amazed at this strange gap in their technology but i commented on it no further now you have seen these fierce things he said do you still feel you should use them but he doubtless thought such things were not familiar to me they were not so very different in general appearance to the war machines john daker knew and in my dreams i had seen much stranger weapons let us ready them i said to him we returned to the surface and there instructed our warriors to bring the weapons up roldero had smashed in one of our gates now and we had had to bring up cannon to defend it but the warriors of humanity were beginning to press in and some handtohand fighting was going on at the approach to the gates night was beginning to fall i hoped that in spite of their gain the human army would fall back at dark and give us the time we needed through the gap in the gate i saw roldero urging his men in doubtless he hoped to consolidate his advantage before nightfall i ordered more men to the breach already i was beginning to doubt my own decision perhaps arjavh was right and it was criminal to let the power of the ancient weapons loose but then i thought what does it matter better destroy them and half the planet than let them destroy the beauty that was the eldren i was forced to smile at this reaction in myself arjavh would not have approved of it it was alien to him such a thought i saw roldero bring in more men to counter our forces and i swung into the saddle of a nearby horse spurring it towards the crucial breach i drew my poison sword kanajana and i voiced my battlecrythe battlecry that only a short while ago had urged the warriors i attacked into war they heard it and as i suspected were disconcerted i leapt my horse over the heads of my own men and confronted roldero he looked at me in astonishment and pulled his horse up short would you fight roldero i asked he shrugged aye ill fight you traitor and he rushed at me with his reins looped over his arm and both hands around the hilt of his great sword it whistled over my head as i ducked everywhere about us beneath the broken walls of loos ptokai human and eldren fought desperately in the fading light roldero was tired more tired than i was but he battled valiantly on and i could not get through his guard his sword caught me a blow on my helmet and i reeled and struck back and caught him on the helmet my helmet stayed on but his was half pulled off he wrenched it off all the way and flung it aside his hair had turned completely white since i had last seen him bareheaded his face was flushed and his eyes bright his lips drawn back over his teeth he tried to stab his sword through my visor but i ducked under the blow and he fell forward in his saddle and i brought up my sword and drove it down into his breastbone he groaned and then his face lost all its anger and he gasped now we can be friends again erekosл and he died i looked down at him as he collapsed over the neck of his sword i remembered his kindness the wine he had brought me to help me sleep the advice he had tried to give me and i remembered him pushing the dead king from his saddle yet count roldero was a good man a good man forced by history to do evil his black horse turned and began to canter back towards the counts distant pavilion i raised my sword in salute and then shouted to the humans who fought on look warriors of humanity look your war champion is defeated the sun was setting the warriors began to withdraw looking at me in hatred as i laughed at them but not daring to attack me while the bloody sword kanajana was in my hand one of them did call back however we are not leaderless erekosл if that is what you think we have the queen to send us into battle she has come to be witness of your destruction tomorrow lolinda was with the besiegers i thought swiftly and then yelled tell your mistress to come tomorrow to our walls come at dawn to parley through the night we worked to reinforce the gate and to position the newfound weapons they were raised wherever they would fit and the eldren soldiers were armed with the handweapons i wondered if lolinda would get the message and if she did get it whether she would deign to come she came she came with her remaining marshals in all their proud panoply of war that panoply seemed so insignificant now against the power of the ancient eldren weapons we had set one of the new cannon pointing up at the sky so that we could demonstrate its fearful potential lolindas voice drifted up to us greetings eldrenand greetings to your human pet is he a welltrained pet now greetings lolinda i said showing my face you begin to show your fathers penchant for poor insults lets waste no further time i am already wasting time she said we are going to destroy you all today perhaps not i said for we offer you a truceand peace lolinda laughed aloud you offer us peace traitor you should be begging for peacethough youll get none i warn you lolinda i shouted desperately i warn you all we have fresh weapons weapons which once came near to destroying this whole earth watch i gave the order to fire the giant cannon an eldren warrior depressed a stud on the controls there came a humming from the cannon and all at once a tremendous blinding bolt of golden energy gouted from its snout the heat alone blistered our skins and we fell back shielding our eyes horses shrieked and reared the marshals faces were grey and their mouths gaped they fought to control their mounts only lolinda sat firmly in her saddle apparently calm that is what we offer you if you will not have peace i shouted we have a dozen like it and there are others that are different but as powerful and we have handcannon which can kill a hundred men at a sweep what say you now lolinda raised her face and stared directly up at me we fight she said lolinda i pleaded for our old lovefor your own sake do not fight we will not harm you you can go home all of you and live in security for the rest of your lives i mean it security she laughed bitterly security while such weapons as these exist you must believe me lolinda no she said humanity will fight to the end and because the good one favours us doubtless we will win we are pledged to wage war on sorcery and there was never greater sorcery than what we have seen today it is not sorcery it is science it is only like your cannon but more powerful sorcery everyone was murmuring it now they were like primitives these fools if we continue to fight i said it will be a fight to the finish the eldren would prefer to let you go once this battle is won but if we win i intend to clean the planet of your kind just as you swore you would do to the eldren take the chance a peace be sane we will die by sorcery she said if we have to but we will die fighting it i was too weary to continue then let us finish it i told her lolinda wheeled her horse away and with her marshals in her wake galloped back to order the attack i did not see lolinda perish there were so many that perished that day they came and we met them they were helpless against our weapons energy spouted from the guns and seared into their ranks we all felt pain as we fired the howling waves of force which swept across them and destroyed them turning proud men and beasts to blackened rubble we did as they had predicted we would do we destroyed them all i pitied them as they came on the cream of humanitys menfolk it took an hour to destroy a million warriors one hour when the extermination was over i was filled with a strange emotion which i could not then and cannot now define it was a mixture of grief relief and triumph i mourned for lolinda she was somewhere there in the heap of blackened bone and smouldering flesh one piece of ruined meat among many her beauty gone in the same instant as her life at least i thought that might be something and it was then that i made my final decision or did i indeed make it at all was it not what i had been meant to do or was it the crime i had mentioned earlier was this the crime i committed that doomed me to be what i was was i right in spite of arjavhs constant antagonism to my plan i ordered the machines out of loos ptokai and mounted in one of them ordered them overland this is what i did two months before i had been responsible for winning the cities of mernadin for humanity now i reclaimed them in the name of the eldren i reclaimed them in a terrible way i destroyed every human being occupying them a week and we were at paphanaal where the fleets of mankind lay at anchor in the great harbour i destroyed those fleets as i destroyed the garrisonmen women and children perished none were spared and then for many of the machines were amphibious i led the eldren across the sea to the two continents though arjavh and ermizhad were not with me these cities fellnoonos of the jewelstudded towers fell tarkar fell the wondrous cities of the wheatlands stalaco calodemia mooros and ninadoon all fell wedma shilaal sinaan and others fell crumbling in an inferno of gouting energy they fell in a few hours in necranal the pastelcoloured city of the mountain five million citizens died and all that was left of necranal was the scorched smoking mountain itself but i was thorough not merely the great cities were destroyed villages were destroyed hamlets were destroyed towns and farms were destroyed i found some people hiding in caves the caves were destroyed i destroyed forests where they might flee i destroyed stones that they might creep under i would doubtless have destroyed every blade of grass if arjavh had not come hurrying over the ocean to stop me he was horrified at what i had done he begged me to stop i stopped there was no more killing to do we made our way back to the coast and we paused to look at the smouldering mountainside that had been necranal for one womans wrath said prince arjavh and anothers love you did this i shrugged i do not know i think i did it for the only kind of peace that will last i know my race too well this earth would have been for ever rent by strife of some kind i had to decide who best deserved to live if they had destroyed the eldren they would have soon turned on each other as you know and they fight for such empty things too for power over their fellows for a bauble for an extra acre of land that they will not till for possession of a woman who doesnt want them you speak in the present tense arjavh said quietly really erekosл i do not think you know yet what you have done i sighed but it is done i said yes he murmured he gripped my arm come friend back to mernadin leave this stink behind ermizhad awaits you i was an empty man then bereft of emotion i followed him towards the river it moved sluggishly now it was choked with black dust i think i did right i said it was not my will you know but something else i think it might have been what i was really brought here to do there are forces i think whose nature we shall never know can only dream of i think it was another will than mine which dragged me herenot rigenos rigenos like me was a puppeta tool used as i was used it was fated that humanity should die on this planet it is better that you think that he said come now let us go home epilogue the scars of that destruction have healed now as i end my chronicle i returned to loos ptokai to wed ermizhad to have the eldren secret of immortality conferred upon me to brood for a year or two until my brain cleared it is clear now i feel no guilt for what i did i feel more certain than ever that it was not my decision perhaps that is madness perhaps i have rationalised my guilt if so i am at one with my madness it does not tear me in two as my dreams used to i have those dreams rarely these days so we are here the three of usermizhad arjavh and i arjavh is undisputed ruler of the earth an eldren earth and we rule with him we cleansed this earth of human kind i am its last representative and in so doing i feel that we knitted this planet back into the pattern allowed it to drift at last harmoniously with a harmonious universe for the universe is old perhaps even older than i and it could not tolerate the humans who broke its peace did i do right you must judge for yourself wherever you are for me it is too late to ask that question i have sufficient control nowadays never to ask it the only way in which i could answer it would involve destroying my own sanity one thing puzzles me if indeed time is cyclic in some manner and the universe we know will be born again to turn another long cycle then humanity will one day arise again somehow on this earth and my adopted people will disappear from the earth or seem to and if you are human who read this perhaps you know perhaps my question seems naive and you are at this moment laughing at me but i have no answer i can imagine none i am not to be the father of your race human for ermizhad and i cannot produce children then how shall you come again to disrupt the harmony of the universe and will i be here to receive you will i become your hero again or will i die with the eldren fighting you or will i die before then and be the leader who brings disrupting humanity to earth i cannot say which of the names will i have next time you call now the earth is peaceful the silent air carries only the sounds of quiet laughter the murmur of conversation the small noises of small animals we and the earth are at peace but how long can it last oh how long can it last
