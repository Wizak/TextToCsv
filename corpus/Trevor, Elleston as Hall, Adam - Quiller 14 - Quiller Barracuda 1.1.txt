 assigned to the infinitely sensitive task of interrogating a rogue agent in miami quiller moves straight into a red sector maximum personal danger when the mafia controlling the druginfested city puts out a contract on his life working his way through the sundrenched streets and treacherous waters of the caribbean himself the subject of a deadly mindcontrol operation designed to sell the united states to moscow quiller brings home a mission that will leave him permanently scarred this is barracuda an operation rated classification one of global importance a mission as lethal as an ocean of circling sharks adam hall quiller barracuda hush then they started to fisher began we waited he sat there like a schoolboy legs together head down i should have said no i was busy or something this wasnt my field it was very quiet tilson wasnt looking at me while we waited he was looking at the ceiling angled back on the chair with his thumbs hooked into his pockets he didnt want to why the hell should i tell you in a muted scream and we jerked our heads to look at fisher and i said you dont have to we didnt you want to drag everything out of me near tears his voice stifled his knuckles white and spittle on his chin christ what was he twentytwo twentythree you want me to go over the whole fucking thing for you no i said we dont and i went over to him and sat on my haunches so that i was lower and less threatening and he could concentrate on me and forget tilson was in here two against one all we want to know i said is how you feel now now that its over and youre back safe and sound just how you feel thats all about the future the problem was that he wanted to know how we felt and he didnt understand that it was totally beside the question the question was if you send out a man this age on his first mission in beirut and they pull him into the camp and put a hundred and twenty volts through his testicles and keep him awake for six days until he breaks what have you got when he finds a gap in the wire and gets a lift on a us army truck and comes back to london anything you can use again were not worrying tilson began but i cut across him you couldnt have told them anything important and thats the told them everything i know but it wasnt critical and it doesnt concern us i didnt point out that you dont send a green executive into the field with anything in his head thats worth getting at wed got to save what was left of his pride he was sitting on his hands now rocking on them as if hed just been bashed over the knuckles with a ruler oh those schooldays those bloody schooldays they last you all your life but his eyes werent squeezed shut any more and he was looking at me with the patience of a trapped animal waiting to know what i was going to do kill him or let him goeverything in a whisper most of us do i said tilson had moved on his chair making it creak and i thought if he meant to start talking again id have to shut him up somehow hed caught me coming out of the caff about half an hour ago fisher had just got back from beirut in a bad way would i mind giving a hand so forth tilson had been moved up into debriefing and i suppose he was competent but he wasnt sure how to handle a wrecked schoolboy i wasnt either but i suppose he wanted someone whod been through the same thing somewhere along the line and now that hed brought me into this thing i wanted to do it alone thats not true fisher said in another whisper ive done it myself not absolutely true but it would help him you he thinks youre god tilson had told me on our way here they need their mythic heroes the young ones the new ones and we never tell them about the feet of clay bit because they crave belief otherwise theyd never go out there were not expected i said to be superhuman in this trade were expected to try holding out and you held out for a whole week and on top of that you made your own escape and you got back here we think thats you know what they did to me yes but thats dont worry i heard tilson say and i got onto my feet because fisher was off the chair and it rocked back and hit the floor and he was standing with his face in his hands and shaking badly and a lot of what he was saying got lost in the sobbing told me never see mother again light in my eyes then they wires all over me kept screaming for them stop but it went on and on syringe with stuff in it give me aids something do you know something they couldve eaten me that bit was familiar because its the feeling you get after a while when theres nothing more they can do to you theyre not human any more theyre just creatures with huge jaws and you go into the final phrase where you lose identity and you wait for them to swallow you up the worst fear the instructor had told me at norfolk is that of emasculation and it had taken five missions before i found out that he was wrong the worst fear is of annihilation of being eaten swallowed up he was still sobbing fisher swaying on his feet with his face blotted out by his thin white hands his hair sticking out button off his cuff his narrow shoulders hunched over the rest of his body to give it shelter someone tapped on the door and looked in and went out again making a point of being quiet and i glanced at tilson once he was just standing there miserably with his arms folded and i think hed got the message wed have to let fisher go through it all again because he still couldnt believe what theyd done to him out there taken away his identity day after day until at last he was nothing but a piece of food and if he could get over it day after day and in front of other people it would save him from the nightmare that could goad him into picking up a knife or wrenching a window open but in any case he wouldnt be allowed to sleep without someone else in the room perhaps for months wed lost claypool like that and froom what do you think tilson was beside me unsettled he needs time is this all right what hes doing its all he can do hes got to get to the other side of what they did to him but i mean he thought about how to put it i said you cant throw him out it wont be up to me standing behind me i could feel it back of my head kept pulling the trigger rocking and swaying it might have looked as if we werent even here but that wasnt true he remembered we were here all right he needed us for his survival this was the confessional we were listening to the confessional and the statement for the defence and an appeal for the courts clemency the whole thing coming out as fast as it could because if it stayed locked in there for much longer it was going to kill him you wont get anything useful out of him i told tilson until he can face himself again could take weeks he sent in quite a bit of stuff before they got him stuff we can use i suppose he said watching fisher we ought to have some kind of resident shrink for people like this ive told loman that till im sick policy is if they can still stand up send them out again and if they fall down throw them into the street theyve lost good people like that theyre going to do it again tilson said didnt look at me i could feel anger quickening what have they said give him the rest of the day and if hes no better sign him out he shit who said that mr croder quick i said and left it to tilson because he was nearer the boy and he caught him halfway to the window and fisher went mad then and tilson couldnt hold him so i went over to help and had to work on the median nerves get them numb enough to stop him using his hands and then i said listen im taking you to my place and tonight were going to get smashed out of our minds what time eleven what does he want me for i dont know i put the phone down and went along to the caff and found tewkes chatting up daisy by the tea urn reeking of that bloody cologne croder was looking for you he said i know hows the lad there isnt a grapevine in this place its more like a fastburn fuse very good i told him not however in point of fact very good at all but that was the message i wanted to disseminate throughout the whole of the bureau fisher was better yes but hed been born with a thin skin anyway without the beirut thing and if they put him through it again today theyd draw blood without even using their nails id got him smashed on vodka by midnight and hed more or less surfaced at the key club during the early hours and didnt remember for a minute or two anything about beirut and it hadnt been the ego suppressing it the tension was off at last and he was on the other side of what theyd done to him and that was where he was going to start living again then he messed up the carpet in the jensen and said he was terribly sorry and i could have wept because he was so bloody young for this game and yet so very good from what id seen of the stuff hed sent into signals from his base out there id asked tilson for a look at it this morning he was still at my flat id phoned harry and asked him to come round and look after him i told him that if anyone from the bureau located him there he wasnt to report to the building that was an order and i would take the responsibility tilson knew where he was and might have leaked it mr croder tewkes said yet oh for christs sake shut up it hadnt totally escaped me that when croder sends for a shadow executive its reasonable odds that hes got a mission lined up and that soon after eleven oclock this morning id be taken off standby and put into operations and cleared and briefed and sent out to god knew where and the prospect was touching the nerves cuppa love yes red chafed hands at the big tea urn powdered wrinkles what would we do without our daisy the gentle dispenser of the universal anodyne hows the arthritis it had been pouring for days on end october rain gives me gyp now and then what about that poor young man though hes fine now keep on saying it telling people the caff was the only place where we could talk without the gag on and daisy was an information centre second only to signals itself there was no one in here i wanted to talk to and id had enough of that bloody cologne and it was still only so i went along and kicked holmes door open not exactly but i was a fraction quick with the handle and he noticed what are they going to do i asked him about fisher steady old fruit take a pew you cant rush holmes he keeps his cool and that was why id come to see him he was also in signals and mr croder was his chief and he might have heard something definite ive only got a few minutes i said yes youre down to see mr c arent you steady eyes under heavy brows watching me carefully hed felt the anger as soon as id come in here i cant tell you anything he said about fisher sorry i had to start using control not a good sign have they been looking for him yes would you like some tea has croder been looking for him not specifically various people have been sort of popping their head in to ask if i knew where he was do you tilson said youd sort of taken the chap under your wing eyes very serious now concerned that could be tricky theyre going to waste him i said not particularly to holmes just thinking aloud not quite sure why i was letting this fisher thing rankle not sure i wasnt simply using it as a focus for other kinds of anger in me other kinds of fear not sure whether i was afraid for him or afraid for myself drifting in the limbo that isolates us between missions bringing loneliness uncertainty while you find yourself looking at the calendar at the clock killing time on the way to the countdown i dont know holmes was saying if mr c has got anything for you i didnt ask i thought you might i would have of course and he knew that staring at me gravely from behind his neat orderly desk worried about me silverframed picture of a deceptivelypretty girl other pictures on the wall some nice arabians by chaille some sketches a henry moore a chinese watercolour will i see them again itd be better holmes said after a while not to fight with mr c hes a bit upset today his voice sounded faint and i realised id slipped into alpha and that i would have to get some control back it had been its been almost two months holmes was saying thats a long time beginning to show he moved a hand placatingly not to most people the thing is leaning across the desk his tone quietly urgent id be very careful with mr croder if hes got a mission for you and youre in this avoiding the word mood frame of mind you could lose it or turn it down we can do that its in the contract because we dont take anything on that might find us somewhere along the line in a red sector where the odds against our getting out are not worth counting they cant force us in other words to sign away our life i dont think youll turn anything down holmes said he wouldnt offer you anything less than interesting i was halflistening to him halflistening to the voices that whispered urgently in the dark of the spirit the thin whining voices of fright alarm paranoia it wasnt anything new since the last time out id been moving on a collision course with the next one and it doesnt get any better he was waiting for me to say something holmes sitting patiently at his desk long fingers interlaced his eyes attentive will i see him again be here in this room again that was the essence of what was going on the sense of seeing things doing things for the last time premission nerves enough to make you sick i dont know how i stand you i said you and your bloody intuition sudden white smile head on one side you made the choice come in here or not come in here lesser of evils or am i being selfindulgent then the chromeframed governmentissue clock on the wall moved to the hour and i got up and tapped my fingers on his desk to make contact with it with him in case it was the last god knows how you got a girl like that i told him the one in the photograph and went to the door and saw him as i turned to go out sitting there looking solemn again heed the gypsy he said do you know what youre asking not very much but its not even your concern everything that happens here is my concern that gives you no right to meddle it gives me the right to a hearing not at present later on you but this cant wait you know that heed the gypsy its for me to know whether it can wait i want to be told thats all what youre going to do with him it is not your concern he swung away his shadow moving across the wall thrown by the bright greenshaded lamp on his desk the curtains drawn against the rain outside night before noon typical of him croder thin and sharpshouldered like a predator busy in the dark his black hair brushed close to his head as if by the force of a stoop his black eyes buried in the bone and lost in shadow his nose cut by the sculptors knife in a single stroke and jutting sharply scenting carrion a trifle yes a trifle exaggerated but it gives you the gist i hope hes simply shall we say a man untouched by the humanities and therefore brilliant admittedly at his work which is to bring his executives back in safety if he can manage it and throw them out if they dont match up to his own exacting standards and with no slightest thought of a second chance the thing is id be very careful with mr croder a little too late for that hed offered me a chair when id come in how was i so forth the niceties hes not an unmannered man but i decided to get the fisher thing over before he told me why he wanted to see me told him i was worried and asked him if hed let me look after the new recruit for a day or two didnt as you may have noticed go down at all well look im not talking about giving him charity he did a good job out there and came to pieces the moment he got back i tell you this is not a refuge for burntout apprentices thats not burnout its delayed shock ive been through it myself and so have i swinging back to face me with his head down and his eyes hooded and so have i his artificial hand catching the light then you can understand but i did not go to pieces as soon as i came home stood with his eyes on me black glittering greenflecked with the reflection of the lamp look they took away his identity but hell get it back in time the real you will please the real problem is guilt because he broke and spoke and he cant live with himself unless hes given a chance to atone send him to norfolk for a couple of weeks run him through the survival course and then run him through it again tell them to flay him alive hes desperate for punishment and until he gets it he wont be able to find his selfesteem and if you dont do it hell do it on his own hes tried the window trick already and hell try it again but if that is selfpity its selfdisgust but if youll give him a chance hell make a first class shadow executive and god knows theyre rare enough its not as if he was looking at his watch and i turned and went to the door and pulled it open quiller i looked back at him you know proctor dont you conversational tone czardas yes he did a couple with me so you know him rather well i didnt think he wanted an answer if you go through a couple of major ones you know your contact in the field rather well yes there were some people coming along the passage and a womans voice said i think someones in there with him and croder said youd oblige me by closing the door and sitting down if youve got a moment oh jesus christ he was in a towering rage but all you could hear were the words give him that much he knew how to get control what he was really saying was that if i didnt come back and sit down in the next five seconds flat hed hit the second telephone from the left and blast me straight into six months suspended operations and leave me to rot but that wasnt why i pushed the door shut i didnt think wed finished with the fisher thing thank you proctor has been doing sleeper in florida for the past eighteen months i didnt know i thought hed been laid off because czardas had left him with a mm slug behind the heart they couldnt get at hed caught a side shot at ferihegy airport in budapest when he was taking off in a partenavia p victor with half the defence ministrys ultraclassified files and one of their younger secretaries on board hes very good croder said and picked up a phone that had started ringing no later than eighteen hundred hours and they are not to be armed thats very important he put the phone down hes been sending exemplary material through our routinegrade lines without cessation except for periods of leave when hayes took over but in the last few weeks his signals have proctors that is his signals have taken a slightly strange turn moreover hes begun sending material through the diplomatic bag verboten in the absence of exceptional circumstances i didnt say anything ive decided not to call him in for investigation because i believe its already too late for that there was a certain amount of delay before i was consulted below in the street a bus throttled up making a sound just like the rolling of heads it might also seem wise to leave proctor to go on as hes going and send someone out there to take a look at things without alerting him i thought of asking you because you know the man rather well and theres nothing we can offer you at the moment unless krinsleys operation in dakar comes unstuck which is unlikely whats he doing but then croder said africas not your preferred field is it its time the whites got out of there and left it to the natives its their land a phone rang again and he picked it up it wasnt the red one switch calls to costain i thought that was interesting considering the proctor thing didnt sound terribly urgent and there was another thing i wouldnt have thought the chief of signals would have been asked to send out a topechelon shadow executive to the united states to check out a sleeper with a screw loose but i didnt give it a lot of attention because i was coming down from the anger about fisher and the adrenalin was washing around and leaving the system sour a taste in the mouth have you been there before miami i said i hadnt not unpleasant this time of the year its too risky in what way i mean i could be out there nursing proctor and you could have a mission come onto the board and youd give it to someone else and i need one i understand that he looked down carefully you are normally less sensitive let it go im down for the next one in and ive got to be here im on standby he couldnt do anything about that its recognised that if they leave a shadow too long with nothing to do hes going to claw the wallpaper off there might be time croder said to call you in from miami looking up i would consider it a personal favour if youd agree to take this on id like to oblige i dont take charm from a vampire his expression didnt change it was mr shepley i should perhaps tell you who asked me to send someone out bullshit shepley was bureau one king of kings and host of hosts and he wouldnt give his chief of signals a thing like this to play with when there were five missions running on the boards i suppose he knew i was giving him some bullshit too i certainly didnt want to be way out there in the states when a new mission came up in london because i couldnt trust them to call me in but i could ask for a formal guarantee and expect to get it but i wasnt going to ask because it was giving me a certain amount of dark joy to keep on saying no to the man considering he wouldnt give me even a minute of his time on the fisher thing im sorry i said i dont want to leave london you make it difficult quiller hooded eyes brooding on my face in the greenish light of the lamp with regret politesse for tough shit i could of course require your acquiesence for require read order but as i say hes not unmannered of course but i would prefer to persuade you dark head sinking lower onto his shoulders i could see the feathers theres no chance i said he pulled a drawer open and dropped some papers onto the desk some kind of forms on top i think then he reached for a pen to put it formally then you decline to undertake this assignment despite my repeated request yes what if i kept fisher on and sent him to norfolk id go to miami i have your word on that yes i looked in on holmes before i left the building hes going to keep fisher on i said in a moment yes he told me this morning im sorry i couldnt say anything for some reason he put me under strict hush monck gin just some tonic glass crashed again musically good flight bit bumpy coming in im not surprised he gave me the tonic theres still a bit of turbulence about baggy alpaca jacket and trousers cracked suede shoes worn to a shine along the sides fifty i suppose thin silver hair across a peeling scalp name of monck lost my boat im sorry id seen litter across the bay as wed come into the approach two or three yachts wallowing in the dark sea capsized maria the captain had told us was approaching the florida coast by now and well out of our way but shed done some damage with an estimated death toll of fifty good timing monck said on your part and gave a slow winning smile cheers more glass fell a huge bahamian was at the top of a ladder clearing away the smashed window panes a trickle of blood down one arm which i didnt think hed noticed you really mean she was a writeoff what your boat oh pretty well salvage some of the interior teak and brass and so on perhaps pretty polly a quick brave smile long may she sail the elysian seas what lets go and sit over there we were in a kind of conservatory where theyd put a bamboo bar and filled the rest of the place with huge palms and hibiscus and birdsofparadise some of the floor was still flooded where the coloured tiles had broken over the years leaving hollows wicker creaked under us and monck balanced his drink on a leaning stool hed met me at the airport and brought me here in a clappedout austin no airconditioning any more than there was in this place how long do you think youll be here a few days youre going to see proctor i believe yes i hadnt been formally briefed in london but croder had said that monck was persona grata and would give me any help i needed then youll be more than a few days hes back in florida you just missed him he was on the last plane out before they stopped traffic because of the hurricane wheres his base here or miami he shuttles a bit quite a few people do judd was here last week hes got a place have you studied judd no if you mean the senator dont worry he said and got a crumpled packet of cigars out of his jacket youre not politically inclined as i know proctor is at least he is now and thats the main problem he scraped a match you can consider this as interim briefing you understand filling you in a bit before the other people arrive his face was pink in the light of the flame the lamps werent on in here yet and the place looked like a jungle the plants beginning to crowd in as the dying sun fired the walls and windows other people monck let smoke trickle out of his mouth watching the huge man on the ladder youll be taking a look at proctor but it wont stop there you didnt bring much baggage but you can do a little shopping when youve the time he faced me suddenly the wickerwork creaking his faded blue eyes resting quietly on mine im fully conversant with your record and it must have occurred to you that mr croder wouldnt lightly toss you the chore of checking on a sleeper whos started sending in funny signals this man for all his baggy suit and thinning hair wasnt coming across as a semiretired staffer put out to grass in the dependencies for one thing i knew the tone he was telling me precisely what he wanted me to know and that was all and he answered only those questions that called for it but i decided to take him headon did bureau one want me out here the big overhead fans sent the smoke streaming away on the sticky air his eyes were still on me and when he was ready he said surely mr croder told you at the time i wasnt ready to listen softly then i hope youre listening now glass crashed again and it sent a flicker along the nerves it hadnt been bullshit then on croders part the head of the bureau had told his chief of signals to send this particular executive out here and i hadnt believed it because there wasnt even a mission on the board but monck had spelt it out for me a minute ago youll be taking a look at proctor but it wont stop there but croder must have known that the mention of bureau one would have got me out of london with no trouble at all he hadnt needed to use fisher like that you say it wont stop i told monck at proctor but are we talking about an actual mission he looked away picking a bit of cigarleaf off his lip and studying it with abstract care a plump woman came through the doorway with her arms on her hips justin you come on down from there i need your hep in the kitchen man now you jus come on down this stuff gonna fall on peoples heads ne mind about they heads they have to watch out for theyselves you cmon down now yhear me monck didnt say anything until the huge man had got down the ladder and gone out an actual mission well im not sure you see my job he faced me again with a sudden swing of his head is to keep you out here in the caribbean until such time as things develop until we know where best to deploy you does that he waited not really i didnt think so shifting his weight in the chair ill put it like this vibrations have been coming out of this region over the past few months and theyve started to reach london all departments have been working into the night for a long time now especially signals and data analysis and of course codes and cyphers at first it had the look of a major narcotics development understandable in this area and then we thought it was something political involving fidel castro again understandable given the geography he dropped ash watching it blacken on the wet tiles we still dont know much but we know differently what it does concern is the upcoming american election in which of course senator mathieson judd is actively engaged it also concerns the balance of power between east and west as it exists at the present time which is precariously so were talking about something rather more than the requirements of a mission his faded blue eyes still on me let me put it this way if the extent of things proves as farreaching as weve begun to believe i shall find it difficult to sleep soundly in my bed black girl extremely pretty more than that vibrant demanding male attention petite in a silk dress that you could have hidden in one hand watching me as i came in so that i hardly noticed him in the shadows between the hanging brass lanterns noticed him only when he moved slightly id rung the bell and hed called out for me to come in they were standing quite a few feet apart as if theyd been talking but not intimately here you are said proctor as if he hadnt quite expected me to come though id phoned him ten minutes ago from the hotel i would talk to him monck had said at the airport in nassau with extreme caution its not out of the question that hes been turned and was wired or had a bug running the door swung shut behind me it was probably on a spring though i hadnt felt it there was no draught the air in miami tonight was deathly still they said we were in the eye of the hurricane the eye of maria though it had been downgraded to a storm after blowing itself out across the ocean monique this is richard keyes id told him my cover name on the phone monique he didnt say her last name she stood with one dark slender arm hanging with the hand turned for effect like a models as she studied me her eyes a sultry glimmer set in the black mascara good evening she said on her breath then looked at proctor call me of course he didnt go to the door with her as she passed me she left the air laced with patchouli i thought i heard a shutter bang in the wind but it must have been someone upstairs perhaps slamming a door it was too soon for the storm to start up again when did you get in he didnt offer to shake hands earlier on you come direct through nassau you look good long time im all right whatll you have tonic he went to the builtin bar where there was a ships lamp burning the glint of mosquitoes passed through the light he didnt actually look all that good but i didnt think it was because of the bullet in him monck had said it didnt trouble him providing he didnt get into any kind of action it looked i thought more like natural wear and tear booze and late nights and girls like that one a bit of a man monck had said for the ladies lime or lemon i dont mind nice place its all right lots of wicker and bamboo and big cushions nixed up with some miami beach art deco mirrors and wall plaques fixtures i would have thought they wouldnt be his not much light anywhere the walls mottled by the filigree work of the lamps hanging all over the place on chains a moorish touch bigscreen tv set and vcr cluttered with boxes of tapes a pile of glossies spilling onto the persian rug vogue harpers elle vanity fair hed established deep cover as an advertising rep working through the major us east coast and bahamian stations still on the wagon pretty much i took the glass it was more i could see now as he stood close to a lamp than natural wear and tear he had a good face unusually wellbalanced the dark eyes level and the nose dead straight and the chin squared but the skin had started to go even at his age forty or so because of the stress which had made him start losing weight it was in and around his eyes too they were less steady than theyd looked when wed been waiting there in the cellar in szeged near the yugoslavian border the last time out together waiting ten hours for them to find us and throw a bomb in and leave the pieces there for the rats to pick over czardas he didnt look as if he could ever go into the field again although i couldnt tell whether some of the stress he was showing or all of it wasnt to do with me he might not always be like this we sat on cushions on the floor the only chairs were grouped around the bamboo table and i went into the routine according to briefing just thought id look him up heard he was out here so forth sure its good to see you hed poured bourbon for himself a big one neat some kind of vacation the accent was still english but he was picking up the us vernacular not really we think castros putting in some new offshore listening posts on instructions from the komitet the high commission signals rooms been getting crossed lines in a moment not your usual pitch his smile had a certain confiding charm and it was there to take the danger out of the comment it didnt its not on the board i said there was no one else they could send out here but i got a guarantee from croder if there was a bug running i couldnt do anything about it i was meant to be out here on the castro thing and thought id look in on proctor for old times sake that was the script and i had to stay with it guarantee that hell pull me back to london if a mission comes up how long has it been getting on for two months you know what its like he scratched at the black hairs on his chest through the vee of his shirt i used to you miss it things are all right here this elections warming up you know what do you think of our senator judd politics arent my bag they can be quite amusing the way they play them here someone started a rumour last month that judd had been a pot addict and they finally pinned it down to a single drag on a joint in high school thought it was an ordinary cigarette but it could have crippled his campaign these good people dont care about a mans foreign policy so long as hes mr clean bit puritan of course then the anderson crowd started a rumour that hed been awol in vietnam for three months but it turned out hed been in a military hospital with honourable wounds judds war record is unimpeachable and they know it then last week by way of a riposte the republican tabloids came out with pictures of tate on a friends yacht cruising off fire island and tate oh for gods sake do you live down a hole senator tate from connecticut running for the democratic ticket they got zoom pictures of him with patsy stiles perched on his lap in a bikini on the afterdeck the shock waves rattled the whole of washington and of course tate was kicked straight out of the running and in case youre going to ask me who patsy stiles is shes a celebrated mafia moll i tell you politics can be quite fun in these lively climes is it too hot in here no good opening a window no but i can notch up the fan a few revs he uncrossed his legs and got off the floor and went across to a wall switch and i noted that he was still supple and moved well and was obviously in some kind of training it didnt fit in with his job sleepers tend to get soft i notice youre reeking he said of citronella thats good theyre buggers mosquitoes but mark my word mathieson judd is not to be underestimated hes a statesman with a world view that we havent seen since nixon and hes not a megalomaniac hell get in hes got to get in so this was why theyd sent me out here id been shown some of the odd signals this man had been sending in to london and some of the stuff hed been putting through the diplomatic bag and we had a case of a firstclass shadow executive getting shot up in the line of duty and sent out to the caribbean to operate as a sleeper and becoming engrossed in us politics to the extent that it was interfering with his job the whole picture was totally out of focus and i began listening very attentively because i had to catch everything i could a false note the wrong tone a word out of place and i hadnt forgotten that first warning with its disarming smile when id told him why i was out here in the caribbean not quite your pitch this man had been given some of the really big ones usually in the middle east because that was his preferred hunting ground and hed done some critical reconnaissance work inside the plo headquarters in tunisia the week before the israelis had blown the roof off and hed infiltrated the libyan air defence system and the soviet shipment programme funnelling arms missiles and material to the arab states he was too trained too experienced and too professional to let anything get in the way of the work he was doing i mean okay yes it was perfectly acceptable for him to fill me in on the local scene over drinks and make his pitch as an interested armchair campaigner for senator judd but this was the kind of stuff hed been sending the bureau through signals and the diplomatic bag it didnt the phone rang and he stretched full length across the rug and picked it up yes the earpiece was bound with soiled adhesive tape and the cable was in knots and i wondered if this was his main line to london it was a womans voice at the other end too faint for me to hear any words or even make out if it was monique the woman whod just left here not long he said in a moment and dropped the receiver back and got onto his haunches again when i say that mathieson judd has got to get into the white house i mean hes the only man in this country who can give it a new direction and im not quoting the standard rhetoric this time with this man its for real i put in a question and let him go on talking and consciously took in what i could while at the back of my mind a sense of unreality was creeping in and a bizarre question flashed suddenly was this man actually proctor bizarre because i knew without any doubt that he was hed changed a bit since id seen him last and hed lost some weight and was showing signs of stress but he was the same man id been with throughout two very nasty missions and i knew him to the bone but the question echoed in the mind very much hope the thatcher government realises what weve got in mathieson judd because the outcome of this elections going to have a major effect on the uk it was almost word for word from one of the signals hed sent in the week before repetitive the communications analyst had noted in the margin a major theme i went on listening but couldnt shake off the feeling of unreality of lost focus the air in the room was sultry electric even with the fan stirring it the whole town was held in the eye of the storm and charged with tension and that didnt help his understanding of the internecine struggle for power inside the kremlin is infinitely deeper than weve seen before in any us president thanks partly to the partial lifting of the veil by glasnost sure but judd isnt missing a trick the thing is he brushed the air with a hand and this time the smile was rueful the thing is that since politics arent your bag im boring the hell out of you now listen can i give you a hand with your mission until its not exactly your assignment his dark eyes narrowing as he smiled the mouth the teeth alone showing evidence of friendship false evidence good of you i said it straight away but it had taken some fast thinking because he was throwing me at every turn its right out of character for any shadow executive to offer to give a hand to one of his own kind because when a mission goes on the board its cir cumscribed and sacrosanct and the briefing is ultraclassified and totally verbal except for the maps and the frontier papyrus and the relevant documents and the same goes for an assignment or any official undertaking for the bureau necessitating a cover name for the field and the cover itself but id said it was good of him to offer his help because it was the answer hed obviously expected listen please he didnt realise that what hed said was completely out of character and i was instinctively aware that i mustnt let him know beginning to sweat but it wasnt the heat of the room it was the nerves something was appallingly wrong with proctor and i was having to talk to him as if he were someone else as if i had to humour him and it was a bit like playing russian roulette because the next wrong word could trigger a full chamber and i knew now why croder had picked a top shadow to come out here someone like fisher would have blown the whole thing before hed known what was happening i would talk to him with extreme caution monck yes indeed id given this man my reason for being out here and he hadnt accepted it not quite your pitch and in a minute or two he was going to bring the subject back had already brought it back lend a hand so forth and i was perfectly certain now that every word i said was going on tape its not out of the question that hes been turned noted bang of a shutter somewhere the wind was rising again at the rim of the eye and the night was stirring across the town every word and the sweat was running because this man too had been a top shadow and had been put through norfolk and been trained to interrogate put through a dozen major operations with the ability and the experience to face another man alone in a room and draw him through a minefield of traps and tripwires with question after question and that bright treacherous smile under the hanging lamp tell me he said about your assignment bang of a shutter contact a tile crashed and the pieces whined through the dark near my face and i got closer to the buildings not wanting to cross the street to the sheltered side because there was debris flying on the wind and it was difficult to see anything coming through the driving rain the storm had knocked out the power station feeding this area and the only light came from the few late cars making a run for home hed tried two or three numbers proctor for a taxi but they werent turning out something hit a big shop window and the glass burst like a bomb and i ducked and found a doorway and stood there soaked by the rain with my back to the open street as the gale took the shards of glass and flung them through the air a car forced its way past the doorway against the gusts throwing silvered beams of light as it wallowed through the floodwater surging at the storm drains a woman screaming somewhere inside the car i suppose terrified or just excited the sound whipped away by the wind it was less than half a mile to my hotel and i got back onto the sidewalk again with my head down leaning against the force of the rain fingers against the face as a shower of debris hit me with the dying impetus of shrapnel more sirens and the crimson flicker of lights in the distance as a firetruck ploughed through the intersection with its sirens going a police car taking up station assignment kept calling it an assignment just because id said there was no actual mission running for me strong windgust and i braced against it the rain beating lights throwing my shadow in front of me across the littered sidewalk sound of an engine and a sudden shout wanna get in speeding up again as i made signs for no and thank you not easy i must have looked like a soaked scarecrow trying to keep the birds away the hotel was only half a block now and i started a slow run to raise the odds against catching something really lethal on my head theres not much to it id told proctor theres been no briefing yet i see with the bright understanding smile the eyes no more than a shimmer between the lids half his face in shadow under the lamp but im sure itll turn out pretty interesting not necessarily i mean they didnt send someone like you out here just for a bit of housework im surprised taking another swallow of bourbon im surprised i didnt get wind of it after all this is my bailiwick got lost in all the buzz signals term for heavy traffic nassau and the florida peninsula formed a tight network with its own console at the bureau since the us stations presented a major information exchange between london and foggy bottom and cubas proximity offered a rich lode of signals traffic for infiltration and analysis providing a window on moscows interests in the region im very good proctor said chin tucked in at sorting out buzz theyre very pleased i said i got it from croder slip but it was too i send to bracknell hes on croders watch it was true and he knew that but it had been a close thing but use the chance you still happy out here in a moment the smile not there any more is that what youre here for in fact not sure im with you sweat itching on the skin there was no danger of course no physical danger unless hed got a gun and id already walked into a trap not out of the question that hes been turned its a rotten word frightening with its sense of turning to show a different face once an allys and now an enemys with trust knocked away and betrayal springing suddenly to life betrayal and treachery but if proctor had been turned i didnt think there was a case for trapping me into anything not physically im not that paranoid yet in a way it could be worse than that i could be moving into territory where i could become lost before i had time to see the danger i knew at least that moscow wasnt involved proctor had never liked them over there since theyd put him through five weeks in a psychiatric ward in an attempt to make him break and speak it had taken him six months to get the shock out of his system but he could have been got at by any one of a hundred international factions in need of a spook of his experience and these days the money was big and the girls much more sophisticated who was monique its just that it occurred to me proctor was saying that they might have sent you out here to check up on what im doing out in the open now i needed time and there wasnt any not quite that they asked me to look you up while im out here on the castro thing to see if youre happy tilting his head a fraction is that how they put it no it was croder he called it a psychological evaluation you know bloody croder in a moment i see the tone was icy now and even that false bright smile was dying away and why would he want to have me psychologically evaluated i think it makes sense otherwise id have told him to let someone else do it cheyneys still in the area but weve done a few jobs together so i know you better than most people that was their thinking and now id found out it was wrong id known proctor not this man this wasnt proctor fencing with him having to listen with every nerve and watch every word i didnt have time to think what could have happened to him but the obvious answer was drugs you know me better than most people he said you think thats true in this trade no one knows anybody else too well do they its relative but look if youd rather cheyney or someone else talked to you all youve got to do is signal croder i didnt ask for the job quite so he was on his feet suddenly and moving around with his thumbs hooked in the pockets of his worn blue jeans his shadow swooping on the walls as he passed the hanging lamps to see if im happy yes thats how you put it not croder swinging to look down at me but why shouldnt i be happy i got up too because we were about the same calibre and i didnt want to be on the floor if he decided to start anything his tone was silkily hostile and if he was on angel dust or something he could suddenly take fire look at it this way proctor you were into a lot of action in those missions and you were bloody good i know you that much but since the bullet thing youve been doing what amounts to a desk job and frankly if it had happened to me id have blown up by this time coming close suddenly watching me with the glimmer between the lids do i look as if im about to blow up with you it wouldnt show but that wasnt true it was showing very clearly hed lost the ability to keep his nerves under the skin in czardas and lighthouse wed both come as close to christendom as wed ever been but hed had a face like a mask the whole time even when theyd taken him out of the interrogation cell in zagreb and hed looked back at me with his eyes absolutely steady and the signal perfectly clear but only to me dont worry they didnt find the pill capsule potassium cyanide the instant exit then let me assure you he said with the accents honed that i am not about to blow up im perfectly happy here and i can quite believe that croder is pleased with the product im sending in his blunt head turned as the shutter banged again and some glass crashed somewhere in the street a wind was getting up fluting through a crack in the door here we go again proctor said his tone suddenly normal he went to the phone and sat there on his haunches pressing out a number and looking up at me you said your hotels ten minutes from here yes you mean walking or driving i said walking and the line came open and he asked them to send a taxi but it obviously didnt work and he tried some other numbers looking at the pad by the phone then getting up weve left it a bit late theyre all staying put looking at his watch id ask you to stay for some spaghetti or something but ive got to go anyway not long hed said to the woman on the phone lets keep in touch then the tone still normal no trace of hostility no bright smile i found it unnerving it was like suddenly talking to someone else lets do that i said he came to the door with me in the meantime ill tell them youre perfectly happy is that right in a moment he said perfectly happy as if he wasnt sure what i was talking about but felt it was the right answer the rain had started soon after i left him but there was nothing i could do about it and for most of the journey i was hardly aware of getting soaked because the chance of fetching something conclusive on top of the head was more of a worry that and the knowledge that the bureau had a sleeper out here manning a sensitive network and going through some kind of personality change and there was something worse something that had a degree of horror to it that i couldnt quite identify as the rain whipped through the streets and the sirens began again in the distance and then as the blackedout facade of the hotel loomed up the chill truth came into my mind and i broke my run is if id hit something it wasnt only that proctor had started to go through some kind of personality change there was this he didnt know it the red light was blinking on the phone in the hotel room and i asked for messages but there was only one the name was mr jones code identity for the bureau with only an extension number i used the prefix and dialled long distance direct it was coming up to hours in london are we clear holmes voice he meant were there any bugs as far as i know there could be a lot of stuff all over the place but it was unlikely because id switched rooms as soon as id booked in as a matter of routine a couple of things holmes said mr c wanted to tell you himself but theyve had a wheel come off with snapdragon and hes at the console now first thing is he wants you to meet ferris hes spelling there was some lightning around but the line wasnt too bad i just wanted to make absolutely sure he spelt it and a flicker went through the nerves ferris he gets in to miami in thirty minutes holmes said your time unless that storms still on is it theyve started traffic again all right hes british airways flight direct from heathrow im sorry i couldnt give you more notice but you werent there earlier can you meet him yes is he alone on his haunches pressing out a number and looking up at me you said your hotels ten minutes from here yes you mean walking or driving i said walking and the line came open and he asked them to send a taxi but it obviously didnt work and he tried some other numbers looking at the pad by the phone then getting up weve left it a bit late theyre all staying put looking at his watch id ask you to stay for some spaghetti or something but ive got to go anyway not long hed said to the woman on the phone lets keep in touch then the tone still normal no trace of hostility no bright smile i found it unnerving it was like suddenly talking to someone else lets do that i said he came to the door with me in the meantime ill tell them youre perfectly happy is that right in a moment he said perfectly happy as if he wasnt sure what i was talking about but felt it was the right answer the rain had started soon after i left him but there was nothing i could do about it and for most of the journey i was hardly aware of getting soaked because the chance of fetching something conclusive on top of the head was more of a worry that and the knowledge that the bureau had a sleeper out here manning a sensitive network and going through some kind of personality change and there was something worse something that had a degree of horror to it that i couldnt quite identify as the rain whipped through the streets and the sirens began again in the distance and then as the blackedout facade of the hotel loomed up the meant a major mission for one thing because of his status and his track record and because id seen his name on the board for catapult when id looked into the signals room before id left so theyd pulled him in from paris overnight and sent him out here direct with no local briefing from monck unless it had been done on the phone between nassau and london monck would have given ferris everything he knew without keeping selected material back as hed done with me because thats the way it works the shadow executive in the field is told only what he needs to know at any given time the background to a major mission can be infinitely complex with areas of ultraclassified material on a government level right up to youreyesonly files exclusive to the prime minister go round again even ferris wouldnt have all of it in his hands his job was to direct the shadow in the field see that he was fed and watered and kept in signals with london give him the information he needed to know and send him wherever he had to be sent wherever the mission took him protect him from the opposition and from his own paranoia when things got rough and finally bring him home with enough life left in him to stand up to debriefing for days on end weeks on end while they turned off the light over the board in the signals room and got on with something else shit man im getting giddy how does this bloody window open its broke there was reflection on the glass but i could see him now ferris coming through the arrival area but not from the baggage claim hed have only one case prepacked for him and stored by the travel section in the bureau and marked fip for immediate pickup can you pull in here between a limo and a dirty red vw luggage all over the place two men with sideboards and black coats and padded shoulders and pandastyle smoked glasses ducking into the lincoln a college boy lurching under the weight of a surfboard and scuba gear somebodys maiden aunt with a carnation corsage and blue hair and ferris that man there i said tall thin glasses i got him fetch him in here exhaust gas thick on the air as the door came open and i shifted over where we go now man ferris said the flamingo on th street and the driver pulled out and gave the cop the finger and i told him to turn up the radio nice and loud its two blocks from your place ferris said but i told him id need to move out because someone had searched my room at the hotel and id been tagged there from proctors in the storm youve made contact already yes or they have patchouli while you were at proctors yes he sent someone round to your hotel he could have i phoned him when i left there to say i was coming no one else knows me here and there was no tag from the airport when i got in no contact until you called on proctor no but i suppose monck could have been blown the light caught his glasses as he turned his head no he keeps his cover in the bank meaning that monck was unblowable so no one had got on to me from there then it was proctor monck said he might have been turned who by ferris dropped a pair of new socks onto the bed i do wish theyd get it right look at this dogshit brown he was already half unpacked we hadnt talked much in the taxi even with the music ferris is impeccable with his security i dont know anyone couldve turned him especially out here he glanced at me again a black shoe in his hand brilliantly polished out here it wouldnt have to be anyone political there are people here earning a million dollars a week running cocaine in from the south a good sleeper with proctors communications could monitor the us coastguard rather efficiently and make a pile i see look at the polish on these bloody shoes they think im loman he had a soft rather sibilant voice like a snake shedding its skin i wouldnt want to be whoever it was in travel whod packed his bag all right he said you know proctor well thats why they sent you out here would he be likely to bust his career for big money i cant say i got up to walk about not near the window blinds there was only meant to be one of us in here hes changed hes changed a lot oh really he took a black leather toilet bag into the bathroom and came back fingering his thin strawcoloured hair then whod be sending the product in possibly cheyney he but you dont mean turned ive been out here i said for twentyfour hours and i talked to proctor from ten till eleven tonight thereabouts i cant give you processed feedback i dont expect it first weve got to beat the air he put a kent brush on the dressingtable setting it at a precise angle they hadnt moved surface things in my room at the hotel but they hadnt remembered that the second drawer down in the bureau had been left half a centimetre open for one thing where are you going to put me i asked ferris the cedar grove near the airport is that the reserve base dear god he said would i do a thing like that sorry i wasnt thinking fast enough the reserve base could have been vetted by cheyney or even proctor himself and passed on to travel for recommended use tonight it could be a trap or bugged or both ive stayed ferris said at the cedar grove its small clean and secluded even though its near the airport good access egress and rearview vision and cheap so molly will be pleased he dropped a greenstriped shirt into a drawer molly is that acidic old bitch in charge of accounts what about cover i asked ferris we dont know yet zipping the empty bag and dropping it onto a chair listen its late so im going to give you the basic scene as it looks at the moment but realise this proctor is the key he sat on the end of the bed and leaned his elbows on his knees the overall picture is vast and as yet undefined only three people have seen the actual printout that comprises the essence of weeks of signals sleeperdata and privateline conferences that have been shoved through the computers for analysis and evaluation only three im not one of them so what ive got to do is funnel you a selected breakdown of what london gives me and your position is this youre in the field to give us the access weve got to have before barracuda can begin running thats the codename for the mission as you probably know because holmes has doubtless told you he ran his fingers through his hair proctor is therefore the key and hes also the access because this is the information ive been given to work on and i can give it to you in toto do not think of proctor as a possiblyturned or renegade sleeper whos conceivably been feeding disinformation to london for an unspecified time or i should say dont think of him only as that he is more he is much more this was briefing he hadnt debriefed me yet on the meeting id had with proctor and that was the next thing hed do but he wouldnt necessarily do it tonight question i said has barracuda got anything to do with the american elections i think it worried him a bit but i didnt know why possibly id touched on part of the information hed been instructed to hold back from me indirectly he said in a moment yes because thats the proctor connection hes gunning for senator judd and it sounds as if hes right ferris was watching his hands yes london knows that a beat i mean that hes gunning for judd he was watching me now instead of his hands and i felt a tremor in the nerves id missed a point somewhere but ferris hadnt i didnt flinch when the telephone rang but it felt like that he swung across the bed yes i couldnt hear the voice at the other end when his thin body was bent over the phone i dont think he was looking at me but i couldnt tell the light was across his glasses im never completely comfortable with this man even though ive always asked for him as my director in the field every time out and even though hes handled me with total expertise and brought me home still functioning opinions and preferences vary among the shadow executives but i count him the most brilliant dif in the bureau and there are seven or eight of them in operation at any given time its running now what makes me uncomfortable is the man himself the way he treads on bugs and the way hell look at you with his quiet amber eyes for so long without blinking that you start getting paranoid it had happened just now no but theres been contact made searched my room yes and tagged me from proctors place this could be monck on the line quite a few other people dont like him either i mean ferris they say that when hes bored with the telly he strangles mice ill tell him he put down the receiver and got off the bed pushing his long pale hands deep into his pockets and moving around stooping like a don other questions not going to tell me whod phoned or why not good for the little ferret he was about to shove down the hole down there in the dark where the tunnels were a chill along the nerves still because of the slip id made had it been a slip what kind what did i have to hide yes i said what are we doing out here in the us you mean where do we stand visavis the fbi and the company he gave a sigh releasing tension and i knew that in one second flat hed had to scan right through the notformyeyes material and decide how much it was safe to unclassify they could have been compromised mother of god you werent meant to know that ferris said with his head at an angle at this stage but it was a good question and ive got a certain amount of leeway in terms of discretion we dont know the fbi and the cia have been compromised at any particular level so i want you to keep things in perspective but theres a risk so were not liaising with them or reporting to them or requesting their help at this point the scene was coming into focus for me now let me put it this way monck if the extent of things proves as farreaching as weve begun to believe i shall find it difficult to sleep soundly in my bed and ferris a few minutes ago the overall picture is vast and as yet undefined can i get some water technically he was my host what yes i went into the bathroom and unwrapped one of the glasses would you like some tonic or something theres probably some in the fridge he was in the doorway and i caught sight of his face in the mirror watching me as i turned on the tap and i didnt know what he was thinking what was on his mind its just a thirst when i came back into the room he said again other questions that was all right he normally briefed like this the general picture and then questions to save time yes the two major intelligence organisations of the united states of america could possibly be compromised and londons sent one little ferret in here to check up on one little sleeper i know what you mean but life is a local affair the problem you see with barracuda is that theres so much going on in the background that the communication datas started to jam the computers thats why london croder under shepleys personal direction is working the analysts round the clock before the networks start crossing wires and picking up other peoples signals and going to ground one by one he said with soft emphasis the stations are switching codes and channels and frequencies as they get scared of leaking their data and at any time at all the analysts in london are going to be sitting there on their hands with the computers shut down for want of input the onus is already on you to provide it i said faster than i meant to im not signed up yet ive sent for someone ferris said for someone to clear you and get your signature watching me all the time his thin mouth set in amusement not quite a smile the way it looked i could easily believe when he was busy strangling mice but im expecting more questions before he comes drank some water the nerves have got a thirst of their own you could be wasting his time possibly weve got meddick standing by they pulled him in from stuttgart tonight meddicks all right offhand so long as he can keep his sphincter muscles under control when it comes to the crunch this man ferris laughs through his teeth you know like a snake hissing the questions he said and glanced at his watch but i still didnt like it this all right yes was the moment of truth we all go through when they offer us a mission and its never easy because youve got to decide whether to play it safe and turn it down and wait till something more attractive comes along or go for it and pick up the pen and commit yourself to the high likelihood of walking into the crosshairs or taking curve too fast or hitting the floor before they can get at the capsule and rake it out of your mouth the moment of truth yes and the point of no return but this time the nerves were nearer the surface than usual and i didnt know why correction i did know why but i didnt want to face it not yet questions yes all right whats the field for barracuda the caribbean is it exclusively mine exclusively there must be concurrent operations running if this things as big as you say yes in zurich capetown and hong kong but they are financial and political not active behind the closed teakwood doors and in the private international clubs not in the midnight streets or the interrogation cells am i the only active shadow in the whole of the enterprise yes but dont let it phase you bureau one is in charge and croder is in signals and i am directing you in the field you can have of course any kind of support you need without number this he said softly is classification one i suppose i shouldve expected that with shepley and croder running the board in london and ferris out here with me in the field but it came as a surprise and i was impressed because classification one gives the shadow executive in the field total support and facilities communications courier lines the strategic deployment of paramedical units and liaison with the local british embassy or consulate and diplomatic status in case of unavoidable transgression of the host countrys laws very few of the top shadows have been offered a ci thorne fosdyck barrett and i believe tasman because in any case a mission of this size doesnt often break i dont want it i told ferris and finished the glass of water too posh for you watching me carefully even with your degree of arrogance no takers too bloody busy look i havent changed ferris and you know i can only work if you bastards leave me alone no heat in the tone but i wanted him to get the message but if you do need help then youd better be there well its nice he said to know were of some comfort even if you dont want to admit it bullshit he was trying to rile me but it wasnt just to amuse himself the man hed sent for to clear me for barracuda could be here at any time and ferris would need my signature straight away because if i turned this thing down hed have to bring meddick in from london to take over if in fact theyd got that man standing by which i somewhat doubted because theyll do this to you you know that theyll drag every nerve out of your body if it suits their book ive seen them kick a man headlong into a mission with the absolute certainty that when hed done the job hed never get back through the frontier alive and then theyd pulled off the impossible and brought him in still ticking and debriefed him just in time before he went and walked under a bus the bureau is the sacred bull and our heads my friend are never far from the sacrificial stone so if im going in i told ferris im going in alone and if i want help ill ask for it understood questions what about proctor are you going to put tags on him bugs in he got his lean body off the bed and went into the bathroom and broke the plastic off the other glass and turned the tap on ive got a thirst too youre driving me too hard joke we put a tag on him yesterday and were mounting a roundtheclock watch and we put bugs in i asked him at what time and waited watching me from the doorway the glass of water in his hand just before you went there on whose orders london ordered it when mean whose orders locally for christs sake who told the man with the screwdriver i did and did you know what time id be there yes they you bugged my phone too i do wish youd sit down youd be much more comfy i had to centre to get the control back before i spoke not very good manners was it a sigh one of his characteristic and calculated sighs i really think this is a job for meddick you know hed be so much easier to handle i moved around a bit and came back and sat on the floor with my back to the wall slight smell of carpet and a shift in the acoustics less traffic noise from the window fuck meddick now thatll make you feel better so youve got the whole of my meeting with proctor on tape yes and you dont therefore need to debrief me except for the visuals and the ambience hes in good shape works out i went on talking normally to let the angst dissipate of its own accord the only physical alternative for getting rid of the adrenalin would have been to hit ferris and hed saved my life too many times for me to touch him and in any case that too would have been bad manners he started off all right but turned hostile he did you antagonise him no i played him very carefully hes lost some weight and hes living on his nerves youll pick that up in his voice too shabby flat renting it furnished airconditioning not working this was before the storm hit the power off very pretty black popsy who left without a word hes tart no unless shes flying extremely high washington or somewhere like that shes sophisticated and potential dynamite raw silk dress platinum pinochet watch yes the tag reported on her did proctor introduce her yes the name was monique talking about her thinking about her brought the hint of patchouli back to me and by association something else that had been there in proctors flat something i hadnt seen or heard some kind of presence an element and it was this that had got my nerves strung up and what i was afraid of most was a question about it from ferris he hadnt asked me yet and he might not ask me at all but if he didnt id know the worst paranoia did you arrange to see him again what yes were meeting for lunch tomorrow at the oyster pick despite his hostility he wants to know more about the phone rang why im here he suspects im checking on him oh really he picked up the phone and listened and said come on up he dropped the receiver back and i asked him where monck fitted in hes very seasoned ferris said and quite high in the overseas staff echelon so if he contacts you listen with care is he directing anyone over here you mean plumbers and people yes he is not hes too far away and he is much too elevated to look after plumbers think of him as a liaison figure between barracuda and the operations in zurich and capetown and hong kong and in direct signals of course with london which is why you were sent to nassau for local briefing whos looking after the plumbers knock on the door and he went over there by plumbers we mean engineers of some kind mostly electronic and mostly concerned with bugs and counterbugs weve got a man called parks who does that ferris said and opened the door i got off the carpet as he came in a small man with quick movements clerical deferential terrible tie truscott ferris said this is mr keyes it shouldnt take long i know its late we nodded and truscott looked around for a chair and got his briefcase unzipped and then ferris looked at me and said why do you think by the way that judd should get in sudden chill and the skin crawling the senses of reality drifting away and the faint scent of patchouli judd quick oh proctor was full of it youve got it on the tape of course as if hed forgotten he hadnt forgotten actually be careful be very careful anyway its all on the tape ferris had turned away and i said to the man truscott youre here to clear me yes he looked surprised well of course ferris would have told him but i suppose i was just making conversation while i waited for ferris to turn round again wanted to see his eyes see what was there sweat cold on the skin then he was looking at me and of course there wasnt anything at all i could see in his eyes because he wouldnt be showing it is it on as if nothing had happened had anything happened or was it just in my head on reality creeping back the mission he said watching me all the time yes said it without thinking but there was no question because i wanted him ferris and the bureau wanted their help yes of course hot in here he said and went across to the thermostat over his shoulder get him cleared then will you i suppose it took ten or fifteen minutes i dont remember theres not a lot to do at this stage just forms to sign next of kin we started into it while i watched for ferris reflection to come into the bathroom mirror through the doorway into the glass of the picture on the wall the seascape because i didnt want to look at him directly but the worst was over now and i wouldnt have to think about it until later in the night perhaps in the still of the whinnying dark when the dreams bring demons the same bequest sir what was it last time shoreditch the battered wives yes right let it stand took it from there and got through by hours no weapons drawn no courier requested no support so forth signed all the bumph went off truscott bobbing his head briefcase under his arm almost too big for him in terms ferris said before i left him of final briefing your primordial task is to latch on to proctor and get everything you can from him get right inside his head and work from there his hands held out in front of him with the long fingers spread proctor is the access weve got to have before we can even start running barracuda and i said yes i understood but in the morning he phoned me and said that proctor was missing cleared out during the night langouste she was below me looking upwards through her mask two of them had worked all through the night down with her hands beckoning i pretended not to see looking at all the sea fans very pretty so forth theyd gone through the flat with countersnoop equipment and hadnt found a thing nothing of his anyway only the bug that monck had ordered put in there without telling me but id stopped worrying about that by now because this wasnt going to be like other missions this was a classification one theyd got on the board and they were going to run me like a rat through a maze and i couldnt expect any manners down she was saying with her hands encouraging me nodding slowly her light hair streaming in the current so i tilted and went down to where she was waiting just above the sand four atmospheres on the gauge okay with her thumbs up i made a bit of token fuss with the faceplate and then nodded yes okay ive never seen ferris move so fast though he didnt seem to hurry he just got a lot more done calling people out of the woodwork and signalling london and monck telling me to get to the cedar grove on south river drive and make certain i was clean when i got there my hotel was blown and ferris had got my things collected and sent to the new place this morning hed used every trick in the book and got hold of proctors phone bills for the last three months and wed gone through them and the most frequent local number wed turned up had been called in the period of august rd to th and it was hers kim harvesters the woman drifting beside me with her long greenish eyes watching me through her mask okay so lets go on up now her hands palming upwards and her flippers beginning to stroke the stripes on her suit rippling in the underwater light and her hair drawn straight and then billowing as she slowed waiting for me then drawn straight again like pale seaweed in the current theyd known hed gone for good because the peep ferris had stationed in the building opposite had seen him pile a lot of his stuff into the sevenyearold softtop chevrolet in the street below hed even taken the stereo and the rowingmachine up we go feel okay bubbles rising against the flat white surface they should have known the man they were handling hed seen the tag in the toyota three cars behind him along biscayne boulevard and stopped at an arco station to make a phonecall and then got back into the chewy and driven on and the police car had moved in before theyd gone three blocks and put the tag through the breathalyser while the chewy had kept on going sunlight bursting against the eyes the body heavy again you did very well she said when shed pulled off her mask thank you id told ferris i wanted him to play the tape theyd made when id been in the flat talking to proctor and do it now i didnt want london to think id frightened him off with anything id said ferris had cleared me called it a model exercise how did you find me she wanted to know we were stripping off our wet suits on the quay where shed got a shed full of equipment and lobster pots and some deepsea fishing gear im a bit out of the way someone i was talking to yesterday said you were good when did you leave the old country years ago shaking out her wet hair my father was a smallboat skipper in dover but he finally couldnt stand the winters she hung up our suits and hosed them and then the air tanks sluicing out the masks what about you im just visiting looking down then up again you dont need scuba lessons its been a long time id lost confidence there was a squawking of seagulls suddenly from the water beyond the boats and she swung her head and looked across at them a square face but small with a firm mouth marks on the cheeks still from the mask thirty i would suppose her skin ageing too fast in the sun no she said you havent lost confidence you were just making it look like that she smiled for the first time since id come down here how long have you been teaching oh years she put a brush through her hair so who told you where to find me george proctor she straightened oh he said you were a good teacher hes trash she said offhandedly as she looked away and then began stowing the air tanks can i give you a hand i do it in my sleep leanbodied and strong turnedup khaki shorts and a teeshirt its back dark from her wet hair i was waiting for her to ask me how he was proctor because hed phoned her every day sometimes twice a day the last time nearly a month ago but she just said i didnt catch your first name richard but then i suppose you wouldnt ask about someones health if youd dismissed them as trash since she said you dont need scuba lessons and you havent lost your confidence in the water why did you come down here with a full frank stare i hoped you might know where hes gone oh someone was bringing a chris craft in throttling the diesels down two or three people on deck very tanned one of them with a line ready and she waved back to them when they saw her there was still a lot of flotsam swirling on the surface from the storm there was flotsam all over the bloody place as a matter of fact ferris had put three men on me as an exercise in caution a lot had happened last night my room at the hotel had been gone through and someone had tagged me back there and then proctor had got out very fast indeed and left no tracks so anything could happen now and if anyone picked me up again and moved in ferris would want to know who they were and where they came from proctor is the key hed said hes also the access croder at the board for barracuda would not have been pleased with that signal subject missing no trace would you like some lobster the woman asked me to eat what else would you do with a lobster dont tell me youre that kinky with a freezing smile loathing me for even having known proctor but still too interested to let me go i said i liked lobster actually shes a tug kim said still is really though ive made a few changes wed put out a couple of miles as far as the warning buoys on the reef and dropped anchor she was my fathers his one great love apart from me twoinch oak on doublesawn oak frames my god the way they used to do things shes still registered for coastwise and harbour work are you starving theres no hurry ive got to catch it first theres some scotch in that cupboard unless youd like wine help yourself she went into a berth and came back in a black bikini hooking the bra and shutting the door with her bare foot arent they handsome i was looking at the blownup photographs of sharks all over the cabin brushing against me in the close quarters she said i was rude to you back there on the quay sorry but he really is such an absolute bastard i wont be long you can get some water on the boil if you like that pan there half full over the side in a perfect curve no splash the lobsterpot marker bobbed in the ripples i kept in the shade under a canvas awning shed rigged up aft of the cabin the sun struck out of a full noon sky and the deck was giving off the smell of pitch there was the glint of fieldglasses again from the stern of the motorlaunch that had nosed its way along this side of the reef soon after wed dropped anchor things had gone better in the night than id expected the hags of morpheus had been kept back by ferriss telephone call reporting that proctor had gone and thered only been a couple of hours after that sometime before dawn for sleep or nightmares but there was still a sensitive area in my consciousness that i was deliberately avoiding because it frightened me it was about senator judd and the way ferris had put his question id face it later when i had to when i was forced to and i would be i knew that langouste a la setoise she said but i think i should have marinated it garlic tomatoes oil mainly the olives are extracurricular because i dote on them i had a french mother not french actually belgian she met my father on the dover ferry one night in a storm lonely people talk a lot dont they do you talk a lot you havent noticed are you lonely my god four questions in a row is this any good cest exquise after a silence that wasnt obtrusive lonely in a way yes i suppose or this is the aftermath he dropped me flat only a few weeks ago for monique youre well rid arent you she looked up at me her green eyes deeper in the shade of the cabin it never really matters you know what theyre like he was the only man ive ever loved not loved actually been obsessed by why didnt you just waving her fork come to me and tell me what you wanted i didnt know how sensitive you might be feeling she watched me for a moment that was nice of you but it cost you fifty dollars flash flash from the launch near the reef i hadnt answered and she said you told me hes gone you mean cleared out altogether he took all his things but you said youd been talking to him yesterday he went last night yes this really calls for the chablis you know i have to keep off it oh are you some sort of official then i mean is he wanted for anything not as far as i know thats a bloody shame laughing on the outside crying on the inside with a big effort that only showed in her voice lightly casually did he talk about me we were talking business the whole time a gull swooped and perched on the aft rail and she swung her head then looked back at me but you said he told you i was a good scuba teacher that was a lie i couldnt think of a better introduction an honest liar thats unusual then how did you really find me hed cleared out in a hurry and left the flat in a mess papers all over the place including some phone bills she was looking at me less often and listening carefully her eyes down so how many numbers did you call the whole lot the one hed called the most often first mine yes looking away there wasnt another number since then that hed called often no she didnt want to know about monique well it wont be long pouring herself some more wine so you found my phone number but you didnt call me i got your answering machine and didnt leave a message youre listed she drank some wine im a careful soul you see and when a man comes here for lessons and uses his gear like an expert i want to know more she looked up at last and i think i believe most of what youve said have you ever been rejected richard it happens all the time i doubt that holding my eyes for a moment its not the missing so much the sex and all that its the colossal blow to the ego you know i mean i can find another man the place is full of them but even that isnt certain any more hes made me suddenly feel unattractive and i sense youre the rare kind of man who knows what that does to a woman it doesnt take a lot of imagination but you ought to get that thought right out of your head ive never been so close to a more attractive woman in my life look i wasnt i know well its always nice to hear she looked away at the reef hes dangerous did you know that i dont just mean to women all i know is that hes in my debt owes you money yes thats why you want to find him can you think of a better reason no but there might be one she put down her knife and fork did i pass it was superb you can thank my mother does it sound as if im always fishing for compliments no but women have to in a mans world gods truth she began clearing the table theres some fruit in the fridge smoke if you want to are they friends of yours who the people over there with the field glasses in the launch yes i hadnt noticed i think you had she brought a bowl of peaches i dont want to sound cute but with you diving for lobsters im not surprised there are some field glasses around my god that was the fifties they do it these days they dont just look then theyll have to start just looking again thats true its frightening she sliced a peach i suppose its a way of keeping the population down are you in the same kind of business the same as george proctor advertising yes you live in the states no so youre not interested in the election these arent ripe i wouldnt bother i dont know a lot about it but i hope judd gets in she looked up quickly hes got to mathieson judd is not to be underestimated hes a statesman with a world view that we havent seen since nixon and hes not a megalomaniac hell get in hes got to get in she stopped but i didnt say anything she didnt want me to wasnt looking at me shed withdrawn into herself its not just the americans who are concerned this time the whole worlds involved and much more than usual when theres a change of administration here i very much hope the thatcher government realises what weve got in mathieson judd because the outcome of this elections going to have a major effect on the uk stopped again i still didnt say anything she was poising a short choppingknife vertically above the peachstone on her plate holding it carefully and taking little stabs trying to split it i suppose but then if id asked her what she was meant to be doing with it she wouldnt know would even wonder who i was what i was doing here she looked psyched out robotic that area the area of consciousness i was afraid of touching exploring was making demands on me now moving right into the forefront of my mind and i almost recoiled physically stab with the knife chipping at the peachstone his understanding of the internecine struggle for power inside the kremlin is infinitely deeper than weve seen before in any us president thanks partly to the partial lifting of the veil by glasnost sure but judd isnt missing a trick the short sea lapped at the sides of the boat and a lanyard fretted in the wind i didnt know if the launch had gone from the reef wanted to know but didnt want to turn my head or do anything to break the silence because i was into the zone of consciousness now the one that made me afraid and i lost the sense of time the past and the present overlapped leaving me in an eerie wilderness of the mind then the knife split the stone and she looked up at me with her eyes blank for a moment then she focused and said theyre not ripe are they i dont know glancing at my plate you havent tried so i made a gesture and when i spoke again it was with the feeling of pulling the pin from a grenade george proctor feels the same way she frowned i wouldnt know he didnt talk to you about mathieson judd god no with a hurt smile that wasnt our relationship just heavy sex and what i thought was love lucky escape i said think of it that way i got up and helped her clear the rest of the table yes but its not so easy do you like my sharks i was looking at them earlier theres a special one out here somewhere that you want to catch that i want to kill she ran the tap in the small metal sink brushing against me sometimes still in the bikini her skin tanned coppercoloured in the light from the portholes with a powdering of dried salt on her shoulders isnt it the same thing catch kill no she looked up at the photographs on the bulkhead its one of those a thresher it took my father here in these waters i was there when eighteen months ago eighteen months a week and two days how did it happen talking about the tug shed said it had been the one great love of her fathers life except for me we were just off the reef over there the anchor got fouled and he went overboard to free it the shark saw him im sorry a whole pack we hadnt seen them she dropped the last plate into the rack and dried her hands and turned away padding on her bare feet to the shade of the awning looking across at the launch and waving turning back to face me maybe theyll stop gawping now her green eyes wet as she said have you ever seen anyone eaten alive before i could think of anything to say im sorry its okay now really weve come to an agreement she came towards me slowly her face hard now they wont come for me until i find him the male thresher and kill him or try in the glare of the sun on the sea behind her she stood in silhouette her short legs braced to the motion of the boat her feet splayed a little and her arms hanging loose her eyes alone catching the backlight from the portholes glimmering in the dark of her skin she looked primitive naked as she stood there speaking of primitive things i go to meet them you see whenever theyre in these waters i go and swim with them in a moment i said alone i took a friend once with a camera this is you i was looking at the blowup near the gallery under the swinging lamp in this one yes id noticed it before and had meant to ask her about it because it looked unreal surrealistic the figure of the swimmer wasnt perfectly clear it could be another shark because of the surface reflection they wont attack you see if you swim the right way unless of course theyre hungry and then it doesnt matter what you do but my dad was making a lot of fuss with the anchor wed got no idea they were anywhere near the reef or he wouldnt have gone down oh christ i went to hold her as she broke suddenly but she shook my hands away im okay now but sometimes ive got to talk about it to someone and its your bad luck today you see because there was my dad down there fooling around with that fucking anchor and then there was just a lot of blood on the surface a lot of threshing about and then the blood christ it was a beautiful red shaking and with her breath moaning he was a beautiful man he coloured the whole sea like a flag like a banner sobbing now but still standing straight with her arms hanging by her sides refusing to bring her hands to her face and that was all i could see of him all that was left a sunset on the sea in the early morning light and you know what i dont understand i dont understand why in gods name i didnt just go over the rail into all that beautiful red so he wouldnt be alone the tears bright on her dark face so i wouldnt be alone the waves hit the boat and the lamp in the galley swung the door of a berth creaked after a time i said a wonderful man how do you know on a sob for you to have loved him so much she swung her head her hair flying out love isnt enough is it not powerful enough however big it is it cant guarantee anything she turned and leaned her back to the bulkhead and the tension went out of her and she looked across the sea across to the reef a wonderful man yes it was just over there where the short waves broke along the reef tossing up flotsam you cant keep away she turned her head quickly dont want to looking across the sea again thats where i swim with them and thats where im going to find it and kill it how will you know which one it is ill know we think words are all there is she came back into the shade writing speaking we think its the only kind of communication we talk about vibes but we dont really understand how deep they go how strong they are when i see that one touch it ill know she went and found some tissues is this your father yes laughing in the photograph in the centre of the bulkhead holding up a big fish a tuna or something a handsome man not young but youthful lean tanned ill make some coffee she said what time do you want to be back whenever you do as soon as you like then she came and leaned her head against me closing her eyes it was nice of you to listen to all that not that you could help it captive audience moving away dyou know how to get an anchor up yes okay ill put the coffee on and start the diesel you look after the winch more gulls now and the din of a donkeyengine on the quay the wail of a siren from deeper among the streets ill try and find george proctor for you she said if you like itd be a great help how much does he owe you or maybe i shouldnt more than im ready to lose i cant promise anything she brought the engine down to slow and span the helm shed put on the khaki shorts again with a sweater over the tee shirt thered been a cool breeze off the sea she was easy in her movements capable in charge of herself not the sort of woman whod try killing a maneating shark out of revenge i asked her why is he dangerous she watched me for a moment wondering i think whether to tell me the last time i was in his flat i was just leaving when the phone rang so i told him id see myself out and he went back to answer it he couldnt see the door from where he was and i stayed a minute to listen to see who it was its not the sort of thing she shrugged but id started to think there was someone else as they say but it wasnt a woman you can tell cant you even when they dont say their names whether a mans speaking to another man or a woman she swung the helm hard over and shifted to full astern can you make a line fast round a capstan yes the launch hadnt followed us in but it had left the reef and was moving towards the marina further along the shore so what was he saying i dont remember much really because it obviously wasnt a woman but i know he said something about going over they suspect ive gone over something like that a gull swooped screaming sighting flotsam anything else she glanced up at me from the line something in my tone was that important he mentioned an embassy your embassy i think the reason why i think hes dangerous is that he sounded like that on the phone you know how his voice can sometimes sound sort of i dont know menacing goes sort of silky it always gave me the shivers and there was a name he used i remember now it was victor look were set up would you jump down and catch the line itll save me whistling for someone i dropped onto the quay and waited not victor viktor there was a phone on the tug but i didnt want to use that one id have to find a booth as soon as i could and do it in private signal ferris proctor has been turned contacts first name viktor at the soviet embassy limbo there was the long black weatherboard wall of a wharf on the right side and a row of capstans on the other side with the sheer drop to the water just beyond them and when i gunned up the rear wheels met a wet patch and slewed and sent the front end smashing through a stack of fish crates and i did what i could to get back on track before i killed someone but it wasnt easy because i was crouched as low as i could below the seat squab because theyd probably try again pickup truck on the left and i grazed the side and tore some metal away someone shouting a twotone cab pulling out from the gap between the wharves but keeping its distance as i pulled the rear end straight and looked for a clear passage but there wasnt one three or four people with bags and fishing rods were walking down from the street and i hit the brakes and we slid and i let them off but the speed was still too high and i chose the only way out that wouldnt hurt anyone and put the car between a capstan and a rusting trailer and flexed the seat belt to make sure it was tight and then they tried again and after that there was just a lot of metal screaming as we ricocheted and hit the trailer at ten degrees and dragged the wings off and the car windows on that side burst into snow and we bounced and corrected and hit the rear end of a private car and swung it round glass smashing again and the pop of a tyre bursting and then there was a shed straight in front of me and at this speed it was going to be a jolt and i sank lower into the seat and settled the belt again and waited with my foot hard down on the brake and the tyres shrilling across the concrete hit the shed with an explosion and the daylight got shut off and the impact pitched me at an angle but i was ready for that because of the belts diagonal and i used my right hand against the facia as the deceleration phase came in and there was the ripping of metal again and then flames bursting in the dark with an orange light and i was feeling for the belt release and the door handle but it was going to be awfully close because wed hit some kind of flammable tank and all i could see was a mass of bright orange waves of heat now and i got the door open and dropped and crawled to the rear of the car because wed come straight through the wall and i wouldnt have to look for a door but the fuel tank was at the rear and i got across the ground as fast as i could with the heat washing down across my back someone yelling in there something like that broken glass under my hands and i shifted them pulling my legs after me a face staring from the near distance with the eyes shielded by the hands a man shouting again get you or something and then i was into the daylight roll over roll over roll clothes on fire presumably then hands grabbed me and the face was close and the mouth said barracuda rolling and rolling and his hands beating at me okay now thats it get me clear i told him i dont want the police i dont think theres time i could hear a siren from somewhere quite close or maybe it was echoing off a wall youve got to cover me and get me out he turned away and i could see the twotone cab turning broadside on to the flames and i crawled that way through the debris until the man turned and said wait wait there i couldnt see anyone else in the area because the whole shed was crackling and there were beams coming down and sending out sparks and i had to crawl further into the open but i kept my face down because id have to go to ground at this stage and hole up and work things out but that bloody siren was closer now and it didnt look as if come on in here a man grabbing for me in the black rolling smoke make it quick the door of the cab had swung open and i went for it with the man helping me because my eyes were streaming show them the bullet holes i told him two of them from the rear bullet holes you got that got it he slung me into the cab keep right down listen i said this is for ferris immediate proctors been turned by the soviets said it again because of the choking i wanted to make sure got that yes ive got that he said and slammed the door shut and told the driver to move it throat still raw kept drinking water decker name of the driver one of ours a bureau cab ferris had kept it standing off with decker on the peep even though id told him i did not want support id sent decker away after hed brought new clothes for me and taken the old ones old christ they were more than old more like the coat off a scarecrow after a lightning strike the phone rang and i picked it up who all right cardinal rule we cant refuse there were two windows north and west because this was a corner room and while i was waiting i took a look from both of them the airport control tower a couple of miles away and some threestorey buildings nearer than that with billboards united overnight to these ten cities marlboro for those who like to smoke coors is the champion no windows overlooking mine at a distance of less than fifty feet on the north thirty on the west a man in the doorway near the bus stop and another one at the corner and two more on the north side twenty yards apart and looking in shop windows and of course thered be more of them on the south side of the hotel where the entrance was prisoner of bloody zenda but they werent there only to give me moving cover whenever i left they were also scanning the environment for possible pollution field glasses behind windows or the hump of a magnum with a laser sight or an infrared night lens so forth they would also note any opposition peeps standing off in the environment or coming into the hotel leaving it hanging around it was ironic if you will that the first thing i always ask for at the start of a new show is that ferris should direct me in the field and here he was blocking me in with so much support that i wouldnt be able to move without saluting the troops come in greenspan he said a soft handshake and charlie chaplin eyebrows dropped his bag on the bed and looked me up and down does anything hurt bit of sunburn im not surprised that was a gasoline fire wasnt it something like that are you from the consulate i look after their staff id like your shirt off its a cardinal rule you cant refuse a medical checkup after youve been through any kind of traumatising action otherwise i wouldnt have let him come up because i wasnt in the mood for coughing and saying ah when there was so much to think about so many questions did she set me up for those shots take a full breath another one now did you feel you were filling your lungs to capacity yes well you were lucky with that seat belt ive seen osteochondritis of the cartilage around the sternum you wouldnt believe you must have taken some of the shock with your right hand even though theres no echymosis ive had people with the belt go halfway through the side of the rib cage have you seen the rainbow what its a movie you should see it this hurt no the launch had moved in to the harbour parallel with the tug and theyd put me in the cross hairs from there or come closer in a car or gone into one of the quayside buildings and climbed though not more than two storeys because the first shot had smashed through the rear window and hit the speedometer at not much more than a fifteen degree angle from the horizontal they rock your head gently now this way feels good there wasnt any whiplash id got my head back on the support before wed hit the other wall of the shed and bounced back are they friends of yours with the field glasses friends perhaps of hers but iflook im going to give you some aloe vera gel for these burns and some propolis ive brought some because they gave me a rough idea what happened he raked around in his bag the sun was lowering across the ocean reddening the wall in here i would need to wait for dark before i moved use the propolis sparingly its quite sticky youre sure you dont have any pain anywhere no pain just a blinding impatience to find things out you must keep yourself in pretty good shape im going to leave you with some dphenylalanine mg take two tablets fifteen or thirty minutes before a meal and make it a total of six per day its on the label here i want no drugs it isnt a drug its an amino acid no toxicity no sideeffects if youd wanted aspirin and antibiotics and all that horseshit youd have had to see someone else it works with lphenylalanine to stimulate the neurotransmitters and the bodys own painkillers shutting the bag soft handshake her majestys picking up the tab is that how you guys put it two numbers there on the bed the second ones my beeper call me any time midnight am whenever if you need me you can expect a bit of delayed shock in the night when the blood sugars low call me okay said i would at the door and get to see the rainbow make time trust me the phone rang a minute after hed gone and i let it go on ringing till it stopped it would be ferris wanting to make a rendezvous for debriefing and i wasnt ready yet thered been too much data coming in and i wanted to do some analysis first on my own flat on the bed with my eyes shut but the muscles wouldnt let go and i couldnt shift into alpha waves because there is no excuse there is no conceivable excuse for putting off debriefing by your director in the field at any given time during the mission delayed shock just as the man said bullshit there is no excuse sweating a little cold on the skin you must surely allow me to express at least a token reaction to being shot at with a trajectory two inches from the back of my skull before that thing smashed into the speedometer to being shot at twice and hitting a shed full of petrol cans maybe more than twice they could have put half a dozen more shots into the inferno and i wouldnt have heard them above the crackling proctor the muscles still tensed the beta waves still whipping me along when all i wanted to do was rest and wait for nightfall west riverside way nightfall because id need to go there alone leave them all down there watching the hotel the crimson light in the room deepening against the closed lids the nerves sending multicoloured firecrakers across the retinae the blood singing through the tympanic membranes the sweat coming faster now and more copiously because there was no excuse to delay debriefing and yet i knew it was what i had to do question it accept dont worry but the muscles wouldnt let go because the subconscious was in panic aware that the organism had gone out of balance that something was wrong appallingly wrong those are your instructions hearing voices send the poor bastard to the funny farm before he starts foaming at the mouth and rolling over the floor embarrassing everyone are these my thoughts get him to a cool white ward with gentle nurses and the goodnight kiss of an anodyne give him another valium shivering in my sweat now they are not my thoughts no hallucinating perhaps theyre not always wrong those bloody medicos you can expect a bit of delayed shock in the night so thats all it is my good friend theres no need to worry just relax it is not all it is deep breaths deep regular breaths to stem the high wild racing of the heart the eyes open now because when the organism is in extreme danger we must tune the senses deal how we may with the onrush of desperation to know to understand what is happening to divine how to rescue the beleaguered self how to survive west riverside way at any time before midnight but not later than that all then in that place would be answered some kind of sleep came a swirling world of random phantasmagoria carrying me along through the dark and keening streets of nightmare and throwing me at last onto the bedrock of reality the sweat running as i woke and caught a breath and let it go drained and bereft of strength but somehow purged and at ease again ready to accept and follow the instructions on the way to the bathroom my legs faltered and i knocked into the door but didnt fall ran the cold tap and filled the basin leaning on it and burying my face my head as i drew water into the parched body seeking to quench the insatiable thirst that burned in it now because fear does that terror does that it leaves the mouth dry as a husk back in the room the wash of ruddled light had gone from the wall and in its place was the acid sheen from the streetlamps outside the north window and it was nightfall as far i told him as your next stop he didnt answer but got another crate and took it into the building the engine of the van was still running stink of carbon monoxide filling the yard it served both buildings the yard the cedar grove and the restaurant next door i was feeling all right now not perfectly balanced but all right i mean not terrified any more with only a shred of consciousness telling me that i should be nothing had changed which direction he wanted to know a shockhaired blond boy with a halfgrin on his face the whole time amused perhaps or almost certainly by this weirdo hed found in the yard did i look so odd a mirror would do nothing though i dont mean look i mean behave am i behaving oddly any direction i said you dont mind where youre goin humped another crate fish by the smell i just need to get away got cabs in front shivering in the warm humid air but not enough to show i believed i need to get away discreetly he never looked at me he refrained from looking at me in the way that we refrain from looking at a drunk or some poor cretin child because our sense of inadequacy in the presence of the abnormal troubles us he looked at me in that way billy billy it said on the nametab stitched to his overalls he took another crate in and i stood there in the yard and later remembered standing there in the yard like a figure in a surrealistic painting as i waited for this bloody fish peddler to come back taking his bloody time while the deep indigo sky roofing the yard rang with the clamour of drums and alarms as the little lamps winked across the board for barracuda in far londinium and the whole of the network trembled to the urgent tenor of the signals going in subject is missing reported to have gone over to the soviets executive in the field has failed to appear for debriefing following attempted hit director requests instructions re procedure while the executive in the field this hapless weirdo stood waiting for assistance god help him and those dozen people out there in the streets stood ready to give him all the assistance he could ever want but i couldnt ask them not now discreetly he said billy said not looking at me i cant take anyone in my van see look im going to be frank with you billy i cant use a cab because theyre out in front of the hotel and hes waiting there for me who is her old man big grin now bright with the light of understanding you australian are you limey my dad was over there once in the war kenley see i cant ride anybody in my van rules taking for the first time a glance at me conspiratorially emboldened by my not being after all abnormal little bit of love in the afternoon was it i started with twenty but he didnt give it more than a flick of his eye taking two more crates in and coming back whistling a man with a sense of covert communication i gave him fifty and he looked at it long enough to make it seem he was giving it his careful consideration and then folded it and put it into his worn plastic wallet mind you dont slip okay its a metal floor gave me a push and slammed the two doors and dropped the bar and went round to the cab and got in and started up darkness and the ammoniac reek of fish the empty crates shifting as the van took the turns a faint whistling from the cab and deep within me the feeling of having missed the road of going in the wrong direction the nagging urge to turn back cab rank across there mate stressing the mate proud of the bit of cockney slang hed picked up from his dad we were four blocks from the hotel on nw th street wanna take a bit of advice go for the single chicks theyre cheaper in the long run this was at the block at riverside way you dont know the address thats close enough cracked black vinyl and the scent of stale cigarettestubs a blue silk garter thick with dust hanging from the driving mirror albert miguel yglesias on the identification plaque the photograph nothing like his face you wanna good place to eat no i know a good place to eat fillipo grill fantastic oysters this big said really in twenty minutes we turned east into the block and i got out open till midnight great bar too fantastic the street was quiet the restaurants full i began walking they would expect me there at west riverside way sometime before midnight not later but they might also expect me to hesitate as i grew close even to change my mind they might then have people out here in the streets in the rendezvous zone to trap me cut me off if in point of fact i decided to turn and go back the way i had come so i took in the environment as i walked in the cab i would have had no chance of going back if albert miguel yglesias had dropped me anywhere in the block approaching on foot i would have a chance step after step observe a late signal going in perhaps attempted to phone the executive between and hours but received no answer the evening air sticky on the face the noon temperature had been ninetythree degrees and the hygrometer touching seventyfive under my clothes i was shivering again it came in spasms triggered by each new onset of nerves do you know what i felt like on this warm miami evening i felt like a man on his way to be hanged attempted to have a visit made to the executive at there was no answer to the knock forced entry revealed the room empty no sign of disturbance no message left people window shopping the sidewalks were wide here and observation was easy because of so many reflecting glass surfaces and the lack of shadow he was a white caucasian thirty medium build a slow walk with a certain degree of strut so what decided you ferris would ask me to leave the hotel without notifying the support but i wouldnt be seeing ferris again the sky bore down across the tops of the tall buildings its weight buckling them bearing down through the thick and steamy air to press on my head to crush me while the streets perspective widened bellying out like a scene through a fisheye lens but then i suppose it had been a long day and the bullets had come very close and theres always you know a shift in the state of consciousness when youre still walking about still doing ordinary things when by a small margin you have just missed being carried to the ice cold slab and filled with formaldehyde i was feeling the reaction that was all not feeling reaction the voice of panic vigorously to be ignored he was very close now and i moved to the left along the sidewalk and picked him up again in the window standing at an angle in a shop entrance way i hadnt seen him before on the quay or anywhere in the street on my way yes to be hanged in other words following a course that would take me to an imminent death a course from which there was no possible deviation a feeling of inexorability of karma being fulfilled it didnt take away fear terror but it took away responsibility these were my instructions to make the rendezvous your instructions come only from the bureau but things have changed i swung round very fast and he almost walked into me had to jump sideways his eyes round surprised are you okay the way i suppose the way i am certain actually i was looking at him no that is what i said to him and i heard it i was not okay and things had gone terribly wrong you need some help but he was already eager to go not wanting contact involvement with this cokehead this junkie he was you understand no more like an opposition agent of any kind than mickey mouse and it had just happened that wed been moving at about the same speed along the street it happens all the time no no help but hed already gone and i stood there with my head bared to the overwhelming weight of the sky and knew that i couldnt in fact shrug off all responsibility because that would indeed lead to the mortuary and the formaldehyde but oh my god you can have no idea how far it was to the telephone at the end of the block how many desperate encounters were played out as the insubstantial figures leapt from nowhere and from everywhere how many times they came for me squealing for my blood as they dragged me to the hangman the stink of fish sickening to the stomach his madmans inane grin go for the single chicks theyre cheaper lurching on my nerveless legs to the end all the way to the end of the block with oysters this big as the sky crashed at last across the roaring chasm of the street and i reached the phonebox smashing away the flimsy aluminium panel with my shoulder to break the momentum digging for a quarter and forcing it into the slot a pale girl with pimples staring for a little time before she hurried past so that i buried myself against the phonebooth into it in it my back to the street and the people hunched like a pariah dog like a leper yes ferris west riverside way at any time before midnight not later than that yes those are your instructions of course put the phone down make the rendezvous of course without question who is that i am listening i tell you i had to use physical force to keep the phone pressed to my head while the other force did everything it could to pull it away and slam it across the hooks i remember that very clearly i need the breath blocking in my throat yes you need force countering force while i waited in limbo for the outcome the sweat drenching my body as the street reeled roared swept over me i need to debrief clinging to the broken booth like a drowning man to a raft block and riverside way west riverside way hurry for gods sake hurry debriefing four men the clock a jade clock in a gilt frame standing on the desk snowed a little before midnight west riverside way not later than midnight so forth no longer important one of the men was ferris it was a big room ornate in a way dark heavy furniture velvet curtains a pile carpet all very substantial reassuring i felt reassured i felt as if lets get it absolutely straight i didnt just feel as if i had in fact come through something and reached the other side and the other side was here the here and now the true reality but dear god it had left me weak punchdrunk greenspan was another of them he was the only one standing up did you pee in the jar he asked me ferris was in one of the deep leather chairs a thin leg draped over one of its arms what yes great and what is so fucking great i asked him about peeing in a jar he watched me quietly no one spoke it had helped a little the rush of anger but had left me exhausted again in a moment i said im sorry no problem greenspan said what is so great about it is that you remember doing it and we took a little blood right the chaplinesque eyebrows lifting yes needle in the arm out there in the hall i think very good your memorys fine my memory you bet why shouldnt it be fine for christs sake well i guess a shrug a glance across ferris youve kind of had a busy day a hand on my shoulder feel okay now i have never i told him carefully felt better in my life well i can take a hint greenspan said brightly you dont need me around here any more he fetched his bag from the desk leaning across ferris for a moment saying something then he slapped my arm with an excessive amount of good cheer and left us it occurred to me that i wasnt quite straightened out yet too aggressive too defensive but then he was damned right it had been a busy day i shut my eyes for a while less than a minute and the firework show died down behind the lids and left mostly black then i opened them and saw ferris watching me whats this place a safehouse he said i looked around the room again big geographical globe a glassedin case of ivory elephants massive tomes on dark mahogany shelves existential psychotherapy noyes modern clinical psychiatry its a what i got up and looked at the shelves at some of the other titles is this a psychiatrists office yes ferris said its also a safehouse thats why were here i had an urge to walk out and slam the door but a certain degree of reason stopped me a bureau safehouse can be anything and anywhere theres one in the basement of the british consulate in marseilles and theres one in madame labhouets bordello in abidjan on the ivory coast and theres one in the horacio escobar clinic for enteric diseases in downtown santiago so a psychiatrists office in miami florida wasnt untypical jade clock midnight the gilt hands together at the top of the dial in a prayer of thanksgiving rendezvous aborted it is also a sacrosanct rule that once the opposition has made contact with the executive in the opening phase of a mission he is not to approach his director in the field at that directors base since it risks exposing him the dif can only function from an ivory tower controlling the shadow from a distance and keeping clear of the action directors in the field by their nature amass an infinite store of intelligence data every time they go out and their value to the organisation is beyond the price of pearls most retire after sixty and take up golf most shadow executives are dead before thirtyfive or if not uninsurable so it was entirely reasonable that ferris had ordered me brought here from the block on west riverside way for debriefing entirely reasonable whats his name i came away from the bookshelves and dropped into the armchair again a dead weight whose the shrinks dr xavier joachim alvarez are you going to have him check me out only if you ask the quietness came back into the room everyone seemed to be listening im in firstclass condition said it straight to ferris carrying the weight of it in my eyes the shadow executive formally reporting to his dip that he was able to take on any kind of action if the need arose he didnt put anything in did he ferris turned his head a fraction and i realised i was tending to talk in ellipses my thoughts jumping ahead again he said greenspan i mean he only took some blood is that right he didnt give me any dope sedative or anything quietly would you like a sedative no what the hell for be warned this was the second time it had happened a minute ago id thought they were going to have me checked out by the shrink but itd only been in my mind not theirs only if you ask and now it had been in my mind that they might have wanted to sedate me and id been wrong dangerously wrong putting ideas into their heads did i really want a shrink sedation but didnt have the guts to ask for them paranoia relax i was much better now less scared about what was happening to me it was going to be all right what is he going to test me for drugs ferris watched me steadily there was a chandelier over the desk and that was where i was facing can we have that thing out bloody bright what sort of drugs ferris turned his head and one of the other people got out of his chair and went to the wall switch oh ferris said any sort really well come to that he looked less cold now in the softer light from the wall lamps less hostile so we will come to that will we meant i suppose that id been behaving a bit oddly of late damn his eyes id nearly got my head shot off enough to shake anyone up the man sat down again and i said to ferris who are these people upjohn he said turning his head again and purdom i need to know more than that said it with an edge the director in the field calls the shots at every phase of the mission but he is also there to succour support and sustain the executive who may indeed look like a snottynosed little ferret down in the catacombs but who is nevertheless the only man who can bring the mission home and when im brought into a room to debrief and there are total strangers hanging around i want to know who they bloody well are if youll be so kind upjohn ferris said is a sleeper here he knew proctor though not well its possible that he can help us find him if he listens to the debriefing unless you object a small man upjohn with a spotty skin and a slanting eye and a pucker in the face for a mouth terrible haircut stuck up like bristles the kind who can surprise you former lieutenantcolonel in the special services or something like that i dont object i said thank you purdom ferris said evenly is here from london to get experience in the field i jerked my head to look at the man saw red suddenly experience in the what you were in china werent you on pagoda you did mirage didnt you for that bastard loman in morocco jesus christ what sort of experience watch it it mustnt happen a third time this was the last thought i wanted to put into their heads that i couldnt keep my control silence opening like a grave then ferris said gently experience in the united states he hasnt worked here of course entirely reasonable but the thought was still there chilling the nerves id heard of purdom seen him in the caff now and then seen his name on some of the boards certainly the board for pagoda and the one for mirage and possibly others he was one of the highechelon shadows and no one had sent him out here from london just to get experience looking at the wall not at me the wall or the door or whatever was there behind me a dark man bigboned his body hunched in the chair thick hands folded and his legs crossed almost twisted together a quietlyticking bomb with some clothes round it and some hair on top an exaggeration of course but you get the picture it was his nerves i was picking up on his heldin energy i watched him for a moment taking him in not wanting to look at ferris because if i looked at ferris i was liable to put it straight into words get it over with is purdom out here to replace me someone was speaking his voice very soft reaching me as if from a distance it was ferris youre among friends quiller he didnt know what he was saying because he hadnt been there in london when that bastard loman had said exactly the same thing youre among friends friends loman had flinched it was the time when they were trying to get me to think twice about resigning because theyd put that bloody bomb under the driving seat of that truck in murmansk deciding that i was expendable i still couldnt trust these people not even ferris am i among friends but of course his voice still gentle as he watched me with his pale honeycoloured eyes id have to think you know think a little more carefully because this man had saved my skin so many times berlin hong kong murmansk where other people would have left me to rot in the red sector and vouchsafed their sleep with a lie communications compromised opposition in control executive unreachable trust then perhaps this one man among them all because in any case if you cant trust your own director in the field youre dead id proved that in northlight i hadnt been able to trust fane and id come close to getting blown into christendom in that truck all right i said heard myself saying meaning all right i was ready to believe i was among friends im a bit tired thats all of course his voice still gentle and theres a bit of delayed shock hanging around according to greenspan possibly so you might not feel quite ready for debriefing paused giving me a chance to say no not quite ready i said nothing but if youre willing we could make some progress londons a tiny bit fidgety why in a moment first proctor was missing then you i sank into the chair letting the muscles go trying to centre it wasnt going to be easy you sent signals i had to i didnt know where you were it was only for a short and left it i didnt remember how long it had been didnt want to i need to know ferris said why you left the hotel covertly i wanted to walk for a bit without a whole troop of people around me you know i hate support the other two were looking at me now id noticed their heads turn the light catching their eyes they shouldnt watch me it made me nervous ferris ought to tell them not to watch me he was unzipping a flat pigskin briefcase and getting a book out a ballpoint from his pocket opening the book he asked me to walk where oh just around for the exercise west riverside you were shot at ferris said and were therefore revealed as a target for the opposition whose intention it was to kill having been recognised then and set up as that target you obviously realised that this town has become a red sector for you a beat yet you went for a walk in the open street for the exercise i got out of the chair and turned my back on him because it was the only way i could talk to him without letting him see my eyes is this a debriefing for christs sake or an inquisition wheeled on him anger in the eyes now and i wanted him to see it you dont consider that the executive handpicked by bureau one himself for this mission isnt capable of deciding whether he can safely walk in the bloody streets or not folded my arms wrong posture because defensive but too late to change it not one of these bastards looking at me all looking down or into the middle distance embarrassed perhaps because my voice was hitting back from the glass panels of the display case and the lacquered chinese screen in shortrange echoes shouting you might call it you might call it that id been cooped up in that stinking hotel for hours on end and i was still full of adrenaline from the lark on the quay and i wanted some exercise yes and i didnt want half a regiment keeping me under mobile surveillance because it could have attracted attention tried to keep my voice under control failed i think that makes sense but if you think im out of my mind then youd better send for your bloody shrink watching me now ferris was watching me why dont you come and sit down youll feel more comfortable turning his head to the man on his left johnson no upjohn saying quietly see if hed mind joining us for a few minutes the man got up and went out through the door behind him not the one id come in by leading to the hall the other one i looked down at ferris he was making notes in the debriefing book i said the shrink yes went on writing a quietness on me suddenly the anger fading you said you werent going to send for him he looked up only if you asked i think you just did that i turned away moved about he was perfectly right then youd better send for your bloody shrink it had come right out of the subconscious because i knew i needed help and id been frightened to ask for it in so many words i could have gone on lying trying to protect my ego but i didnt because wed got a mission running and something had gone terribly wrong and i had to face it deal with it somehow listen if nothing else i am a professional for gods sake give me that can i have a drink the thirst still burning but of course ferris got up and went over to the table by the couch where there was a decanter and a glass i suppose that was what it was the classical psychiatrists couch id only ever seen them in cartoons if he asked me to lie down on it i would twist his head off at the neck and steady lad you need this man you need him thank you glass of water he looked at me ferris with his pale amber eyes concerned that i should understand if i read them right all is well my dear fellow there will be no misdirection a word normally used in the context of a courtroom but within the bureau the connotation is different a director in the field will sometimes if hes incompetent or devious misdirect his executive and if things are running close it can be fatal im dr alvarez a short man in striped pyjamas and a dressinggown dark eyes not smiling serious taking me in evaluating me reaching for my hand this is keyes ferris told him good yes not taking his eyes off my face why dont we all sit down you have some water would you prefer a glass of wine some whisky this is fine youre thirsty dry mouth of course you had a nasty experience im told do you mind if i sit behind the desk im not trying to look authoritative you must understand its just that i can think better there its my querencia you are not sleepy no it would be understandable if you were its late he swung his legs onto the desk tilting the leatherpadded chair back folding his strong square hands watching me for a bit longer and then turning his head to ferris well now what id like to do ferris said looking at me is to go through a routine debriefing and if you find any trouble with it dr alvarez will make things easier you should know that hes on the bureaus overseas roster and provides us with this safehouse in emergencies his clearance status is prefix meant totally reliable even that being an understatement i could therefore ferris meant go through a debriefing in depth with nothing barred i took a slow breath it still frightened me the memory of what my mind had been doing in the time period following the quay thing and the debriefing wouldnt be easy even with alvarez here ferris glanced at him now and i think alvarez nodded only the slightest movement of his head then ferris looked back at me all right im going to ask you again why did you leave that hotel covertly it went on echoing in my mind covertly covertly and i realised that something was happening to me something i couldnt control but my voice sounded all right a fraction terse that was all i didnt go there isnt that the important thing ferris watching me didnt go where and then the whole thing blew up and i was on my feet and standing over ferris shouting at him cant tell you the other two men suddenly on their feet as well and moving towards me very fast cant tell you for christs sake dont you understand sacrifice her breast brushed against me her skin coppercoloured in the subdued light a powdering of dried salt on her shoulder theres a special one out there somewhere that you want to catch that want to kill green eyes alighting softly on mine the eyes of a mermaid of a succuba you will go to west riverside way at any time before midnight flash flash from the field glasses across the water not later than that her skin bronzed the down silken above her breasts the light flashing flashing on the cylinder of the syringe can we use your phone watchful amber eyes the tick of the jade clock but please the sea had calmed there was no movement now get them onto it straight away a man one of the men johnson no upjohn blotting a walllamp out as he passed across my line of vision the faint beeping of the pushbuttons make a note west riverside way a shadow across my eyes then its substance alvarez well now how do you feel his dark face with its black silk beard his gaze intent how do you feel now all right good he rolled my sleeve down what was in it the syringe on the tray valium he took the tray away we want you to check out that address upjohn phoning utmost caution ferris said on the dial of the jade clock an hour and twenty minutes time gap i cant tell you for christs sake dont you understand the last thing i remembered use utmost caution upjohn said into the phone its an esoteric bureau term reserved strictly for when for instance youre defusing a motiondetonator bomb i looked at ferris but he was at right angles everything was theyd put me on that bloody couch ferris i got onto my elbows and swung my legs down no shoes hello he said did i tell you yes the address yes but tell me again just to confirm silence and time going by where are my bloody shoes tell me again he said gently oh for christs sake west riverside way now where are they somebody fumbling around with my feet take i heard upjohn saying as many people as you need alvarez pushing my feet into my shoes i can do that i told him did you hear that doc ferris was asking oh yes we are ourselves again sounded terribly pleased ferris said to upjohn strictly observation no entry no contact i can tie my own laces i told alvarez listen how did you get that needle into me i dont like needles report directly to me ferris said he was making notes on the debriefing pad the whole time you lost consciousness we had to catch you before you put that thing in yes the stress had become overwhelming you didnt want to answer his question do you remember report directly to the dip upjohn was saying i dont know i dont know what i remember i think you do its a little alarming to you thats all but theres no more block block psychotraumatic inhibition youll feel better now its all behind you small pearly teeth showed in the black beard behind me thatd be a relief that would be dear god a relief can i have some water round the clock upjohn was asking yes ferris told him then looked at me when you phoned for us to bring you in you sounded in a bad way what had happened it was like thinking back through a veil having to reach for the past nothing but you sounded dead beat amber eyes watching me thank you i drank the whole tumbler straight off it tasted odd did i it tastes a bit odd i told alvarez everything will for a little while your body chemistry has to adjust there was a great deal of adrenaline in the system and then there was the valium im so pleased he said to see you in such good shape thank you i got off the couch and found a chair and dropped into it purdom the topechelon shadow got up and went across to the decanter and filled my glass again which i thought was nice of him yes i told ferris i was dead beat thats absolutely right i was fighting something off and you won alvarez at the desk again his feet on it but it left your reserves critically depleted ferris asked fighting what off it meant going back and it frightened me i had never known such a force applied against me such dominance i id been told to go there and i knew i shouldnt but i had to kind of compulsion upjohn came back from the phone and couldnt find a chair i think i was sitting in it now you did well alvarez said still pleased others would not have resisted youve no idea how strong it was the compulsion oh but i have it was so strong that your resistance left you dead beat to the point where you couldnt resist any further when you were asked why you left the hotel covertly you lost consciousness rather than explain the intercom on his desk began ringing it was a remarkable manifestation he picked up the phone si mi querida ferris got up and dragged the carved oak chair closer to mine and sat down again with his pad you also said when you were coming out from under those are your instructions do you remember that todavia no es una emergencia yes i was following instructions dont worry ferris said id started shaking hadnt thought it showed more water date vuelta y duermete mi querida alvarez put the phone down ferris asked me quietly where did they come from the instructions i dont know damn you i dont know they all brought their heads up it had sounded very loud alvarez hadnt moved perhaps id woken his wife upstairs shouting like this hed just told her on the phone it was an emergency case i had to get control alvarez said to ferris he really doesnt know you must understand its very frustrating for him ferris was watching me dont worry take your time we havent got any time the mission had been running only fortyeight hours and proctor had gone to ground and the opposition had put the executive into the crosshairs and got right inside his mind and left instructions there and id come appallingly close to walking straight into a trap there wasnt a chance to run that through again ferris i said theres something that doesnt match they wouldnt go for me with a hit and get inside my head with subliminal instructions at the same time ferris was making notes they wouldnt have told me to go to that address if they didnt mean it theyd set it up as a trap and i couldnt walk into it if id been shot dead first upjohn said unless you were given the instructions after theyd failed with the hit what no i was given them before we were back in harbour before the shooting ferris asked quickly how do you know when because of her breasts straight from the subconscious he tilted his head say again alvarez was leaning forward now when i was coming to i had visual impressions of the girl on the boat harvester but i dont there was a voice alvarez said overlying the visual impressions feeling of panic suddenly i reached for the glass and drank hand not quite steady did they notice yes the voice was in the background she was talking too but in the foreground panic because it had just occurred to me that there could be other instructions still inside my head like a worm in an apple there was music alvarez a radio playing no purdom looked across at him it could be radionic remote beamed at what distance i asked him im not too conversant ill talk to parks ferris said he was the electronics man whod checked proctors flat for bugs there was a launch i said and told him about the field glasses it followed us into harbour noted but this inconsistency they wouldnt have put those instructions into your head and then put you under that gun upjohn said be unwise to assume it was the same cell i mean the whole things open isnt it the drug scenes very big here eighty per cent of the cocaine used in the states comes in from cuba a lot of it by sea the harvester girl could be running stuff herself or for one of the cartels they mightve thought you were an undercover man for the coast guard or something bang bang happens all the time do you think shes in drugs ferris christ i said i wouldnt know if shes american english he turned the top sheet of his pad over and said all right can you take a debriefing on harvester yes it took forty minutes because there was a lot of material her relationship with proctor and her present feelings about him hes trash and the phone call shed overheard and everything wed said on the boat and of course the points ferris picked on did she try seduction no but you mentioned her breasts she was in a bikini and bra there would have been alvarez said a certain amount of dream content surfacing when you were coming to we tend to undress women in our sleep ferris thanked him and turned back to me the launch he said did you think she knew what it was doing there i got out of the chair weakness in the legs getting up quickly to make it look all right but ferris caught it when did you last eat quiller lunch on the boat protein then alvarez said at once and came out from behind his desk you need some protein cheese yes would some mozzarella appeal debriefing went on the field glasses you say she noticed them this is complicated i thought it through and then said one scenario is this i noticed them and of course said nothing she saw them innocently and called attention to them a bit annoyed or she noticed id seen them and called them to my attention to clear herself in case i thought shed seen them and wasnt saying anything because she knew all about them knew all about the launch did she make anything of the fact that the launch followed you in no do you think she saw that it had followed you in i was watching for that but i cant be certain i was tying up the boat weve got photographs of her of course i had a man with a zoom on the quay when did you put her under surveillance before you got there youre keeping her under surveillance but of course his amber eyes on me i know it hasnt escaped you that she might have set you up for that hit on proctors orders in a moment does that trouble you no but i said it too quickly and he caught it he can catch flies in flight perhaps a little making a note shes not unattractive and youve got some sympathy for her because of what happened to her father are you putting down what i think or what you think tone with an edge i was leaning with my back to the bookshelves wanting to move about restless not able to because of the weakness not wanting to sit down because i was being put on the defensive debriefing always has that element in it because youre asked to give reasons for things you said and things you did to justify every move you made and take responsibility for every signal every strike every mistake and what makes it difficult is that you said those things and did those things in hot blood with the dark coming down and nothing between you and the unmarked grave but a random blow or a desperate lastditch run that in the cold light of enquiry are seen as illadvised and potentially hazardous for the mission the one sin above all others debriefing can leave the spirit naked and sometimes we rebel are you putting down what i think or what you think he didnt answer and with good cause as the director in the field he had the right the sacrosanct obligation to record events as he saw fit because when the executives back is to the wall hell say anything to protect himself some morose and missionweary shadow with a penchant for statistics has worked it out slumped over a teastained table in the caff with his busy abacus that in the first three phases of a mission the executive in the field has been pulled out and replaced on four occasions out of ten because his debriefing proved that he couldnt handle the demands on him couldnt control the field couldnt proceed without increasing the risk of blowing his own operation or half the bureaus ultraclassified files and whoever they are we forget their names because it scares us to remember them when you asked her for a diving lesson did she get you to sign a waiver in case of accident what yes what address did you give the hotel the first one she phoned you there when twentythree minutes after the shots were fired what did she say she left a message asking you to phone her back she sounded he checked his pad agitated then she must have seen me pushed into the cab not necessarily she could simply be living in the hope that youd got clear in some way no one upjohn said saw him getting into the cab i was there her number this was purdom youll get all that ferris told him if theres anything you can do purdom shut up again i wished he wouldnt just sit in that bloody chair and brood i could feel vibrations coming out of him that jarred the nerves and i tried the whole time to ignore the man because the truth couldnt be faced he could have been called out here to replace me the minute the debriefing was over and hed seen what the opposition had already done to the shadow in the field and didnt like it what would i do then if london sent instructions to pull me out of barracuda go to ground vanish and work from the dark from the silence of the catacombs a pox on them there is nothing worse my friend for the executive in the field than to be replaced to be sent home crippled with his inadequacies bringing nothing with him but the news of a lost cause and leaving behind him nothing but his bloodied tracks nothing worse you understand than professional ignominy the irretrievable loss of face correction yes there would be at this phase of this particular mission one thing worse you said ferris that harvester repeated word for word a political diatribe youd heard before from proctor yes i noticed alvarez shift in his chair ferris said quietly how could you remember it word for word i and left it i didnt know could you repeat it now alvarez word for word yes beginning to sweat because i remembered how kim harvester had looked when shed gone through the same material on board the tug stabbing at the peach stone with the knife withdrawn robotic ferris looked at upjohn tape sure he got the recorder and waited with his finger on the button when youre ready ferris said it was frightening because i went straight into it without any hesitation bringing it out at a measured pace hes a statesman with a world view that we havent seen since nixon half his face in shadow beside the brass hanging lamp very much hope the thatcher government realises what weve got in mathieson judd the first stirring of the wind as the eye of the storm began moving across the town his understanding of the internecine struggle for power inside the kremlin my voice distantseeming the words unnaturally paced until it was finished and the voice stopped and i looked up to see alvarez watching me leaning forward intent finished ferris yes the skin crawling upjohn shut down the recorder no one spoke so i said what did i look like short silence and then upjohn said bit switched off you were in an altered state of consciousness alvarez said somewhere between alpha and theta waves i got the decanter and emptied it into the glass only half full took it at a gulp while upjohn asked alvarez where the tap was that was where i picked it up i told ferris i got visuals with it proctor yes but i mean it wasnt just that hed told me that stuff viva voce i wouldnt have remembered it word for word i was picking it up from the background just as he had before yes the same subliminal source again alvarez asked was there music playing no nothing in the background ferris was making notes is that all youve got in your mind about mathieson judd yes poured some more water and drank it you dont know anything about the elections no you havent followed the news christ i said i havent had much time to read the papers so you have no ideas alvarez said about senator judds chief competitor governor anderson no the water was cool and i savoured it except of course that hes trying to tell the voters that theres so much wrong with america after the republican fouryear term that the country needs taking apart and rebuilding the water cool in a dry mouth a quietness in the room as deep as the quietness that snow brings whereas judds theme is reassuring the countrys in good shape and all we need to do is consolidate the gains that have been made under the present administration the glass making a small musical sound when i put it back on the silver tray the quietness settling go on someone said gently so its not a question of whether each argument is right or wrong but a question of which message is the more likely to appeal to the nation obviously senator judds and then after a long time i couldnt hear my voice any more and i saw ferris leaning across the desk talking to the psychiatrist and purdom watching me from his chair and upjohn switching off the recorder id been walking about i think and now i sat down ferris was facing me suddenly do you know how long you spoke for no nineteen minutes with no interruption i felt drained emptied of something looking up at ferris not wanting to believe it that bad do you know what you were talking about yes andersons campaign theme and judds theres nothing buried alvarez said you must understand the material is quite near the surface an integral part of the conscious even though it was ingested subliminally by the subconscious ferris sat down again and got his pad offhandedly not looking at me have you any more instructions the nerves sent a tremor through the organism in a moment what instructions still not looking at me busy writing i mean is there anywhere youve got to go anything youve got to do its only a thought you dont need to worry about it time going by while the skin chilled under the sweat and their faces watched me not with their eyes with their heads turned listening instructions after a long time no i dont think so i dont know and then i was on my feet suddenly and looking down at alvarez how much stuff have i got in there for gods sake how much more he said we may never know ferris made a final note on the debriefing pad and put it into his briefcase and looked at alvarez may i use the phone doctor by all means i need to call london i understand the switch is just under the desk here at the door he said i shant be far away if you need me did he expect me to go berserk or something control yes mea culpa ferris went behind the carved redwood desk and picked up the phone and sat with it elbows on the big green blotter his eyes nowhere thinking then he dialled i got up again not wanting to go on sitting there waiting moved about a little took another look at those bloody elephants god what a waste of a good tusk we may never know like an echo in the mind how big then was the worm in the apple how healthy how vigorous as big as a snake as a dragon miami ferris said get me board board was for barracuda in the fair city of londinium with the doubledeckers jamming piccadilly circus and the taxis dodging through the gaps their black tops bright with rain yes good morning im switching to scramble i have no wish not the slightest wish to go to london whatever they say whatever they decide purdom moved now got out of his chair he was like me couldnt just sit still nursing his nerves if you were to ask me for whom the bell tolled i would tell you that it tolled for him too is mr shepley there he would make a good psychiatrist this man ferris looks the part thin ascetic totally calm though perhaps he is a shade too coldblooded and of course might even find it not abnormal for a patient lying there on that bloody couch to explain that his problem was that he couldnt stop strangling mice yes sir theres been an unexpected development and ive asked monck to fly in from nassau hell be here in twenty minutes i havent worked with him before and i need to know whether he qualifies for major classified one decisionmaking purdom was standing by the bookshelves looking at the titles if thats what you want to believe i suppose i hated him in an infantile way because there was nothing in his square balancedlooking head i mean nothing coiled there no worm yes i can give him the whole picture weve just interimdebriefed the executive upjohn hadnt budged from his chair i didnt like him much either not because of his acne or his broomhead haircut of course i disliked his detachment or rather his ability to detach himself from what was going on i could believe his blood was colder than ferriss if there were any in his veins at all all right sir understood do i fax the debriefing he said a few other things that werent important the important bit was over now i knew that but i hadnt heard shepleys answer to the question i wasnt looking at ferris when he put the phone down had my back to him i heard him flip the scrambler switch and get out of the chair monck was in croders place he said before he left london hes still on that level overseas section id turned round and was facing him whatever decisions have to be made he has the power to make them getting his briefcase looking at his watch im meeting him at the airport cutting it a bit fine why dont you catch up on some more sleep at the hotel its still secure upjohn will take you there didnt really want an answer these were orders then everyone was moving about and ferris called alvarez back and thanked him for his hospitality and then came with me to the alleyway at the back of the house where there were two cars standing in shadow try not to give it any more thought he told me just try to sleep when ive talked to monck and asked him what were going to do ill contact you probably in an hour or so got into his car but i like the town because its crazy upjohn drove through the lit streets knew his way i sat beside him like an aristo in a tumbril ferris knew what was going to happen already but couldnt give london the whole picture without faxing it and there wasnt really time even for that barracuda couldnt go on running without an executive and the only executive it had was a man who might at any time break loose and start following instructions he wasnt even aware of at this moment and instructions that could tell him to blow the whole thing up shivering a little not unexpected its got everything after all drug trade casinos refugees the mafia you name it sight more interesting than streatham i suppose i answered him now and then on the way but i dont remember clearly when we got to the hotel he opened the gates at the back and drove the car through and got out to shut them again before i left the car feel like company play some poker i thanked him and said i needed some sleep and he nodded and stood there in the halflit yard until i was inside the hotel lying in the dark with my clothes on watching the reflection of the traffic lights at the corner of the street below listening to the creak of the plumbing and the thin whistling of the first jet landing as the night drew towards dawn i looked at this thing in the face and got rid of illusions there would be only one thing worse yes than being sent back to london and seeing my name gone from the board and the final entry on the form id have to sign executive recalled from mission only one thing worse than losing barracuda and handing over to purdom and that would be for them to order me to stay with it and do what i could because the only reason for their doing that would be to find out what i would do if they gave me room where i would go if they set me running again how they could profit if the worm in the apple went on eating and drove me across hazardous ground into a red sector into a trap and that would be terrible to run through these streets not as the shadow for the mission but as a rat in a maze an experiment a subject for sacrifice that would be their only reason for keeping me in red to green amber to red a toilet flushing on the floor above a jet turning onto the taxying lane with its sound and the echoes fading red to green and the silence settling in and then the explosive shock of the phone bell jarring the nerves i reached for the receiver theyre leaving you in ferris said my hand clammy on the smooth plastic the dark room crowding me a sense of disbelief i suppose i wanted it spelled out for me so that there shouldnt be any misunderstanding my name is still on the board for barracuda someone was whistling down in the yard as daybreak came your name is still on the board for barracuda so help me god newsbreak shes petite strawberry blonde violet eyes great cheekbones very trim age thirtyone makeup highlight the cheekbones deep eyeshadow hairspray she applied her own lipstick impatient with her cosmetician small curt gestures eyes on the mirror on her face most people hate her especially men who have to work for her under her the shows director technicians those people she enjoys emasculating them the hand of the big clock moved to but there was no significance attached to this she wasnt going out live tonight this show was to be pretaped i dont know why she normally goes out live there was some messup i guess you may find out when youre there i could only see part of her waist up through the glass partition two of the monitors were blank the third was showing a buick ad she can use that kind of clout you see chuck baker called in by ferris to brief me on her because some people say shes arguably the single most accurate and important source of information on current events for onefifth of the american people through syndication programmes okay other people say thats just hype but id say its a close guess the nielson media research figures give these are my views twentyone million households per broadcast she threw off the makeup gown and crossed into the studio moving with care to preserve the fluffedup lustergel coiffure looked at her hands set the tourmaline ring facetuppermost checked her nails other people came in now two men and three women some of them technicians with audiogear clipboards papers one of the men switched on the teleprompter and checked the display i could see her better now this was one of the monitor rooms and someone had come in a minute ago and asked where harry was and i told him i didnt know id got the studio lapel pass from chuck baker but i guess its up to you to tell people what youre doing there if they ask okay at this hour most of the studio was dark and the man whod asked about harry was the only one id seen she and brokaw were called the sexiest anchors in the industry by a poll conducted last june tv guide printed a joint opinion of influential critics that puts her as the first most trustworthy anchor on the screen in terms of news accuracy and her own deeply considered views shes strictly nonpartisan and that comes through for her though at this time of course shes down here from the national newsbreak network in washington to pitch for floridas senator judd i could hear her voice faintly now through the panel as she began rehearsing the other people were moving about the whole time now checking equipment and one of the monitor screens lit up and began showing her image as a camera started shifting its angles zooming in on her face pulling back to headandshoulders in the last quarter her show cost a night and brought in giving a profit for the network of more than a minute they pay her a million dollars a year and shes obviously worth it with all the syndications thrown in one of the technicians was taking a quick bite at a sandwich as she worked and the anchorwoman said without turning her head no food in here you know the rules this isnt a goddamned construction site a man looked in from the corridor and one of the crew put his thumb up and the man went out again cameras im ready jeff wheres harry he took a day off and forgot to tell anyone jesus get phyllis in here erica whats our timing when im ready ill tell you shes a legend in her time already she can go into a studio cold turkey and in ten minutes you can start the cameras and she can hit thirty or forty million people with the kind of charm and authority and sheer presence that hasnt ever been seen before offstage shes gotten a reputation for being a real personal bitch but onstage shes got a redlight reflex you wouldnt believe the minute the light goes on she projects herself right into those twentyone million households and stops everything right there and all people can do is watch you know something she could stop a family fight knives guns you name it without even leaving the studio bennie uh cut those lights sorry erica the backdrop behind the anchor desk was a map of the united states covering the whole flat with a backlit transparency of downtown miami by night one of the onscreen monitors lit up with a still headandshoulders shot of senator mathieson judd smiling and waving she is also and this is pretty rare in the industry shes also of what they call good family they came over on the mayflower and jonathan cambridge ii is the founder and president of marlborough chemical bank she doesnt mix very much in high society she went through a leftist kick just out of high school and left the ancestral home to live by herself in a sixthfloor coldwater walkup on lexington for two years but the pedigrees there if she needs it she could walk in to just about anyones country house and theyd ask her to stay some people were moving one of the theatrical flats and adjusting the lights a man was kicking cables clear and using duct tape another monitor screen came live with a tight head shot of the woman at the desk and the camera pulled back the girl whod been eating the sandwich loaded the teleprompter and checked it and stood away not looking at the woman at the desk but just waiting others were standing back one of them twisting a rubber band round and round his fingers there was no sound now bennie is that your stuff hanging there yes ill for gods sake put it somewhere else its distracting me jeff are we ready when you are all right lets go a flood of light no movement anywhere until her eyes had reacted to the glare then her head tilted to look straight up at the teleprompter and the red lamp came on at the main camera and she flashed a brief brilliant smile goodevening im erica cambridge and these are my views yesterday in new hampshire it looked as if senator mathieson judd was for the first time pandering to the dictates of those on his campaign staff who have been trying to persuade him to throw in a little healthy theatricality as josh weinberg of the post has put it to counterbalance the republican candidates serious and perhaps solemn approach to the matter in hand but in my view ladies and gentlemen the matter in hand is indeed serious and indeed solemn nothing less than the task of your goodselves the people of choosing the man who will become one of the two and i say this advisedly one of the two most powerful statesmen on this planet pause a glance to the papers on the desk to give weight to the silence the violet eyes lifting again and senator judd himself knows the seriousness and the solemnity of this occasion and had more than once declared himself categorically disinterested in cheapening his respect and regard for the electorate so what happened yesterday in new hampshire was not rehearsed was not premeditated it was real some of you were there i believe you saw the little boy with the childishlylettered placard on his chest reading i have aids but its okay to hug me you saw mathieson judds instinctive move towards him in the crowd brushing aside his bodyguards you saw him hug that little boy and if you were close enough you saw the sudden springing of tears on that mans face as he stood with his arms around his small suffering fellowamerican for those few seconds of amazing grace and again a pause but this time her eyes remained on the teleprompter i do not think ladies and gentlemen that i need to translate that scene into the banality of mere words for you allow me to say only that those who consider senator judd a figure of almost majestic dedication to the serious and solemn business of leadership those who consider him as no more than an intellectual devoid of feeling should now rejoice in the knowledge that he is also a man of heart and it is this above all that we must have in the white house a man who will not only lead this nation with the high skills of management and statesmanship but a man graced with humanity her eyes on the teleprompter for two seconds three then she looked down and shuffled the papers havent seen you around here before mr keyes faint smell of sweat im not surprised hed come in quietly a minute ago and id checked his reflection in the glass panel without looking up thickbodied blandfaced moved like a cat sitting beside me now been working out somewhere and hadnt had time for a shower youre not surprised i wished hed go away but governor andersons theme erica cambridge on the monitor screen is that theres so much wrong with america after the republican fouryear term mr keyes he didnt know me hed read the name on my lapel pass if you want to talk to me youll have to do it when miss cambridge has finished whereas senator judds theme is reassuring the country is in good shape i could have read this for myself word for word the chill came creeping hadnt expected it id been trying to think it was all over now done with the subliminal infiltration of my mind i have to check up are you with the crew he was nothing to do with the studio he was probably her bodyguard blue suit black shoes rubber soles to consolidate the gains that have been made under the present administration word for word i remembered ferris leaning across the desk talking to the psychiatrist purdom watching me from his chair upjohn switching off the recorder then ferris had turned to me do you know how long you spoke for no nineteen minutes with no interruption do you know what you were talking about yes andersons campaign theme and judds i sat for a long time watching the woman with the violet eyes listening to the words she spoke the words that i had spoken before when had she thought of them written them the man had gone out is to thank you for letting me be with you this evening im erica cambridge and these are my views brilliant smile hold fade credits i waited until most of the people had left the main studio then i went in there who are you the bodyguard hadnt followed me in either id cooled him off or he didnt want to start anything that could bring cambridge down on him for being stupid for all he knew i could be the head of the studio my name is richard keyes i dont know you we need to talk getting her long slim snakeskin bag checking her watch swinging towards a door bennie you want me voice off where did you put the transcripts i sent them for copying all of them hes doing them tonight theyll oh for gods sake i need the originals to take home his face in the doorway patient enduring i sent them ten minutes ago erica and theyll be back here practically now next time bennie get it right she picked up one of the phones on the desk remembered me and said you can make an appointment through my secretary i said we need to talk tonight i dont know you please leave she dialled and i went to the main door george proctor sends his regards the bodyguard was waiting for her outside and she came past him and caught up with me at the elevator who i havent time i said to make appointments she wasnt biting her lip but it looked like that her makeup girl had taken off the heavy studio masque and fluffed the gel out of her hair and she looked younger and more human how much time do you have well play it by ear i need to make one short call okay turned to the man in the blue serge is the car there yes maam go down and wait it was when we came out of the building into the street and got into the limousine she leaned across the small marbletopped table when did you see him last ferris had told his people to check on the second most frequent number on george proctors telephone bills and it had been unlisted but theyd got around it through contacts and the name theyd come up with was erica cambridge two nights ago she looked away was he with anyone i think she regretted it immediately but of course it was too late yes shed learned already and just went on watching the people has he contacted you since then no have you contacted him no hes missing i was watching her carefully and there was a lot of reaction in the eyes as she brought them back to me and looked down too late again you cant say someones missing when you saw them so recently he took everything with him i see she straightened up pulling the white silk stole round her bare shoulders have you been here before i suppose id looked interested in the environment which was true enough two of the bureau people had come in here soon after we had and taken up station near the doors i didnt recognise anyone else but that didnt mean i was safe i hadnt seen the marksman on the quay or anyone else in his cell and they could be in here now sitting with a coffee playing the juke box using one of the payphones no i told her hadnt been here before the neon sign outside had said kruger drug its rather like schwarbs pharmacy she said on the strip in la but thats gone now this was just a drugstore at first but it stayed open all night so people came in here for company nightclub types looking for something different latenight workers actors that kind of crowd now theres just everyone cuban traders cops drug dealers the survivors of family fights you name it coffee yes they have nineteen different kinds she waved to someone and the brilliant smile flashed and died again leaving the nerves showing just under the skin it could have been because of her job or her temperament i didnt know anything about her except that she might know where proctor was that remains your immediate objective ferris not really my immediate objective was to stay on my feet and run through this town while they watched me followed me waiting to see if there were anything left inside my head any traces of the subliminal material that had been put in there waiting to see if the worm were still in the apple eating its way through waiting over there by the doors sat here feeling the chill but id have to get used to it for christs sake deal with it find proctor and the rest would take care of itself proctor had been turned and gone to ground and for all i knew hed been the principal whod set me up for the kill down there on the quay hi dorothy the smile flashed again she liked being seen came in here probably to be seen but at the same time wanted privacy which was why shed chosen this table right in the corner and put her bodyguard close enough to fend off anyone she didnt want to see i liked your show i said thank you which of the nineteen what oh whatever youre having the girl went away with the order i had to tape it because theres a meeting tomorrow evening with the senators campaign manager and im invited the presence of her bodyguard two tables away would not of course do me any good if anything started nor would the presence of the two bureau people the whole town had become a red sector two days after the mission had begun running and that put me at great risk but there hasnt been a single operation in the bureau records that didnt go through the endphase with the executive working on the very edge of extinction its the nature of the trade and there was the obvious possibility that if i could find proctor at some time during the last hours of this night i could turn him in for interrogation and give them a chance to shut down the board for barracuda if they could get him to break that little scene i said in new hampshire was it true she looked down in this business truth is what you make it thats the only way to play who else was there that night with proctor yes a friend just leaving a woman it wasnt a question yes i think theyd been having a row as a gesture and she doesnt know where hes gone i havent asked her i dont know where she lives the bodyguard stood up suddenly turning two women away in speech at a distance the vowels stand out better than the consonants and when wed come in here id heard ameidge from several tables and now there was auohah from one of the women with small moans of disappointment the guard sat down again sugar no i want she said without looking at me to find george proctor very much so do i perhaps we can help each other if you want to tell me the places where he used to go i can have them checked out it wasnt necessarily a thin chance proctor was a topechelon executive and he knew how to go to ground without leaving a trace but he could be operating as part of a cell or part of a whole network and hed have to keep in contact and that would be where i could find him by catching a stray signal tripping on a wire crossing a courier line and working inwards from there i knew one thing it could be fatal to underestimate proctor monck briefing me in nassau three days ago what it does concern is the upcoming american election in which of course senator mathieson judd is actively engaged it also concerns the balance of power between east and west as it exists at the present time which is precariously let me put it this way if the extent of things proves as farreaching as weve begun to believe i shall find it difficult to sleep soundly in my bed proctor had been turned and gone over to the soviets and for all we knew he could be at the very centre of the opposition network the centre of an organisation that had moved in on me the instant they felt i was a danger the instant when id telephoned proctor to say i wanted to see him theyd searched my room and tagged me through the streets and put me in the cross hairs and infiltrated my brain within hours of my arrival in miami whoever proctor was operating for now they were important perhaps international even multinational and he would have a major role to play i can tell you erica cambridge said the places where he used to go yes but i doubt if youll find him there we could find traces thats all we need i think i should tell you a moment of hesitation but she decided to go on i think i should tell you that my need to find that man isnt personal she was looking down again she did it a lot i said are you sure oh yes yes in spite of my asking you she left it asking me about the woman if its not personal i said its political in the united states of america within ten days of the presidential election the way a dog scratches a flea is political but with george proctor hesitation again its something even more than political theres something going on that this time she broke off and her eyes became wary mr keyes did i get your name right i dont have the slightest idea who you are or what you were doing in the newsbreak studios im looking for george proctor sure but a minute ago you said that we could perhaps find traces of him my organisation theres no deal mr keyes her eyes were hard now unless youre prepared to name names i may do that later i said not now her head turned to look at the bodyguard then back to me i have to go soon mr keyes i come here sometimes to you know unwind be by myself i didnt get up you wont find him i said by yourself will you not immediately not for a day or two but well find him then why did you come to me because you might have helped us to find him sooner if we pooled our information wed shorten the time wed rather not wait two days but it wont be more than that youll need longer and you may be too late looking down running a fingertip round and round the rim of the little espresso cup her breath quickening the lift and fall of her breasts under the white silk catching the light from overhead a vibration in her that i halfcaught through the senses halffelt across the space between us at the small round table an emanation from her etheric body from her nerves then she looked up and i caught a touch of fear only two days no more than that when you find him what will you do well get him out of the country very fast watching me steadily the fright still there its important for me to see him first we couldnt allow that looking away now trapped i waited hi erica a woman waving the bodyguard on his feet and turning for instructions cambridge giving a quick little shake of her head it was going to be all right but i put three dollar bills onto the check as a gesture it would be very helpful to you cambridge said leaning closer if you let me see him before he leaves i have a great deal of information on him then give it to me now and youll see him before he leaves thats guaranteed im sorry its the best i can do stood up buttoned my jacket mr keyes is your organisation the british government i would have thought it was rather clear proctors a british national but look get in touch with me some time tomorrow if you want to though im not easy to reach we may i see some kind of id i chose the card with the foreign office crest and dropped it onto the table and she looked at it carefully may i keep this by all means took a purse out of her snakeskin bag put the card away its difficult to talk to you if youre standing up weve talked enough i think and you were working late it was a pleasure mr keyes the fright in her voice now she was looking down again her small hands flat on the marble top of the table with the fingers spread the voilet nail varnish glinting under the light id be glad if youd sit down for a moment is that too much to ask i was surprised because i hadnt expected her to break so completely but this was simply because i didnt know the proctor background and her connection with it it looked critical because as i sat down again i could see that she was having to make an effort to keep control and her voice was shaky now look youve caught me at a crucial time i i need help if that doesnt sound too melodramatic she waited for me to say something said nothing theres no one i can trust you see i mean ive got friends sure associates pressing the table hard and theyre all good people but but i dont know how strong theyd be if things got really rough and none of them know about george proctor okay we were close yes but they dont know about this thing thats happening driving her hands against the marble her eyes wide now then changing narrowing as she caught an inward glimpse of herself and looked up at last and around her in case anyone were watching her eyes coming back to me her voice soft suddenly fierce are you listening to me for gods sake yes you goddamned british you wont give an inch will you her hands off the table now restless brushing the air but im going to take a risk and trust you because im gullible enough to feel reassured by the queen of englands crest on the card you gave me no going to trust me because she desperately wanted information on proctor and id guaranteed her a meeting with him as soon as we found him looking around her then back to me the next ten days are going to be critical for the united states of america and by extension for the rest of the world not politically critical because mathieson judd is a republican and if he gets into the white house there wont be any change but critical internationally globally i have a question since you know george proctor is he a small fish or a big fish it depends on the pond its a very big pond so lets try this would you say hes capable of becoming a big fish in a very big pond i looked away one of the bureau men near the doors was different midnight shift proctor i said is capable of anything that requires cold courage risk and endurance he shouldnt be underestimated thats also my opinion he and i she looked down spreading her hands on the table again perhaps wanting to feel its stability wanting to borrow from it he and i were close personally until quite recently close enough for me to be quite sure he wasnt the advertising man he purported to be though he used his connections with newsbreak pretty well as a front but he still had a reserve i couldnt get through and i believe he was doing things unknown to me that would have surprised me correction alarmed me frightened me not just personally i mean on a geopolitical scale pause i want to get this right on a clandestine geopolitical scale for instance im not saying hes the biggest fish in this thing by any means but i believe hes being used as the prime mover you remember a man called howard hughes said id heard of him someone over there was pointing in this direction one of the waitresses he had a mad dream cambridge said he wanted to buy america in what sense he wanted to control it by buying up its major companies the machinery behind the throne he went a long way but it was the wrong way the hard way the bodyguard was getting to his feet again theres an easier way her voice quieter intense her eyes on me the whole time now to buy america all you have to do is buy one man the president but first you have to excuse me maam the bodyguard held out a remote telephone you taking calls who is it mr sakamoto yes ill take it surprise but no hesitation excuse me mr keyes i picked up a menu so first theyd tried her home and been told miss cambridge was at the studio and then theyd tried the studio and been told that if she werent home she could be anywhere but she sometimes went to kruger drug and then theyd tried kruger drug so they must have wanted to talk to her quite urgently at five minutes to midnight you mean right away looking at her diamente watch oh sure no problem has anything then she corrected it and said ill be there in fifteen minutes and gave the phone back to her bodyguard im sorry mr keyes its something im unable to pass up of course this isnt the place anyway to talk we left the table the bodyguard ahead of us when can we meet again she sounded torn under pressure a woman called hi erica but she didnt turn tomorrow i said ill phone you she gave me her card and as we got to the doors i passed close to one of the bureau men car and he left his table and went out in front of us while i was talking to cambridge in the lobby its absolutely vital she said softly that we get together as soon as possible her eyes with fright still in them ill make a point of staying in until noon call before then the limousine was at the kerbside with a chauffeur at the rear door can i drop you somewhere she asked me i feel like a walk a last glimpse of her face at the smoked window no more than a featureless smudge leaving me with the odd impression that shed been trapped in the big black car obliterated midnight plus seventeen the latenight traffic rolling with very little sound through the streets gathering at the lights and waiting finding release changing lanes to go round the work gangs still clearing debris left by the hurricane the black lincoln ahead of me with two other cars between until the limousine slowed letting them past and turning into the driveway of west riverside way contessa there was nothing i could do this was a residential street large balconied houses stucco and porticos behind trimmed hedges wrought iron gates the residences of old miami money shadows everywhere thrown by the trees and hedges one of the tall ornate street lamps out like a dead eye in the night heat still rising from the stones and the tarmacadam after the days unremitting sun the air moist from the vegetation from the sea i wish to christ it didnt affect me but it always has always will and dont try telling me its all in the days work im not standing for that seed pods dropping big ones spiralling down through the lamplight and hitting the sidewalk with the sound of autumn hail he must have been under their own surveillance for quite a time because they didnt ask any questions they used one car and two men and the snatch didnt take more than ten seconds and the car was gone again more than a snatch because the first man to reach him had broken his spine at the first vertebra and theyd dragged him across the sidewalk and thrown him into the back there was nothing i could do because the distance was something like a hundred yards and it was over before i could have got out of the car and started running and in any case the executive in the field is strictly forbidden to go to the aid of anyone at all because hed reveal his presence and thats what theyll sometimes go for attacking one of the support people to bring the shadow out it was the only thing about this killing that gave me any comfort they couldnt have known i was anywhere in the environment or they would have worked more slowly on him to give me time to get there what was his name then and where was he from and who would tell her one of the personnel staff a woman they did it better im sorry love but theres some bad news about bob the tyres whimpering under the brakes and the doors flying open and the rush of feet and then death in the warm miami night hed tried to run id seen that much turned and tried to get clear somehow because the support people dont carry arms and there were two of them and they were quick very quick i checked the three mirrors again the one inside and the two others id been checking them at short intervals since id passed the limo and made a square and put the trans am in the shadows of trees on the far side of the street and the nerves were raw now because of the death they werent in any kind of intelligence these people their methods were too direct and they had no interest at all in pulling one of us in for interrogation they went straight for the kill i would have to telephone as soon as i could to report what those snivelling creeps in records would call a terminal incident and to warn ferris that west riverside was no longer surveilled it looked like a oneman station and there wouldnt be a relief until eight in the morning because this was the graveyard shift and not thus named for nothing hed been nearer the house than i was and on foot no blame to anyone except possibly to himself id no means of knowing whether hed made some kind of mistake put it into the computer and youd come up with fifty recommendations for doing a surveillance job on foot youre faster more mobile less easily seen so forth and fifty recommendations for doing it with a car youve got permanent cover and armour plating and even though a car makes a bigger profile than a man it attracts less attention parked in a street than a man on foot just standing doing nothing the armour plating hadnt done me any good on the quay but if theres a long shot set up for you it doesnt much matter what youre doing youre in the crosshairs and thats it they could do the same thing again without leaving the house any second from now but the risk was very slight because no one had come close enough to see me to recognise me i was only running one calculated risk and that too was low they were keeping surveillance on the street from the house as a matter of routine and that was how theyd picked up the bureau man just now and they might have noticed this dark blue trans am pulling in to the kerb and staying there with no one getting out fingers on the ignition key they could in point of fact be watching me now as i sat here with nightlenses and a tripod beginning to wonder why the pale blur of the drivers face was still behind the windscreen after twenty minutes they could in point of fact have sent a man out to check on me but he would double and approach from behind and he couldnt stay out of the mirrors turning the key a spasm along the nerves in the right arm from the fingers to the shoulder and the odd sensation of the mind dipping away from reality nothing dramatic just dipping away but dont start the car for gods sake theyll pick up the sound turning the key but slowly the mind working on the muscles with its subtle omnipotent demands the message perfectly clear you will go to west riverside way at any time before midnight not later than that turn the key and wait for the bang of the starter dog against the flywheel and the beat of the engine turn the key with half the mind issuing its unquestionable orders and half swinging fullcircle in a dizzying attempt to get control full control logic startled me saved me its gone midnight no later than midnight they said the hand the fingers coming away and for a little while a sickening wave of fright bearing down it almost happened theyve still got control of you theres nothing you can do to bullshit yes let us be forthright about this sat up straighter both hands crossed on my lap the moment over the danger done with because listen it was only last night when i was one block from here as close as one block and fighting for survival reeling against the telephone box and forcing a quarter in hunched like a pariah dog i need yes you need i need to debrief where are you block and west riverside way hurry for gods sake hurry the wave of fright bearing down bearing away leaving me with my hands cold in the warmth of the night my breath steadying progress progress you understand report to ferris briefly and with confidence lingering effects of the subliminal programming now diminished no major problem in combating man in the mirror im sorry mr keyes its something im unable to pass up her phraseology formal correct that was her metier shed sounded surprised but didnt hesitate yes shed be there in fifteen minutes was there now all you have to do is buy one man the president but first you have to first you have to what the man was coming down the sidewalk on the side of the street where i was parked he was alone and walking steadily his size increasing in the mirror as i watched question what had turned proctor hed been dug deep in the ground on allied territory an established sleeper nursing his wounds a soft job a steady job had he got bored some of us get bored we work for a bureaucracy and that can drive us straight up the wall but i didnt think hed got bored proctor it had been something much more critical than that hed done good work for the sacred bull gone out on some of the major missions and come back with honours put his life on the line time and again and got away with it and in this he wasnt dissimilar to me then what had changed him turned him he wasnt a man to fall for the usual male chauvinist toys money power women he liked women yes but he didnt lack their company kim erica monique perhaps others of course others i would find out who had turned him when i found him they were probably in that house over there with its gracious oldworld balconies and wrought iron gates we already thought we knew how they had changed him by some kind of subliminal programming and the thing that made me really frightened was that id been exposed to the same influence and felt its insidious power the subtle devouring power of the worm in the apple and might be exposed again his footsteps now audible his humped body moving into the chrome rim of the mirror my driving window was down but the one on the passengers side was closed and i could see him more clearly than he could see me because the facia was dark and the street lamps overhead were throwing reflections on the outside of the glass his dark figure came into the edge of the vision field and then the details began to clear he walked with his head down and his hands in his pockets his gait tipping him forward a little as if he were being pushed along away from somewhere he wanted to be or towards some place where he didnt want to goi didnt move with my head at this angle i could see all i needed to see but there wouldnt be anything i could do if he turned within the next second and smashed the window in and fired and kept on firing i didnt think he would do that i thought that one day perhaps tomorrow in a few hours they would do that or something like that because they knew by now that their first attempt had drawn blank walking on he was walking on and they would try again but not tonight or not at least at the present moment because he didnt turn to look into the car didnt know i was here knew only that he was unable to do more than keep moving along the sidewalk pushed steadily from behind towards an undesired destination his humped body arched forward and his head down a lone unwilling traveller in the night and my wellloved and unwitting friend because he had not in fact come to smash the window in and fire and go on but thered been no risk of that oh really well how do you bloody well know you said yourself there was no it doesnt matter what i say for christs sake its what i think its what the fear thinks its always like this when theres a threat to life dont you understand relax yes indeed relax the moment is over and all is well we live on our nerves for gods sake give us a break but governor andersons theme is that theres so much wrong with america after the republican fouryear term that we need major changes whereas senator judds theme is reassuring the country is in good shape her eyes lifted to the telepromter her attitude serious informed i could have given it to her word for word so when had she written it i would have to ask her it could be important the timing and there she was coming out of the house on the opposite side of the street at this distance i couldnt see her face clearly and in any case she was now wearing dark glasses and a headscarf but i know people by their walk and this was erica cambridge crossing the sidewalk under the magnolia tree to the limousine at the kerb her bodyguard with her and another man short deftly moving also with dark glasses on ushering her into the car and getting in after her chauffeur and bodyguard to the front the doors slamming and the lights coming on the moon in its third quarter lowering across the heights of the city a helicopters lights tracing a path along the east horizon over the sea the masts of yachts riding on calm water in the lamplit marina the smell of seaweed that had been torn by the hurricane and brought to the surface to lie rotting under the daylong sun i stopped short of the quay finding shadow the limousine was nearer the row of power boats the engine idling for a moment and then dying away the bodyguard got out first scanning and moving a little away from the car and standing with his back to it containing the environment then the chauffeur got out and opened a rear door and there was cambridge again and the short man a japanese both of them still with dark glasses on he touched her elbow and they moved quickly across the flagstones to the first boat in the marina a motor launch with the crew in white ducks and a name at the stern in gold letters contessa cambridge and the japanese were handed aboard with a lot of courtesy a flurry of salutes they didnt move into the cabin but stood waiting near the rail turning to face the quay the chauffeur and bodyguard had got back into the lincoln and now it turned and headed towards the ramp and the street at first i thought it was coming back but this car was smaller a black sedan slowing and stopping just beyond the motor launch four men got out the moment the wheels had stopped rolling they all faced the way they had come towards the street two of them buttoning their dark blue jackets tugging at them not speaking to each other watching the ramp the limousine came past me less than fifty feet away i turned my head to darken the image as a matter of routine as it rolled to a stop by the launch three men got out the driver and two bodyguards and a third car came down the ramp and took up station behind the limo four men getting out and scanning immediately all welltrained welldrilled the chauffeur was standing at the rear door of the limousine and another man climbed out tall slightly stooping bareheaded dark glasses moving at once to the motor launch as the crew snapped into the salute i recognised him from the photographs that were all over the town senator mathieson judd the republican candidate for the presidency nicko get your fuckin ass outa here right now or youll get your fuckin brains blown all over the place you know what i mean black heavybarrelled suzuki an inch from my face he smelled of chewinggum which way i asked him the quay was narrow here this was more than a mile from the boat marina there were three other cars standing further along towards the warehouses figures near them the glow of a cigarette in the shadows thrown by the cranes turn around make a uturn cmon now a jerk of the big gun lights came behind me and i stopped halfway through the turn an engine idling whos he just a guy whats he doing here gettin his ass out slam of a car door footsteps i left both hands on the wheel in plain sight one of the men standing by the cars further along the quay broke away and started walking towards us dropping his cigarette head up alerted blinding light in my eyes turn this way this way couldnt see a thing just the dazzling white fire of the light who are you charlie smith whatre you doing here im looking for the marina theres ten thousand marinas in this place listen ive seen you before somewhere i shut my eyes against the glare how longs he been here to the other man the black listen im doin my job man i told him to get his ass jesus i think i know the glare blacked out leaving an afterlight under my lids id taken this route because there werent so many overhead lamps the streets up there were daybright and my face was known to a few people among them the man whod had me in his sights yesterday is this you holding a blackandwhite photograph shining the torch on it no i think its you the light dazzling again as he moved it i know my own face goddamn he said this is you said nothing these werent intelligence people id simply walked into some kind of drugtrade situation but they had my photograph hold him there roget okay the suzuki swung up again cut them lights an the motor cmon it was the other man i watched the white man he was walking down to the group of cars his gait busy energised hed sounded pleased when hed looked at the photograph as if it were something to eat he was a fat man with small delicate hands for picking currants out of cake i started thinking about egress about yes getting my ass out of here but the front of the trans am was pointing straight at the water between the rusting mass of a dredger and a timber jetty and even if they let me go it would take a couple of bites with the wheel to get me facing the other way and if theyd wanted me in a rat trap they couldnt have done a better job tomorrow i told ferris on the phone and hed agreed i hadnt got anything urgent to debrief tonight and i wanted some sleep but youve lost one of your people lost the connection wasnt too good the phone box had taken a battering and the armoured cord was frayed i spelled it out for him and his voice was icy when he spoke again i didnt realise wed invited that much attention there was the long shot i said but that had a specific target tonight it was overreaction i knew what he meant in the course of intelligence operations we dont kill off the infantry just for being there a beatingup as a warning would have been the normal response but these people werent in governmentstyle intelligence and that made it even more dangerous because they behaved unpredictably and there werent any rules youll need to be very careful i told ferris if youre going to replace that man telling him his job i suppose because he just said what about erica cambridge ill give you a replay tomorrow but you should know that she went aboard a motorboat tonight in the company of a japanese from riverside and senator judd silence then name of the boat contessa thats a cutter the contessa is a ton yacht anchored in the bay i think he was going to say more about it but changed his mind were getting a lot of information in with a direct bearing on barracuda ill brief you tomorrow over and out he wouldnt sleep well for the rest of the night with a death on his hands hed feel responsible but more than that it would change his whole approach to the running of the mission he couldnt afford to deploy support for the executive or even passive surveillance people in these streets without risking their lives and he wouldnt be prepared to do that its an ill wind i didnt want support he was coming back the white man someone with him a woman he shone the torch on me again and i contracted the facial muscles to bring the ears back and pushed some air into my mouth to fatten the cheeks all i could do is this the guy i couldnt see her face because of the glare in a moment no dont give me that shit he shook the photograph i havent seen him before but he was there for christs sake at the apartment this is someone else a hint of patchouli on the air how long were you with him anger in his voice frustration wanted his currant cake long enough to remember what he looked like this isnt the man well jesus christ this is the face of the guy in the photograph youd better take care nicko dont kill too many for your own sake get back to the car walking away im warning you nicko the scent of patchouli a link with proctor subtle and tenuous but a link and a question why had she lied shed said nothing more than good evening that night in the apartment but i recognised her voice just as shed recognised me a black girl petite slender more than attractive vibrant her arm hanging like a models in the light of the brass lamps the hand turned outwards a little for effect her dark eyes taking me in so why had she lied i havent seen him before out he jerked the door open out of the car he turned to the other man the minion frisk him then he squeezed himself into the car and rummaged around for guns taking the keys from the ignition and opening the trunk and throwing things around the jack and the breakdown kit and the fire extinguisher half pleased with himself i thought at this stage and half worried that hed got it wrong and i wasnt the guy the guy in the photograph dont kill too many shed said had nicko killed the man on surveillance in riverside an hour ago he couldnt have done it himself he wasnt quick enough on his feet with his hands but i didnt think hed even ordered it the setup with riverside and erica cambridge and mathieson judd and the cutter for the contessa was strictly political the setup here was cocaine hes naked nicko but there was the link with proctor was proctor on cocaine okay take him down there and put him in the car in the line not the chewy keep the gun on him you let him go roget youre dead that would explain proctors changed personality if hed got himself into cocaine we started walking and the black boy hit the muzzle into my spine two or three times because hed seen it done in the movies i suppose but it was annoying because he could chip a vertebra and i was tempted to spin on him with the right forearm doing the work there wouldnt be any risk because when a gun gives a man the type of cocky confidence this one was showing then you know hes not paying enough attention and you can take it away from him like a toy from a boy but he wasnt alone here and it wouldnt do any good i needed to get clear as soon as i could and i mustnt rush anything keep movin another prod though i hadnt slowed he was young and fresh out here from jamaica or haiti recruited from some cardboard city on a mudbank by an entrepreneur with a gold watch and a diamond pin and stories of fortunes to be made hey big daddy here i come and i didnt want to spoil everything for him but it would have to come to that behind me i heard nicko swinging the trans am straight and rolling it down the quay on the wall side parking it and cutting the engine slam of a door catching up with us shes parked okay for you limey we dont want anything illegal going on around here a thin wheeze something like laughter pleased with himself he was the pseudo manicdepressive type and i would have to watch him because theyre the most dangerous theyll kill out of caprice i said it was decent of him because i didnt like tickets and we reached the lincoln and the black boy pulled the rear door open and pushed me inside and slammed it and stood away and his voice came through the glass stay in the car mister you wanna live you know he had a point because that suzuki was big enough to blow the whole of the lincoln through the wall without even being selective there wasnt anything i could do for the moment there were three other man standing near the cars all in dark clothing a navy sweater a jump suit no shirts nothing white two of them were smoking they didnt talk sometimes they turned slowly to look at nicko and then they looked away again it was important for me to get the hang of their relationships so that i could work with it at this stage my thinking was that they were all traders except for the boy roget that nicko was in charge but they didnt like him were even afraid of him perhaps because hed killed people dont kill too many nicko and would be ready to kill more i couldnt see monique she must be in the chevrolet parked in front of the lincoln on the facia clock it looked as if they were waiting for a boat because they stood watching the sea the strip of water between the dredger and the jetty it wasnt dark out there the moon was throwing a milky light across the swell left by the hurricane and ships lay silhouetted at anchor a helicopter was working a course from north to south across the port to virginia key presumably a us coast guard patrol if these people were lights and the squeal of tyres under the brakes and the three men stood back nearer the wall one of them bending to look through the windshield then nicko came past the lincoln from behind and was there beside the grey pontiac when it stopped rolling and a door came open and two men got out one of them holding the other in a police grip with an arm twisted behind him both latins wheres martinez this was nicko the driving window of the lincoln was down and i caught most of what they were saying patching a word in here and there to construct the sense hes on his way toufexis had some business were running late for christs sake put him in the big one whats roget doing there like that with the gun weve got someone else in the car same kind of thing for the first time i began to worry its easy to think when there are guns around and the talk is tough and theyre confident to the point of inattention that you wont find it very difficult to get clear ive got clear in situations totally controlled by field intelligence people sometimes kgb people trained and drilled and capable so that in this kind of lax crimeworld setup the danger was in underestimating the odds these men were shipping coke and they were doing it in competition with twenty or thirty major narcotic gangs and that meant they had to carry firearms but they hadnt been trained to use them and they hadnt been through unarmed combat instruction and they wouldnt have fast reactions but to underestimate them could be fatal because it only needed one stray shot and finis and there was the fat man nicko i knew his kind hed been spoiled by his mother and hed grown up to take what he wanted and hurt if he had to hurt when they wouldnt give it up and later kill if he had to kill and it had begun with cake and now it was wealth and power and women and sometimes death if someones death would give him one of those things or all of those things but the thing about him that warned me frightened me was that hed started to enjoy killing and had probably begun to want only those things that would give him the excuse for doing it this was my impression he wasnt uncommon in the terrorist world or the narcotics world but that was no comfort to me he was here now tonight and the cake he wanted was another death my own not there put him in the front roget moved away from the rear door backing off and keeping the gun levelled and ready to swing he at least knew the rudiments the latin would have said cuban moved in front of him with loose jerky steps and his hands crossed over his head as if he knew exactly what had to be done tugging open the front passenger door and climbing in slamming it shut putting his hands on the ledge below the windshield now and leaning his head forward i could hear that he was praying no talkin between you two bastards rogets face at the window but it was the other face that worried me the fat mans he was standing a few feet from the car with his hands hanging by his sides the little pink fingers bunched like the legs of hermit crabs he looked at the cuban taking his time and then looked at me taking his time his fleshy red mouth in the faintest of smiles his small eyes shining weve got someone else in the car same kind of thing chill rising up the spine reaching the nape of the neck the fat man turned away and i seemed to hear the echo of shots whats your name i asked the cuban softly he didnt answer went on leaning his dark head on his arms the tremor in his shoulders never stopping as if he were in fact bending forward under the lashes of a whip i could hear his prayers now tumbling in spanish from his lips his prayers and his plea to madre mia a plea for help madre mia the sibilants throwing echoes back from the facia panel soft as the rustling of dead leaves i left him to it and watched the quay the men standing there nicko had his eyes on the water now like the others and sometimes looked at his watch the others werent talking together nor to nicko the black had his back to them his gun still levelled at the lincoln his jaws working on the chewinggum when the cuban took his hands off the ledge i asked him again whats your name its too late he said i think he was at the stage where he realised he wasnt alone in the car and wanted to voice his thoughts and that was more important than my question too late for what for anything the quiet despair of the damned in his voice he didnt turn in the seat to look at me he looked at my reflection in the windshield roget had said no talking is your name juan no my name is fidel you mean its too late at night too late for anything he will kill me nicko yes it is why i am here is it the same with you yes same kind of thing maybe hell change his mind i said how long have you known nicko his tone calling me a fool he was perhaps forty this man short but i would have said muscular under the dark seamans jacket his face weathered less by the sun and the wind than by the demons in his head he looked as if hed come a long way through the years missing the right turning and having to go back he was shaking a little as if cold on this warm tropical night i dont think he was on cocaine on a downswing what happened to your hand fidel he didnt answer what are they waiting for out there his eyes reflected widened a little perhaps surprised by how little i knew of things the boat he said where is it coming from he went on staring into the windshield for a time and then his eyes closed juanita he said kept on saying whispering juanita and was weeping now his head going down and the tears coming freely juanita oh juanita in a tone of such desolation that i saw her in the distance a red rose on her black dress and her face waxen white as she turned and waved her hand no higher than her shoulder and turned away walked away his woman i would suppose juanita my nerves jerked as he moved suddenly hitting the door open and swinging it against the wall his bunched body projecting itself out of the car as roget swung the gun and shouted at him freeze freeze right there and nicko and the others turned to watch one of them giving a short laugh having seen this sort of thing before perhaps having expected it nicko said nothing didnt make any move towards the car he was smiling back in the car back in the car you wanna get fuckin shot fidel the cuban stood turning writhing his head in his hands moving as if he were struggling to get out of some kind of restraint a straitjacket struggling but not succeeding i knew what he felt i had no juanita but i knew what he felt i wasnt doing the same thing because i had done the same thing in my mind a long time ago when i was new to things before i learned that a trap cannot be sprung by allowing the onset of panic which sounds stuffy perhaps considering this man was approaching his death but it doesnt mean that i had no feeling for him do not ask for whom the bell so forth back in the fuckin car and the man came fidel back into the car his crouched shadow leaving the wall as he dropped onto the seat and pulled the door shut leaning his head back against the squab his eyes closed i began waiting until i thought he might be ready to listen to whatever i had to say and while i was waiting lights came from the dark sea lifting and falling to the swell fidel is this the boat he turned his head a little yes what are they going to do with you they will kill me listen fidel i might be able to do something to stop them but ill need your help so brace up get your head together you know what im saying do something with him there i think he meant nicko but he could have meant the black roget roget would be easy to work on listen theres no point in giving up fidel it wont get us anywhere youve got to who are you interested for the first time i can get you out of this but youve got to help now understand that we you know nothing he said you think you can do anything against him against nicko then you know nothing not a lot of use i wanted information out of him so that i could get something together and set it in motion but there wasnt going to be time because the arrival of the boat would change things and i wasnt ready where will they take us fidel quick across the sea his eyes watching me in the glass across the sea to where they will take us out to sea and then shoot us and throw us to the sharks that is the way it is done jesus christ it sounded like a regular programme sweating a little i was sweating a little now because the time frame was narrowing closing on us and once theyd got us on the boat thered be nothing we could do finito in my trade ive seen one or two deaths caused one or two deaths all right killed if you want me to spell it out for you but listen this is the point ive never taken it lightly a mans death lightly even when he was at my throat before i managed to beat the odds even when hed been doing everything he could to blow me away ive never thought of it as all in the days work although to many thats all it is a trick of the trade a necessary inconvenience but i would have to get perspective this was miami florida and the drug trade here was a multibilliondollar industry and the stakes were high and life was cheap and that man over there the fat man nicko had probably made this trip a dozen times fifty times and thought of it as no big deal and if i got the correct perspective on what was happening tonight if i pulled back from the environment as you pull back with a zoom lens all i would see would be a miniature black lincoln down there with some tiny figures standing around it and two tiny figures inside it and they would be the two tiny figures who would be dropped into the sea in a little while from now to float for a time on the slow lifting and falling of the swell until the dark fins broke through accelerating and closing in and then there was just a lot of blood on the surface a lot of threshing about and then the blood christ it was a beautiful red he was a beautiful man he coloured the whole sea like a flag like a banner and that was all it was going to be about given the correct perspective and the background of a multibilliondollar industry with its primal laws and its murderous checks and balances a whorl of crimson blossoming on the moonlit breast of the sea and this perspective i knew was necessary to me it would give me a tool for getting inside nickos mind so that i could see if there were anything i could do to it if there were time they will take us out to sea and then shoot us and throw us to the sharks that is the way it is done fidel i said why will they shoot us first because otherwise we might swim to shore it will be only a few miles his eyes watching me in the glass interested in me now perhaps because i wanted to know all about this thing instead of wailing to my mother it is their way because they do not have to get rid of our bodies there will only be bits and pieces found perhaps impatiently you are not afraid i dont intend to be thrown to any sharks i wish youd understand that in a moment you are not american i think no you are english yes it explains things then i have heard that the english cannot see the nose on their face we try to look beyond it you see have they sent for this boat especially to take us out there of course not there will be a pickup some of the fear had gone out of his voice hed got over his madre mia bit and his prayers to the almighty god who had decided understandably to drop him in the shit and now he was fatalistic but that wasnt really any better any more useful to me i would need to get some feeling back in him anger perhaps anger towards nicko that could be dangerous because this man was a latin and liable to shoot the whole chamber dry before he took aim but id have to make the best of the material i would much rather have worked alone but he might get in the way and it was probably safer to bring him into the act than risk his messing it up the boat was riding at the jetty a line taut round a capstan with a man keeping it secure another man had come down to the quay to meet nicko and they were talking now weve got a couple of guys to take care of so forth there were questions of course that would have to wait because i needed all the time i could get to structure some kind of survival they would be asked later and perhaps answered if ever at all where had nicko got that photograph why was he so ready to blow me away without checking my identity more than he had was it proctor who had thrown this net out for me with photographs all over the town questions like that but more immediately a pickup of cocaine of course this boat is carrying the cash the cash is in the other car how much i do not know i am not on this run when you say you might do something what ill tell you when the time is right how many runs have you done fidel many with nicko sometimes how much cash is usually taken on board it depends different sources different deals maybe half a million maybe a million american dollars of course nicko was nodding to the other man then he turned and began walking towards the chevrolet the two men on the quay started scanning the environment each with one hand tucked inside his jacket nicko brought a black suitcase from the chevrolet ducking to talk to someone inside monique perhaps then he nodded and slammed the door and began walking with the suitcase towards the jetty almost as an afterthought he turned his head to look at roget the black and jerked his free hand gesturing towards the boat it was then that the reality of the thing hit me and i was made to know that i had been whistling in the dark in order to keep panic away because there was nothing i could do if i got inside that mans mind no argument i could use to stop his hand i was one of the two tiny people who would be dropped into the sea and that was it the only chance of getting clear would be in some kind of action between the lincoln and the boat and roget would have his big black suzuki trained on us and even if i could get it away from him the other men were armed and would be too far away for me to work on them if the outa the car jerking the suzuki cmon outa the fuckin car i saw fidel go into spasm as if a bullet had hit him then he opened the door and its edge caught against the wall and he had to pull it away walking round the front of the car with his eyes on the sky praying again i suppose you outa the fuckin car i opened the door and pushed it shut after me and noted everything i could as i walked to the jetty roget was of course at our backs nicko was halfway along the jetty with the suitcase leaning a little backwards as fat men have to leaning a little to the left to counter the weight of the suitcase in his right hand not looking back or towards us towards fidel and me taking care as he got hold of the boats rail and stepped aboard monique was still in the chevrolet i wouldnt expect her or any woman to be present at an execution keep walkin i think fidel had slowed his step understandably when i glanced at him i saw that he had paled and was walking with that jerky motion head down now that id seen in him earlier as if he knew exactly what had to be done hed been here before not like this but behind a gun herding some other man to the slaughterhouse we were on the jetty now with the boat twenty twentyfive feet away and black water immediately on my left it was inviting because once i was under the surface i could move a long way unseen but there wouldnt be time to dive roget would pump the big suzuki as a reflex action that was the last chance that offered once on the boat there would be no more and as i followed the cuban onto the deck i caught some of the aura and felt the fear wash into me chilling me to the bone diamonds seen from the ocean miami is beautiful by night a blaze of light floating from horizon to horizon on the water and reflected there the night lends a semblance of purity to most cities their light flowers from them as if from unsullied soil i saw the bright frieze of the skyline at intervals when the swell dropped the boat into the long indigo troughs fidel and i were sitting in the scuppers on the afterdeck our knees drawn up roget standing with his back to the opposite rail with the big gun trained on us when i could see the water i noticed that flotsam was everywhere the detritus of smashed pontoons and jetties and small boats thrown up by the hurricane and strewn across the sea perhaps there were bodies there i looked for none she was a singledeck motor yacht with twin diesels and a cluster of antennae on the cabin roof i estimated our speed at fifteen knots and we were a mile from the shore heading out we dont tolerate thieves fidel didnt voice any reaction to the kick his limbs jerked and were still again it displeased nicko i think hed wanted a scream you know mr toufexis he doesnt tolerate thieving a hiss of breath as the kick raked across his legs leaving him spilled on the deck with his groin exposed and the fat man went for that and got his scream theres got to be trust you understand me trust with this kind of money around and this kind of merchandise weve got to trust everyone else and theyve got to trust us you understand what im saying fidel the cuban was prone now and vomiting couldnt answer wouldnt have answered anyway id seen the two men in the control cabin look around when fidel had screamed they didnt like nicko id noticed it before i would have said they were more like professional traders than men of the criminal type as such they werent here to take their revenge on society but simply to make money a great deal of money they were business men not thieves hence nickos nice distinction this didnt mean they werent dangerous get up standing over the cuban hands on his hips his face red with rage a show of monstrous petulance clean that up the swell lowered us smoothly into a trough and there was the city again looking beautiful the throb of the diesels was low and sensual the warm air rich with the scent of seaweed youre too fat nicko i said he looked down at me what did you say youre too fat he was a short man didnt carry his weight with majesty like sidney greenstreet or orson welles nicko was just a dumpling of a man spoiled a cakeseeker i thought he might be sensitive about it and he was it was as quick as he could manage but it was done in rage which lowered the muscle tone and i had a lot of time to monitor the kick as it came and when it came i caught it nothing more than that caught it and held the ankle until he began losing his balance because i didnt want him to fall the moment had come and gone it had been an essay that was all nicko was standing over me and blocking roget completely and it might have been possible to use the fat man for my purposes which were of course to avoid death but i would need to make physical contact with him before i could do anything to him and i couldnt have got to my feet and started work because there wouldnt have been enough time he would have come at me right away so id had to get him to make the first contact and things had come very close because i could have done a lot more than just hold his ankle could have straightened up and pitched him back against the man with the gun and roget would probably would very probably have loosed off at least one shot in his surprise i wouldnt of course have stopped there that would have been the beginning with two people off balance and wide open and the ships rail immediately behind them it could have been quite elegant in a way though somewhat too easy to claim any credit i didnt attempt it because there were some unpredictable factors nicko and the black would have had their throats well exposed and would have been dead before they went over the rail but i couldnt have told where that first impulsive shot would have gone it could have gone straight through nicko and into me there had also been no predicting how fast the two men in the control cabin would have reacted and got to their guns in the end within those few milliseconds when i was holding the fat mans ankle i let the subconscious make the decision for me because it could scan the whole range of data very much faster than the forebrain and it would be much more accurate i am just telling you this my good friend to let you know that i was not just sitting there on my bloody rump awaiting the grim bloody reaper i was not intending to offer this fat little tick the high privilege of despatching me with a shot from his bloody little gun without first culling whatever grace and favour the gods might have for me and turning it to my cunning advantage without in simpler terms trying everything but there is nothing to try my good friend you know that youve heard of whistling in the dark you want to be funny in almost a scream a scream of rage getting his balance again and bringing his right leg back and starting another kick not having learned and this time i parried the foot and turned and straightened up and let his momentum carry him against the rail and when he span round i slapped him with the back of my hand across the eyes across more significantly the pineal gland then i waited while he got his orientation back and it took a bit of time he lurched about with a hand to his forehead and his other hand reaching out to grab the rail and then my arm and when he grabbed my arm i chopped gently across his wrist to make him pay attention to make him understand that i didnt like to be touched with those little pink hermitcrab fingers freeze roget of course getting excited waving the gun oh fuck off i said and went on watching nicko waiting for him to get himself in order again but the pain in his wrist was occupying him so i took the opportunity of talking a little look nicko there are things weve got to discuss and they could be to your immediate advantage but youre putting me in the wrong mood with all this fidgeting are you listening to me nicko i hope you are because otherwise you could make a very grave mistake in taking on the whole of the british government he got his eyes focused at last but their expression showed only confusion i didnt expect him to fall for the british government thing but i could be wrong and he might be thinking about it there were also the other problems hed suddenly been given to work out hed tried to get through with a couple of kicks but it hadnt got him anywhere and he was bright enough to know that if id decided to use more force i could have snapped his wrist and knocked him out cold with a backfist instead of stunning the pineal with a slap people with guns arent ready for any kind of resistance and it phases them but i could be making a mistake with this man and he could get rid of his angst by going for his gun and putting a bullet right through my own pineal gland louche the british government the fuck are you talking about an intellectual question hed got his emotions under enough control to let him think straight and i liked that because it made him more predictable theyre the wait a minute he was watching something across the water something behind me presumably a boat wed passed half a dozen lying at anchor as wed left the shore no more than their riding lights burning the moonlight throwing the shadows of their masts across the surface there had also been another vessel moving under power with lights flooding the control deck i didnt look behind me he might be trying that one roget he said get lower with that thing the afterdeck wasnt lit but the black made a sharp silhouette against the moonlit sea and the suzuki had a substantial profile coastguard i asked nicko that would be nice he didnt answer just went on watching the boat i could hear its engine now one of the men in the control cabin looked round hearing it too the waters off this coast were heavily patrolled by the us coastguard on the watch for drug runners cubans and haitians and they could stop any vessel they werent happy about and ask questions they were all watching the ship behind me nicko and the men in the cabin and when i looked at roget i saw that his head was turned away from me and the nerves went into the fullalert phase in that instant and the adrenaline hit the bloodstream as i worked out the distance and the two strikes that were called for one to deal with the suzuki and the other to the mans throat and then it was over and his head was turning back to watch me and i found that my breath was still blocked to power the necessary movement and my right foot was dug against the deck to push me past the inertia and get me across the deck relax but jesus christ that was relax its over now deepen calm the breathing let the muscles go loose again there might be another chance and more time to take it the three other men had guns but thered be nothing i could do on board this boat while that suzuki was here it could put out four shots a second and blow me overboard if that man starting firing nicko the man in the cabin the one who was watching the boat out there what he didnt turn went on watching the boat youll have to get it over with before we get there nicko didnt answer presumable meaning youll have to shoot those two before we make the rendezvous with the supplier nicko still silent fidel the cuban had finished sluicing the deck he was on his haunches again his face still pale his head back and his eyes closed i would have said he was wishing it were over wishing for an end to pain nicko the man in the cabin again what he turned round now its okay theyre just a nicko we want you to do what you have to do before we get there we dont want bodies around you listening nicko the man at the helm said something and the first man nodded and youll have to do it quietly nicko no guns theres too much traffic out here that wasnt coastguard it was you dont listen nicko i said theres too much traffic out here you do like we say or we dont come out with you the next time are you listening to me nicko patience in his tone spelling it out no fourletter words thrown in for effect just the message listen to me nicko patience and a certain authority he was a dealer and he was out here on business and he didnt want anything to get in the way he and his partner then the man at the helm the dealers nicko the heavy the hit man bringing the half million or the million on board seeing to it himself for the others a necessary evil you dont know these people he said his stomach jerking as he pushed the words out i know them you didnt have me you wouldnt be out here to meet them the fuck are you talking about vicente i didnt know if they would have started arguing if it werent for the fact that murder was to be done perhaps it worried them even though they were used to it i could feel the same kind of tension that develops in a prison when everyone knows that not far away theres a man preparing a rope or a syringe or the straps on the chair and that the clock is moving towards morning no noise nicko and do it soon or youll get us in trouble out here and mr toufexis wouldnt like it have you thought of that think of it nicko the man in the cabin vicente turned his back he and the man at the helm carried guns bolstered on the left side and nicko was wearing his the same way there was no one else on board except for roget with the suzuki and fidel the cuban and of course nicko the two men whod brought the boat to the jetty had stayed ashore the main problem in terms of timing was roget the young black his finger was inside the guard the whole time and he was seven eight feet distant from me so i began work with that as the fulcrum theyre the people who employ me nicko what turned to look at me the small eyes squeezed almost shut as if a wind had got up a cold wind the man up there vicente had started to worry him the british government i said im in miami on a special assignment fuck does that mean it means ive been assigned by the thatcher administration to represent the united kingdoms interest in the presidential election under the aegis of senator mathieson judd he watched me youre full of shit you know that the thing is nicko youre getting into something very big and youre not aware of that i think its only my duty to tell you everyone can make a mistake but what worries me is that this one is going to blow you right out of the water in a moment mistake thats right for instance who gave you the instructions to kill me mr toufexis who else more quickly than id expected perhaps to shift the blame the blame not the guilt there wouldnt be any guilt just the memory of sadistic pleasure then youll have to tell mr toufexis hes making the mistake the pink fleshy mouth became stretched slightly and there was a soft wheeze a kind of laughter mr toufexis doesnt make mistakes give me your wallet i thought hed never ask but im going to take a risk and trust you because im gullible enough to feel reassured by the queen of englands crest on the card you gave me erica cambridge perhaps it would work with this man too gave him the wallet and as he took it i moved another two inches towards roget the man with the big suzuki i had moved more than a foot closer to him in the last three minutes cash credit cards driving licence taking his time foreign office whats that you call it the state department richard ainsely keyes right thats the name so theres no mistake not on your part no but i think you should telephone mr toufexis and tell him about my assignment for the thatcher administration im sure hes no wish to get involved in senator judds election campaign the senator wouldnt be pleased another two inches to the left simply as an exercise in case there was something eventually to be done a green light was moving across the sea at the starboard beam of a vessel nicko had seen it and stood watching it for a moment then turned and went into the control cabin i judged we were now three miles out three at the least fidel the cuban had said the rendezvous was to be made seven miles out and the arithmetic was simple enough at fifteen knots cruising speed we would be there in approximately fifteen minutes no noise nicko do it soon do it before we get there that was logical enough thered be other people at the rendezvous and i might get a chance to kick and scream so forth create confusion senator judd nicko looked up from the wallet the candidate for the presidency fuck are you talking about he turned and went into the cabin and i watched him go to the radio unit sound of a vessel the one moving past us to starboard heading for port roget heard it too and wanted to turn round and look at it but he was only shifting his eyes thinking about it and i didnt get ready to do anything i wasnt close enough to him yet and id have to wait until nicko came back before i could shift a bit more to the left again the best thing would be to get to the suzuki and swing it down but give him time to fire a few shots it would make a lot of noise and if the coastguard had a patrol out here theyd come and ask questions no noise nicko telephone to his head i could only hear a word or two as his voice rose and lowered against the throb of the diesels but i think he was asking to speak to a man called joshua or foster or of course proctor because the vowels carried more clearly than the consonants perhaps proctor the immediate objective for barracuda he was holding my card up turning it aslant to catch the light i think i heard foreign office but that could have been because i was listening for it then there was mr toufexis and then proctor again and then thatcher be it given that i was only getting snatches it was really very frustrating because the executive for the mission was only a telephone number away from the objective and he was three miles out to sea with a man on one side of him with his testicles out cold and a man on the other side waiting to blow his head across the bay if he did anything wrong and a man in the cabin there with orders for his immediate execution all i want nicko is that telephone number you little fat bastard the one youve just called and if i ever get you alone youre going to tell me what it is the deck rose and fell away to the slow undulations of the swell the miami skyline was lifted suddenly from the dark and strewn across the horizon in a cascade of diamonds then was lost again blotted out by the profile of the cabin assignment government janitor no senator senator judd more clearly now as the man at the helm throttled the diesels back slowing us nicko cradled the telephone and there was no more to listen to as i asked the black are we nearly there i wanted to know how he was feeling how confident or how nervous keep your fuckin mouth shut you know what i mean no reliable data nicko was coming back and roget turned his head a little to look at him so i shifted my feet again three inches this time because it wouldnt be much longer now youre full of shit nicko standing in front of me the small eyes glinting did you talk to proctor himself got a reaction we hadnt mentioned his name before there isnt any mistake there isnt any assignment you wasted my time and i dont like that but id got the answer only proctor knew enough about me to know i wasnt on an assignment for the thatcher government in connection with senator judd this man had just been speaking to the objective i was that close i suggested you telephone mr toufexis i said not proctor whats the difference perhaps i could have gone on from there kept him talking if thered been time tried a few oblique questions about monique kim harvester erica cambridge riverside way the yacht contessa to see if i could get any more information to work on to give to ferris but there wasnt a chance because the man in the cabin vicente was turning round hey nicko you have to do it now dance this was the scene this was the scene of the execution we were moving at less than cruising speed and there was less noise from the diesels the wake bannered from the stern across the sea towards miami there was a vessel a mile off perhaps less it was difficult to judge distances by moonlight on a reflecting surface the vessel was marked only by its riding lights two or three more stood off our port quarter farther away one of them with lights shining on deck and from a line of portholes below another looked as if it had way on and showed both red and green lights it was heading obliquely in our direction but wouldnt pass close no closer than half a mile water slapped below the bows the night was peaceful the man vicente was still turned towards us in the cabin looking at nicko fidel the cuban wasnt aware of the moment he sat humped against the bulwark nursing his pain his eyes closed and his head on his chest across from him five feet from where i was standing roget the black leaned in a crouch to keep the profile of the big suzuki below the rail he also was looking at nicko the fifth man was at the helm his back to us above the cabin roof the radar scannerswung and a penant flew against the stars this was the scene nicko pulled his gun fidel kicked the cubans foot to get him conscious fidel lifted his head and looked up into nickos bright little eyes and shrank get up didnt move he couldnt look away from the man above him his lips began forming words that made no sound get up it took a little time a few seconds because he was in a lot of pain but he got to his feet and nicko looked into his face turn around we rose on a crest and there was miami again jewelbright in the distance riding out the night i wished fidel could have turned his head and seen it because it was so pretty it might have reminded him of juanita kneel on your knees somewhere a lanyard was slapping timber to the wind of our passage strumming in the quietness passing the time flotsam drifted past a cement bag i think or a lifejacket nicko not with the gun vicente from the cabin nicko turned with a jerk jesus christ were miles not with the gun the tone almost quiet but with a lot of emphasis a lot of authority fidel didnt hear them or didnt follow the meaning he knelt facing the bulwark his back to nicko praying softly in spanish there was nothing i could do for him and i dont think that in any case it would have been wise if anything happened he would be in the way fatally perhaps in the way listen for christs sake one shot wont make any nicko if you use a gun mr toufexis is going to know he is going to know from me youve seen mr toufexis with people nicko he will be like that with you so do it now and not with a gun jesus christ but in capitulation i suppose vicente was thinking in terms of numbers physical numbers if he didnt want anyone to make a noise there was no point in rogets holding the big suzuki on me any more hed be better off putting it down and getting his hands ready in case i tried to do anything fidel wouldnt do anything he wasnt in vicentes reckoning the way he was working his numbers out there were four men against one and that would be enough in the event of trouble do it nicko now i dont think vicente had thought about roget and the suzuki yet he was too concerned with nicko and the need to get this over soon at once he watched nicko go to the chain locker and come back with a marlin spike christ sake he said looking up at vicente in the cabin think of the fucking mess i thought his tone was interesting to take a gun away from a man like this a man who cleans it loads it wears it wherever he goes is like taking his clothes off him it feels like a different world to him a world in which he feels exposed and i believe there was another thing nicko was squeamish to shoot another man from a distance however short is to enjoy the remoteness of the act the technical sophistication of moving the safety catch off of aiming holding still and moving the trigger against the spring but to take a mans life with the bare hands or with some crude instrument as an extension of the hands is an act of intimacy of an intimacy greater by far than the act of love involving as it does the plundering of life itself he stood there nicko holding the spike not sure how he was going to do this without getting blood on his expensive khaki suit he was holding the thing in both hands in the horrible semblance of a golfer about to make a stroke time nicko from the cabin youre wasting time do it i thought i heard rogets teeth chattering on my left perhaps he didnt really like the act of slaughtering when it came to it or perhaps he was excited i dont know nicko i said let the poor little bastard jump overboard give him a chance to swim he wont steal again after this nicko turned his head to look at me and the look was murderous i think because id offered him a getout he couldnt take fucking shuddup his fat little face shone with sweat i could smell him from where i stood then he looked back at the man kneeling in front of him at the back of his head the timing wasnt right i couldnt make a move if i tried making a move the timing would have to be perfect and i would need to use fidel the cuban and i would need to use him in the moment of his death nicko from the cabin you want me to come and do it nicko i think vicente knew the fat man well enough to know that he would be stung by that would feel unbrave unable to kill a man without his gun do you know how to turn the swell moved under us all lifting and letting us fall as if to the rhythm of our mothers bosom the bosom of mother earth as if we were brothers nicko vicente roget fidel and the man at the helm whose name i didnt know as if they were my brothers very fast do you know how to turn very fast which in a way i suppose they were my brothers born with me on this little piece of interstellar rock to be nurtured by the same essences of water and of air the same magnetic waves the same vibrations and then to die but i was not going to think about that he stood there holding the marlin spike my little fat brother smelling of sweat mine own executioner it might amuse you my good friend if i tell you how to make a very fast turn in case you dont already know it will make an interesting digression in my stream of consciousness because i always feel a certain lightheadedness when faced with the prospect of mortality it has happened before well then let us to the matter it is performed sometimes in shotokan karate in heian shodan when one moves from zenkutsudachi to kokutsudachi turning completely through two hundred and seventy degrees there are six things to do each of them making the turn faster and faster and it doesnt make any difference whether youre in zenkutsudachi or standing normally though its better if you have one foot forward a little say the right foot because this will be the pivot for the turn the lights swing upwards into view brightly bedecking the nights horizon over there as we fall away to a hollow in the sea nicko stands tensely now he is very tense his knuckles white as he grips the heavy spike only a second has gone by since vicente spoke to him daring him though it seems much longer the right foot yes will provide the pivot and the first thing you have to do is push off with the left one if you are turning backwards to the left the second thing is to swing the hips in that direction to be conscious only of the hips in this millisecond of our little game and the third thing to do is to swing the left arm in the same direction to lend centrifugal force and here it is worth mentioning that the left arm and hand provide a potent weapon at the end of the turn if say the hand forms a fist with the knuckles vertical and the thumb uppermost fidel is praying as he has prayed before he kneels as if in his church and of course appropriately since he is about in his mind to meet the personification of infinity he calls god nicko is starting to lift the marlin spike swinging it in an arc above his head it is heavy he is sweating copiously he stinks vicente is watching from the cabin hands by his sides he looks italianate as his name suggests i think he is a cool man confident in himself and therefore dangerous the other man is of course looking ahead of him across the milky moonlit sea maintaining the diesels at something like a quarter throttle with the bows cutting the horizon the night is warm as we sail on in brotherhood sharing its warmth but that is not quite true the night has no warmth for me because when the fat man has split the head of the cuban he will come for me and if i do anything to stop him they will shoot the others and risk calling attention i am not however forgetting you my good friend as you wait agog to perform this totally spectacular turn or so my totally inexcusable degree of selfindulgence allows me to believe the fourth thing to do then is to use the right arm in the same direction again using centrifugal force and yet again if the right hand is formed say flat and with the palm upwards and the fingers closed to provide a cutting edge it will offer an effective strike at the face or throat or clavicle should you wish to defend yourself against attack the two last requirements for the turn are not physical the first is mental the second almost spiritual you have to think get there and finally you have to feel be there he is lifting the heavy spike nicko swinging it back and upwards his small pink mouth puckered and the material of his expensive jacket going into folds at the shoulder the single button pulling at the waist que dios se acuerde lo bueno que he hecho en mi vida y se olvide lo malo the lips of fidel are moving though i dont see them from this angle i know they are moving because i can hear the sibilants of his last prayer vicente is watching from the cabin he hasnt moved time has slowed as always happens when the mind brought to a high degree of stress becomes aware that time is a manmade artifact and subject to contradiction by the infinite the marlin spike swings higher i watch it the turn yes we must not forget the turn the expression of my sense of lightness of unreality as my life nears its seeming close but you already have it all my good friend and you should practise each segment of the turn one after another and you will find the speed increasing and to the point where you are carried off balance a sign of progress then you should put all those segments together and let them happen at once like an explosion and in the instant of completion tighten the abdomen to preserve the balance and land squarely at whatever degree you wish to it doesnt have to be at two hundred and seventy theres no magic in that number the last requirement to be there has to be made with the muscles relaxed and the mind in alpha waves and this may not happen at the fiftieth turn of your practice but could well happen at the hundredth the deck trembles a little beneath our feet the lanyard slaps to the wind of our passage the sibilants fall from the lips of the kneeling cuban as the little fat man brings the marlin spike to the top of its arc and it comes fluting downwards to the cubans fragile skull and his executioner grunts with the effort it strikes it strikes the skull be there a whirl of lights as the city of miami span across my vision field and the black was suddenly close to me and my right arm swung through the turn and the right hand lifted a degree to line up with his throat and even now the surprise was only just coming into his eyes and of course too late because the swordhand was in contact with its target and beginning to bury there at the site of the thyroid gland what i had started to do was over now and it had taken very little more than one halfsecond though the planning had taken longer from this instant there would be chaos of a kind and thered be no way for me to control it there were risks appalling risks to this desperate enterprise but it had been a question of choice of letting myself get into a sordid little confrontation with nicko and having to kill him an unknown number of seconds before roget blew the heart out of my ribs with the suzuki or of going for this trick getting rid of the black before anything else and taking the others on later if i could reach the blacks motor nerves fast enough and freeze them he wouldnt fire the gun and nicko and vicente and the man at the helm would opt to maintain silence on the boat and come for me with their hands or a knife and i might have a chance of dropping overboard before they could reach me dropping and diving deep and turning for the long journey to the shore but there was nothing i could do now to control the moment i would have to watch for a chance if ever it came and use it for what it was worth a very great deal of data was coming in to the left hemisphere for analysis the cuban was collapsing onto the deck with his blood colouring the air as it flew from the site of the blow i saw nickos face saw the grimace the mouth drawn back and the eyes widening in an expression id no time to interpret though it was shock i believe perhaps because it was the first time the man had killed without using a gun had killed personally intimately leaving blood on his hands that would not be easy to wash away in front of me was roget and he still hadnt pumped the gun presumably because i had indeed reached his motor nerves in time he was already dying as the blood began filling his windpipe and his body was beginning to swing back from the force of the strike it wouldnt take more than one hand to tip his spine across the rail and send him overboard butbegan firing and i wasnt ready for it because i thought the moment had come and gone and all i could do was push at the barrel and he swung faster and the shots went raking across the cabin and the sound banged in the confines as glass shattered and the man at the helm was pitched across the controls and the diesels began racing at full throttle nicko was shouting something and i didnt know if hed been hit vicente was tumbling down the three steps from the cabin with his eyes on me and his hands ready not reaching for his gun six shots rapid fire the last of them from a dead mans finger as roget tilted backwards over the rail and i pushed the big suzuki with him stink of cordite on the warm night air and the deck keeling as the unmanned helm swung over and we began weaving across the sea with the engines still at full ahead both and then nicko was at me and we locked together and i tried for his throat but missed because my shoes were slipping on the cubans blood so i tried for the solar plexus with the fist rising to get under the ribs for a direct kill but the area was thick with flesh and he only grunted and i changed the fist into a heelpalm and struck upwards but didnt do more than graze the side of his head get him vicente as he reached us and nicko got an arm round my neck and put pressure there until i found the thumb and broke it and he screamed and the other man came in close for me with a knife and i hadnt expected that the glint of the blade in the glow from the cabin lights hadnt expected it because he hadnt been reaching for anything when hed started his run tried an elbowsmash into nickos face but he was halfturned away from me and offbalance going down and dragging me with him and i let him do it because there was a chance of a strike and i straightened one leg with the foot angled to make a blade and thrust hard for vicentes groin and did some damage and felt him spin sideways and strike the deck with his head not making a sound a different breed from nicko and therefore the more to be wary of cordite sharp in the lungs someone coughing the fat man coming in again and surprisingly fast and i couldnt do anything with him until he made a mistake and left himself open and i found his face exposed and went for the eyes and reached one of them but it galvanised him and he insisted with me an arm round my neck again and squeezing as vicente came in with the knife and i waited until it swung up and then turned and left nicko as the target i dont remember when it was that they began gaining it took time and much had passed vicente was losing blood because id managed to turn the blade and rip into him somewhere before i lost my grip on the handle and let it go i had injured nicko perhaps with one of the nerve strikes id been working on but he was still surprisingly strong and very quick vicious in his anger because he wanted his cake and hed been looking forward to it and i was trying to take it away from him take my death away they had both spent a lot of time trying to reach their guns at first they hadnt wanted to make any more noise after the hammering boom of the suzuki but then theyd realised i might get them both under control and theyd stopped worrying about making a noise id sent the first gun vicentes over the rail without any trouble because he was so busy with the bloody thing that he forgot about the combat and left himself open and id gone in with an eye strike and got the gun away from him while he was protecting himself nicko was more difficult and wed fired a round with his finger on the trigger and the gun pointing nowhere but then id found his throat and hed panicked and id got the gun and lobbed it overboard and this worried them and they became excited i could have killed nicko when id found his throat exposed but i didnt want to that had been proctor hed phoned from the cabin and i wanted the number because it had become the focus of the whole mission the only access to proctor wed got the stars were swinging through the black reaches of the sky and when the boat heeled as it sped across the surface i began losing orientation just momentary flashes of knowing nothing being nowhere momentary but critical potentially lethal i didnt know where the boat was taking us we knew it was running wild that was all the helm free and the throttles open and the first thing vicente or nicko would do if they could get clear of me would be to break for the cabin and get control i didnt want that to happen because if we hit another vessel and didnt totally smash up id have a chance of getting away the stars swung and the bows hammered across the swell and i lurched sometimes mentally lurched into the oblivion that was waiting for me out there a limitless void that was there to gather the end of things the bricabrac of lost endeavours the tattered rags of hope where for christs sake stay with it dont give up stay with it yes indeed perhaps id taken the blade in somewhere and was losing blood it felt like that the onset of lassitude stay with it exactly so but they were gaining i tell you they were gaining on me twice i found an arm exposed and worked my thumb into the median nerve with force enough to produce great pain but there was no sound no jerking to free the arm and after a time i realised that we were locked together these two men and i across the body of the cuban nicko his voice vicentes voice sounding stifled with not much breath to spare weve got him nicko speaking perhaps to boost the fat mans morale or not speaking to him at all but to me knowing the value of despair if one can instill it in ones adversary he failed because i knew the danger but the thought stayed in my mind on an intellectual level the thought that they could have got me now they could be within seconds shall we say of bringing me my doom here under the swinging stars as dazzling lights swarming against us in the night their brilliance rising in a wave towering the lights of the city breaking over us as the boat hit and the night exploded and i was flung headlong as the hull burst open and glass from the smashed windows in the cabin flew in a bright shower in the light from the shore then the sensation of falling and the flat sheen of water below and i hit the surface shoulder first and the lights flared and then darkened as i went under nowhere it wasnt dark down here not now theyd set up a generator and floodlights or perhaps it was one of the fire trucks with its search lamps going the coloured flashes of the police cars dappled the surface above me and i could hear sirens dying towards the quay i could see sharp outlines close to me debris turning as it sank and blurred shapes farther off the huge body of the boat angled bows down with the stern breaking the surface but he was nowhere nicko i was yes losing blood i could see it now blackish whorls forming in the water as i moved blowing like smoke but it couldnt be anything serious worth surfacing for i had already been up a dozen times to breathe for a while floating face upwards to reorientate having to take the risk of being seen i didnt want to be hauled out and questioned at least until id found nicko or they had if they found him id know i was watching their progress every time i surfaced i would rather find him myself i had something to ask him the telephone number the access to proctor it wouldnt be easy to ask him if they found him first and put him into an ambulance id have to make out i needed medical attention so as to go with him stay with him but i would have said that the chances of finding him alive by now were thin unless he was bobbing on the surface somewhere among the debris and they hadnt seen him yet sound of a helicopter vibrating through the water then more light came flooding down silvering some of the bits and pieces that had been blown out of the boat i dived lower using the light one hand on an anchor chain to keep my bearings and there was fidel below me his arms and legs opened out his face turning towards the light and then vanishing the dark smoke of blood still curling from his skull he would be going down there to wait for his little juanita to wait a long time for her in the limbo of the lost his arms and legs windmilling slowly disturbing the slime where a fish flashed in the light then another scenting his blood i surfaced again and floated drawing flotsam around me and sighting along the surface there was more noise here the thin wail of the sirens piercing the boom of the choppers rotors the surface was ruffled by the airstream and the debris was tossed in circles then it rose suddenly i suppose it had come lower to look at something ready to deploy the salvage net on the jetty a frogman was settling his mask and flipflopping towards the water i took a final breath and went down again into the halflit netherworld and saw him almost at once nicko his arms stretched out as the cubans had been the current tugging at the cloth on his little fat legs and as i swam towards him the light was mottled with the slow drifting of leaves rising and whirling and spreading out some of them touching his hands nickos hands then drifting away turning and catching the light and darkening again hundreds of them puzzling me until i saw they were banknotes the suitcase on the surface somewhere among the other things burst open and empty now still losing i was still losing blood the muscles languid and the mind starting to wander a little mesmerised by the whirling of the banknotes but i went for him scissorskicking through the light and shadow and missing him the first time as the current turned him so that for a moment he was upright standing there with his arms reaching to touch his windfall to play with it while fish darted at his face at the hollows of his eyes i got close to him at the second attempt and danced with him as i caught the folds of his clothes and began searching the pockets but the lungs were pulling for air and i had to surface and float there taking in a snatched breath and then another until i could breathe rhythmically taking the necessary time but worrying because he could drift away nicko and i might lose him down again and i couldnt find him had to go deeper as far as the mud and the litter of cans and tyres and broken spars and then look upwards catching his silhouette against the light and rising for him working on the pockets again the light troubling me now flooding into my head and staying there when i closed my eyes the weakness spreading from the muscles to the will the will to go on moving instead of letting go drifting in the shadows dancing with my little fat friend as he watch it dancing among the leaves wake up for christs sake yes no time for dancing is there taking his keys and his wallet drifting with him as he turned wallet in my hand wallet with perhaps the telephone number in it the access to proctor drifting and turning in the eerie underwater light with the mind hallucinating weaving patterns of its own the scene swinging as i turned again and looked into the face of kim harvester grace honing the knife the noon heat pressed down from a brassy sky and the glare off the water hit the inside of the cabin like a floodlight the sea was mirrorsmooth with a long swell running we were somewhere south of cape florida shed told me ten miles from the mainland we didnt want shed said anyone looking at us through field glasses again honing the knife turning the blade on the stone a big knife long curving to a fine point one of her breasts showed inside the loose turquoise bra the nipple raised she wasnt sitting like that leaning forward to invite my interest she was just used to being alone on board i shall have to make it a clean kill she said the swell lifted the tug lowered it i could see the cape north by northeast and two other vessels one of them moving out of the bay under limp sails and a motor yacht on the south horizon shed said it was the contessa right into the brain through the eye if i dont do it cleanly hell flash away they dont like being hurt and hed remember looking up her green eyes seeing the shark not me dont underestimate those beasts she hadnt wanted to bring me to the tug early this morning shed moved with me through the pale underwater light but i hadnt gone straight to the quay there were a lot of people milling around there silhouetted against the floodlights and the coastguard helicopter was still hovering above the sunken boat id surfaced to breathe and then dived again leading her past the end of the jetty before i climbed onto a moored boat well clear of the action and reached the quay are you all right her mask off watching me yes can you get me away from here you need an ambulance she said youre hurt blood reddening the water trickling from my clothes look get me away will you i dont want people asking a lot of questions it was dangerous perhaps to trust her but id been losing blood and hadnt slept and if i dropped suddenly shed go for one of the ambulances and i didnt want that thered be some of nickos friends in that crowd along there and my photo was in circulation i didnt want a police enquiry either because itd hold things up why dont you want them to ask questions not letting it go not taking anything for granted watching me hard with her green eyes id said the wrong thing you see not feeling terribly bright at the moment in any case i dont want anyone to see me theyre still trying to kill me shed remember the shooting yesterday swaying a little now swaying comfortably enjoying the rhythm the lights of the city swinging away swinging back watch it yes dont want ambulance who are the police oh jesus christ what made her think that the drug scene i suppose she was so used to it thought i was a dealer man on the run no toufexis his people toufexis didnt take her eyes off me all right ill take you out of here but i want to know who you are government the whole city swinging swinging back the lights dizzying hm government youll have to prove that or im turning you in she searched for the knife wound somewhere under my shirt left side found it handkerchief okay keep it pressed there while i get the car on the way to the tug i showed her my identity and told her there were two bodies back there fidels and nickos and perhaps a man still alive vicente in the water she could phone the rescue team and tell them that then i lost the whole thing and woke up on the boat i was a nurse she said for seven years does that hurt no morning light across the sea id slept nearly five hours and woke feeling successful in a way because id got that mans wallet and it had proctors number in it or the number of the place where he could be reached where nicko had reached him from the boat i liked it she said being anurse but those male chauvinist pigs finally got under my skin and i quit slammed the door of the emergency room in one of their faces as a matter of fact broke his nose they think were just their assistants but nursings a profession too were professionals like they are and we spend a lot more time with the patients and get very much closer and that matters you know its very often a question of life and death if you hold someones hand at the right moment but those bastards just think were scullery maids keep your arm away this is the last one curved needle going into the flesh and out again across the wound she might have been sewing a sock very expert i keep this kit for me really how do you feel good shape because youve lost some blood as you know but we cant tell how much youre a bit white still but that could be shock hanging about hold absolutely still while i get a bandage came back and i said are you a police reservist or something volunteer diver thats all they beeped me so i want to know all about it richard because i could be some kind of accessory after the fact or concealing evidence or a dozen other things looking at me straight i took a risk bringing you here and you owe me but all i want is the truth told her the whole thing and there wasnt any danger in that because she already knew i was looking for proctor and the only thing i was adding now was that proctor was looking for me when you say hes looking for you what exactly does that mean hed like to find me it wasnt an answer and she knew that in a moment is he trying to kill you i think so she dropped the unused bandage into the medical kit and snapped the lid shut was that him shooting at your car no how dyou know hes no good with a gun all right then did he set you up either he did or whoever hes working for is he working for toufexis i dont know look if youd rather i dont honestly know but id like to well thats the point shed seen the yacht with the slack canvas coming out of the bay and watched it for a moment if you want to find proctor maybe i can help but youll have to tell me more about things and if youd rather not then say so why would you want to help me in the labyrinth where you cant see much more than the next corner its nice to know which side people are on and even nicer to know why people change their minds sometimes and thats because their motivation isnt strong enough to keep them stable it happens all the time i think i want to help you she said in a moment because i like you not like exactly i find you intriguing first you get shot at and bloody nearly burned alive and the next time i see you its six fathoms down with bodies and banknotes all over the place she held her gaze for a while turns me on and as i told you hes an absolute shit and id very much like to see you put him in the gun sights and drop him stone cold dead looking down i phoned your hotel after that shooting to see if you were still in the land of the living kind of you in a moment she said i did a year in bomb disposal when i was still in england it that was before you lost your father she looked up quickly yes why i mean you had these wrong start had these suicidal tendencies was not very flattering these urges to push things to the brink quite a while ago she watched me quietly and when she spoke again her voice was lower i suppose so were a bit alike arent we it used to turn me on and this is why i mentioned it actually about bomb disposal it used to give me a real kick to sort of be in their presence just sitting quietly in front of those things knowing how much awful power there was in them and being close to you gives me the same feeling i mean the tension comes off you in absolute waves and i like that she got up and took the medical kit to the other end of the cabin and put it into a cupboard and then went into the head and this was the first chance id had so i went over to the phone and dialled the number yes shadow safe i left it at that and hung up he would have had support people watching my hotel and they would have expected me there after id called him last night from the quay and theyd have started worrying by first light and ferris would have signalled the board as a matter of routine executive missing and that boat had made a lot of noise with all the police and everything and he might have put things together and started a search when kim came back she said i want you to rest for a bit longer and dropped a pile of magazines onto the bamboo stool just till you get your colour back that had been hours ago and now she was honing the knife and not talking very much shed gone into a kind of shell and i didnt disturb her spoke only when she spoke sometimes you wont see one for weeks then youll see a whole group moving in to feed on something something like roget the black still floating out there unless his finger had got jammed inside the trigger guard of the big suzi and hed gone all the way down have you seen one today couple of dorsal fins over there look cutting the surface a hundred yards away splinters of light flashing as they turned and caught the sun i hadnt noticed them the noon heat pressed down its weight seeming to calm the sea the glare came up from the water blinding bright flooding the cabin and bouncing flashing on brasswork and reflecting in barbs of light the silence was absolute and there was no motion except when the swell rolled under the boat we floated here in isolation trapped between sky and sea under the burningglass of the sun did you expect them to be there i asked her sound carried and we spoke in murmurs in a way yes she turned the blade again on the stone ive been getting a feeling lately a feeling it wont be long i watched the two fins i think there was a third now but the light was tricky the whole surface shimmering before you find the one youre looking for yes looking up at me do you get feelings like that presentiments yes it was a third fin i could see it clearly now what kind are they id say theyre nurses not grey ones but still aggressive how big maybe three metres fully grown ive seen she broke off as the water flashed over there and a slim metallic body broke the surface no theyre threshers that ones over four metres it was a thresher that killed him i got a close look she was silent for a time her eyes on the rhythmic stroking of the blade they hunt in packs how many is a pack it varies anything from ten to thirty theyve got large eyes she said green ones like mine she was watching them all the time now the knife still in her hand whats attracting them there were more of them now they come and take a look at boats quite often people throw garbage out of boats she was sitting totally still now her eyes on the sea her head angled a little the knife lying in her cupped hand her brown legs tucked under her the toes flexed they were circling the whole time but slowly coming closer to the boat and we could hear the sudden sharp splash as one of them flicked a tail scattering white water five six of them now the water was clear below and i could see the dark line of a reef running across our beam with shadows moving as the rest of the pack circled fathoms down could you skipper this boat if you had to do you think she was speaking slowly only halfaware of me i could work it out there wasnt anything i could say that would change her mind it was her own affair as i said some people say i just want to follow my dad be with him again one man i think he was into psychiatry or something like that said that sticking a knife into a shark was penis envy takes all sorts doesnt it they were close now seven or eight of them their bodies darkening the water just below the surface she didnt move looked carved out of bronze under the hot weight of the sun the knife in her hand it used to give me a real kick to sort of be in their presence just sitting quietly in front of those things knowing how much awful power there was in them i got out of the deck chair and stood at the rail and looked over the side they were closer than id been able to see before and one of them came right in and nosed along the beam of the boat and i felt its tremor as it grazed the timbers she was wiping the oil kim the oil from the blade and dropped the rag on to the stone and kept hold of the knife moving to the rail and looking down into the water and when she remembered me and looked up against the glare of the sun her eyes were narrowed to slits of pale green in the bronze of her face watching me for a moment before she said her voice clear in the unearthly quiet if hes there ill know ill know the one then she reached behind her and unhooked the turquoise bra and let it fall and tugged the bikini down her legs and over her long narrow feet and swung herself across the rail and broke the surface quietly sinking as far as her head and then bringing her legs up to lie flat just below the surface not moving her arms or hands but only her feet fanning with them to move away from the boat they were charcoal the sharks and she was a light bronze and of course much smaller but she looked less alien among them than i would have imagined floating with her body aligned to theirs as they closed in slowing to get the measure of this other creature i didnt move could not i am sure have moved she was holding the knife behind her back that is to say underneath her so that it wouldnt flash in the light like a lure and attract their attention and as she took a breath and turned slowly and dived the last i could see was that she was holding it in front of her now the knife then she was gone fear crept in me contracting the scrotum tightening the throat as i watched those things from the safety of the boat fear of them certainly of their huge size and their latent primitive force and fear for her the suddenness of her going from sight leaving a sense of shock a sense already of loss and appalling danger of murder down there where i couldnt see of feasting as they closed in and their curved jaws opened and they ripped and began ravaging too much yes too much imagination very well let us regain a little of our control so forth she must have done this before and she knows those ghastly things from long experience and all shes doing is playing with life and death and maybe putting on a show for me proud of her obsession flaunting it but even so even so my good friend i didnt relish this you may well believe and then there was just a lot of blood on the surface a lot of threshing about and then the blood christ it was a beautiful red he was a beautiful man he coloured the whole sea like a flag like a banner fortyfive i would have said it must have been fortyfive seconds since id seen her the great shapes were still circling slowly not so near the surface now as if something below were attracting them their long tails fanning in the clear water the light of the surface ripples playing along their smooth metallic flanks could you skipper this boat if you had to do you think the sun beat down on the sea pressing it flat spreading its heat and its molten light from horizon to horizon while i dwelled here on this gilded mote and came as close as i have ever come to praying fifty seconds sixty perhaps as they circled the slim bronze othercreature in the depths its not my vessel i brought it in and i want to report a death more than a minute shed been down there more than a minute now her lungs beginning to feel the need for oxygen you did nothing to stop her what could i have done you could have talked to her surely talked her out of it you could have restrained her if necessary she was a responsible adult with a mind of her own a confused adult surely intending suicide how do we know i think she was following her karma her what her karma what is that exactly movement suddenly in the water there over there a fin cutting the surface and flashing in the light the others circling wider for some reason oh for christs sake come up will you its a minute fifteen a minute and a half what is karma it means fate loosely translated destiny she was following her destiny people meddle too much you know with other peoples lives we are not our brothers keeper when it comes to the crunch slowly very slowly from the depths there was this smaller shape now a dull gold creature rising with its long hair rippling at its sides until the head broke surface and the body followed turning gently to float as the weakness flowed into my legs and the breath came out of me and i shut my eyes against the brazen light of the sea and even then you didnt try to dissuade her no it was her wish her will i do the same thing myself sometimes you go swimming among sharks no but its just as dangerous we like the brink you see we like being there the great gray shapes circled some of them just below the surface with a fin cutting through it here and there like a knife through silk some of them deeper no more than dark shadows and there she was the female biped lying in the middle of them with her face to the sky and her eyes closed and her mouth moving as she breathed breathed deeply to replace the oxygen shed used down there a human being with a history and two dead parents and a few boyfriends around and a job to do and a life to live or simply if you looked at it that way the way nature looked at it a morsel of food for these fish a delicacy with rich sweettasting blood and tender flesh a small feast for them in the heat of noon an offering in the celebration of life a tail threshed at the surface close to her but she didnt move didnt turn her head perhaps they were playing perhaps i thought with my breath blocked and my blood chilled they were playing and then she moved at last rolling gently until she was face down and then jackknifing her legs coming out of the water and poising vertically for a second and then sliding out of sight leaving a small ring of ripples that melted away as the big fish drew closer and i knew what i would finally say when they pressed me to it yes i should have tried to talk her out of it tried to save her life she came up three times to breathe and dived three times surfacing closer to the boat than before and breaking the pattern floating across the circle they were making and lifting suddenly from the surface as one of them rose from below and glanced across her back and i had a rope ready in my hands before she got her balance and crawlstroked to the side of the boat and i helped her across the rail he wasnt there with the water streaming from her body the one i was looking for wasnt there streaming from her hair as she faced me with her green eyes shimmering as she lived through this little time in that particular state of grace that comes with a release from close communion with death and then her hands were on me and she drew me down with her and the knife dropped to the hot scented timbers of the deck and lay beside us blood on the deck yes im at sea south of cape florida ten miles from the mainland in a moment condition fully active the knife wound id taken last night had slashed the hip but hadnt cut deep muscle i could still run if i had to she was wiping the blood off the deck over there by the starboard rail the shark had grazed her shoulder blades when it had lifted her from the surface the chief of the miami mafia ferris said has put out a contract on you effective immediately did you know i could have guessed it explained the nicko thing he caught the tone theyve made contact yes another pause and then he said in any case its too dangerous for you to disembark at the quay as you did before youre on board the tug yes he was keeping the exchange of information as brief as he could we werent using a scrambler stay there till dark and ill have you taken off theyll ask for your exact position later understood yes anything to add yes were under surveillance the motor yacht with the limp sails had furled her canvas and had come within a mile of us under power and id caught the glint of twin lenses in a moment he said wait for the dark nightfall so who was firing on you she was splicing a rope making a loopend sitting on a box she had a pair of khaki shorts on nothing else letting her back heal all shed asked me to do was throw seawater over the abrasions i dont know i said i saw the whole thing the fire and everything she worked at the rope did you think id set you up richard why should i you were so wary of me that day is what i mean so untrusting with a brief glance at me but then i suppose youre wary of everyone in your business whatever that is her tone changed became more formal theres nothing you want to tell me and i understand that but i need to know enough about last night the boat crash to satisfy myself that im not an accessory after the fact or concealing evidence or harbouring a criminal ive got a good record and i work for the miami police whenever they can use an extra diver so i want to make sure im not getting involved in anything illegal youve shown me your foreign office card but you can get those printed by some backstreet forger if you know where to find one there were two steps down into the cabin and we were sitting at the forward end out of sight from the sea she knew about the surveillance shed seen the field glasses too the head of the mafia i said has put out a contract on me hence the shooting on the quay and hence my boat trip last night i told her about it hence also the surveillance theyve put on us again i want you to know leaning forward that as soon as im taken off this boat i shall keep well out of your way she looked up why because it puts you at risk i know that but i want to see you again one day look im hardly a tender blushing rose i know luigi toufexis ive met him i did hes the mafia chief yes i did a bit of undercover work for the police here once got involved by accident and made myself useful toufexis is deadly but you dont need telling that look i pick up quite a bit of scuttlebut in my job i know most of the boat owners and some of the coastguard crews she looked down making another splice and the rumour that started going around a couple of days ago is that youre an international cocaine dealer working under uk government cover and you came here to put toufexis out of business hence as you say the contract she looked up to catch my expression wasnt any what shed told me fell right into place it had proctors signature on it he wanted me blown away and hed picked the most powerful weapon in miami to do it with logical bureau procedure is it true kim asked me no george proctor put that story out to bring toufexis down on me you know that i know proctor he would have preferred to make the kill personally as a matter of honour but he was obviously too occupied with other things does he use cocaine yes or he did when i knew him that fell into place too proctor had been known for his integrity and that was why croder was concerned about his lapses in signals to london and he wasnt a man to blow his mind on cocaine just for kicks so it must have been a response to his increasing frustration the bullet near the heart had left him unusable as a shadow executive and hed felt out of it a hasbeen felt emasculated and the coke had given him back the strengthoftenmen feeling the grand illusion was he subject i asked kim to illusions of grandeur sometimes he told me once that he could run for the presidency if he werent a foreigner for the presidency fell into place again hed been exposed to subliminal influence and knew enough about senator mathieson judd to imagine himself in judds position as a presidential candidate tell me about this man judd will you her mouth came open and for a moment she seemed disoriented then she said without hesitation judd is not to be underestimated hes a statesman with a world view that we havent seen since nixon and hes not a megalomaniac hes got to get into the white house because hes the only man in this country who can give it a new direction my own thoughts dipped away and her voice sounded fainter then i surfaced to the full light of consciousness and knew without any question that there hadnt been any time lapse i hadnt missed anything shed been saying its not just the americans who are concerned this time the whole worlds involved and much more than usual when theres a change of administration here i very much hope the thatcher government realises what weve got in mathieson judd because the outcome of this elections going to have a major effect on the uk it was word perfect i could hear the echo of my own voice in my head his understanding of the internecine struggle for power inside the kremlin is infinitely deeper than weve seen before in any us president thanks partly to the lifting of the veil by glasnost sure but judd isnt missing a trick she stopped and in a moment looked down and pulled another strand into the splice the swell lifted the boat again and i leaned lower sighting along the stern rail the yacht was still at the same distance i couldnt see the light on the lenses this time go on i said she looked up what tell me more about judd thats all i know a point then for the debriefing kim harvester had come under the subliminal influence only in proctors flat and not for very long we could assume there was no radionic device on board the tug she was not therefore a target like proctor my own exposure had been different id picked up some background material on judd and also picked up instructions which hadnt necessarily been for me the swell lifted us again and i checked the sailing yacht it hadnt moved it was nearly sundown and i said are you heading back to port after theyve taken me off yes ive got three morning lessons the first one at six is this boat faster than that one over there quietly she said i can look after myself richard do you keep a gun on board of course she dropped the spliced rope and leaned back stretching her slight breasts touched by the light of the setting sun its rather nice she said you know ive played about with bombs and done some undercover work against the mafia and youve seen what i do with sharks but you still seem to think of me as a woman and in need of protection i like that dates me i suppose no becomes you were going to nassau ferris said to meet monck and a few other people he was watching me steadily with his pale champagnecoloured eyes watching for nerves fatigue signs of disorientation id told him id been in that wreckage down there wed seen the mafia boat hanging from a crane at the quayside when wed taken off toufexis would assume id been killed with the others because no one had seen me come ashore but it was risky to rely on that because of the surveillance theyd mounted on the tug out there i could have been recognised id never seen such tight security and for once i was glad of it two of the bureau people had picked me up at sea in a converted motor torpedo boat at nightfall and got me from the harbour to the airport in a shortbodied limo with tinted windows and brought it across the tarmac and right up to the cessna citation and i didnt see ferris until i went aboard when did you eat last a couple of hours ago sleep i caught up injuries minor morale very good because id got the diary from nickos wallet and it could give us access to proctor i gave it to ferris and he began peeling the pages apart it had got soaked and dried again a mafia type used it when he phoned proctor he got the number from it proctors or a number where proctor was at the time he went through the pages taking care some of the ink had run light spread against the cabin roof as we banked over the citys brilliance grp ferris said and snapped his belt open and got out of his seat are you going to use the phone i asked him yes then do me a favour i want some protection for kim harvester can you manage that two men when he didnt ask why because that could wait and he didnt cavil it would mean diverting the services of two men in shifts round the clock and london would want a very good reason indeed and ferris knew that and hed have to take the responsibility and this was one of the things i liked about him he trusted the man he was running and he didnt ask questions that little bastard loman would have wanted forms in triplicate sent from london with a tensheet questionnaire and a request for notarisation and god knew how i could ever persuade him to push all that lot past his sphincter muscles as soon as you can arrange it i told ferris two men taking shifts yes and theyll need a boat available could they use the mtb yes shes bringing the tug in to port early tonight she would have started back as soon as i was taken off berth at the place where they shot me up decent of you he went forward into the cockpit and i loosened the laces of my shoes because theyd shrunk a bit when theyd dried out and id have to get another pair as soon as i could because if your feet arent absolutely comfortable it can take the edge off your speed at a run and that can be fatal if youre pushing things ferris came back i didnt phone that number direct im having it checked for the address the odds are i said that its riverside it could be anywhere point taken the executive tends to get tunnel vision the deeper he goes into the mission while his director in the field can keep a more open perspective and see things the shadow can miss i havent i said in a moment picked up any more instructions id seen it in his eyes when id mentioned riverside he didnt look relieved he didnt necessarily believe me i could have had further subliminal instructions piped into me with an injunction to keep them secret he didnt say anything im fairly certain i told him that theres nothing electronic on board harvesters boat she didnt have any more to say about mathieson judd i checked her for that and she just gave me a repetition of what shed given me before he pulled out a minirecorder and pressed a button debriefing had started so shed picked up that bit at proctors it was the same thing id picked up myself when i went there that night the reason i want her protected is that theyre still surveilling the boat and they might make a snatch and force her to give them all the information shed got about me none of its vital but i dont want her to go through interrogation at the hands of people like that in a moment he said without looking at me whats the personal relationship at this point between you and harvester none of your bloody business he hesitated a fraction and then pressed rewind and play and got the tape back to hands of people like that and reset for record you ought to know i dont let personal relationships cloud my judgement during a mission except for the man you wiped out in the underground three that wasnt during a mission look i hitched round in my seat to face him if you want to make an issue of my relationship with i dont he said and his eyes stopped me dead what time do we get in making bloody conversation you notice to bring the tension down what annoyed me was that you cant ever win a point with this man the way id reacted to his question about harvester had told him precisely what he wanted to know seven he said give or take a few minutes in the same tone how close did you come to buying it in the mafia boat oh for christs sake i got my nerve back hours ago easy now you see my good friend what i mean hed got his answer i had not got my nerve back hours ago despite kims tender ministrations do you feel like a little more debriefing of course he pressed for record again and i told him about the execution thing on the mafia boat naming names and getting the timing right as close as i could remember this woman monique ferris said at last what about her i dont know she was with proctor that night when i went to his place but we didnt say anything more than hello and goodbye he made it clear he wanted to be alone for the meeting but on the quay last night she did her best to convince nicko hed got the wrong man did her very best check on the woman monique ferris said into the mike to me so you came out of it with the diary anything else my life bridling again quick to anger its well understood he said courteously that the diary could locate proctor for us its understood that even if youd brought nothing out of the incident the life of the executive for barracuda is of inestimable value we youve got purdom i said standing by came out with it very fast and the tone was bitter and the instant it was over i was appalled because the bloody thing was still running and there was the loud clear and irretractable record of my hitherto hidden fear that purdom had been brought in to follow the mission in the background in case i bought it and he had to take over sweating a little the nerves heating the blood debriefing you see is not always easy theyll dig right down into your soul and drag it into the sour light of inspection ferris said quietly the expression in his amber eyes guileless and to be trusted if purdom had been down as the executive for barracuda i would have refused it and if he is ever obliged to take over i would ask london to replace me as the director in the field breakthrough quiller with a nod how are you croder good enough sir and you quite well and at this stage of the mission when we didnt yet have certain access to the objective and theyd sent the chief of signals out here from london without warning anyone the nerves can get a bit on edge and i was already reading significance into the slightest word by quite well did he mean considering the executive in the field had made so little progress that the chief of signals himself had been sent out here to ask what was happening he was the last man i expected to see here watching me with his black eyes buried into his skull and his thin body held tightly within itself to hide any expression the last time wed met wed had a row over that poor devil fisher and i wasnt in a mood to put up with any bullshit his eyes briefly noting the state of my clothes shall we sit down gentlemen she didnt even keep an iron on board i just hang everything out in the sun sorry creaking of leather as people moved the chairs around six of us in here ferris croder monck a man i didnt know purdom and myself purdom dark bigboned silent simmering with frustrated energy come here to sit on my shoulder like a vulture on a tombstone damn his eyes i was not in the mood i tell you for being rubbed the wrong way all is well ferris said quietly from the next chair my nerves had been showing and i cant stand that its appallingly poor security it had been nothing more than a brush with the infinite out there in that boat last night and i was still alive and it was time to get back into gear for gods sake youve met mr monck of course but not tench have you i hadnt seen him before short studiouslooking glasses almost as heldin as that man purdom just nodded to us as we said hello hes here to assist me croder added which could of course mean anything he could be a bureau shrink sent out here to check my condition note whether my eyes were flickering whether i was putting out sweat things like that they do this sometimes people like loman do it theyll send someone out to the field to give an opinion as to whether the shadow is showing the worse for wear whether he ought to be recalled before the rot sets in but listen i was still in good shape and ferris was still in control and i didnt want these bastards watch it youll have to watch it hes probably nothing more than a cipher clerk sent here to look after signals steady the breathing loosen the hands go into alpha for a couple of minutes calm the ego down nice room it was a nice room bit modern but not too institutional for a place like this we were in the deputy high commisioners office in east street no one else around or at least not visible a security guard had shown us in and gone off again thered been more security on the way here from the airport four men deployed at a distance with their jackets bulging and their heads constantly on the swivel one of them worried when ferris had wandered off track a bit to tread on a beetle i wish to christ you wouldnt do that but he never takes any notice it was instantaneous hes got a laugh like a snake shedding its skin as you know if youll give me a little time croder said and began turning the sheets of the debriefing book i think i reached alpha but only for a few seconds felt too restless got up and walked about to look at the pictures on the wall tugged at the laces and pulled my shoes off and walked about like that what a bloody relief saw ferris making a note on his pad new shoes i suppose he doesnt miss anything the phone rang and tench picked it up at the first ring and said yes but was it urgent and then listened for half a minute and finally said all right and passed the phone to croder cocktail sir id seen it on the board before id left london it was jowetts thing one of our first in sri lanka when was this you cant tell anything from croders tone he talks like a lawyer reading a will i saw ferris watching him what are his chances this i didnt need jowett had had a wheel come off and his chances werent worth a damn because the man at the board didnt know how to help him and you do not you do not raise the chief through cheltenham when hes in the next hemisphere with a major mission already on his hands unless theres a life in the balance has he got it with him the product the poor bastard had pushed it right into the endphase and hed got the product and hed been running like hell for the coast on board a plane or in a hertz or buried under a sack of oats in a truck and someone had blown him or hed left traces behind and now he was holed up in a telephone box with blood in his shoes and the fear of god in his soul and ringing london tugging on the lifeline to see if it was still there still strong enough to get him home to get him home alive while have you informed hallows i tell you i did not need this it wasnt exactly what youd call reassuring was it i mean hallows is the man they send for when something has got to be done extremely fast not in my private opinion in a lastditch attempt to succour the executive but as a gesture of concern so that it can be spelled out in the final report that they had tried at least they had tried tell him croder said and i knew the words by heart that every endeavour will be made but that he is confidently expected to use his own discretion discretion capsule yes he gave the phone back to tench who dropped it on to the contact with the sound i swear of a coffinlid closing silence in the room for another ten minutes while croder got through the rest of the debriefing book and tench stroked the back of his untidylooking head and purdom stared at his hands and monck sat like a crumpledlooking buddha in the biggest chair and i talked to croder in the soundless confines of the mind dont you care about that man jowett is that all you can do send for hallows to disinfect the final report so that we can all sleep in our beds you ought to be on that bloody telephone raising all the support you can get for that poor bastard you should be oh for gods sake spare us the melodrama theres a ferret in a trap and he cant get out thats all its not the first time its happened and it wont be the last rip so forth and let us get on gentlemen with the job very well the coilspring spine of the debriefing book made a faint discordant medley of notes across croders steel hand as he closed it and dropped it onto his lap and looked at me and said proctor then i would value your opinion first obvious question and id had the answer ready in my mind ive only met him once but id say hes been suffering the increasing strain of being taken off the active list because of the bullet in his body it looks as if hes been exposed to some sort of subliminal radionic suggestion which could have changed his personality at the subconscious level destroying his sense of loyalty which used to be very high and turning him against us i also found out today that hes been on cocaine for quite a while and manifested illusions of grandeur he once told harvester he could have run for the us presidency if he werent a foreign national he harvester with a glance at the book is she a reliable source of information ferris hadnt moved in his chair but i felt the waves i think he was expecting croder to ask me what sort of relationship i had going with harvester ferris likes his fun she was a nurse in england for seven years shes done some undercover work for the miami police in their investigations into mafia operations and shes currently a civilian volunteer diver the police can call on if they need an extra hand she was working for them last night when a boat smashed into the quay ive talked to her over a period of seven or eight hours and in my opinion shes reliable in terms of information and can be trusted i see with care you have a tendency to enter into personal relationships with women during the course of a mission i would like to ask id like to tell you that the success ive had in my work for the bureau indicates a degree of intelligence that would hardly allow my judgement to be swayed in critical situations but if youve got any doubts about it then you can send me straight back to london so that i dont have to sit here listening to bullshit it was eighty degrees outside but im not absolutely sure there wasnt frost on the window look i know im rather rude but this bloody man had been going to ask whether i was capable of carrying out the tasks of a senior shadow executive without selling the whole mission down the river at the first sight of a nubile woman and it made me cross and if you dont understand what im talking about its your problem the silence had gone on for an awfully long time i caught a look in moncks eyes that could have been amusement then ferris said evenly quiller came very close sir to losing his life in the early hours of this morning and i think civil of you i said but i can manage my own buttons now didnt make things any easier i know and that was a damned shame i waited for croder to ask me for an apology as soon as the smoke cleared a bit but he did a surprising thing thank you to ferris and then to me at this stage of the mission youll have certain questions in your mind concerning the background and i think you should have the answers ill be brief proctor is a british subject and hes become involved in some kind of subversive activity on us soil and seemingly in connection with senator mathieson judds presidential election campaign waved his steel claw im taking this from the debriefing notes and partly from my own information from other sources the notes by the way to ferris now for the most part provide a very direct focus on the background data thats been coming in from international sources you are both closer i believe to success in this mission than youre at present able to appreciate i thought that was extremely doubtful because we couldnt get anywhere near the endphase until wed found physical access to proctor but of course croder could see the whole picture and i couldnt the fact of proctors involvement in us affairs gives us concern that he might cause harm to our ally it could at least cause embarrassment on a diplomatic level the american people are at present engrossed and engaged in the elections and any interference by the uk however unintentional could hazard the relationship between the two countries that is one reason why you were sent out here quiller to find proctor and get him out of the usa as soon as possible and in secret another reason is that we cannot warn and advise either the cia or the fbi and let them take care of the matter because weve been informed that both those services may have been compromised even if that were not so we are able and prepared to question proctor once in our hands more effectively than could be done in the us where special methods of inducement could not be practised and on that subject i have a question youve been through two missions with proctor isnt that so yes i realise he might have undergone some sort of change in personality since then but would you say hed be liable to offer information sufficiently induced in a minute i said i dont know i cant say they dont get out the cutlery in that particular room at the bureau i mean they dont use curling tongs anaesthetics on the eyelids needles in the urethra that sort of thing but they use the hood you mean youre unsure of his present mental condition well yes its a bit complex now his heads full of strange ideas and his nerves are possibly strung out on coke and id say hes more like a dangerous psychopath than an intelligence agent you could try hooding of course it might break him croder called it sufficient inducement because in a trade as uncivilised as ours we reach for euphemisms for the same reason that a coroner reaches for the smellingsalts hooding doesnt cause pain and its physically noninvasive and all they do is shut you in that particular soundproofed room with a black bag over your head until youre ready to tell them what they want to know the sanitised term is sensory deprivation and i went through a bit of it in turkey and its a lot less pleasant than it sounds because after two or three days you start floating about in a mental vacuum until finally the panic begins and then youre done for because when they come to take the hood off youll either tell them what they want to know and keep your psyche intact or youll keep your mouth shut and go right over the edge and if youre lucky youll finish up in the funny farm neither of these things happened to me in turkey because one of the people looking after things came close enough for me to reach his throat and hed got the keys of the handcuffs on him one way monck told croder might be to keep him short of cocaine catch him while hes screaming his head off ferris was making a note thank you croder said we could indeed try that turning the sheets of the debriefing book from what ive just told you then quiller youll know that if at any time the cia or the fbi get wind of us and ask you what youre doing in miami youll need to stick closely to your cover if they decide to detain you on suspicion your director in the field will ask london to make representations through private diplomatic channels there is always for instance a certain amount of suspicion aroused if youre seen crawling out of a burning car with bullet holes in it or climbing out of the water a hundred yards from a wrecked mafia boat at three in the morning thats why id avoided questioning on both occasions understood i said ferris ferris nodded and turned to me you also need to know that we found a microtransmitter concealed in the ceiling fan in proctors flat weve sent it to london for them to look at but in the meantime parks has told us he thinks its designed to broadcast subliminal material from a remote source buried in the wave structure of any kind of electrical hum fan refrigerator it would also work in a tv set whenever its receiving a signal parks is still taking proctors flat to pieces looking for more electronics croder was going through the debriefing book again id like some elaboration on this newsbreak anchorwoman erica cambridge youve reported that shes anxious to find george proctor ferris had debriefed me on this in the air but there was a lot i hadnt been able to say she told me she wanted to find him very much but that it wasnt for any personal reason do you think thats true yes i think they were close in fact she said so but i sensed that when they broke up there was a lot of unfinished business political business she asked me what we were going to do with proctor when we found him and i said wed get him out of the country right away ferris was making notes again croder asked me how did she react to that she wanted a meeting with him before we got him out and i used that as a tradeoff yes you guaranteed she should see him provided she helped you find him perhaps its not important but do you feel its a guarantee we should keep ethically yes your ethics might not be mine ive been trained to play it rough but a meeting between those two suitably bugged would probably give you a lot of information if we can find him i suppose ferris was making those notes for purdom keeping the bastard briefed ready to take my place over my dead body joke if we can find him monck said yes he was watching me steadily what do you think the chances are it would help us to know your feelings on that not really my feelings werent terribly sanguine phone again and tench picked it up proctor is a professional i said a top professional hes trained and hes dangerous and hes apparently got the whole of the miami mafia behind him and that gives him god knows how many places he can hide ferris was on the phone tench had passed it to him croder said to me you dont think our chances then are very high i tried to keep the tone under control didnt quite manage oh for christs sake dyou want it in letters of blood then one of those silly coincidences happened youve known them im sure because ferris was saying im sorry to break in but theyve checked on that phone number in the diary the one with the initials grp and i think youve located proctor hes on board the contessa risk i want a twentyfourhour watch ferris said on the phone on the cutter for the motoryacht contessa it normally ties up at quay the bayside marina i noticed croders assistant tench watching me obliquely hed obviously gathered id made some kind of breakthrough when i caught his eye he looked down stroking the back of his head he did that a lot frightened i rather think of croder and his responsibilities and the stroking was meant to show how relaxed he was youll need four men two for each shift i want a photograph of everyone who boards that cutter or disembarks from it and ill tell you by radio if i want anyone tagged questions purdom hadnt reacted he sat with his head down waiting for doom i think hed made up his mind i was going to finish up with a dumdum in the left ventricle and his feet were already on the starting blocks the fact that we now knew where proctor was didnt guarantee i wouldnt bite the dust at any given moment according to the terms of the contract the mafia had put out on me but i wished he wouldnt sit there with his nerves twanging like that it didnt help starting immediately ferris said and gave the phone back to tench looking at croder signal sir yes before we leave here signal the board for barracuda for the eyes of bureau one executive has located objective c of s informed mr shepley would be pleased and so would holmes standing there in the shadows between the floodlit signals boards itd take the edge off his nerves be okay to get himself another cup of coffee celebrate so forth but it might be all that caffeine inside him that keeps him at such a pitch you know ive never thought of that congratulations croder said watching me darkeyed brooding busying his mind already with the future because it was one thing to locate the objective and another thing to get him away from that privatelyowned and wellprotected vessel out there and take him to london and fry his brains out under a hood now id like to talk a little more about the anchorwoman theres now an obvious question in our minds isnt there yes indeed when she went aboard the contessa last night had she known proctor was there your report was necessarily brief can you remember what she actually said about proctor yes one thing was she said it would help us if we let her see him before we got him out of the country she said shed got a great deal of information on him it took another ten minutes to give him a replay of the scene in kruger drug last night then i called up the other material that hadnt been specifically about proctor she told me id caught her at a critical no a crucial time and that she needed help there was no one she could trust she has no friends she didnt know if theyd be strong enough i quote for what i asked him to give me a minute i dont know how strong theyd be if things got really rough and none of them know about george proctor okay we were close yes but they dont know about this thing thats happening told croder thing he dropped the word like a stone into the silence i dont know i said what the thing is but she began talking about proctor again before we left kruger drug pictured her face her hands spread on the marbletopped table listened for her voice he still had a reserve i couldnt get through and i believe he was doing things unknown to me that would have surprised me correction alarmed me frightened me not just personally i mean on a geopolitical scale i want to get this right on a clandestine geopolitical scale told croder he didnt comment and i kept on going she said something interesting about the late howard hughes that he had a mad dream about buying america by getting control of the industry the machinery behind the throne she said there was an easier way that to buy america all you had to do was buy one man the president i sat back you must have asked her to elaborate on that i would have but her bodyguard brought her a remote phone she had to go who was the caller did you a mr sakomoto was he the japanese you saw boarding the cutter with her i dont know he you tagged cambridge ferris from kruger drug to riverside and she came out of the house with the japanese and you tagged them to the quay is that right yes but he wasnt necessarily sakomoto there could be several japanese croder said in that house yes and how did you leave the cambridge woman leave at kruger drug what was said do you remember she asked me when we could meet again and i said id phone her the next day she today yes she said it was vital that we met again as soon as possible and that shed stay at her phone until noon croder scuffed through the book you didnt telephone her i was on board harvesters boat all the morning at that time i wasnt certain i could trust her and i only used the phone once to call ferris just a twoword signal shadow safe it looks ferris said as if youll need to meet cambridge again especially now now that shes been on board the contessa and may have seen proctor she may be still there croder said on board i doubt that she goes on the air every day in a minute from now monck said tench is there a tv in that cabinet he pulled open the double doors yes sir turn it on and cut the sound down and play the channels were looking for these are my views you know the one erica cambridge oh yes channel monck said half past nine thank you sir flick flick flick and the juiciest cheeseburger you ever saw dripping with some kind of sauce then lots of them with lots of people with big white glistening teeth all biting into them with the cheese pulled out into strings fade out fade in some shadowed cleavage no ferris was saying on the phone but you can leave a signal there how is jowett doing tench i said use that other phone and get me the number for newsbreak studios miami will you jowett asked croder when ferris had rung off theres no news jowett had run cocktail into the shit in sri lanka knocking on the door tench went across and opened it the security guard and a man in a khaki suit and carrying a worn leather bag looking around whos the patient this is dr hornby ferris said bloody doctors he must have sent for him i pulled my shirt up and hornby came over and looked at the dressing and began loosening it tench asked me if i wanted him to get newsbreak yes i want to leave a message for erica cambridge its good of you to turn out ferris said and took a look at the wound i was only mending a rod fishing rod was it a clean knife or dirty id say clean woman did these these stitches yes thought so wonderfully drawn nurse yes theyre underrated you know shed like to meet you good evening im erica cambridge and these are my views the violet eyes the brilliant smile shuffling the papers yesterday in new hampshire it looked as if senator mathieson judd was for the first time pandering to the dictates of those on his campaign staff who have been trying to persuade him ive got newsbreak on the line sir her show i took the phone who is this bennie has put it to counterbalance the republican candidates serious and perhaps solemn approach to the matter in hand but in my view ladies and gentlemen i thought she looked a degree nervous just a degree bennie this is richard keyes ask miss cambridge to telephone me would you as soon as she comes off the air she can find me at shes not here mr keyes she taped the show tonight thats right look if she happens to call give her this number see me in four days hornby said heres my card his respect and regard for the electorate so what happened in new hampshire was not rehearsed was not premeditated it was real some of you were there i believe i thanked hornby and tucked my shirt in again had she met proctor on that yacht that would make her nervous a degree nervous unless of course shed been lying unless shed known already that he was there i phoned her apartment shes not here mr keyes im sorry can you tell me where i can find her she just went out thats all i know i left both numbers where she could find me and ferris picked up the other phone monck told him ask your people if they saw her come off the cutter but of course the tone acid ferris can get touchy when people give the impression he cant think straight we need that woman croder said we need her badly yes i said wed begun feeling jumpy now all of us especially purdom when wed parted company at kruger drug last night shed told me it was vital we got together again as soon as possible and since then shed gone to riverside and shed gone aboard the yacht out there and if she still wanted to talk to me she might give me the evidence we needed to push barracuda straight into the endphase she is our new objective croder said for the mission the thin body buried in its clothes the gaunt head sunk onto the shoulders the obsidianblack eyes watching me to see if i understood how very important cambridge had suddenly become to us all if shell cooperate i said we shall do all we can to persuade her the bleak bright barewalled scene of an interrogation cell flashed across my mind triggered by the word persuade but of course he didnt mean that we would approach erica cambridge if we could with civilised blandishments and exhortations like the gentlemen we are what time was that ferris on the phone you said she uses a bodyguard croder asked me she was using one last night i need two people ferris said on the newsbreak building front and rear and i want you to keep a watch for her limousine youve got the number if shes seen anywhere at any time i want to know immediately and dont let her out of your sight this is ferris croder said hold it looking across at him if shes not using a bodyguard tell them to give her protection ferris repeated that and said it was fully urgent and rang off and then everyone was standing up and monck said dont waste any time and i tied my shoelaces and purdom opened the door and we were on our way out when one of the telephones began ringing i went back and picked it up is mr keyes there please speaking this is erica cambridge the tone quiet and urgent im speaking from the limo they called me with your message why didnt you call me i waited until noon i was prevented they were all watching me and i gave a slow nod where can we meet im on my way to the party at the marina yacht club theyre giving it for senator judd thats why i had to tape my show for today did you catch it by any chance i was at a meeting im sorry you missed it some of the things i said were a little different a lot of things are different now mr keyes i want to tell you about them can you get to the party youre in nassau right now arent you she knew by the number we need to meet somewhere more private than a yacht club afterwards look if you can get here before say midnight you should do that this is a campaign party and itll go on till the morning and theres a man i want you to meet ill keep him here as long as i can it shouldnt be too difficult he has the hots for me whats his name stylus von brinkerhoff i could meet him somewhere privately it has to be low key a casual introduction a beat then because i hadnt said anything she went on its really very important for you to meet him mr keyes and there are some things i have to tell you one is you dont need to look for george proctor any more you know what im saying i didnt like the pressure shed started to put on me or it could be nerves a touch of apprehension before barracuda was pushed headlong into a new phase look i have to pick someone up and take them along and i wont be able to talk in front of them i dont have more than a minute im going to leave you an invitation at the desk of the marina yacht club and you can ask for it there its black tie mr keyes you just dont appreciate how important it is for you to be there tonight all you have to do is trust me the line went dead and i put the phone down that was cambridge asked croder yes i filled him in verbatim how does it strike you this was ferris and he spoke before anyone else could the ranking here went from monck through croder to ferris and me but ferris was my director in the field and the mission was running and it was his sole and sacrosanct responsibility to look after his executive and he was making that quite clear she used rather a lot of obvious pressure dont you think when she said you had to trust her did she sound hurt or indignant no persuasive did she sound out of tune argot he meant out of character ive only met her once croder said can you bring it down to the odds that its a trap yes purdom had begun tapping the tips of his fingers together not making any noise just doing it quietly not knowing he was doing it wished hed stop the thing is i said weve taken a lot of trouble keeping me under cover since the mafia thing last night and wed be coming right out into the open again if i went there to the party monck had been shuffling around the room and now he stopped and said with his head on one side lets try it this way how much do you think you could learn if you met her there a lot if shes genuine if it isnt a trap beginning to feel the chill a little ive walked into traps before knowing once or twice what i was doing but theyd been the kind where you stood a chance of doing something very fast or very deadly a chance of getting out again with what youd gone in for the product some kind of information dragging a man back to base for interrogation or bringing away papers photographs tapes i dont mind taking a risk as long as its calculated as long as its worth taking but the problem wed got here was that we couldnt tell what the odds were whether it was worth it or not whether it was worth walking into the marina yacht club and hearing a long way off in the distances of the mind the swinging of a hinge and the closing of steel doors and the dying away of the echo in the dark ferris this was croder asking for a decision from the dip from the man who knew the field better than anyone who knew the executive and what he could do what he couldnt do couldnt be asked to do if you went in there he spoke directly to me youd have all the support we can raise fifteen or twenty people trained talented armed and strategically dispersed they couldnt stop a long shot they would check the environment very carefully purdom was still tapping his fingertips together and it worried me and i turned my head but ferris got in very fast and made a gesture and purdom froze and looked down suddenly turned away hadnt known hed been doing it and i saw monck and croder pick up the score all very nervy we were all very nervy because if i walked into that place and wed got it wrong wed lose barracuda lose it to a single shot sweat beginning cold on the skin said to ferris do you think i should do it with his customary care i think you should consider doing it but consider well the chances arent very good and the last word of course is yours car going past in the street someone calling out faint laughter la dolce vita i think its worth the risk balloons if von brinkerhoff is there well have him tagged of course there was a heathaze right across the city as we swung into the approach path and the lights glimmered through it brightening as we lowered ask her about that script she was using for last nights show ferris said does she remember working it out according to campaign logic or did it just come to her from out of the blue as a flash of inspiration but i wouldnt suggest she might have been under subliminal direction or that she might still be why not its delicate ground and it might panic her it panicked you flaps down i was feeling all right he hadnt asked me how i felt because hed got a pretty good idea when i say i was feeling all right i really mean i was feeling normal normal for this particular situation i was going straight into a red sector and we couldnt hope to cover all the contingencies because a gun is a gun and they dont have to be very big and they can be quite accurate if people know how to use them and they can drop a man from a distance even in a crowd even with a silencer in place ask her if shed be willing to meet mr croder and mr monck i halflistened he wasnt really briefing me he knew id got a rough idea of what we wanted out of erica cambridge he was making conversation covering the important points to see if i had any questions yes but giving me comfort at the same time giving me someone to talk to as we levelled out and the blue lamps flickered past the windows and the bump came the first of three because what we were doing was executing a tradeoff balancing the odds and deciding that the life of the executive for the mission was worth putting at risk providing the chance of getting vital information was high enough so i was feeling normal for the situation a hollowness in the stomach a chill on the skin the palms slightly moist the feeling that i was on my way to an execution wasnt new id had it a hundred times and as recently as last night when little fat nicko was taking me across the darkling main to a rendezvous with the grim reaper god rest his stinking little soul i did not like that man execution yes nothing new but this was different because everything looked so civilised and i was sitting here in moncks dinner jacket and there was going to be an invitation left for me at the marina yacht club for this very plush party and i was meeting a rather attractive woman there so forth different but no better no better my good friend because a trap is a trap and in this trade you dont often get out alive youll have immediate contact of course whenever you need it ferris said and pulled his valise from under the seat in front he meant i could signal any one of his people in the environment and talk to them tell them what i wanted pine veneer and simple handles nothing fancy joke draughty out here on the tarmac ferris had phoned from the plane for a chopper to stand by for our arrival in miami and take us to the shuttle pad by the yacht club because the timing had been tight and it was now and we didnt know how long cambridge would be able to keep von brinkerhoff there a customs and immigration man was waiting for us and we stood there showing papers with our hair all over the place and then he said everything was okay and we got into the hughes liftoff croder will be following on ferris said and hell be available for a meeting with cambridge if she seems amenable a tuft of his thin strawcoloured hair still sticking up at this stage anything can happen and with a bit of luck she might be ready to give us the whole thing and we can wrap up the mission keeping things cheerful you understand knows his job ferris down at lowering across the masts in the marina heeling a little as the pilot brought most of the power off and turned through the last few degrees and then settled her carefully on the skids a nice enough building the yacht club as youd imagine pale red brick and white window frames pillared portico and wide green lawns people standing outside on the balconies with drinks in their hands the women in long colourful dresses im not if you want to know particularly keen on parties because you cant hear what people are saying with all the noise and that wouldnt matter so much but youve got to put in some kind of answer here and there for the sake of politesse ferris opening the door and dropping onto the pad and waiting for me a lastminute rush of apprehension as i followed him ducking under the rotors and already seeing some of them not far away some of his people one of them the man whod got me into that cab on the quay when the shed had caught fire two days ago good people well trained a comfort yes i swung the door of the chopper shut and turned round and faced the building and blew the cover theyd been giving me since theyd taken me off the tug last night blew it to the winds the mafia had got a contract out on me and toufexiss people had been given my photograph and thered be some of them here tonight and i felt the sudden airrush and the bloody thing droning into the skull and then it was over and i was back in control eighteen men ferris said your own little army and touched my elbow and turned away and i walked along the tiled path between the massed geraniums not hurrying because i was here now and the party was far from over by the look of things a crowd of black polished limousines in the car park on my left with chauffeurs standing around and two of our people near the wrought iron gates i didnt know exactly what orders croder had given for tonight but he wouldnt have put this amount of support in the field just to keep things jolly so i suppose hed told them to watch for a gun hand moving and make a killing drop in time to protect me theyd carry official bodyguard licences to keep the fuss down when the police wanted to know what was happening this was routine bureau procedure skin beginning to itch because the warmth of the night was heating up the teflon i was wearing under the dinnerjacket people crossing the portico on their way to the car park only half a dozen police officers standing around so i suppose senator judd had already left it was midnight if hed still been here there would have been fifty of them but there were a great many other people also standing around most of them in blue serge suits there would be a lot of highechelon guests here tonight targets for political activists and weirdos hi can i help you brilliant smile a small corsage of carnations one bare shoulder florida chic there should be an invitation here for me richard keyes the name for the face in the photograph they would know my name too shortening the odds yes on the other hand sure mr keyes i have it right here im sorry you missed the senator was he good ohhh with her eyes shining rolling to heaven every hormone in her slim preened body lining up to vote for golden boy on the other hand it wouldnt be easy in a crowd this big to squeeze off a shot and get clear with all those chauffeurs and police officers and bodyguards standing around and less easy still to pump out some rapid fire from an uzi that would attract even more attention and they wouldnt reach the car before the police dropped them with a fusillade seek comfort my good friend seek comfort where ye may enjoy what there is left mr keyes the smile shimmering the corsage quivering slightly to the body language what there is left of what my little darling you mean my life champagne sir thank you cutting quite a dash in my borrowed plumage glass in hand the truth of the matter concealed beneath silk lapels the teflon itching on the skin proof against anything up to armourpiercing grade but if they were professionals theyd go for the head youll make it mathieson strung out in huge gold letters on a banner across the podium where the band was playing a dozen couples still on the dance floor their shoes brushing through coloured streamers two waiters on their knees picking at the carpet where a glass had fallen and smashed three japanese talking together by one of the tall whiteframed windows and erica cambridge well hello mr keyes slight coollooking in a sheer white silk gown with a lame belt lame shoes her violet eyes watching me as the smile was flashed on for the occasion you look stunning in fact did thank you did you just get here yes did you come alone yes then you didnt see mathieson i heard he was very good hes looking away looking back i have a lot to tell you why dont we go outside where its quieter its like a turkish bath out there i led her towards the white moulded archways opposite the windows giving my glass to a waiter i got here as soon as i could the slapping sound of a rotor cut across the music as another chopper landed croder will follow on ferris had said or it could be picking up some of the guests stylus couldnt stay erica said he had to get back we found a couch blue linen with white rope trim where it was quiet enough to talk someone had left a brocade bag back to the contessa stylus von brinkerhoff she looked at me sharply youre well informed mr keyes my first name is richard im sorry i missed him what do you know about him you said you had a lot to tell me maam is this your bag oh my god ive been frantic thank you so very youre erica cambridge i just love your show thank you well im interrupting how is proctor i asked her when the woman had gone she looked surprised again wary one cant always remember but i think ive never seen a woman so frightened beneath the maquillage so close to some kind of brink i didnt see him she said but hes on board the contessa reaction after reaction and i began worrying that all she had to tell me was what we already knew i believe i mentioned mr richard that i have no one i can really confide in really trust i i suppose ive gone through life antagonising people at least thats my reputation so why should i confide in you why should i trust you no earthly reason you dont even know me youre not making it easy for yourself i was i didnt ask you to trust me erica theres no obligation but if you want my guarantee that i wont divulge anything you have to tell me without your permission i can give you my word how much is it worth im sorry thats not very its unbreakable would you be prepared to talk to my people who are they officers of the british government her hands were on the move again as theyd been when wed sat at the table in kruger drug correction not frightened beneath the maquillage awed awed by what she knew what shed found out at west riverside way and on board the contessa the british government she said is involved the entire world is involved i look if youre willing to see my people i can arrange it youd have more confidence in them than just one stranger theyre much higher than i am it was a getout but it was logical if she was ready to talk to ferris and croder and monck i could walk out of this thing and go home with a whole skin and let them put it down in the records mission completed executive debriefed because if this woman had the information we needed that was exactly what id be doing completing barracuda she was our new objective and i was close to handing her over whether i agree to see your people or not ive decided to go to the state department running one violetlacquered fingernail along the white rope trim unable to keep still it would then be for them to consult with the president and for him to decide whether to summon our allied ambassadors but i dont know richard this whole thing is her hand brushing the air its so farreaching and this is what scares me i want to help senator judd get into the white house and in fact im already helping him do that but now that ive learned what i have i dont know if it isnt the most dangerous thing i could do for everyone for the united states and the rest of the world i didnt say anything i know he went thataway simon gusty laughter much champagne he said the mens room trotting past with uncertain feet arm in arm but where is nancy not in the mens room let us hope more laughter there are some people i have to talk to richard before i can leave but not about this lets meet on the front porch in fifteen minutes well go to my apartment and ill show you what im talking about its actually on paper duplicated you know what im saying a whole brief do you understand the product mission completed unless it was a trap i didnt know how good an actress she was i didnt know if the fright in this woman the feeling of awe didnt derive from the knowledge that she was about to do what theyd briefed her to do when she was on board the contessa lead a man to his death proctor had been there on that yacht let that be borne in mind because yesterday hed asked la cosa nostra to put out a contract on me and theyd come so very close to a kill dont go with her you have a point i need to know a little more i told her we cant talk now i asked you to come here to meet that man not to discuss what i know my apartment has a security guard and youll be absolutely im used to looking after my own security thats why i need to know more she looked hunted glancing around her but in a public place like this its very private actually there are no bugs in the walls give me the gist i need to know how serious this thing is whether in fact it was serious enough to force me to take the risk of going to her apartment she looked around her again pressed frightened that was my impression all right she said in a moment here it is she moved back against the wall against the big mural of sails heeling across a choppy sea with spindrift blowing and said quickly and softly i told you there were plans with senator judd as the prime mover to buy america i know more about it now on board the contessa theres a faction calling itself the trust frighteningly powerful awesomely influential in world affairs it has people like apostolos simitis the shipping magnate lord joplyn of eastleigh who controls more than half the mineral deposits in south africa takao sakomoto the leading industrialist in japan maybe you havent heard of these men no then take it from me theyre the puppet masters behind the scenes of international finance people like stylus von brinkerhoff the swiss banker the man i was hoping you could meet here tonight they she broke off as someone came through the arches towards the rest rooms passing within a dozen feet of us in a moment my god this is so dangerous talking in a place like this but you wanted the gist and its this richard these men plan to buy america and sell it to the soviets in the declared interests of the final and permanent laying down of arms among nations they propose the creation of a single world government behind whose public throne they can exert their private power and to meet the enormous demands of demographic reorganisation they envisage the setting of that throne to be in moscow watching me for my reaction didnt see anything but my pulse was elevated i could feel it it was going to be worth it then worth going to her flat taking the risk because she couldnt be making this up it had the appalling ring of truth well go there separately i said to my apartment yes i have the limo here we can talk no i said for the sake of security yours or mine it seemed to worry her both mine if this whole thing was a trap hers if they put me in the cross hairs out there and missed and hit her instead it wasnt a night for taking chances okay you have my address you gave me your card she got up straightening the lame belt ill be there inside of fortyfive minutes depending on the traffic youll be alone of course she left me setting me up shes setting you up probably this is a trap you know that probably so dont go there dont be such a oh for christs sake shut up i know what im doing its a trap its a trap its shuddup snivelling little bloody organism scared of its own shadow one of them over there by the french windows hed been there since id first come in another one by the doors talking to a girl chatting her up good cover another one on the dance floor engrossed or seemingly engrossed until he saw my signal and said something at once to the girl and she laughed quickly so i imagine hed said if he didnt go and wring out a kidney soon thered be an accident because he was coming towards the mens room and i went back through the archway and cut across him in the corridor a small neatlooking man with glasses never look at him twice unless you noticed his eyes cold as the eyes of a reptile the kind of man i like to see when theyre meant to be keeping me as far as possible from the slab in the morgue stretched out under the shroud and stinking of formaldehyde its a trap oh for gods sake bugger off have you seen lucas he asked me no but ive seen baldwin the way i want it is like this shes leaving here in about fifteen minutes and its going to take her another thirty to reach her flat heres the address im i know the address im going over there by the bar and wait until i see her leave i want her tagged and i want you to see if she makes any kind of signal and if she does i want you to see who gets it and what he does where he goes if he normal routine he said starchy bastard as bad as ferris put on a pout when they think theyre being told how to do their job but i liked that because only the real professionals have got that degree of pride and tonight i wanted real professionals about me my good friend not yonder cassius whatever happens im going to follow her to her flat as if i didnt know any better and if you people find youve got a lot to deal with i want you to do exactly as much as you need to including deadly force if you think im endangered has c of s cleared you on this yes what have you got for me out there something with smoked glass a limo yes ill sit in the back providing as long as you dont tell nancy you know what i mean she thinks you dont sleep around thats exsh exactly what she thinks peals of restrained mirth their voices fading providing i reach her flat without any diversions i want all the cover you can give me at the moment when i get out of the car how many people are there outside her flat now four crosby mace where will you be following your limo two cars behind black honda coupe florida plates all right when you broke off to let him concentrate on the two men over there by the reception desk he turned his head an inch and got a signal from the man standing by the curtains picking at his nails theyre okay have you seen any sicilians here nine they havent seen you not to recognise where are they five outside two of those are in the car park the others are in here that one over there the one on the far side with the cummerbund those two by the bar he meant hed seen them before or theyd been seen before by one or more of the other support people here tonight seen and recognised there could be a dozen more of them a hundred theyve got a vote too got political views go to political parties eat cookies crap close in on you aim for the head splinters of bloodied bone from the site of exit in the skull youre taking a risk youre playing russian roulette again you oh for gods sake piss off when you see me getting out of the car i shall want your personal signal as to whether you think i should go into the building youre hood arent you yes seen him before north africa loman had put him into the field for tango hed impressed me knew how to drive how to subdue a man how to make no noise ask no questions i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt send him up to norfolk for training as a shadow if he lived long enough though its a fraction chancy for the troops as you know look at the one they got last night in riverside way all right i said tell someone to get my car moved within sight of her limo she thats been taken care of youre on the west side three rows from the gates and five cars along from the middle aisle shes on the same side two rows from the gates and six along the gaps counting as cars because theres a lot of movement down there now with people still leaving your drivers waiting for you there name of treader id better fade i moved round the room keeping behind people when i could watching for erica in ten minutes she came through one of the arches with a man talking intently i hadnt seen him before hood was watching him from the bar i moved again this time towards the reception area and i was outside by the time she came across the porch she was still talking to the man listening to him neither smiling nothing social and when they parted she simply turned away and he went back inside there were other people drifting across the lawns and along the pathways dinner jackets bare suntanned arms cigars the glitter of jewellery sudden laughter a drunk getting rather loud and then being hushed chauffeurs coming forward some of the men in blue serge moving into the crowd music still coming from the building through the open french windows a threequarter moon afloat in a clear sky above the turreted roof a fine night windless but close oppressive i didnt know where croder was or if in fact he was here by now he hadnt necessarily been on board the shuttle chopper id heard earlier there was another one on the pad with its rotor turning but i think it was taking off not landing croder might not be here at all though i assumed hed be somewhere in miami by now there was still a chance that erica would agree to meet him give him the whole thing that had been ferris i think doing his homework going through my debriefing on the kruger drug meeting and suggesting that croder follow me in to miami in case erica was ready to talk she was walking down to the gates another man with her now a bodyguard keeping pace from a short distance behind his head turning the whole time someone was laughing in the little group on the west side of the car park the chopper was airborne over the pad and some balloons were blowing across the peoples heads in the down draught i went through the gates not far behind erica and peeled off to the left walking five cars along and three rows down i was in a small open space now with no one near me and i saw the man signal me from the limousine i didnt see anyone looking in my direction but id seen hood over towards the aisle covering me and i felt the pressure coming off the pervasive fear that had been with me since id arrived here my shoes moncks shoes slipped a little over the brickred tiles i suppose they were new ones the chopper was passing overhead now and some of the coloured balloons were sent blowing to the ground and bouncing and flying up again in the draught from the rotors as the chopper slowed hovering and i looked up and saw the door coming open a few inches and the submachine gun poking through the gap and the dark orange flame as it began firing mazda picked up the phone and dialled yes voice i didnt know dip hes not here then give me the number rage great rage parole barracuda give me that number hes mobile here it is wrote it down on the pad christ i told the driver is this the best you can do were jammed solid he said treader ringing tone smoked windows i couldnt see much more than highlights outside glass chromium police cars with their roofs lit up sirens fading in a fire truck an ambulance rage great rage yes ferris listen i said theyve hit cambridge get in control accommodate it but jesus christ we should have seen it coming we where are you ferris asked in the limo outside the yacht club good evening brilliant smile this is erica cambridge and these are my views the bloody thing pumping out rapid fire and her white silk dress turning crimson and the bodyguard trying to reach her but going down too his body humped and jerking as the shots went in then the chopper lifting suddenly and very fast leaving the balloons blowing across the car park blue and green and red and yellow whirling in the wind above the peoples heads as some of the women screamed and went on screaming until a kind of silence came the sound of the chopper fading across the sea get in treader dragging me to the car and hustling me into the back slamming the door and getting behind the wheel and starting up and moving off someone hysterical in the crowd just here where the woman was lying the woman and the man their blood pooling in the moonlight rage fierce rage and these are my views let them stand you saw it happen i heard ferris asking yes i saw it happen get in control it was nasty but the executive in the field is reporting to his director and there is the need for control for decorum you understand there is no room here for personal feelings how did it happen youre perfectly right how indeed did it happen theyll want it for the signals board in london a chopper took off from the pad here and came across the car park and someone opened the door and used a submachine gun at a range of fifty feet in a moment where were you not that close they werent making any mistake it was a straight accurate hit we moved forward slowed again the cars were jamming at the stop sign where the yacht club drive met the main road police whistles blowing they were trying to clear the exit roads but it was difficult because a lot of people had obviously stopped their cars to see what had happened some of them standing on the roof they didnt know you were there ferris said the chopper didnt shift its no this was just for her well go to my apartment and ill show you what im talking about its actually on paper duplicated you know what im saying a whole brief do you understand the product mission completed not now all right ferris sounded a touch overcontrolled very cool his articulation precise we had come after all so very close to wrapping this one up and going home your instructions are to listen i said her phone must have been tapped they picked up her call to nassau tonight you think so shed been on the yacht and she asked me along to the club to meet stylus von brinkerhoff and said it was very important for me to meet him she also named proctor we were bugged we must have been it didnt cross your mind ferris asked carefully at the time all that crossed my mind was that she could be trying to trap me scared for my own skin it doesnt do you know it doesnt get you anywhere except on the bloody slab but the problem was that i was still scared because i was still in a red sector and we were jammed solid in a pack of cars and if one of toufexiss hit men had seen me leaving the club and going down to the car park theyd come for me and it wouldnt do any good keeping the doors locked because theyd just smash a window with the muzzle and start pumping control yes there must be a modicum of clear thinking listen i told ferris this wont wait for debriefing theres an international syndicate called the trust and von brinkerhoff is a member their objective is to buy america and sell it to the soviets i quote i gave him the other names shed told me and filled in the details she said shed got it all on paper a whole brief she called it at her apartment so if you can get permission to go and look around someone broke in there half an hour ago merde how do you know i had some people stationed there in case it was in fact some kind of trap two patrol cars arrived and they followed the police inside the building and said they were reporters the doorman told them hed been attacked and tied up fifteen minutes before they found cambridges door open with the lock smashed the place ransacked every drawer pulled out the pictures dragged off the wall to find the safe the bedding all over the floor the mattress ripped and in the end theyd found it the brief they must have because she hadnt even thought about checking for bugs on the phones in her flat or the phone in her car she wasnt intelligence she was political didnt understand things like cover had probably just dropped the brief onto the coffee table or somewhere and theyd looked right past it at first and then theyd seen it and there was nothing we could do about it now we were moving suddenly free of the jam going northeast along bayshore drive it could have been proctor i said that is our thinking his and croders he was seen landing from the yachts cutter when earlier tonight just before eleven slight jolt to the nerves they lost him they must have or ferris would be telling me where proctor was now within minutes support people are exactly that they are troops in the field and they lack the refined exhaustive training of the shadow executives even if id tagged proctor myself he would have made it difficult for me because he was on my own level competent and seasoned so proctor was off the contessa and back in the streets of the city and hed probably conducted the breakin himself because he was very good at it and hed been looking for a vital piece of product he had also cut right across the potential endphase of barracuda and put us back onto square one if he landed at i said that was about an hour after cambridge phoned me in nassau it wouldve taken him about an hour to reach land from the contessa that call must have been bugged and proctor himself could have been listening in the thought of it gave me another jolt hold on i told ferris treader how far are we to the safehouse he halfturned his head ten minutes bit more dont go any closer keep on the move but dont circle that area got it i saw him checking the outside mirrors is hood with us two cars behind on the digital clock i said to ferris she must have taken that brief without their knowing they wouldnt have given it to her there would have been several copies and they didnt know that copy was missing until she phoned me in nassau over a bugged line then proctor knew we considered that his tone still had its cutting edge id heard it before in mandarin in northlight when the mission had gone dangerously off track he wasnt of course furious with proctor tonight he was furious with himself for letting it happen furious with his own incompetence as competent people often are when a wheel comes off we also considered that it might have been stylus von brinkerhoff whod shown her a copy of the brief he was at the party tonight thats possible she said he was attracted to her i would think most men were wheres von brinkerhoff now i asked him perhaps we could turn him were watching for him to take the cutter back to the yacht monck suggests that if cambridge wanted you to meet von brinkerhoff he might be ready to back out of the project or even blow the trust weve sent someone to quay to wait for him and offer your apologies for not being in time to meet him at the yacht club and see what he says see if hes ready to take it further treader went through some lights on the yellow and checked the nearside mirror theres a corvette moving up on us he said ive been trying to lose it it he right behind no theres a buick right behind but the corvettes buzzing it there is the moment when you are sitting comfortably in a sumptuouslyappointed limousine with a telephone in your hand and a cocktail cabinet in front of you and pile carpet under your evening shoes and there is the moment when you are suddenly aware that you have become prey to a hunter not far behind you who seeks your death and aware also that you cannot hope to run fast enough to escape him and the contrast between these two moments is so violent as to numb the mind because in this instant the trappings of civilised life are stripped away to leave you in a different world a different creature crouched barefoot on rough ground with the hackles raised and the teeth bared as the terror courses like cold fire through the blood proctor was in this city again and hed come here to retrieve that brief and hed asked toufexis to make the cambridge hit for him and he knew how close the executive in the field for barracuda had come to infiltrating his operation and he knew id be at the yacht club party because hed bugged ericas phones and he had not asked toufexis to hit me too because he wanted to do it himself it had become personal my meeting with him on the day id arrived in this town had forced him out of his apartment and sent him straight to ground and hed used his connections with the mafia and got toufexis to put out a contract on me and theyd tried twice and i was still alive and was still a threat to him and it had hurt his pride and hed told toufexiss hoods to hold off tonight because he wanted this kill for himself lights swung in the mirrors but i couldnt see from this angle what treader could see i want instant replay i told him weve lost the buick i think he got scared the corvettes right behind us yes close ferris i said on the phone are you still there yes were heading north on nd avenue and crossing coral way i think proctor is right behind us i let him absorb that while i spoke to treader then i came back on the line hes in a black corvette with a florida number plate youve got that yes ill do what i can thank you have you got a second line there yes then leave this one open he said he would flashes on the rooflining quick and regular proctor was signalling for us to pull up treader wheres hood behind the corvette and theres a red mazda behind the honda whole bloody parade proctor right behind us and a toufexis hit man following hood in the mazda light traffic coming the other way the night clubs still open this town never sleeps proctor was still flashing us and it was the sensible thing to do because he didnt want to make any noise attract any attention none of us wanted the police in our way it would be very nice to tell treader to put his fist on the horn and leave it there till a patrol car picked us up officer this nasty man behind us wants to kill me so youd better do your duty so forth nothing so cosy because it would lead to a lot of awkward questions and making charges and that would stop barracuda right in its tracks and in any case theres a strict injunction in the rule book against a shadow executives calling upon any police officer its quaintly written dont you think for his assistance and yes i take your point barracuda is going to get stopped right in its tracks in any case just as soon as proctor gets into the back of this sumptuouslyappointed limousine with his heckler and koch p mm and its wilson sound suppressor and starts tickling the tit which he is very likely to do for the simple reason that he can outpace this ornate tart trap by a factor of three to one and if you think this looks like a car chase youre dead wrong its a funeral procession first shot and i slid down against the soft leather upholstery to bring my head below the rear window and saw treader doing the same thing settling back against the headrest wouldnt help him much because proctor would be using heavy armament against a car like this or he wouldnt have started firing at all though treader could get away with it if the slugs had to plough through the rear panel of the boot and then the back of the rear seat before they hit the headrest with most of their momentum gone he was just making things as easy for himself as he could never say die so forth take what cover you can get what do you want me to do he asked me and i liked that we were having a conference and if we needed advice from headquarters we had a line still open for signals you cant say you cant say my good friend that the situation was not under control slug hitting the boot and bursting its way through the seatback very close to my left arm the bastard oh the bastard hes going to put the next one straight into the spine and that means a slow death with unbearable pain or six months rehabilitation and a wheelchair put it into the head you bastard dont forget your bloody manners chipping away at the cocktail cabinet with splinters flying up from the woodwork rattling against the windscreen with not enough momentum left to smash a hole in it situation ferris hes firing on us ive ordered three cars in where are you now still going north past shenandoah park youre still on nd avenue yes then dont divert ill route them to intercept i told treader the flashing through the rear window had stopped treader wasnt going to pull up because if he did that it would finish me off and it was his job to keep me alive for as long as he could or god help him when it came to debriefing there was a bit of noise from behind us and i asked him about it and he said he thought hood was using the honda to worry the corvette ramming it obliquely to burst a tyre it looked as if proctor was alone in his car because i didnt hear any shots going off that werent putting slugs into the limousine proctor had decided how to handle the police thing the gun was making a noise and it wouldnt be long before we brought a patrol car zeroing in but he was now relying on a quick kill with enough time to get him clear he pockpock in quick succession as the next one hit the boot and then the threeply bulkhead and began nosing through the upholstery and i shifted to the right and felt the bloody thing ripping into the sleeve and saw the starburst on the windscreen as the glass frosted over very close and i crawled across the seat to the other side because hed shifted his aim six inches to the right every time feeling for me with his gun sweat on the skin and the scalp creeping because the situation was not in fact in control and there was nothing we could do and he was going to get fed up in a minute and pull out and gun up alongside and aim for treader and send this barouche into a shop window and get out of his car and walk across and kick the glass in and empty the whole chamber into the side of the head unless of course ferris could bring in his interceptors somewhere north of here and do something useful by the look of things we were doing approximately sixty mph and treader was using the traffic lights as best he could slowing enough to bring him to the next intersection still fast enough to gun up and go through on the green without losing too much speed we could pockpock and the thing glanced off the door pillar and buried the last of its momentum into the sun visor on the forward passengers side and i moved again crawling across the seat to the right little tufts of nylon padding lying around like puffs of smoke torn away from the leather treader saying ok yes quite a lot of noise suddenly from behind us and i saw headlight beams sweeping across the face of the buildings on the other side of the street and the flush of light under the roof didnt change so it must be hood in the honda some kind of trouble hes lost it treader said hood yes crumpling noise a rollover the headlights flickering across the shop windows and then going out ferris no sir hes on the other line this is tench tell him weve lost hood hes crashed will do pockpock and the door of the cocktail cabinet buckled and glass smashed inside it i got onto the floor and asked treader what made him crash did you see it couldve been the mazda behind him sideswipe or something treader couldnt see all that much because he was hunched down against the seat squab and could only use the outside mirrors and from his angle they wouldnt be showing him a lot more than the top half of proctors corvette but it was logical to assume that the mafia hit man in the mazda had got the honda out of the running because it had been a threat to proctor we were leaving the park on our right and crossing th street as the yellow turned to red but the corvette and the mazda came through without stopping and i gave it a minute another two minutes at most unless ferris could get his interceptors into the action because we were a sitting target and it was simply a matter of time listening ferris i said yes change of plan he sounded quietly impersonal my instructions are to call off my people to call they wont be intercepting youre expected to deal with the situation by whatever means stay in contact finis i told him i understood it did not in point of fact take a lot of understanding ferris was speaking from his base and croder must be there too and either hed only just found out that ferris had ordered mobile support into the area or hed given the order himself and then changed his mind the bureau gives a great deal of licence to the executives and their directors in the field but there are some rather strict guidelines and one of them is that we dont fight a running battle through the streets of any given city and place the citizenry at risk and sirens and that was precisely what we would have started doing if the interceptors had been sent in shot and then a secondary bang that sounded right underneath us and the limo gave a lurch and treader said got a tyre and we began weaving and then straightened there was a lot of noise now as the rubber wrapped itself around the rim and started heating up the sirens were fading in from behind us i suppose because of the honda thing someone had seen it roll and theyd got on the phone i said treader were not going to get any help they changed their minds i see trying to sound cool he knew the score now too stink of burning rubber coming into the car i hate that smell gets on your guts shot and the rear window frosted over as the slug came through and drilled a hole in the roof he wasnt firing wild i think it was just that the limo was lurching about quite a bit difficult target at sixty mph with the steering affected siren again and this time ahead of us a patrol car picking up the honda call from the despatcher and turning south its lights starting to colour the polished surfaces inside the limo and the siren growing louder i didnt think it would ignore a limo doing this speed with a burst tyre so i spoke to treader again listen i want you to ditch me look for an alley between the buildings or the gates of a yard or a car park bright lights now as the police car saw us and started a uturn with the siren howling anywhere with enough cover to let me run all right he said hed do what he could and i found the little chrome lever and got the righthand door unlocked and waited pulling out my handkerchief and wrapping it round my right hand waited watching the coloured lights reflecting from the inside of the windows waited holding my breath against the sickening reek of rubber sweat on the left hand the phone slippery with it waited until treader told me to get ready and i signalled ferris that i was making a run and pitched sideways against the division as the brakes came on and the tyres whimpered and we lurched once twice as he lost the front end and dragged it straight again as the burst tyre came off the rim and the metal screamed on the tarmac and i heard treaders voice in the background ditching pulled the doorlever and hit the door and went through as it swung wide and i rolled into the ukemi with the edge of my right hand making contact with the pavement and the arm and shoulder following and then the whole body curving into the roll and coming out of it with my feet to the ground and enough balance to get me running hed found an alley for me and i checked the environment as i ran because i didnt want to present a silhouette against the lights of the street at the far end it was a mess back there and i didnt know if proctor or the man in the mazda had seen me leave the car but if theyd seen me theyd follow me on foot and i wouldnt have more than a fiftyyard lead and there were high walls here and no cover that could shield me if he came close enough to use his gun the alley looked endless ahead the length of a city block with the lights of the next street making a bright niche in the shadows i didnt turn my head to look behind me because it would slow me and if i saw proctor coming there was nothing i could do hed have ample time to break his run and go into the aiming stance and make sure of the shot shadow down the slug ripping into the back of the dinner jacket and shattering the spine and leaving the nerves in catastrophic disarray the muscles of the legs cut off from the brain and the body tilting forward shadow down i was nearing the street ahead but the scene in the minds eye had brought fear with it and i had to look behind me and i saw nothing no movement anywhere in the whole length of the alley so i slowed a little as the brightness of the street came flooding against me and a car slid to a stop with its tyres squealing and a door coming open mazda monique you dont trust my driving its not that i said buckle wouldnt work you know something i bet i dropped a dime down there in the slot im always doing it she leaned towards me scent of patchouli hit it hit it like this a ripple of laughter see what i mean you can keep it buy yourself a yacht i got the buckle fixed and sat back and pulled it tight and tried to think ride around a little that would be nice she turned left again at the lights driving cleanly sitting there in her black leather skirt and tunic gold belt rings on her fingers and long gold nails tiny feet halfnaked in gold sandals poised over the pedals the curve of her body cut like a black crescent moon monique i believe it was thats right what happened i asked her to the honda i wanted to know where we stood he got him kinda shunting george proctor is a real mean man he got him kinda shunting and then i think the guy in the honda must have swung the wheel at the wrong time and he wasnt going too slow and bingo he went rolling like a barrel who was he a friend of mine he in drugs too no he was trying to look after you right didnt want proctor to get you you could say that proctors real mad at you right you cut off his supplies or what im not a dealer i said nothing like that i watched the flash of her smile reflected in the windscreen thats why nicko was going to feed you to the sharks thank you i said for trying to stop him usual way she said i dont give a shit if a dealer gets his providing of course hes not working for toufexis but the execution thing i dunno it kind of involves judgement right kind of coldblooded different from just some guy gets in the way of an ak and kerboom you british yes she still hadnt answered the question it hadnt had anything to do with judgement is this the guy nicko pushing his flashlight against my face no dont give me that shit shaking the photograph in her face i havent seen him before well jesus christ this is the face of the guy in the photograph youd better take care nicko she said dont kill too many her face hidden by the glare of the flashlight but id caught the scent of patchouli so why did you get in the car she was watching my face too in the windscreen which car this one i didnt have time i said to find a taxi with mr proctor right up your ass thats right so whats a britisher doing over here in gods country muscling in on the game its like calling you an americaner which sounds awful dont you think a british subject is actually a briton you real cool cat tossing her head back laughing the big gold earrings flashing as they swung so whats a briton doing over here messing around on our home ground she swung the wheel and gunned up through the intersection with an expertise that i found sexy i work for the foreign office in london i said and the reason why nicko intended to kill me was because proctor had asked your friend toufexis to put out a contract on me as you know maybe i do maybe i dont not smiling now we were going very carefully she and i as far as i knew she worked for toufexis and looked capable enough of making a hit if i said something wrong despite her alleged aversion to making judgements as far as she knew i was opposed to proctor and toufexis to the point where theyd put a price on my head foreign office she said whats that state department see your id and the tone was unmistakable i gave her my card looks authentic she said could even be i took it back you can flash your badge i said i wont tell toufexis what badge said it too fast watching me in the windscreen you know what i find so interesting about you first time i see you its in george proctors place visiting next thing he vanishes like a bunny with a bee in his ass then youre down there on quay and nickos going to cream you execution style which is the only way he knows next thing i see you tonight in that place talking with the highestpaid anchorwoman in the us of a like you knew each other all your lives when you shoulda been out there in the ocean feeding the sharks i dont get time to catch my breath before la cambridge is lying dead on the ground just a hundred feet from where youre standing just like you were the spotter for those guys aint actually saying anything then before i can blink youre tooling through the town in a limo with proctor drilling holes in the bodywork busy as a riveter so i find you a very interesting man she used the gear shift the heavy gold bracelet shimmering in the glow from the facia panel and we turned again eastward towards the bay i didnt say anything id had to roll twice on the sidewalk back there and the stitches must have pulled because my shirt was sticking to the wound and the right shoulder was bruised because it had taken the impact but the worst of the shock was over by now and i was beginning to feel the heady lightness that suffuses the organism when it comes to know that life is sweet and that it has not been taken away proctor had come very close to doing that and it was nice to be driving through the late night streets of this fair city with a pretty little undercover agent of the miami police department she was still watching me and i suppose it would have been rude not to answer one has to keep busy i said its this foreign bureau thing i dont get it doesnt gel with all that office huh foreign office oh sure yeah maybe intelligence i was afraid youd never catch on proctor knew toufexis and the mob knew it was practically in the papers okay she said in a minute that makes sense she turned her head to study me yeah you got the look mean hard as a nail sell your own mother and not for much she slipped a slim dark hand into the gold bag on the seat you mean this one yes a lieutenant yet just a bit of gold tin but i like the life it suits you does he deal proctor no he smokes crack thats all but hes in with toufexis like you said we go to your place or mine yours okay fix you some protein you gotta be feeling hungry after a ride like that i been there i suppose she meant the corvette thing i can imagine i said see i moved in on proctor to find out what he was doing i knew he was in with toufexis and toufexis is your assignment absolutely pull him in i pull in the most powerful branch of the mob in florida that dont get me captain nothing can proctor he doesnt deal no but tell you this hes into something bigger than that political and very sophisticated like when i move in on him i have to move la cambridge out and shes she was really quite attractive so what happened you going to tell me nicko got a sign from heaven to spare you out there in that boat or what shed done a lot of interrogation in her time been taught how to drop a subject for a while and then snap back to it catch you by surprise they werent professionals i said you bet your sweet ass they were professionals man they i mean they werent trained in close combat oh come on you mean you had a teeny weeny xm assault rifle tucked in your sock and they never frisked you i never carry a gun she stopped at the lights hand on the gear shift her head turned to look at me you never carry a gun but there were four of those guys out there with look i said this is very embarrassing i had some luck and thats it watching me a shimmer of dark eyes between smoky lashes youre really annoyed arent you yes a soft explosion of laughter as the lights changed and she hit the gear shift and took the mazda away you real real cool cat very annoyed cool cat so why didnt you just flash your badge and call the police and get me put into protective custody huh well see its this way i thought you were a rival dealer horning in on his operation or maybe youd stashed away a little bit of toufexiss merchandise when someone wasnt looking and normally i dont give a shit if one of those mothers gets in the way of a spray gun it lightens the load for us and it saves all that bullshit in the courts when we work our ass off for months on end and bring a bunch of those suckers into the court and see some bleedingheart jury give them an acquittal on all counts and send them whistling on their way happens all the time but like i say the execution thing gets under my skin a little i mean i like to sleep nights so i put in my bit for you and tried to cool nicko off but that was all i could do because you know what i flash my badge and hed have shipped me out there with you on that boat you better believe me and if he hadnt done that id have blown my cover and ive been working more than six months getting closer and closer to toufexis and i wouldve thrown the whole thing out the window for the sake of one little waterfront dealer which like i say is what i thought you were didnt know you were a real live dude in the british foreign bureau sure office right but then gee big deal you didnt need my help anyway all the same i said it was civil of you hey any time white flash of her smile in the windscreen she turned again and headed south and started slowing along a street full of waterfront apartment houses that was a mafia hit she asked me cambridge i dont know oh thats a shame we ran into an alley behind the houses and hit two speed bumps and she swung the mazda alongside a brokendown fence and switched off the engine i was kind of hoping youd be able to tell me about that you seemed to know her pretty well the way you were talking to her at the party see narcotics are okay but she was a big time gal and that was a big time hit and if i could get a handle on that operation i might take it straight to the fbi and who knows they could offer me a job with them change of pace little more prestige you know she locked the car and we went across a concrete yard and into the rear of the nearest house and took the lift to the fourth floor a broken strand of one of the cables twanging through the pulleys at the third door along a dimlit passage she got out her keys and opened up and went inside and i followed you want some eggs that would be nice make yourself at home bathrooms through there you want to clean up boy you got legs you know that im sorry throwing her gold bag on to a chair checking her hair in a mirror i saw you get out of that limo so fast i thought you were going to mash your head all over the sidewalk then you were up and running and i figured you were going to keep on flat out right to the end of that alleyway and i had to burn rubber through a red light and get the whole of that block behind me and make another turn and get my ass all the way down to where you were in time to catch you is what i mean i only just made it you got legs turning away from the mirror and facing me with her hands on her hips in her black leather skirt with her moist skin glowing in the light and her eyes halfhidden in her long dark lashes im real glad i made it you know i dont have a man now proctors taken off you go for black gals oh for christs sake lieutenant i said weve got business to do a flash of laughter and just dig that accent lefftenant wow you want them boiled fried benedict sunny side up over easy two three four whatever youre having i said and went into the bathroom and when i came back shed started frying them the top half of her body visible above the counter dividing the big cathedralceilinged room from the kitchen like a drink im fine as i am take a look around thats my own art work on the walls she meant the photographs rows of them black and white and most of them taken by flash lt lacroix with incidentnumber lt lacroix with incidentnumber the positions mostly the same a man stooping or leaning face to the wall or prone on the floor a cop frisking him or putting the handcuffs on or keeping a locked armhold or pushing him into a squad car lt lacroix looking on got up in short pants and a tank top or jeans and a tee shirt or a torn leather jacket the same expression on her face in every shot very alert her eyes wide and missing nothing giving me the impression that if the cop fumbled with the handcuffs or lost the arm hold or let the man slip away from the car shed be there with a force of her own because she hadnt spent the amount of time she had in nailing these people just to see them evade arrest kinda toast she asked me rye whole wheat french whatever youre having so what would you do if one of these people tried to get away monique i do what it takes ive been up three times this year on a police brutality rap you beat that thing is theyre all in the slammer and i guess thats the name of the game how tall are you five two hundred and ten pounds call me a fucking midget but listen the bottom line is just how hard you kick them in the nuts because it really gets their attention we sat at a black lacquered table under one of those hanging mirrored globes with its reflections floating across the walls and the black net curtains as she flashed me a smile and passed me the ketchup and said in her light husky voice see i dont personally give a shit if people decide to go to hell in their own handcart by smoking crack or shooting snow they dont wanna live and they know how to die its their business i just find its a good game to play its fast and its risky and i go into these houses and make a purchase and flash my badge and bring the rest of the guys in from the cars scare the shit out of everybody and maybe sometimes shake a guy down for a couple of grand i like nice things look at this room i like a nice watch and nice shoes you know and who do i steal from the public shit i steal from the dealers see im not like those fancy congressmen charge the public for their plane trips and women and cruises and all that stuff theyre the real crooks but of course for them its legal they okay the eggs said yes thing is it triggers so much crime and theres not much we can do to keep it down the numbers are just too big in this town theres maybe a thousand armed robberies and auto thefts and breakins every day and a big percentage of those are drugrelated those poor slobs sucking on the devils dick and having to net a hundred grand or two hundred grand to support the habit thats where the public pays so i do my thing and like i say its fast and risky but theres no way there is no way we can stop the biggest growth industry in miami the stuff just comes dropping out of the sky in bales and canvas bags from the lowflying planes while the power boats are out there picking them up same time as the bodypackers in from columbia are dying in the hotel rooms found one of them today with a pound of cocaine in his stomach stashed away in eightytwo condoms had to give him emergency surgery because see those things can burst and the coke paralyses the colon and this poor son of a bitch had been out and bought himself an enema and two packets of prunes and a box of exlax didnt do him any good see near dying when we got to him went to jesus two hours later in the postoperative room things going on like that all over this town the stuff comes in every way there is planes and boats and pickup trucks and peoples stomachs you like some more coffee said yes anyway toufexis is my assignment i mean my personal assignment they wouldnt put just one little lieutenant to work on the head of the miami mafia weve got a whole special unit on his ass but thats why i moved in on george proctor see what caught your interest i saw him with toufexis himself talking in the lobby of the gold hibiscus shaking hands and everything like real good friends i took it from there had to get cambridge off the stage but he liked the cut of my whoops or something and it only took a few days then i began working on him you know i mean once id copied the key of the apartment and he wasnt there diaries phonenumbers the regular routine and one time i followed him to a place he often went to and the next day i got myself invited inside flashed my badge nice and polite where was that house on west riverside way you know the place no i said and put my coffee down but tell me about it finis and the last time he went there was two days ago but its a dead end because i cant go in there myself a second time without an official backup and like i say that place sure is no crack house she was sitting on a black leather bean bag one arm held straight out and resting on her knee her hand hanging the gold nails glinting sometimes as the light from the mirrorlamp floated across them how many of the rooms did you see maybe three or four the big hall with the staircase and a couple of rooms either side and a small kind of den see you cant have just one cop go into a house and take the whole place apart this was just a dropby kind of thing like i explained to them they could have asked for a warrant if id tried muscling them you okay there on the floor said yes the way it was see they should have told me to keep my ass in the street a great big house like that and the guys got up in pinstripe duds and everything and it got me thinking a little bit why they were so ready to show me around but maybe i was just oversuspicious because proctor went there you didnt see a japanese no just these three guys two of them american and one with a french accent he was on the phone to someone i took it to the point see where i could back out and leave there with my nose clean said my despatcher had obviously sent me to the wrong address i wanted them to forget the whole thing as soon as they could because i was taking a risk they could mention a cute little black cop in proctors hearing and he could ask them to describe her and binggo but anyway hes gone to ground and unless he shows up again there isnt anything more i can do but theres a couple of little things thatve got my antennae quivering see though theyre nothing to do with drugs things like him calling the soviet embassy that get your attention somewhat i said somewhat sure you being in the intelligence game but listen this is a twoway street you know i show you mine you show me yours if theres anything youve got on proctor i can take to the fbi i want it i got off the cushion and walked about rolling the right shoulder to ease the stiffness i cant promise anything shit a bright frozen smile i can ask my superiors to give you anything theyre able to that might be nothing at all hes into something that big proctor something rather sensitive the way you understate things she said it sounds like an international spectacular i didnt say that its the things you dont say richard that i listen to the most the slim hand hanging from the wrist was moving a little circling restless you cant show me yours gee why should i flash mine around try this i said but the telephone on the black lacquered cabinet began ringing and she went over there yeah a half hour back she lifted her free hand towards the ceiling very slowly and as it reached as high as it would go she spread her fingers out and the gold nails looked like fruit glowing on a tree then get him she said i dont give a shit go get him bring him in her hand was turning slowly the gold vanishing and reappearing from behind her fingers as the floating lights passed over them her bare arm stretched like this looked like a slim dark vine the muscle lit and shadowed okay maloney can you hear me all right okay i dont give a shit hes connected to washington go get that motherfucker and bring him in and i mean right now or ill have your badge first thing in the morning now move your fucking ass man those are my fucking orders she dropped the phone and brought her other hand down slowly watching it turning it into a black and gold fan spreading it across the shadows youre beautiful i said i know im into dance nights off those guys she said they think just because some dude got a pass into the state capitol they cant arrest him you give me enough on a guy and ill go and arrest him inside the state capitol try what ill give you as much as i can told her throwing in details that proctor was persona grata on board the motoryacht contessa and was involved in senator mathieson judds campaign for the presidency that there was yes a soviet connection and proctor had already been reported as having telephoned their embassy thats as far as i can go monique its practically all i know about his operation except that it has got international dimensions now that proctors gone to ground you should use the time to get as close as you can to the cambridge hit and work from there she dropped onto the floor facing me in the lotus position her thigh muscles carved out of ebony wrists across her knees and both hands hanging with the fingers wide making a black and gold screen youre taking a risk she said not really i go blabbermouthing that to the fbi trying to look good trying to get in there that wouldnt be very intelligent would it at this stage the fbi are going to be working on the cambridge hit in any case and i shouldnt think itll take them terribly long to find the helicopter and start from there tell them if you like that it could be a mafia hit its only my supposition she watched me from the shadows of her lashes not too many people outside the mafia go and make a hit like that takes money and its very exposed shows how cool they are giving us guys the finger part of toufexiss personality hes like that always keeps just out of reach so thats all you got to show me its dynamite and you know that because of the judd connection and the soviet jeeze she said in a minute you seen the fbi badge no its real pretty looking down frowning a little okay show you mine i knew he was calling the soviet embassy because once when we got in from the black flamingo club there was a message on his machine and i was near enough to watch the numbers he touched on his phone next day i checked them out and it was the embassy he was on coke at that time sure he was riding right along or he would have waited until he was alone before he made that call he was still slipping getting cocky in the coke fumes some of the mafia braggadocio rubbing off on him perhaps itd give me a chance take him when he was high if i could do it before he or the mob had another go and brought it off what did he say on the phone i asked her nothing too much no names or anything he was just making a rendezvous did you surveille it the timing was wrong i was on duty you didnt sent someone else to cover it send someone else and im giving the whole deal away you dont watch your ass in this service you get kicked that was the only time you heard him phoning the soviet embassy right but there were other things she told me shed followed proctor once to quay and saw him board the cutter nothing new and told me hed been going with a girl named harvester before cambridge had moved in nothing new and then she began talking about the canisters he used to bring them back from the newsbreak studios couple of times a week and a guy came for them and returned them later he do you know what was in them sure i checked a couple for drugs but they were just video tapes it could be the guy that came for them took them to riverside way because i saw one of them there that time i checked the place out it seemed did you put them into a vcr i couldnt do that they were sealed besides which i was looking for a big stash of merchandise and tapes didnt turn me on too much anyway they were just commercials how did you know theyd got labels honidu syn whats that uh skin cream syncrest thats an earphone unit pizzarita thats a chain of chic pizza stops discreet thats pads for gals go on i said whats so big i was deadpan but it must be showing in my eyes it might be nothing i said i didnt think so okay there was orange sunset yummies and tuxedo junction thats a soft drink and a junk bar and a cologne for men theyre all i can remember theyre all you saw you got it in a moment i asked her where is proctor now last time i saw him he was climbing up your ass in a corvette if you know where he is i said carefully and dont want to tell me i could understand that but if you know and choose to tell me i could give you much more i aint lying she didnt put on any false resentment i thought it was probably true is there any way i asked her you could go into the house again the one on riverside not without a warrant and you cant get one i dont have no reason there is no way then that you could get hold of one of those canisters no way theyre private property it was nearly three oclock when i looked at my watch when are you back on duty varies on undercover maybe eight maybe nine report in can i use the phone go ahead i went across the room and dialled yes dip hang on tenchs voice in a moment yes just reporting in i said where are you oh not long any kind of answer will do as long as it doesnt make sense means someone is listening then theyve got to take it from there asking suitable questions until they make a hit you need support no medical attention no congratulations the last time wed talked over the phone id been in the limousine waiting to ditch you need transport no a rendezvous yes silence for a bit it will have to be in the open i didnt like that but id been expecting it id become a security risk it happens a lot of the time when the shadow executive becomes so exposed and so vulnerable that the whole of the field becomes a permanent red sector he is then a danger to his director and must keep his distance from every base and safehouse because he could be followed there he becomes a pariah dog unwelcome at any door and therefore without shelter ferris would have a bolthole for me but it wouldnt be an established safehouse because i could contaminate it all right i told him he couldnt say where are you so he said how far are you from where you ditched more explicit five miles no more no three roughly give me a minute getting a map she hadnt moved her reflection was in the black lacquered cabinet with the gold inlay stylised peacocks she was watching me she would realise i was shielding the content of my talk with ferris but i couldnt do anything about that at worst it was discourteous we had established trust youre without transport yes youll rdv on foot thats right then ill be at sw st avenue and sw llth street by the school in ten minutes no more yes thirty no forty yes right look for two vehicles a dark blue saab and a black chevrolet blazer van both fairly new i shall be in the blazer and you will therefore rdv with that youll take it over questions no forty minutes then at yes i went back across the room she was still in the lotus position her hands spread like fans a beam of light floating across one of her eyes brightening its translucent orb like a jewel before it moved away will you dance more i asked her as time goes by and finally turn in your badge think i should yes look she said and unfurled her legs and rose with the grace of a swimmer surfacing this is the body my spirit chose but my spirit is feisty and assertive and i hate men because theyve always called the shots most men sure not all of them so it gives me a kick see to order them face down on the floor and then have them hustled into the van and sent to the slammer and it gives me a kick because theyre dangerous and ive got to be good to beat them at the game we play so maybe ill dance more as time goes by but for now im the happiest little gal alive kicking the shit outa those motherfuckers you going yes you dont want to jump in the jacuzzi with me of course i do but you gotta go thats right some other time get you a taxi ill find one couple of minutes from here she said right in front of the hotel just go left on the sidewalk turning to face me at the door with a quick swing of her hips that went through me like a wave i dont know what it is about you it aint the looks i prefer blacks i guess its the brand of pheromones you send out im in most nights after twelve call me id asked for forty minutes to give me time to get to the rendezvous absolutely certain i was alone the taxi dropped me off at sw llth terrace and sw rd crescent and i walked from there covering two blocks and using doorways and doubletracking making certain making absolutely certain since ive been with the bureau only three executives have inadvertently blown their directors in the field and the one who survived his mission was fired the day after debriefing the saab and the van were already there and i gave it another five minutes scanning the whole of the environment until i was sure then i walked across the street to the van and got in ferris was alone sitting at the wheel with his long body slightly hunched held in on itself and his hands folded on his lap i hadnt ever seen him like this before and i suppose i should have been warned i began debriefing but he stopped me almost right away and got it over said id been withdrawn from the mission window there are some new clothes for you ferris said in the back i thought a van would be easier to change in than a car the night was quiet this wasnt one of the main streets that casino and nightclub traffic used there was only one light that i could see in a window apart from the street lamps the only other vehicle in sight was the dark blue saab waiting to take ferris away when wed finished the debriefing the programme is he said still hunched at the wheel with his eyes on the street to fly you by private jet to nassau and put you on a plane for london youll be smuggled purdom can do nothing first time id spoken since hed told me the news i think it sounded fairly normal my tone bit of an effort though as you can well believe my good friend youll be smuggled through to the london plane with great care for one thing we dont want you seen and shot at before you can get out of the field and for another thing croder wants the opposition to believe youre still in operation in the hope that proctor will waste his time trying to find you and purdom can proceed under the cover of your assumed continuing presence and that is exactly the way that bastard croder talks assumed continuing presence nibbling the words over in his small rats teeth and then spitting them out youll be at the airport here ferris said at hours outside the private departure lounge ill get into the van and tell you where to go there is nothing purdom can do if i go the mission goes you know that i realised id got my hands tucked under my folded arms that i was feeling cold on this sultry miami night i suppose that was why ferris sat hunched over the wheel hed directed me in five missions major ones and we understood each other worked well with each other had mutual respect and trust its not always like that take bloody loman for instance but hed got more to deal with than losing an executive he could rely on hed told me that if i got fired from barracuda hed go back to londontoo i wouldnt keep him to that it had been a gesture on his part bit of civility but it wouldnt make any difference if he stayed on here hed be stuck with a new executive who couldnt make a move it doesnt always happen but it was true now i was indispensable to the mission weve got to get proctor i said and weve got to put him under a hood and sweat the whole thing out of him hes the major objective in fact the only objective now that weve lost the cambridge brief and the only way we can get proctor is to let me go on running till i get in his way and draw his fire expose him pull him into a trap stop me running and barracudas dead it didnt hold water but i thought id at least try i wasnt sure ferris would trouble to answer but if he just sat there and let the silence go on itd leave me looking stupid and he wouldnt do that it would work he said yes if proctor were the only danger but the preeminent mafia family in this town is actively searching for you and theyve got your photograph they total by the way ninetyfour members so if you go on moving in the streets its going to lead to another situation like the one we saw tonight and that is what brought croder to his final decision he sat back at last and turned his head and watched me with his expressionless amber eyes youve become a danger to yourself to the mission and to the overseas bureau network on this coast whose main task is to assist the americans by monitoring british and european underground activity you are therefore a danger to our hosts and that is also why croder has come down on you its not londons policy i hope youll admit to run a mission to the point of open street battles inevitably involving the police which is why croder had second thoughts on sending in interceptors tonight he waited for me to say something i could think of nothing to say in my opinion hes justified in withdrawing you and sending you home at least youll have survived the mission the light up there the light in the small high window went out id been watching it and the thought had been in my mind that as long as it stayed there as long as it didnt go out i would somehow manage to stay with barracuda so you will understand the state of my mind my good friend as i sat there with my director in the field in the small black chevrolet van lost in the vastness of the nightquiet streets i had descended to rabid superstition the silence was drawing out so i asked him what happened to hood hes in hospital with concussion nothing major treader the police booked him for speeding he told them he thought he was being chased by a drug gangster who took him for someone else hell be all right im sorry i said in a moment for purdom ill tell him that tell him i wish i could have left him with at least a direction to take ive done nothing you know since i came here except stay alive so i can quite see croders point of view got that over it hadnt been easy but had to be done for the sake of the records the shadow executive is the most important member of a mission and his personal views are sought at critical times what i had just said would go down as the executive has evaluated the decision made by the chief of signals and fully understands its necessity from the chief of signals himself i expected no comparable manners he could have sent for me and personally explained the situation but had simply told ferris instead to order me out of the field but then croder was a worried man and i didnt envy him in the normal way he doesnt lack common courtesy in a moment ferris said quietly final debriefing what yes i thought for a minute to get it straight it doesnt amount to much theres a policewoman on undercover work in the narcotics division name of monique lacroix a lieutenant she took up with proctor in the hope that he might lead her closer to toufexis the mafia chief she confirms that he telephoned the soviet embassy in washington at least once she would be helpful to you in finding proctor and you should consider letting her have any information on his connection with the trust shed like to get into the fbi all right do we need a recorder no all ive got for you is this proctor brought canisters of video tapes back to the apartment from the newsbreak studios and someone called for them and brought them back later lt lacroix said they contained video tapes of commercial ads youd better note these he got the mini sanyo out of his pocket and pressed for record syncrest honidu i spelt that one for him discreet pizzaria no pizzarita wait a minute i had to recall her voice light and husky as a context for the mnemonics orange sunset tuxedo junction the light in the window went on again and the nerves leapt for an instant as hope came touched off by superstition its remarkable it is quite remarkable how sensitive the web is where we sit enmeshed with our environment someone up there had pressed a switch and activated the nervous system of a man down here in the street hidden inside this little black van the superstition itself of course rated no more than a cheap laugh the stranger up there behind the high window hadnt intended to rekindle hope in this poor creatures breast hed intended simply to have another pee is that it what yes no ive missed one in a minute yummies yummies there was an odd sound coming from my throat presumably a kind of strangled laughter if theres anything that makes me fall about more than a pratfall it is bathos watching me ferris said youre in better condition than i thought he meant that as an executive just thrown out of the mission and ordered home i didnt appear to be ready to cut my throat never better i said stoutly so whats your thinking on these commercials i believe hed got it but had decided to leave the big number to me which was nice of him i said it could be a long shot but if you had those ads analysed on the screen for subliminal content at either visual or audible wave lengths or even both you might possibly come across things like vote for judd in any number of variations and if you did you could then work out the potential impact of those programmes on the american population to the nearest hundred million he let the silence go on for a bit then said quietly if youre right this would go down in your records as a major accomplishment fuck the records i didnt want a pat on the back from those superannuated old farts in the hierarchy i wanted the mission i wanted barracuda i take your point ferris said you think this has been proctors main operation no this is an educated guess i think he began using cocaine lost control and was got at by scouts working for the trust to give them access to a major television network as an outlet for their subliminal signals sorry ferris said and pressed for record again i did it for him and went on i think the soviet connection began as a developing relationship between proctor and a kgb agent in washington one of the people he would normally meet in the international intelligence watering holes such as the gold hibiscus in miami and i think his major operation is working for both the trust as an active tool wellversed in subterfuge at high levels and someone in the kremlin who needs the trust monitored without its knowledge ferris pressed for off and sat for a bit without talking i let the silence go on there was a lot more i could give him if i felt like it but theyd ask for it in london at the endoftour debriefing that reads endoftour my good friend and not endofmission you will please understand there is a difference i wouldnt say ferris said at last that youve left purdom without a direction this is very good product mostly assumptions by a highly experienced agent civil of you but the major objective for the mission is still proctor and hes still out of your reach we talked about that for a few minutes but it was a dead end and he put away his little sanyo and we compared watches and he said ill stay in miami until they send out someone to direct purdom and then you dont have to i said you can direct him better than anyone hes not quite my type ill have to brief the new man then ill get a plane he looked at all three mirrors and got out of the van and stood for a moment looking down and around him hoping to find a beetle to tread on theyre all asleep i said this time of night christs sake leave them alone he looked up at me with a faint unholy light deep in his eyes he said at the airport private lounge i watched him going along the pavement a tall reedy figure with its wispy hair catching the lamplight his head was down again looking from left to right as id seen him in las ramblas in barcelona and at tegel airport in berlin and in monkey street hong kong i do wish hed leave the poor little buggers alone the sound of that small crisp explosion sickens me when he got into the dark blue saab and it drove away i waited for a little while to let things settle in my mind and gradually the panic diminished the panic of finding myself suddenly isolated abandoned cut off from the signals board in london with nothing more important to do now than change my clothes and get a couple of hours sleep and drive to the private lounge at the airport there to be led away and smuggled out of sight the discomfited embodiment of a fall from grace then i shifted behind the wheel and started up and moved off and when i passed the tall balconied house the light in the dormer window was still burning so i stopped again and fished for a map in the glove pocket and found one and looked for chucunantah road and moved off again and turned east and then south with the thought in my mind of seeking parks you dont remember him i know but ill tell you thishe was my only chance and the opera aint over till the fat lady sings sing will this do you yes it stank of rotten eggs or something and seawater was lapping at the side as the swell moved against the harbour wall flotsam made a multicoloured scum on the surface beyond the rail its not for long kim said is that right twentyfour hours did the hurricane do all this most of it she ducked her head under the shattered boom and crouched beside me in her frayed sunbleached shorts it was almost dark here in contrast to the glare of the morning sun across the water outside the harbours becoming abandoned pretty well other storms began wrecking it and people began bringing their boats here those that were still afloat their idea is to do them up given enough time but the thing is they havent got enough money theyre allowed to leave them here they dont pay dues or anything she pulled a loose timber and shoved it into the flooded hold behind us then moved away to work at the jammed door of the cabin two of the berths were still intact and shed brought oil lamps and a keg of water shed been asleep when id telephoned the tug just before five this morning from parks place but shed said straight away that shed pick me up at the exxon station three blocks from the harbour and find me shelter id telephoned avis and told them where id left their van i would go down in signals as missing all instructions to the executive in the field will be followed except where extenuating circumstances are seen to exist as determined by administration at the time or at a later date failure to report to a rendezvous was technically a breach of contract and if i ever managed to get back to london i would face a board of enquiry i hadnt telephoned ferris from the exxon station to tell him i was going to ground because that would have put him in an invidious position technically he would have been expected to inform croder but he wouldnt have done that he would simply have accepted the fact that his executive had become a rogue agent and reported to croder only that i had missed the rendezvous he would first of course have done everything he could to persuade me to change my mind and follow instructions but there would have been no point in letting him go through an exercise in predetermined futility and if id told him what i planned to do he would have tried everything to stop me soon after hours today the executive in the field for barracuda would be posted on the signals board in london as missing soon afterwards his name would be removed from the board and replaced by purdoms in the meantime there would be a man holed up in the stinking cabin of a wrecked schooner on the florida coast awaiting the coming night with the patience of a saint and the conscience of a sinner while hour by hour the terror would grow in him until at the long days end he would surely come to know that he was mad i cant borrow a boat kim said when she came over to me again itd involve other people and we dont want that so what ill do is take the tug out to deep water and hang around and see if anyones followed me if im clear ill head back to the coast where theres not much shipping and come into the harbour here as soon as its dark she sat next to me on the splintered bunk touching her bare arms folded across her knees does that sound all right it sounds very good i offered her a couple of hundred dollars to defray expenses the diesel oil and the three diving lessons shed had to postpone but she said she often went out deepsea just to be there and the lessons were no big deal this rides on me she said and thats the only way you can get it during the heat of the day i slept woke and slept again voices came sometimes but not close this place was a graveyard and there was no seaborne traffic in the evening i opened a can of sardines and had them with a piece of bread and drank some tea from the thermos kim had left for me the bloodred remnants of the sun were paling to a grey wash and then darkening as night came down across the littered sea and i heard the straining of rowlocks not far off then the bump of timbers she came aboard quickly and on bare feet without a sound the moon in its third quarter cast an ashen light across the harbour and reflections pooled on the planks above our heads i hadnt lit the lamp there was no one she said coming beside me absolutely no one her hands smelled of oil and rope and seaweed the pale light frosted the salt along her arms being not quite certain isnt a risk id take i mean i know what you mean her breath was coming a little fast and she tried to slow it talking about the tides for a moment and the state of the sea until she finally said and had not been willing to say all right when youre ready by the brass chronometer in the cabin of the tug it was eight in the evening when we anchored over deep water a few minutes after eight though time had lost its meaning now and there was no hurry how far are we i asked her two sea miles give or take a bit thats what you said you wanted are we under their radar yes but were only a blob they dont know what vessel she is the sea was dead calm and the lights between here and the coast were motionless the moon hung among hazy stars and you would have said it was a night for magic to be made across this vast unfathomable stage a night for sorcery its reaches peopled by warlocks witches and diabolists casting their spells and conjuring phantoms from the very air i told you my good friend that by nightfall i would come to know that i was mad and here was the night and here this madmans tale here too of course the appalling urgency to turn back and gain the shore and find a telephone and offer myself to be led like a lamb to london did you eat anything she asked me yes not too much no some sardines time to go to the loo when i came back she helped me on with the wetsuit and i asked her all right what am i up against i heard her take a breath bad news first they feed by night and actively there are a lot more rods than cones in the retinae so they can see quite well in dim light the moon isnt a help though youll need it to see what youre doing i pulled the front zip and began strapping the ankles she helped me crouching at my feet her hands quick and deft the things that attract them are light noise and rapid movement i suppose thats true for most creatures its nothing special but watch out if you see garbage being thrown overboard and keep well away from it they sometimes move about in packs as you saw yesterday but ninety per cent of attacks are made by a single shark the attacks usually direct straight on without any close passes beforehand she straightened up and began helping me with the gear and the floats statistically which is really all im talking about only a third of the vie of the people attacked have reported seeing the shark its usually what we call a blind hit before you can see anything she stopped talking for a minute i suppose she was having trouble with a buckle or something thats all i need to know i said youve theyre also attracted to fish moving in a shoal if you see a shoal steer clear of it or try to swim towards it to turn it away most of the strikes are made at the extended arms and legs try to remember to swim with your flippers almost together just paddling slowly with your arms close to your sides i wish to god she said and broke off and for the rest of the time she managed to sound almost normal with her voice no more than subdued whats the best weapon ill come to that she said these things have got large olfactory sacs and their sense of smell is acute a test they made at lerners showed that a shark can detect one part of tuna juice in twentyfive million parts of seawater when they smell anything that interests them they turn upstream and home in on it so if you feel any current running and you see a shark upstream of you youre in better shape as far as your scent is concerned i know you probably wont have to use any of this but if you do run into problems its going to give you an edge she was standing in front of me now fastening the last strap of the scuba harness her eyes watching me in the light from the binnacle the green pupils iridescent darker than id seen them before more concentrated and i had the passing thought that she was looking at me for what might be the last time but if that kind of thing was in her mind she would be wrong she would of course be wrong does everything feel okay i shrugged the harness a bit higher and she took up the slack on the buckles okay now fine she turned away and got a metal cylinder from the cabin blackpainted with a fireextinguisher type lever that was all the bad news as i said this is the only good news weve got its a concentrate from the moses sole fish gives out a milky fluid but the toxicitys only potent enough if its released into the sharks mouth she buckled it to the left side of the harness at the hip dont forget youve got it for gods sake everything comfy i said yes and walked to the rail and she held the gear steady while i climbed over and turned my back to the sea and looked up at her as she offered me the unexpected miracle of a quick flashing smile and i let go and the cylinders hit the surface and spread bubbles around me like a veil of white lace as i turned over and began swimming it was huge a long shadow lying under the surface id heard someone say it was two thousand tons the size of a destroyer it looked even bigger than that its outlines etched by the play of moonlight through the water broken by a shoal of fish swarming near the twin screws aft flashing as they turned darkening and flashing their quickness mesmerising there were sounds here muffled but not distant the sound of generators and voices and music so faint sometimes that i believed that silence had come then getting louder as the current swirled and i rose through the water breaking the surface under the dark slope of the keel there was no music now it hadnt been a party on deck or anything i think it had come from radios in the crews quarters aft where id approached the target the motoryacht contessa i began work straight away and fixed the first one a foot above the surface on the starboard side the magnet was strong and made a sudden ringing sound as its field pulled it to the hull with the force of a hammer blow i hadnt been ready for that i didnt like it a fish even a big fish moving at speed and turning hitting the hull obliquely wouldnt make a sound like that i think it would have been heard inboard i think it would have been heard by people in the well of the ship i used the flippers to drive me below again so that i could take sightings i didnt feel comfortable with the lower half of my body dangling belowsurface looking down the length of the hull i could see the shoal again a swarm of two or three hundred small fish flashing silver as they turned and turned again with a speed that gave them the semblance of an illusion theyre also attracted to fish moving in a shoal if you see a shoal steer clear of it or try and swim towards it to turn it away i was all right here they were as distant as the length of the ship there was no other movement anywhere except for bubbles rising from vegetation on the sea bed the anchor chain hung in the water not far off under the bows a rope of black pearls in the filtered light of the moon in the other direction the twin screws bloomed like dark flowers their rounded petals silvered at the tips the moon was above the port beam so that one half of the hull was dark the other barely visible lit from the surface as brightly as the sea itself and merging with it i moved slowly to the other beam and spread one hand against the painted metal palm towards me and laid the next unit over it but the magnet was stronger than id thought and it was a job to pull my hand free and when i did there was still a slight hammering sound as the unit met the ships plate i would have to do better than that in the next halfhour or so i fixed four more of them using a fabric strap as a buffer to deaden the sound and then duckdived to take another sighting below and saw the shark it was half the ships length away and looked motionless a ten or twelve foot grey cylinder flattened a little horizontally it was just below the surface its profile silvered by the moon and not easy to see except for its size then it began moving at first across the beam of the ship and then turning to stand off again nearer me but not close yet it was pointed now towards the stern and did nothing for a while then the long tailfin moved suddenly and it was streaking the length of the hull and hit the centre of the shoal before the fish had time to scatter it looked like a big window being smashed with the bits of glass exploding from the centre i was about midship and needed to move aft the shark had turned and was facing towards me but at a fair distance what was left of the shoal had regrouped and was shimmering in the water near the hull again apparently unable to learn itching on the skin the nerves shaken and sweat springing not unexpected id done most of the work down here in comfort free of any concern except for the noise of the magnets jamming home but now things had changed i know you probably wont have to use any of this but if you do run into problems its going to give you an edge it was time to remember the other things shed told me and i kept my arms close to my sides and my legs together drifting closer to the hull there was so little movement of the water against my hands that i wasnt sure there was a current at all but if there was i was downstream of that bloody thing and it couldnt smell me but of course it could see me shed said they could see well enough in dim light and the moon was bright enough through the clear water to define the sharks dorsal fin even at this distance it could see me very easily youve placed six of those things now get out we need eight that man parks recommended eight six are good enough for gods sake get out while you can panic will get us nowhere i shall stay exactly where i am but it wasnt easy it was not easy my good friend to stare at that hideous twoton killing machine while it stared me back it had kept still like this just like this before it had suddenly shot forward and hit that shoal like a missile for the sake of jesus christ get out get out get out sweat crawling on the skin under the wetsuit itching making me want to move to pinch the flesh through the rubber the only way to scratch but let us be reasonable nothing much has changed when you stop and think i knew this was dangerous and i knew ferris would have tried to stop me if id told him what i meant to do and i knew that by the end of this long day i would come to realise that i was mad and that when she had given me that wonderful smile when she had mustered all the courage she had needed just to do it to give me that flashing beatific smile i knew that she hadnt thought much of my chances that she was in all likelihood looking upon this vain and ambitious madman for the last time and had managed to bring herself to offering him everything of life she could the gentle valedictum the grace of her womanhood i knew those things but somewhere along the line as they say id been lulled into thinking it was going to be cushy down here after all because they wouldnt come the sharks wouldnt seek me out wouldnt decide to make of this impudent clown a snatched meal the jaws coming open as the great body turned with the tail driving it towards the kill the jaws locking shut on impact and the flesh becoming shreds the bones out get out for christs yes im afraid i got carried away a little didnt i and if you werent quite so shitscared i wouldnt have to suffer your pusillanimous bloody whining id have a better chance to think think move very slowly paddle with your flippers arms to the sides move towards the stern towards that great grey fish with its tiny eyes keep close to the hull just underneath it part of the ship just a piece of equipment nothing alive nothing of flesh and blood the jaws coming wide open as it steady lad we came here to do this and we are going to do it the sweat crawling ignore it ignore the itching driving me crazy ignore then it moved and grew enormous as it drove past me and hit the shoal again and the fragments scattered and i held still with the breath blocked in my throat and my senses numbed held still a piece of equipment nothing alive like the little fish over there some of them crushed but slipping out of that cavernous mouth again floating to the surface awkwardlooking their blood trailing in the light of the moon door banged somewhere some kind of door the clang of metal and then the light was dappled with movement as things began drifting down touched with silver and sending out small bubbles some kind of things i didnt know what my mind was too occupied with the shark over there nosing through the water while the things went on drifting down surrounding me an applecore moving against the facemask an applecore mother of god the things that attract them are light noise and rapid movement but watch out if you see garbage being thrown overboard and keep well away from it eggshells a chicken carcass potato peelings drifting around me and i started moving forwards keeping horizontal and just below the hull but too close and the airbottles banged against the plates and i froze and waited for the shock to pass and then put my head down and went lower fanning with the flippers not looking to see where the shark was because it would mean turning and i didnt want to turn to move more than i had to it was somewhere behind me now the big grey fish but i didnt know how far away only a third of the people attacked have reported seeing the shark its usually what we call a blind hit but suddenly it was in front of me small in the distance and i hadnt seen it go by it must two two sharks now a vessel of this size i suppose would attract attention at night at feeding time the memory cells inside those tiny brains would automatically steer them towards garbage with this amount of light three four they were zeroing in from the featureless expanse of water wherever i looked and the big one behind me went past at a distance of a dozen feet as i floated just beneath the hull a part of the equipment the thing hadnt accelerated this time it knew that garbage doesnt scatter when attacked two others three others came in much faster competitively and went for the debris brushing one another making tight turns with their jaws wide taking in what they could get the metal door clanged again and more garbage mottled the surface dark at first and then catching the light as it sank and the four sharks five became excited dogfighting their way through the debris and one of them broke off and brushed against the propellers jaws open ready to attack anything any shape at all then it turned very fast and came for me headon and i held still for as long as i could and then i was looking directly into the gape of the jaws and brought the cylinder up and squeezed the lever and felt the coarse hide graze past my shoulder as the toxic fluid clouded the water like milk and the tail fin hit me and the airbottles rang against the hull sake of jesus christ get out get away things not good a degree of concussion it had been a blow to the head but i was aware of what was going on though not terribly interested blood in the water now ahead of me a blossoming of crimson perhaps one of them had gone for another becoming frenzied i didnt actually care whether gods sake get out get out yes the voice of reason moved my head down and turned with the flippers fanning clear water now in front of the mask fast as we can now yes usually call a blind hit keep a cool head so forth blood again and the whole scene flashing and swirling in the moonlight as they circled just aft of the ship the drift of milky toxin still hanging in a cloud the blood worse now a mist of crimson youve turned you shouldnt see them any more youre not going straight this was true yes i was wallowing i think not able to steer too well gods sake turn again turn and go straight using one arm paddling turning and seeing clear water ahead moving faster now feeling a little brighter thing hit me like a train and i blacked out blacked out the music the music of the spheres a blind hit that was what had happened and the organism was trying to run on its own now autonomically the eyes still open and watching for clear water the balance mechanism of the inner ear correcting adjusting but there was redness in the water and my feet were not moving the blind hit had ripped the wetsuit away at the shoulder and broken the skin the feet not moving we need to move my feet just lying in the water move them it is necessary life is necessary we are moving ahead again fanning slowly and the truth is that one of two things will happen i will continue to move to leave behind me the frenzied dance of the big grey bloodied fish or one of them will come for me again and this time use its jaws to better effect and close on my body and shake me crush me with my arms and legs obscenely sticking out from that great shape like the legs of a frog i had once seen in the mouth of a golden carp and then shall it be written finis finito on the final pages of this mans life move your feet keep moving philosophy a rush of cheap philosophy through this semiconscious mind i agree will get us nowhere the water was still clear ahead of me through the mask and i rose a little and broke the surface and let the full light of the moon strike down against my eyes the coral rock she had said would be my marker to the east and there it was a red winking eye in the night and behind me as i turned my head the lights of the motoryacht afloat on the sea quite a distance from me already id come farther than i would have thought i went down again to swim below the surface for a time the legs feeling stronger now and the head clearing six of them i had set only six of them not eight but the fish had come and thered been no choice it might be enough six let us hope so fat lady sing now fat lady sing bomb its all very well for them i havent had a woman in three weeks they think were bloody robots all day i havent seen him sir he said he was going on deck wed been here all day i asked him how long will those batteries last thirtysix hours thats their normal endurance theyd been running since midnight and it was now seven in the evening theyd been running for nineteen hours wed got until noon tomorrow so the judge asks him what makes you rob banks then and this guy says thats where the money is laughter tv show the shivering hadnt stopped i dont know if parks had noticed it felt like a fever without the temperature cold if anything the skin clammy id had a row with kim shed said youve got to sign in at a hospital for a bit shock needs treatment its as important to treat shock as if you were bleeding to death i know this ive been trained and ive seen what happens if people neglect shock it can kill the worst of it was that she probably thought i was carrying on out of bravado but that was not the case it was not my good friend the case at all i would have given a great deal to report to a hospital and flop out onto a bed with nice clean sheets and a gentle nurse to wipe my fevered brow and hold my hand a very great deal but this if you remember was the last chance id got of bringing home barracuda however thin however desperate well talk about that when we meet apostolos doesnt want anything said before then we need to keep open minds apostolos simitis the voices coming in to the recorder werent always as intelligible as that they were coming through a mass of unrelated and conflicting sounds other voices music static interference coming in on six channels from the six transmitters and parks was doing what he could to keep them separate and edit them before they went onto the tapes he was sitting like a spider in the middle of a dense array of equipment amplifiers modifiers input balancers audio monitors with signalstrength needles swinging across the dials the whole time hed started editing and recording the moment id placed each transmitter and pushed the contact under the rubber shield by the time id reached here at three this morning hed filled three sixtyminute tapes with nothing much on them in the way of voices most of the crew and passengers had been asleep you all right are you he asked me im fine hed noticed the shivering then but of course that wasnt all i must have looked like something out of a car crash when id got here shed said the blood loss wasnt critical but id need to have the dressings changed in twelve hours that thing had ripped flesh off the whole of the upper arm and left the triceps exposed im not a doctor shed said i could be up on criminal charges practising medicine on you and not even reporting it i dont think the shock was because of the wound there was the lingering horror of having been out there with the huge dark shape of the vessel blotting out most of the surface overhead while those bloody things had come at me through the open expanse of water like the angels of death more tea said yes he was looking peeky himself hadnt slept since transmission had started nineteen hours ago hadnt taken a break because id told him we mustnt miss anything mustnt miss a word dont fancy anything to eat no dont let me stop you i didnt think id ever want to eat again i was just this side of nausea slumped here in the big lopsided armchair stinking of iodine and god knew what else its normally the dogs bed parks had said but ive put him in the kitchen but you shouldnt have come here darling this is a terribly small ship i told you ill come to your cabin whenever i can that had been in french so far wed heard english french german russian and japanese coming in to the tapes there were five women on board three of them secretaries wed heard several people identified by name during conversations takao sakomoto simitis de lafoix lord joplyn abraham levinski stylus von brinkerhoff wed heard only the first names of the women except for madame st raphael he said hed cover that sort of thing at the meeting i couldnt make him budge parks was watching me and i nodded it was the third time wed heard people mention a meeting i wish theyd say when i told him thats what were after is it some kind of meeting were after anything we can get i see his tone told me he thought i was playing it close shutting him up and that was true anything at all going onto the tapes from the contessa was by its nature ultraclassified except for the private conversations and if the batteries held out long enough to give us the scheduled meeting we could be listening to material as vital as the briefing that erica cambridge had brought off the ship it could give us the whole of barracuda if we get what im hoping for i said theyll want you to come with me to london for special debriefing consider this stuff ears only for bureau one you know what i mean crikey the kettle was whistling and he said look could you stay exactly where you are i got up and went over to the stool where hed set up the makeshift canteen and the ceiling came right down at an angle and i threw a hand out behind me and broke the fall and lay on the floor listening to the constant rush of static and voices and parks got off his stool at the console and i told him to sit down again and get on with what he was doing we mustnt miss floating in front of me the canteen floating in front of me miss a word not a word got up and tried again you ought to have something to eat parks said so i found some bread and made the tea and went back to the armchair bread i asked him not just now sitting there like a leprechaun on his toadstool face pinched with fatigue eyes nickering as he monitored the signals all id offered him was some bread poor little bugger as soon as i felt a bit better id go and find some eggs or something he is to be eliminated but how can that be done toufexis is protecting him we own toufexis he will be given the task of eradicating crime throughout the united states once the new order is established hell do as we tell him interference came in and saturated the voices then cleared a little hes too dangerous now we used him to work on the tapes for the selected commercials at the studios and that was fine but then apostolos brought him aboard here and gave him too much trust in my opinion hes now privy to very sensitive information on the whole project and his behaviour is becoming a little irrational as perhaps youve noticed brink agrees with me he is to be allowed to go ashore once more and toufexis will be given instructions this is but no later than we were both crouching parks and i watching the console but static was coming in overwhelming bursts talking about proctor it sounds like it i said parks knew about him ferris had sent him in to search proctors flat for bugs the day after hed cleared out and gone to ground i wasnt surprised theyd decided to put him out of the way the last time id talked to him hed looked perilously near the brink with his psyche undermined by cocaine and subliminal indoctrination and by now he could be coming slowly apart you brought me aboard as your mistress baptiste not as your servant i would like some sleep if youll be so kind when i have otherwise eight eight in the evening at nine parks showed me how to adjust the volume and selector controls to keep the stuff channelled as it came in and went into the kitchen and made us some eggs on toast and some coffee by midnight i was feeling stronger and took over from parks while he got an hours sleep the signals flow was down to a trickle now mostly comprising private conversations and snatches of speech from the bridge i slept between two oclock and six and then went through the only tape that parks said might interest me but it wasnt anything to do with the project and there was only one reference to a meeting with no time mentioned and in that case you have my full authority to arrange the takeover if they wish to contest our offer of three and a half billion us dollars im prepared to listen to a counter offer but the bottom line must be three and a quarter billion i am calling weiner today to get his opinion ten in the morning doesnt look too good parks said i do wish people wouldnt state the obvious of course it didnt look too bloody good when wed got two hours left two hours before those bloody batteries ran out did he think i didnt know the situation those bloody things coming at me with their jaws wide open and putting the fear of christ in me and in the end whatd we got nothing nothing i could take to ferris eleven eleven oclock most of it was useless talk of corporate infrastructures and aggressive trade policies snatches of talk shows and dirty stories below deck the imbecilic beat of heavy steel and the rise and fall of the dow jones average on the financial services programmes long discussions on the advisability or otherwise of asking the vatican if it wanted limited participation in order to persuade the south american states to accept the proposed status quo without the inconvenience of rebellion nothing i could use no statement of aims no commitment to illegal acts no material on rigging the imminent elections nothing on mathieson judd nothing on the moscow connection nothing nothing nothing noon fifteen minutes later parks said the first ones starting to fade he was fiddling with a volume knob watching a dial batteries yes you cant amplify youd just amplify all the slush as well i let my eyes close shutting out the glare between the slats of the blind my arm had started throbbing and i remembered shed said id have to get the dressing changed in twelve hours shed given me some antibiotics but i hadnt swallowed them because i needed a clear head or not at all spain of course must be invited at twenty minutes past noon the next transmitter began fading and went out limpets they were becoming no more than limpets out there clinging to the hull of the motor yacht contessa where the shoals flickered silver in the underwater light and the anchor chain hung like a rope of black pearls and let me reiterate the salient points for you so that we can go over them later in more detail the key agent is of course gordon schaffer the voice of apostolos simitis we have persuaded senator judd that schaffer is the best man by far to assume the post of his premier aide at the white house it will be for schaffer to install the radionic transmitters in the oval office itself in order to bring president judd under the continuous influence of our directives parks i said stay with that dont lose that if the batteries go theres nothing all right all right it was a time for praying for what it was worth hellstrom has estimated that it will require something in the region of twelve months continuous subliminal suggestion to inculcate the main schema into the presidents subconscious and if that seems a rather long time we should bear in mind that the changes we envisage for the social environment of humankind are greater than any seen since the beginning of mans history a thin bar of light leaned from one of the shutters to the linoleum and motes of dust floated through it brightening suddenly and going out again as they passed on in a microcosmic mimicry of the constellations each star moving from light to darkness from life to death we will remember that there are certain factions within the kremlin who could not be counted upon to say the least to lend their influence to our project we have begun to suspect that the englishman proctor may be in the process of breaking our trust in him and working for those factions in the role of what may be called a double agent we have agreed to eliminate this problem at the earliest opportunity there was c pause and we were left with the rush of static and interference and i looked across at parks were starting to lose it he said get the volume up slush and all keep it up joplyn can you assure us that great britain would ally herself to our aims i can assure you that once president judd has persuaded the united states and the end of war on no option but to ally herself impossible for europe to stand on its massive dimensions of this enterprise but on the understanding we may assume not interests of military when it compromise outset if only slush a deafening tide of slush in the room as parks brought the amplifiers up to full strength and sat watching me and i lifted a hand and he cut it leave the others going i told him while they last can you start making duplicates of that one at the same time how many six no problem the last transmitter went dead soon after one oclock and parks hit a switch and all we could hear was the dog in the kitchen scratching to get out sounded heavy stuff parks said hesitantly that what you wanted i suppose i was a bit groggy and not quite able yet to realise what wed got on that tape because i just said what yes i think so look is there any way that stuff could get wiped out in here or in transit ill take good care and put it in a shielded box if thats what you mean do that yes do that handle it i said as if it were a live bomb because thats pretty well what it is half an hour later i asked him if i could use the telephone and he showed me where it was i hadnt even attempted to work out the risk but at the back of my mind i knew of course that it was appalling but it was something that had got to be done so that made it easier in a way girls the black cadillac had been there for more than fifteen minutes at the kerbside no one had got out it was a quiet street residential other cars were parked there under the lamps or in the shadows between the lamps i had got here thirty minutes ago now that i was here i could only wait i needed to see his face to know that he was here if he werent here if there were something else in the black cadillac i would get out of my car and walk down the street into certain gunfire i knew that id picked up a lincoln an hour ago from avis nothing very fast because we werent going anywhere just a car he could recognise easily if he came if proctor came i sat waiting i had telephoned him from parks flat suggesting a rendezvous he hadnt asked questions he was a professional and he knew three things one that i wasnt trying to bring him off the contessa into a trap because i couldnt hope to do that with the massive armed support he would ask toufexis to put into the field two i wouldnt suggest a rendezvous unless id got something to tell him that would interest him and interest him to the point where hed consider sparing my life three that i was ready to trust him with that same life or i wouldnt be here at all it was six minutes before the appointed time in six minutes i would know what hed decided to do and there were only two possibilities he was either sitting there in the cadillac and would walk up the street to meet me or he had let me believe hed be here and simply told toufexis that i was set up for the kill at this time and in this place if in six minutes from now i tried to drive away i would receive a fusillade before id gone fifty feet the same thing would happen if i walked up the street and proctor wasnt here the cadillac had arrived with an escort of five vehicles two of them armoured with door pillars thicker than standard and smoked windows and massive front bumpers and heavyduty tyres five minutes even if he were here and we met and talked he might not be interested in what id got to say he might disbelieve it counter it or ignore it and when he left here he would give the signal for the kill he wouldnt let a chance like this go begging four minutes there was another risk even if what i told him made sense and would normally have interested him to the point where he would decide to spare my life for his own sake he might be so far gone by now so subliminally indoctrinated or so high on cocaine that he would behave irrationally as theyd already noticed him doing on board the contessa according to the tapes i dont think there were any other risks there may have been and i could be missing them i was very tired now dangerously tired pushing my luck and you cant get clear now even if you wanted to i know that shuddup youre locked in it was the only way leave me alone the minute you get out of this car gods sake leave me alone that familiar feeling three minutes two one familiar feeling ice along the spine the hairs lifting at the nape of the neck the breath quicker and the pulse accelerating felt it so many times before never got used to it always as bad the mouth dry and the eyes ready to flinch at the crack of a twig or the creak of a door or the click of a rifle bolt thirty seconds and time slowing slowing nine oclock on the facia nine oclock and no movement anywhere no one getting out of the black cadillac well say nine hed said and i had agreed and now it was nine the appointed hour and it would be up to me how long i waited before i realised he hadnt come before i decided to get it over with and started the engine and pulled away from the kerb and drove into a burst of deadly hail finito you were a fool after all you could have gone home they had a plane for you the hail shattering the windscreen and ripping into the bodywork and into my head my face my lungs fool after all theres one born every door of the cadillac opening didnt have it didnt have to be proctor just one of toufexiss one man only one man getting out and slamming the door and looking in this direction and starting to walk proctor his hands hanging loosely by his sides i couldnt see his face but i know people by their walk and this was george proctor and i got out of the car and shut the door and started along the sidewalk picking my feet having to pick my feet up and put them down again felt like a marionette did it show felt like a marionette under slack strings step at a time one step at a time youll get there a leaf a leaf here and there underfoot the trees breaking in high green wave against the citybright sky the shadows deep enough here to conceal itll have to be good he said proctor halting in front of me what i told you to come alone you dont listen he studied me dark eyes shimmering between narrowed lids the heavy mouth pursed in a false smile you look a bit under the weather its just indigestion he didnt laugh i havent got long i went and leaned my back against the railings of the garden hibiscus in bloom red in the lamplight brought one foot up to rest on the low stone wall where to start where are we going to start you know i didnt get you here to waste your time proctor or mine so youd better listen because its true i turned my head and saw men standing beside their cars turned and looked the other way same thing a small army i just wanted to know id been right hed asked toufexis to bring a small army here turning to look at proctor you were very good once first class we did two big ones together didnt we and then you had a bit of bad luck with that bullet and it brought you out of the action and youve been getting so bloody frustrated that you finally hit the drugs and let the soviets turn you and now youre deep in all that shit theyre peddling on the contessa and that is absolutely true were you listening for what it was worth the eyes very bright not with anger or anything but worse with amusement i came here to take you home i said his eyes changed very slightly and he was lifting his head back a degree sighting me and i realised something i hadnt ever thought of he was thinking that i had lost my reason perhaps i had home he said i see watching me carefully you missed out you know you should have joined forces with me its an incredible thing theyve come up with a real master plan a call it world dictatorship he shrugged if you like but a benign dictatorship a new order with the thousand year reich i said lasted twelve years this is so very different this isnt socialism his hands began gesturing and his eyes brightened again this is one world in the making and were happy for you i said another thing you should listen to proctor is this youve been influenced by subliminal suggestion ever since those people picked on you to work the soviet connection theyve turned you into a robot stood waiting letting it sink in it had got home id seen that he knew all about subliminal suggestion hed had those commercial tapes doctored for the trust in a moment he asked me how much do you know about what about the trust the whole thing he took a long time now he didnt think i was mad any more if you know everything why do you want me to go home thats the mission always has been youre the objective youre out of your depth here he asked suddenly what makes you say theyve had me under subliminal suggestion the focus was here then we found a transmitter in your flat a bug no a transmitter putting out information it was very powerful i picked up some of the stuff when i was there that night political stuff and instructions they were for you of course not me his face was deadpan a trained face conditioned to express nothing but his eyes were changing all the time now glittering excited then deadening darkening perhaps it was the cocaine but i didnt think so id started some kind of struggle inside him what were the instructions to go to west riverside way quickly did you go there no i waited thinking there was a chance still but he said whatever happened ive become a valued member of an organisation that can give us a new world and all you can offer me is the old one if i come home they want me for debriefing dont they thats what your real mission is youre here to blow the trust that bloody woman thatchers given this one to the bureau to look after he left his eyes on me for another five seconds and then looked at his watch youre wasting my time i havent finished yes he said you have he swung his head and stared along the perspective of the street a man was standing by the nearest vehicle an armoured limousine smoke curling from a cigarette under one of the lamps ice in the blood the scalp shrinking i dont like it when theres only one last throw turning back to me he said you knew the risk have you got a capsule on you i dont need one itd be less noisy he said i brought my foot down off the little wall and leaned away from the railings wanting i suppose to be standing up straight when they did it or perhaps i was just stretching my legs felt so bloody tired theres something i meant to ask you proctor how far do you trust those people toufexiss no simitis and lord joplyn and the others his eyes were excited again why you think theyre putting you in charge of their intelligence dont you their global intelligence network it had been on one of the tapes how do you know i know everything but look work it out for yourself for christs sake thats a job theyd offer bureau one yes or croder even loman or the chief of mi or mi or the cia but a shadow a ferret in the field youre not even thinking straight he watched me without saying anything for so long that i thought the coke had phased him out in some way but his eyes were still very bright god knew what was going on inside his mind but i think id found another focus and this time it was trust it had got to be think about it proctor the minute youve done what they recruited you for theyll throw you to the dogs very quietly you cant say that id hit the nerve hed already suspected it hed seen the signs and chosen to ignore them we believe what we want to believe youre trusting those people with your life you know that i think he might have started listening at that point but the months of continual indoctrination had left him unable to think for himself he looked along the street at the man standing by the limousine and said again you knew the risk and turned away last chance proctor youd better have this i went for my pocket and then froze not thinking fast enough god knew how many guns were trained on me here get it out of my pocket this one tape recorder he hesitated his dark eyes narrowed then did as id told him push the play button last chance yes it would depend really on how much control hed still got control of himself his persona how much hed be able to understand what he was listening to he is to be eliminated lord joplyn you recognise the voice yes the lamplight pooling in the street the men watching us from their cars but how can that be done toufexis is protecting him his eyes darkening as he listened we own toufexis hell do as we tell him id asked parks to make a new tape this one putting it all together and bridging the gaps all the stuff about proctor hes too dangerous now apostolos brought him aboard here and gave him too much trust in my opinion it began just then a kind of fever in him in proctor hed suspected this already he was an experienced shadow trained to look into mirrors within mirrors and hed caught an incautious glance picked up a careless word and begun piecing things together all i was doing tonight was giving him the substance and the proof and he was shaking now swinging his head and i felt the energy coming off his thick strong body as the rage took hold hes now privy to very sensitive information on the whole project and his behaviour is becoming a little irrational as perhaps youve noticed he turned from side to side swinging like a trapped bear and i took the recorder from him as he went to the railings and took hold of them the knuckles of his big knotted hands going white as he shook the bars brink agrees with me he is to be allowed to go ashore once more and then toufexis will be given instructions shaking the railings not saying a word returning to the primitive a wounded animal i was worried that he might turn and vent his rage on me he was a big man strong and at the moment i could hardly stay on my feet lost more blood than id thought lost too much sleep call it accumulated mission fatigue it had been a hard five days since id flown out here from london let the matter rest with me von brinkerhoff and i will take full responsibility if any question arises afterwards when it was finished i put the recorder away youd better get control proctor theyre watching us i looked along the lamplit perspective of the street and saw the man by the limousine turn and reach through the window listen this is your last trip ashore and they can get those instructions any time now and that man down there is answering his phone were playing it too bloody close get in the car we stood at the corner of bayshore and nd street traffic going past long hair blowing in open cars the night still young under the bright miami moon there was a club just here with music floating out across the sidewalk well be going home i said through the bahamas take it easy round the pool for a couple of days he stood shivering head down buried in himself god knew how long it was going to take them to straighten him out but thatd be their problem in london then he said an extraordinary thing i apologise for making life so difficult for me i suppose civil of him thats all right happens in the best of families you know monck dont you in nassau yes well be looking in on him while were there for major debriefing the definitive debriefing on barracuda then id drop those tapes on the table i didnt think thered be any trouble with proctor but one mans testimony wouldnt be enough to blow an organisation that size theyd need firsthand evidence recognisable voices and thats what wed got good club i said popular didnt answer head on his chest perhaps didnt hear cabs pulling in dropping people off at the marquee some of them in fancy dress some sort of gala then a car stopped by the kerb and ferris got out and came across to us people going by a flurry of girls giggling covered in streamers pretty dresses silks and coloured plumes a bit tiddly i wouldnt wonder one of them touching my arm as she trotted past oh boy have you had a hard day last night a gust of laughter hello proctor ferris said long time no see and we got into the car the end
