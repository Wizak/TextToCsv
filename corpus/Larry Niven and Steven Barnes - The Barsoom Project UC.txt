 the barsoom project prologue like a raging mountain the terichik rose screaming from a frozen nightdark sea its manysectioned grotesquely wormlike body reared up tons of water and ice thundered into the ocean with a howl like the death of worlds the black night swirled windwhipped snow through mist that tasted of salt the tenchiks mouth gaped cavernously endless rows of serrated teeth gleamed as it shrieked its mindless wrath its breath was a cold and fetid wind the humans beneath it were warrior and wizard princess and commoner they were frail meat in the terichiks path brittle fleshly twigs tumbled in an angry storm they scrambled for safety ran back onto land away from the sea they fled past the wreckage of the shattered inuit village rows of crushed houses a great stone lodge with its roof stove in boat hulls splintered and scattered like insect husks buiwar was the first adventurer to die and he died well he was the greatest warrior among them but foolish to think that his enchanted usik the pubic bone of the sacred walrus could stand against the tenchik even faced by a beast to dwarf ten killer whales bulwar roared defiance and sprang forward his icecaked black beard flagged in the frigid air his mightily thewed arms coiled beneath the bear furs that lent him strength and courage buiwar had once been an ordinary man a systems analyst in the white mans world here where the heavens met the earth he was a great warrior a great force for good his magic his courage his strength were not enough the terichik crushed him savaged his body with fanged cilia his screams echoed in their heads long after his body had vanished into its gaping maw the humans retreated there were twelve now people of the tundras and the people from the white world beyond they ran until the sound of rifle shots split their screams two more of their number fell trapped in a withering crossfire agile and lithe beautiful eviane rolled to safety behind an abandoned boathouse even as she hit the ground she unslung the automatic rifle from her back and braced the butt against her shoulder she was a woman of flaming red hair and sparkling green eyes her mouth was generously wide quick to laughter or rage now it was flattened into a fighting grimace cold enough to freeze the stars in the sky she peered along the rifle barrel and then glanced back over her shoulder her companions were holding the tenchik at bay the sky shimmered with power enchanted flame searing away the clouds it was evianes task to break the back of the ambush to send the minions of the cabal howling back into the wastes the terichik rose to blot out the moon and stars its screams shook the earth evianes stomach boiled acid with fear now was not the moment to shirk now was the time to concentrate to bring her wit and skill to bear she sighted through the rifle scope through the driving snow a blackspeckled ridge of ice and rock leapt into relief somewhere behind it were the men who held them pinned and vulnerable to the awesome terichik her scopes crosshairs trisected a shadowed forehead eviane grinned one of the cabals minions was about to join his ancestors the painted face the glowing eyes were almost an invitation she inhaled deeply held that breath and squeezed the thgger the rifle jittered against her shoulder snow sprayed to the cabalists left he jumped in surprise before he could run she fired a second time he threw his arms around his chest his mouth gaped wide recoil pulled evianes gun barrel upward the cabalists head exploded eviane was shocked tickled in an odd way but shocked strange usually you just get the flash of red this time theyre using prosthetic makeup effects kinda gagout but wow confusion reigned on the far side of the ridge and the attack the ambush was breaking it had failed the enemy was in rout eviane came to her feet howling victory and her companions rose with her brandishing guns and spears they raced across the frozen ground the night blizzards shrieks matched their own another cabalist rose his hands raised to the air in the sign of surrender take no prisoners she laughed giddily and fired from the hip the cabalist doubled over holding his stomach he yelled something something that seemed to take great effort to say but the wind was too loud to make out the words his face was twisted with pain eviane fired again and his body straightened out as if hit under the chin with a baseball bat twisting he crumpled to the ground eviane walked to her first target moving more slowly now she stared down at the body the winds whistle was dying the flakes of ice were settling to the ground the air was warming but she shook she bent down examining the wound she had inflicted the mans forehead was gone what incredible effects as if they had a will of their own her fingers touched the dead man crawled to the ghastly hole above the still staring eyes they traced the edges the wind died sound became silence save for the whimper of wounded and the growing murmur of the other warriors who approached with lowered weapons mute the titanic shape of the terichik writhed in the sky behind them eviane stood eyes wide mouth open but silent finally as with a terrible effort she screamed and ran she threw the rifle the goddamned rifle aside and hurled herself behind an upturned stand of boats she knelt there whimpering and watched without comprehension as the terichik flickered and dissolved as the moon disappeared from the sky above her and the stars and the distant mountains all that had been heaven and horizon was now a blank white dome crisscrossed with enormous rectangles one building at a time the abandoned inuit village disappeared the lodge the smokehouse the line of boats the boathouse remained but it was too far eviane whimpered and ran and hid again this time beneath a heap of splintered wood and iron the only remaining boat over and over in an endless loop her mind screamed what is happening what is happening i dont underohgodohgod and then even the wreckage disappeared eviane knelt on a blank field of white around her her companions threw down their weapons and began to gather around the two bloodstained bodies at the edge of the dome a door opened men and women in crisp orange uniforms entered they mouthed phrases about effects breakdowns and optical difficulties as they hustled away the warriors and angakoks the princess and the commoners separated the quick from the dead eviane remained on her knees unseeing unhearing even when she was lifted up and carried gently but firmly to the exit the bodies were covered belted onto stretchers and whisked away only blurred imprints and smears of red remained on the artificial snow finally men came to pick up the rifle they handled it with infinite care as if it were a sleeping viper or a live grenade something that might awaken to wreak new and greater havoc as if it was a thing of magic in a world of technology or of technology in a world of magic chapter one the barsoom project in the beginning three words spoken uncounted billions of times the narrators voice echoed everywhere and originated nowhere it filled the vast dark cavern of gaming area a with its rolling resonant embrace alex griffin peered into the blackness phantasmal carts danced about him in elaborate patterns orange outlines in his infr red goggles the carts glided through an endless empty night invisible to each other yet they have never lost their magic never diminished in majesty ever have we looked back to the roots of our cultures the origin of our species the genesis of our planet come with us now and peer into the past of our solar system to the formation of our most distinctive neighbor a darkened dome a few hundred meters across became a urnverse the stars emerged above and below they flamed in primal glory never had the skies of earth been so fully or brightly populated blobs and streams of dark matter moved across the stars dimming them never had the stars made any noise at all but now griffins bones rattled with the reverberations of the best sound system in the western hemisphere one dim star abruptly flared brighter than all the rest it was blinding it was already dimming while shells of lesser fire expanded from the supernova at ferocious speed there were flamecolors in the shock waves griffin chuckled quietly the thirteen hundred dignitaries gathered here by cowles industries and intelcorp were in for a hell of a show his chief deputy marty bobbick had a grip on his elbow martys round face was soft with wonder and his eyes gleamed though details differ current theories agree that the solar system originated as a cold cloud of interstellar gas there were snowflakes and snowballs protocomets scattered through it and so it remained until the shock wave from a nearby supernova disturbed its equilibrium the supernova had died to nothing no not quite gone griffin found it as a tiny blinking dot then the shock waves arrived with a rolling crash that owed less to physics than to dream park magic the vast interstellar dust clouds bowed before it flattened then began to collapse and condense there were hurricane shapes at the centers the viewpoint zoomed in on one of the whorls as streamers began to separate giving it the look of a carelessly spraypainted archery target the great storm sparkled like a fireworks display the center began to glow gravity and spin became the dominant factors stars began to form the unseen narrator said but griffin found his mind blanking out the words the illusion was so overpoweringly real that his chest ached for breath a new sun blazed forth awesomely bright within its murky sheath of dust and comets in that terrible light griffin could see lumps condensing along the rings that surrounded the sun the solar system was still murky comets moved through the viewpoint like white bullets this was the big one the project toward which cowles had angled for over a decade the beginning of the largest venture in mankinds history and griffin was part of it if only as the security man who would keep these multinational billionaires from murdering each other the men and women taking their slow trips into the heart of the primordial solar system would be much more a part of it if they chose and if they didnt there would be no barsoom project and if there were no barsoom project then very soon by geological time there might be no life on earth the turgid protostellar whirl was clearing now sunlight boiled away the nearer comets leaving residues that would become asteroids boiled the atmospheres from even the closer planets the planets flashed and flamed from time to time as smaller bodies smashed into them the viewpoint moved toward one such body a glowing cratered lumpy sphere that grew clearer as its atmosphere dissipated griffin wrenched his mind out of the illusion and brushed the controls before him in the cart of the hundred and fifty cornputerdriven carts gliding through an embryonic cosmos he and marty had the only cart equipped with manual override in case of emergency he could reach another cart within moments there was no reason to expect any such emergency but he whispered to marty lets peek in on them marty noddedhe still had a deathgrip on alexs elbowand alex rattletapped instructions to the heatsensitive vidplate before him it lit it became a quad splitscreen and in each quadrant a cart appeared each cart seated ten visiting dignitaries at upperleft were intense serious visitors from the united kingdom only one a rotund woman in her fifties was smiling broadly clapping with childish glee upperright held officials from international labor union the energy people the international unions were more powerful than some nations certainly they were prime candidates for the offer that intelcorp and cowles wished to make chitchat broke off heads swiveled right mouths gaped a gargantuan gassheathed snowball roared directly at s cart a smaller cornet grazed it a tenor scream split the air as the comet flared blindingly and passed on the right they laughed and slapped each other on the backs none knowing who among them had screamed lowerleft was the panafrican coalition members who were not currently embroiled in war what a mess africa was a jungle all right a jungle of artificially drawn lines so complex that things might not sort themselves out for another century national boundaries tribal boundaries industrial boundaries and union boundaries all writhed and fluxed and left bloody tracks behind year after year for the past century project barsoom might straighten them out might give some of these political entities cause to fix them in place a reason to forget the past for the sake of the future lowerright ten young tolkien elves inhumanly tall and slender yelled and laughed and ducked a passing comet that was intelcorp the company formed by the partnership of genera electric and falling angel enterprises wiser heads within those companies understanding that massive success and massive inertia are two sides of a coin had split off some of the best young minds from the ge think tanks these maniacs were backed with a hundred eighty million dollars and linked with the creative whirlwinds behind falling angels the rogue technological nation orbiting luna the zerogravity laboratories of falling angels were responsible for the tokyoseoul expansion bridge as well as a revolution in hightensile engineering the result was one of the most effective think tanks in history they already held eight percent of the most productive patents issued in the past decade and the best was yet to come the sun had dimmed the solar system was finally settling down the cratered sphere in the foreground was drifting closer its rocks had breathed forth a new atmosphere pink in hue and not thick enough to block the topography and as the orangered sphere grew huge clean white polar caps and a lacing of long graygreen lines were suddenly apparent two cratered moons rose over the planets eastern curve there was laughter from the carts ln italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli observed a network of single and double lines crisscrossing the surface of the planet canali means channels or grooves in italian but the word was mistranslated into canals which implies intelligent design quite a show eh marty grinned in the dark a new moon i want to sign up right now get out your mark card if youve got the money theyll be passing the hat pretty quick alex continued to look at martys black silhouette we havent done any mat work for over a month have you been working the treadmill sure well not every day he sighed guiltily guess im gonna pay for that huh in about thirtysix hours marty would be in his first game it was a fat ripper special the monsters chasing him would be slow and that was as well alexs assistant had been muscular when security hired him muscular hell he had come within one point of a bronze in judo at mexicos panamerican games in by the time griffin came over from cowles seattle in marty was soft but still strong and skilled he could wipe the floor with griffin in a structured randori now martys weight was seventy pounds out of control they said these special games would rip the fat right off you and then they laughed a week of waddling after orcs and dragons doesnt make anyone thin the intelcorp cart held the reason that marty would join the fat ripper charlene dula stood seven feet zero tall even for a falling angel her uncle richard arbenz was only an inch shorter a double phd responsible for two of those lucrative patents both were possible targets for terrorists the exact origins of the feud between falling angel and opec were lost in a welter of crisscrossed accusations falling angel swore that it began in the infamous anansi incident when armed mercenaries had attacked a falling angel spacecraft the united moslem activist front were widely held responsible although they had never been brought to task the umaf had placed sole responsibility for the near disaster on a brazilian industrial concern no one believed them and the organization had long since disbanded or been absorbed piecemeal into a dozen other proarab organizations especially the renegade holy fire group there had been other problems through the yearseconomic boycotts military blockades even reports of sabotage it formed a thinly veiled pattern of hostility which had neither resolved nor escalated into open war the result was a highly effective war of nerves at the moment the battleground was the acidravaged stomach lining of one alex griffin security chief of dream park the industrial and political descendants of all involved parties were held in gaming area a of dream park griffin tapped the quad screen blinked and forty new faces appeared alex counted off texaco ibm aeroflot and the mitsubishi red star consortium mankind had come so far in some ways and in others remained up in the trees chittering and throwing rocks at each other if only the trees werent so close together if only the rocks were smaller perhaps barsoom would give mankind a second chance there would be no room on mars for the poor or ignorant human frailties would follow man to the stars but some of the simpler motivations to violence could be left in the cradle viking probes demonstrated that the martian environment was not the haven for extraterrestrial life envisioned by burroughs wells and lowell the viewpoint skimmed above tidy spindlytowered cityscapes at the junctures of the canals alex glimpsed a street crowded with eightlimbed beasts red and ebonyskinned men and tall insectile green tharks each group carefully avoiding all others then the sky darkened nearly to black cities and canals faded away the great moons shrank to lumpish dots rather mars is a barren desert without sufficient water oxygen or hope to support any but the simplest lie forms its atmosphere is far too thin to resist the fierce solar flux mars is lashed by ultraviolet radiation that would kill all but the hardiest microbes despite the dreams of the past there is no life on mars but there will be martians the carts rolled across the surface of mars the landscape stretched to a razorsharp horizon too close an endless plain of grayred rocks and sand broken here and there by the rise of a wearylooking mountain a thin lifeless wind whispered about them even with marty seated next to him alex felt so unimaginably lonely that it shocked him what was it subsonics subliminals in the light patterns whatever it was it was eerily effective mars seemed then a spinster sister awaiting the kiss of life a bridesmaid to vibrant earth looking longingly across a twohundredmillionmile gap waiting waiting ever a bridesmaid never a bride a light appeared in the sky a moving twinkling star crossing from east to west it loomed larger and brighter like some huge diamond and suddenly it blazed it was like a nearby sun when it touched the western horizon the ground shuddered the sky shivered with the flash it was as if an hbomb had detonated what stood above the horizon was not a mushroom but a rapidly expanding dome of flame the domes rim rushed at them rolled over them with a roar it passed leaving them unharmed orange magma flowed forth where the intruder had struck ljfe can come to this barren world life in a flash offire a second comet streaked across the sky and this one seemed to come straight at them filling the sky filling alexs vision alex screamed with delighted terror as the world exploded suddenly the sky was pouring with sleet and rain a billion tons of ice had vaporizeda thousand times the size of the comet fragment that exploded over central siberia on june we can bring air and water to mars no poet had ever pictured mars as female and earth as male too bad alex thought the barsoom project would get mars with child as if by the power of timelapse photography the rain fell all around them now utterly convincing if alex reached a hand into that would it get wet he did it his hand remained dry in the midst of a torrential downpour marty stifled a laugh the rains passed the small sun filtered through a thicker atmosphere seemed gentler now perspective tilted until they were staring at reddish sandy soil dust became gravel became boulders as the carts were zoomed down to a different level of existence alex found himself watching earthtailored bacteria at work the wriggling shapes became more complex rocky soil broke under their attack the rain turned fine marsdust to mud the expanding carts raced ahead of a writhing network of roots and emerged into a shrinking jungle of green plants now the carts moved through a fall of marsdust great bucketlike vehicles dropped out of the sky each of a different bizarre design puffing flame only at the moment before impact men erected the spiderwebthin skeleton of a dome then filled it in with rhomboidal panels the carts were semiindependent now they would go where their occupants pointed them though they remained out of view of each other the central computer controlled them still so that there was no chance of the invisible carts colliding with each other griffin cruised closer to the dome it seemed huge bigger than gaming a big enough for a small city an environment that could house an entire community of engineers and scientists there will be martians we will be the martians and you will be part of that process this is the fisture this is how it will begin griffin accepted a glass of wine from the hand of an eightfoot indigo thark its four arms articulated gracefully it delicately picked its way through the crowd dispensing a seemingly endless stream of wine and beverages for an instant he wondered how the ifiusion was sustained surely it was solid perhaps a human being within an external shell the upper arms controlled by waldos this was futile the magic of the dream park technicians should be accepted as magic and there were more important matters to occupy his mind a brassvoiced brit was telling half a dozen amused americans that cannelloni means pasta or dinner in italian but the word was mistranslated into noodles which implies intelligent design japanese investors chatted excitedly as they admired the phoenix fl the rocket vehicle intelcorp had bet its roll on it was a truncated cone shaped much like its little brothers the phoenix variations that had served between earth and moon for fifty years but the phoenix f wouldnt be just bigger it would be fusionpowered the kind of plasma torus that powered bussard fusion plants on earth would form the base of the beast it would leak halffused deuterium plasma to form a rocket exhaust special effects had been playing with the fl most of the model must be a hologram but part of the base had children crawling all over it no adult in the room was likely to live long enough to see the projects completion but these children might one day they would control barsoom stock and they would remember a neat trick eh the voice as a low grumble and griffin turned to see harmonys face looming above him alex said good move getting them to bring their children we gave them all a weeks free gold pass to dream park what better way to make these people take the investment seriously thadeus harmony was a bear of a man with the shoulders of the linebacker he had once been but time had sloped those shoulders and a desk job added to the thickness of the waist there was extra gray in harmonys hair now more lines in the blunt features and a bitter twist to his mouth that hadnt been there a year ago in his first year at dream park alex had dived into the work headfirst sometimes not emerging for weeks at a time harmony was the one who hauled alex kicking and screaming from his desk to ski in aspen or cast for shark in the bahamas all alex wanted was to return the favor he had not yet been able to find a way all he could do was watch a close friend turn into an old man before his eyes the sense of helplessness was numbing with a sudden clanketyrumbling sound the leviathan iv model rolled up to them and stopped the demo version of the mining rig was only twothirds the size of the actual unit but at seven feet high still impressive a flock of children rode the vehicle like dogfaces riding a sherman in world war ii the leviathan chattered about its specs alex paused a moment to listen and to watch the digging jaws and claws extend watched the tanktreads and steel sides turn translucent as the whole thing went schematic ore sample tank threeman passenger cabin minilab communications powertrain all detailed looks like a crab on rollers griffin said walking on harmony was silent the security chief waited a couple of seconds and when no comment was forthcoming ventured another comment everything seems to be going well dont you think yes everything harmony said griffin stopped a flat note of disgust had taken root in harmonys voice suddenly growing strong harmonys eyes were tight and wary and moved too quickly as if looking for something to avoid whats wrong griffin asked voice low dont bother saying nothing your nostrils twitch when you lie not a trace of a smile harmony shook his massive head i have it on the best authority that nothing is wrong the very best ahhah well i can accept that but tell me what nobody in earshot if there was something wrongand there isnt of course but if you were listing the people youd most like to watch skydive into a school of sharks who might head the list harmonys face creased in a reluctant smile ah evocatively phrased well harmony opened his mouth and shut it again never mind alex ive been told that whats done is done are you racing toward the future or are you mired in the past thats what i was asked harmony smiled politely as a flock of chattering japanese businessmen scuttled by the instant they passed his face went flat and bitter thats what they asked me thirteen hundred guests milled around a poking into this peering at that they tended to form distinct clusters the arab delegation moved toward griffin and harmony as they inspected a scale industrial complex a computerdrawn hologram that pumped and hissed right down to the last detail its miniature lights made it a jeweled crown in the light of a martian sunset alex watched harmonys face darken was it here someone in this group of men who his eye went to the tallest man in the group their leader an industrialist named kareem fekesh met his gaze fekesh was six feet of effortless elegance darkly feline in a suit that made harmonys ralph lauren look like a salvation army special fekesh inclined his head politely and turned back to his conversation anyone else if someone posed a clear security risk harmony would have spoken of it regardless of orders whose orders the group from falling angel was nearby griffin directed himself and hannony in that direction ambassador ambassador arbenz inclined his head gravely you are the security chief alex nodded alex griffin and this is thadeus harmony deputy director of operations for cowles industries he used to be my boss kicked upstairs harmonys smile was purest porcelain alex watched them shake hands it tickled him to see harmony looking up at the man arbenz said this is a great success i think to have collected so many different nations and interests at one place and one time i wonder if any other organization could have accomplished it time will tell whether the victory is real or symbolic ambassador there are greater things at stake than raw human ego nothing else costs so dearly true enough a painfully thin and awesomely tall brunette came to stand at arbenzs side have you met my niece charlene thadeus harmony alex griffin the girl smiled shyly she was pretty in that elongated spacer way alex saw her as a bit flatchested and far too thin but there was a basic sweetness and cheer to her as she said im so happy to be here its been a long eight weeks hasnt it yes and only my second time down she shook her head regretfully i built up my legs in the centrifuge and on the exercise bikes but ive still twisted both ankles she bent her legs experimentally my knee hurts i hope youll be all right for the game ive got two knees she said suddenly mischievous theres only one dream park you dont know any of the other garners where was marty i have a companion we met through compunet shes a gamer too and we partnered on some frantic vid campaigns im looking forward to playing with her here wow her eyes glowed i still cant believe im really here i know the feeling hed heard it too often alex realized that he hadnt a whole lot more to say to charlene her hand pulled at his arm these effects theyre so real how do they do it alex winked santas secret i tell you whatafter youre out of the game ill introduce you to the elves hows that fine thank you very much harmony and alex drifted away from the crowd and griffin could feel the tension reviving in his friend alex before he had a chance to say anything else alexs beeper trilled against his wrist he said the office wants me shall i tell them well talk later harmony said harmonys eyes wer haunted to hell with the beeper was halfway to alexs lips but he bit it back what was going on here but the haunted look vanished as harmony slammed the wall down duty calls alex he said sardonically he winked as if someone had pulled a string behind his eyeball alex thought it was obscene harmony turned and vanished into the crowd alex walked toward one of the side doors pressed tabs on his watch and heard the lock beep in response the door opened with a last look at marsthe past the fanciful and the future he disappeared out the side door chapter two the phantom feast gwen ryder had been told about the phantom feast but she still stopped in the doorway bewildered it might have been a library half the walls were books and most of those were tall and wide heavily illustrated diet books and cookbooks and nothing else some were quite old some quite recent there were hundreds an old book the beverly hills diet had been disassembled its pages papered one wall customers on their way out clustered around guffawing as they read the funnier passages aloud another wall was covered with fading photos of impossibly rich dessertswith a comparison chart showing how many new york marathon miles it would take to burn off the calories a doubleexposure photo of anorexic numberchested men and women staggering toward a tenstory banana split was stark and somehow disturbing it was ten minutes before ollie was scheduled to show up and well past lunch hour the phantom feast was still crowded old and young cheerful or morose singles and clusters the customers all looked somewhat alike they were stocky chubby fat or morbidly obese gwen was startled to recognize a famous middleaged actor robin bowles cheerfully scrawling autographs for a handful of supplicants she grinned not because she collected autographs but because he looked so real and so comfortable six feet tall maybe five feet in circumference the huge balding presence who had dominated so many vidscreens signed a last book and sagged back in a chair his own size no need to worry about little teeny chairs in the phantom feast mazie henderson waved from a table for four without getting up she was rolypoly an oval woman with a round florid face but at five four she wasnt big enough for her chair her companion was bigger and a few years older reluctantly gwen went over the man got to his feet it was the limit of his strength long black hair full black beard an ornate silver buckle the size of his palm mazie said gwen you know my husband avram avrams a magic user now avram smiled and pumped her hand once and sat down too hard worn out marie didnt look much better gwens broad smile had no visible malice in it she hoped well you must have enjoyed the east gate game how about we take in a few rides ive tried the everest ski slope and its marie leaned toward avram and stabbed a weary finger at gwen kill that for me dear i havent the energy gwen laid an empathetic hand on maries shoulder i but jested hallelujah maybe she could escape without a numbing barrage of anecdote it might be safe to sit after all in high school gwen had become almighty tired of maries gaming stories that had been oldstyle gaming a dozen kids or as many as could find the time would gather in somebodys living room to play a twoday game cassette interaction was limited to stiffly animated composite images crude but effective maries living room had a monitor the size of a picture window gwen had liked it enough to graduate into real gaming dream park gaming but she had never come to love the monday morning rehashes those were still as dull as somebody elses diet the waiter set a choppedsteak platter in front of avram gave marie a salad she ignored it but avram dipped his fork into it it looked good diet dressing no doubt but it was big and varied all bright greens reds and oranges with no dairy products marie seemed not to notice avrams piracy i feel like i owe you a report gwen after all you talked me into it oh no you dont have to really actually i was just waiting she started to get up her conscience was pulling her back even before maries meaty hand closed on her arm this time marie had earned the right last august gwen had met marie for the first time in twelve years marie was a mountain her new husband avram was another and he had been a gamer years back theyd worked marie in stereo and theyd talked her into playing a fat ripper special with avram marie stabbed into her salad for the first time she grimaced leaves in a fat ripper she should have unlearned that attitude marie chewed swallowed in haste and said im three pounds down a pound a day for an instant she showed some energy they ran it off me we started off with genghis khans army hot on our heels and it didnt get any better in spots avram said yeah the horde was tracking us we were more worried about them than anything we might meet eight hundred of us and thousands of enemy behind us general wisowaty said we wouldnt stand a chance if they caught up guide avram interjected guide general wisowaty would be an actor working for dream park within the game whatever he said would be true in context though it need not be the whole truth the salad looked good and gwen was tempted to order one gwen had no taste for a red vinegar dressing surely virtue had earned her an ounce of blue cheese she tapped her lunch order into the tables console marie rescued her salad from avram who pretended to sulk as he cut his salisbury into inch squares she chewed and swallowed quickly and resumed we were in strange territory nobody wants an army in his backyard general wisowaty was leery of farms but we needed food we were on short rations of course of course gwen dream park was starving us and working us but they had us thinking about food all the time i dont get it were supposed to learn how to lose weight on a fat ripper special youre supposed to notice your food if you eat automatically or for any reason that isnt nutrition you get upholstered the fat rippers teach you the difference between feeding your body and feeding your face gwen knew the lectures she liked being plump and ollie liked it and her doctor said her blood pressure and cholesterol count were inhumanly healthy she hadnt gained or lost a pound in three years the fimbulwinter game would be her first ripper but she was going in as an employee back to the east gate game did you have fun marie thought about that a smile flickered briefly fun i guess i must have i didnt get killed out i saved two other players because i saw what was coming she saved me avram said i got killed later we could see an easternlooking city in the distance towers like minarets tall and pointed and lots of them then the edge of a wall we bought food at two farms not too near the city just enough to halffill the carts where was ollie in the two years that they had been married their mutual love of gaming had made them the hottest pair of gamer actors on dream parks list ollie had graduated medical school eleven months ago and that made him even more popular doctors were needed in any game but particularly in fat rippers but their popularity also meant that they had less and less time to themselves mentally she counted off it had been eight days since the last time she and ollie had shared free time and a water bed she flushed with warmth and deliberately pulled herself back into maries game they always told it as if it had happened to them in another age theyd have been locked up as crazy it helped if youd been in the game and of course some players were better storytellers marie was not but marie was enjoying her tale the gates were rusty the hinges werent in good shape the guards were kind of sloppy but they whooped when they saw us and went running to tell everyone the buildings were big and round a little like turnips with the minarets sticking straight up from the middle the market didnt look like much when we got therejust goods in piles and people coming with wicker baskets to get what they wantedbut an hour after we arrived there were hucksters everywhere they werent happy people gwen but they sure wanted to talk they helped us with the loading just so wed have time to tell them about other places between sentences marie had managed to eat half of her salad she cast a sidewise glance at avrams steak mind if i borrow a bit of this avram said nothing his wife speared two rectangles with her fork popped them into her mouth and shoveled salad in on top calories dont count f you steal them off somebody elses plate i used to do that we bought another cart marie said around her mouthful a big one we bought several days worth of food for the troops and piled it in they didnt bargain we made out like bandits the general wanted booze and opium for the troops but there wasnt anything like that in sight when jeffrey asked one of the locals she just looked puzzled we were afraid to push and they wouldnt buy our spices a waiter brought gwens salad and a tray of crackers goodlooking stud but brisk gwen couldnt catch his eye oh well what difference did it make she was an ancient married woman now a woman caught gwens eyes she stood near the wall pudgy as the rest watching as the beverly hills diet faded into the jane fonda geriatric workout and more general merriment she stood out she wasnt laughing or even smiling she seemed lost her straggling crimson hair and large green eyes made her improbably waiflike green gwen knew she was too far away to see the womans eye color had they met gwen suppressed the urge to walk over and ask if she needed help and look at her eyes avram set up a booth and started doing tricks i got propositioned by a burly blacksmith type i took him up on it and that used up half the afternoon maries voice had the kind of winkwinknudgenudge in it that left absolutely nothing to the imagination avram didnt react at all marie must have trained him to be civilized and modern about her peccadilloes gwen wondered how and where his passive aggression emerged ollie wasnt passive at all extramarital tactophiliaflirtingwas part of their lifestyle but any man who crossed a specific line was courting murder suddenly and quite unspectacularly gwens dislike of marie crystallized time i came back jeffrey and carole and blag were missing off getting laid maybe blag and carole came back around sunset jeffrey didnt we thought wed better get back to camp where had gwen seen the redhead woman before it came to her with a jolt the dossier on the next fat ripper sure she was one of the players even in a static holo there had been something about her that stood out some potential for action some suppressed energy that impressed gwen or at least caught her attention the back of her neck itched she needed ollie his memory was better than hers what i said gwen with a start gwen realized that for the first time marie had said something which required a response there was challenge in the way mazie leaned across the table that and two words gwens memory fished out of the monologue gave her the answer you chewed garlic just in case because the villagers didnt want your spices were you already thinking vampires marie slapped the table and gwen captured her salad before it jiggled over the edge exactly and carole thought shed seen gargoyles the vampires lived on the heights in the minarets come night they started swooping down on us we broke into the buildings to fight there the doors werent even barred the people must have given up long ago avram said i got my troop into the smithy we started a fire marie said we thought it might help my blacksmith hathorthen he broke down and told us all about it the vampires owned that town the tops of buildings were theirs and stairs didnt go there theyd been there longer than anyone could remember they kept alcohol and recreational drugs out and anything else that might ruin the flavor of blood maries attention snagged on the forkful of salad she was waving in the air she put the fork in her notquiteempty bowl and pushed it away i have to tell you something permanent happened to my appetite that night i had to think of myself as food to figure out how to fight vampires garlic didnt keep them away we decided they like flavoring random flavoring that they dont like and we couldnt count on any help the locals wanted us to stay so twenty of them would live longer your order madam the voice came from behind gwen but she didnt have to turn just reach back over her shoulders and found ollies strong chubby arms and wrapped them around her neck one of his fingers unobtrusively brushed a nipple and she felt a shiver of pleasure race along her bones she leaned back for a deep kiss marie was polite enough to stop talking but not enough to look away she was staring at them when they broke for air ollie was about five nine and fifty pounds over the average that was actually a great improvement when they met you could have added another sixty pounds to that estimate ollie nodded to marie and avram he slid into the seat next to gwen still holding her hand gwen felt the tension leaving her in a wave lost in ollies warm wide smile she sighed my lord and master the goddess who dances in my heart he bent forward and kissed her again how ya doing much better now her eyes flickered sideways indicating marie who had continued to chatter as if frantic to get her story out before ollie swallowed gwens attention totally there were vampire sentries on the ground floors and no light first building we went into we were swarmed after that we rolled barrels of brandy down into the basements first the brandy then throw in torches then wood that worked we turned the minarets into chimneys but it took us till nightfall and some of the vampires escaped the fire and some of our own started coming to life gwen squeezed her husbands hand she halfwhispered boy am i glad to see you listen do you see that woman over there he scanned the room found gwens target just as the frowzy redhead sleepwalked out of the room brushing past people as if they werent really there strange duck but a recognizable breed indeed gamer shes in our files for fimbuiwinter he squeezed his eyes shut for a second name eviane he was delighted with himself and bounced with pleasure probably just her nom de guerre somehow miraculously marie had managed to finish her story she grinned and leaned back from the table i want to sleep for a week with avram she stood her lips curling salaciously avram heaved himself up as enthusiastic as a steer at the slaughterhouse door i wont see you till were back in portland right right our final briefing is in thirty minutes the fimbulwinter game starts tomorrow im the shamans lovely daughter gwen caught a flicker of disbelief in maries eye eskimos are allowed to have a little padding my dear avram laughed appreciatively and marie gave him a polite shove toward the door gwen dug into her salad ollie watched the pair until they were safety out of earshot another rousing dream park success maybe avrams too torpid but maybe he got something out of the experience maybe if they ran him through again which they cant these gamers dont nearly pay their own way its all for research love i know and maries a waste she learns what to say and thats all she gets out of it saying the magic words wont take weight off and it wont teach her better habits and its hell on those of us who have to listen my my what a wonderful wait you must have had gwens wide blue eyes were moist and grateful my hero verily you saved the maiden from the dragon her fingernails gripped the back of his hand hard claim your reward dammit he sighed weve got about twenty minutes to make it to gaming central not nearly enough time to commit a serious indiscretion nor yet a frivolous indiscretion never be late to a briefing tonight sure who needs sleep chapter three the tower of night twenty meters of tyrannosaurus rex thrashed helplessly in the tar pit its graygreen hide sprayed blood from a dozen bullet wounds it glared up at them and screamed the scream of the dying sauriana sound very like the product of a cowles mach vifi synthesizer to max sandss educated ear it blended perfectly with the thunder of the volcano erupting at the south end of the canyon it would have been the perfect end to a twohour minigame the dinosaur the tar pit the volcano the lithe and lovely cave girl who clung to his side like moist silk one problem remained unsolved professor deverouxs legs still kicked wealdy in the tyrannosaurs mouth this was of course no fun for deveroux and no fun for max and the rest of the team either deveroux still had the time key in his pocket max checked his watch there were only ten minutes left the lava crawled toward the tar pit beneath them toward the mouth of the cave where five adventurers huddled in confusion jeez orson sands wheezed were up the creek now at six feet four inches and three hundred and fifteen pounds his twin weighted twenty pounds more and looked fifty pounds heavier than max the difference was that under his cushion of fat max actually had considerable muscle which made him an anomaly in the sands clan orsons twenty extra pounds werent muscle muscle didnt run in the sands family nobody ran in the sands family which in part explained the proud and readily identifiable sands profile max said any suggestions eviane the short freckled redhead shook her head without saying anything she never said anything maybe shed checked her vocal cords at the door she was kind of cute particularly if you liked them chunky but standing or sitting she seemed to wrap herself around herself the space around her became annor max had to force himself to speak to her and why bother orson repeated his litany of grief we been screwwwwed his face was red and puffy as if he was about to roll on the ground and hold his breath for two minutes the tactic had been awesomely effective when he was a plump cute fiveyearold he had grown plumper than plump and less than cute in the past thirty years max was tired of the act the lava had reached the edge of the water covering the tar pit and a feather of steam boiled up the stench of sulfur grew chokingly strong rakes of gray ash streamed from the sky eviane watched the lava with what max couldnt help thinking was a practiced eye quiet she was but shed gamed that key theyd found the skeleton of a tyrannosaurus rex and the bones of a man within evianes stick had poked among the bones of the right hand just enough to disturb them to spring any trap then the left just enough to expose a glittering key tapped the key tapped the ground at her feet reached among the bones and plucked the key without brushing a single bone and before any other player had planned a move alura the lovely cave girl who had guided them pulled at orsons arm must go oh whats the pint orson will you shut up the point is that we came to play eviane nodded approval and said her first words in two hours this isnt right they promised darlin this whole thing hasnt been right we go alura said in her best mockpaleolithic accent we go worship pray for help orson pulled a face youve already gotten everyone else killed you tryin for a perfect score max smiled benevolently youre going to be a ball on the ripper i wish i hadnt come that makes many of us orson max checked his watch eight minutes there were four players left max and orson and eviane and kevin kevin titus was a kid and the only skinny one in the group he was really skinny painfully so in the two hours that the game had been on three of their four guides had been killed by various toothy carnivores with the exception of the late lamented professor their guides had all been young vivacious pidginenglishspeaking cave dwellers encountered on site max had chuckled quietly at the anachronism and followed the bouncing curves they cheated kevin said plaintively the kid was five feet of knees and elbows sugarcube teeth frizzy brown hair and nervous energy he was panting with exertion though even max had his breath back they said that everything made sense eviane breathed hard as if hyperventilation helped her memory they said that given the stated game situation everything is accurate so they lied the lava was getting close the mouth of the cave was growing wanner no they wouldnt lie she repeated that as if it were an article of faith dream park wouldnt lie theres an answer we go and pray gods must help alura said almost calmly have they ever helped before max asked hopefully no her shaggy blond head gave a mournful wag then she smiled ingenuously but maybe we pray wrong if dream park didnt lie then theyre idiots orson whined there werent any goddamn cave people in the cretaceous dinosaurs were dead for sixty million years before the first human being ever appeared they blew it lava swept down the valley the tyrannosaurs tiny eyes bulged as the water around it began to boil it screamed piteously when the lava hit it the scream reverberated through maxs bones and a whiff of cooking lizard hit them in a blast then the swamp was gone and the tar was exposed to the lava and it all went up in a fireball the gamers threw themselves flat the air whooshed crinkling his eyebrows with heat max glimpsed big white bones before the lava rolled them under damn this is too much too damned graphic even for dream park thank goodness i havent eaten since breakfast lava filled the valley below it percolated like a demons cauldron were screwed im telling ya i want everybodys money back eviane was looking thoughtful if her slightly crossed eyes could be interpreted as a thoughtful expression something isnt right here she said a flat certainty in her voice caught maxs attention and orsons too she may look like a flake but theres somebody home in that head orsons mood calmed in an instant whatve you got she shook her head its its a puzzle they always are when they run over fifty minutes theres a clue whats the clue orson said i havent got a clue im hungry and im tired and weve got six minutes to live think about it whats wrong with this everything waitwaitwait click you could almost hear it in some ways the brothers lived in different worlds max made his living as a very particular kind of clown orson as a computer programmer but when the puzzlesolver in orsons head suddenly clicked on max vicariously shared the thrill there was the brother he loved the fastest questioncrunching mind he had ever known youre right there arent supposed to be cave people here we found just one group all about the same age everything else was right all of the sauropods have been right for the era we saw diplodocus and brontosaurus but no stegosaurus or allosaurus mixed in kevin slapped thin hands against his head so what are the cave people doing here max caught the joke and his laughter drowned out the rumble of the volcano unless theyre time travelers too he turned to alura who had been cowering politely through the entire exchange alura take us to church lhis way behind them the sky glowed the lava was filling the valley of dinosaurs and in another few moments it was going to come roaring down the tunnel the result was likely to use up all of his hit points in one hot second so to speak they ran or at least moved as quickly as girth and wind would allow kevin a skinny little rabbit with barely enough meat to separate bones from skin reached the chamber alongside alura way ahead of the rest he was gasping she wasnt max clamped his mind down on the fatigue but when he saw the chamber exhaustion and confusion melted away like snowflakes the structure might have been carved from limestone by the passage of water or it might have been an enormous gas bubble in a mountainous sludgy wave of primeval lava whatever had carved it had done one hell of a job it was huge a crystalline cathedral with indirect lighting and where did the light come from oh give it up phosphorescence bioluminescence whatever it was gorgeous stalagmites rose from the floor like rows of fairy teeth thick spiderwebs festooned the corners strange baseballsized husks dangling from them but the room still sparkled in the center surrounded by a cone of light was what max knew they would find orson clapped his hands delightedly thats it a platform with a metal post and a waisthigh metal ring large enough for several adults to grasp simultaneously its an advanced version of deverouxs time machine another group came back with their kidslike taking a picnic stopped to feed the dinosaurs kids got stranded here grew up with no adults they were laughing and hugging now even eviane had abandoned her vow of silence and was whooping louder than anyone lets move max said checking his watch hed set it to count down it gave him ninety seconds to end the game kevin and orson examined the machine orson called it takes a key eveviane the only key still in the game eviane tossed it underhand to orson who fitted it into a lock and turned it fits it was drownin fair after all move it were about to have company say a million tons of lava kevin and orson tinkered with the vehicle fiddling with the buttons until lights triggered around the metal ring and the air vibrated until it sang max felt the tingle all over his skin and laughed and stomped delightedly they were going to make it they were all right everybody gather around and get ready the mom was heating up the hair on his arms stood up away from the skin as the time machines whir grew loud all five of them grabbed the ring felt the electric trill as the power increased the entire room began to vibrate alura released the ring with one hand to grab maxs shirt pressing her warm little body against him max was terribly glad that alura unlike the rest of her family was a real live unhologramtype person the entrance of the cave splashed with lava for a moment fear filled his stomach and a shrill whir filled his ears the room whirled and there was nothing there nothing at all when the smoke and lava cleared they were back in the clean sterile time life building the woman who called herself eviane wandered out of the time life building into the main thoroughfare it had been a long time since she had been to dream park although in another sense dream park was with her wherever she went the facades of the rides and exhibits rose like a fabulous array of circus balloons the hologram images rose thirty and forty feet into the airpolynesian paradise dragonworid fokker biplane the ali baba ride the infamous snuff show and the hallucinogenic little nemo some of the facades were pure delightful fantasy the rosy cheeks of snow white blended naturally with the alpine splendor of the ski chalet but there were also strong elements of the grotesque here was the face of a screaming south american indian with ants swarming before her eyes naked bone appeared the marabunta challenge the threat of violence made evianes head spin she stopped for a moment leaned against a railing and squeezed her eyes shut no violence no pain just fun right nobody gets hurt it was selfdefense plot smashed the cabal had been rabid for vengeance the terichik she opened her eyes and when the film of tears cleared she remembered to breathe again the pain in her chest went away maybe she shouldnt be here at all she shrugged that thought aside she had already met somebody nice not even counting charlene dula charlene had been a miracle a genuine sevenfoot elvish miracle but max sands was nice bright cheerful curiously athletic for his size and he seemed to like her maybe she should have gone with them the voice snapped back on her instantly how could anyone like you youre a murderess a crazy woman and if they find you theyll put you where the birds dont sing and the sun dont shine and sleep comes in black capsules with little white bands she swallowed hard and forced her shoulders back and the voices into retreat they grew quieter but didnt go away they never went away a little boy swiveled and pointed mommy wow look at that costume the ladys wearing she must be ten feet tall eviane turned and made herself smile charlene the hypertall woman picked her way through the crowd it was true she was grotesquely tall she might have been another exhibit jewelry at her ears and throat had a hightech look medical monitors but she carried herself with a grace and dignity that inspired respect rather than pity or shock eviane ran to her friend and hugged her charlene returned the hug for a second then gently pushed the shorter woman back for an instant eviane was overwhelmed by the variance in body type with charlene balancing on evianes shoulders they could go to a masquerade ball as an exclamation point how were the rides charlenes voice was that of a cultivated child i wish that i could have been with you uncle wanted me with him at that barsoom thing she smiled in shy apology this was supposed to be our time together ive made friends over the holo for years but its just not the same oh dont worry if it werent for you i wouldnt be here in the first place this is just the best time ever charlene hugged her friends arm i know i would have had more fun with you the fun is in getting out alive they stepped aside to let a comical car cruise past it loped along on jointed hairy legs instead of wheels the driver had headlights instead of eyes and fenders for ears charlene chuckled its usually more crowded than this isnt it hard to believe but true this wasnt ordinary dream park time the park was only halffull this was a vip week reserved for people like charlene bigwigs and their families involved in the barsoom project and people participating in the fat ripper special she closed her eyes the next thing she knew charlene was holding her eviane it looked like you blacked out for a moment there you didnt know where you were it was the crowd the noise charlene looked unconvinced right maybe im just hungry now that ill believe come on isnt it time for our briefing you bet redshirted acrobats juggled balls of fire barehanded with dazzling agility the flame formed a stairway up into the sky disappearing in a bank of mist as exotic flute music played one acrobat after another did handsprings up the stairway and vanished the walls of dream park twisted and turned around them like the walls of a mare every foot crammed with shops exhibits and concession stands the entrances to rides and experiences to the north like a great moon rising at the end of the street was the gleaming dome of gaming area b they reached the restaurant an ivory tower labeled the tower of night which rose from the middle of an arabian bazaar eviane felt a little more at ease here finally would be people that she would be comfortable with gamers magic users sorcerers keepers of the dark secrets the same breed that she washad been she got into the tube lift on the side of the tower and pressed her hands against the tube as it began to rise and rise the cage moved at impossible speed the sun was sinking behind the mountains when only minutes ago it had been midafternoon now they were above the entire arc of dream park the hundreds of acres laid out in glittering array conical towers and silvered spheres twisting rollercoaster loops and the thousand hotels and motels crowding hivelike beyond all shrinking shrinking now she could see the entire valley basin and as the elevator continued to rise the lights of los angeles stretched out like strings of glowing pearls neat the illusion was magnificent the cage was still accelerating around a black earth refracted light outlined the atmosphere in a bright circle that was still contracting eviane felt the chill of fear just enough acrophobia to make things interesting charlenes breath fogged the glass wow no acrophobia there sunlight flared along one rim of the world which had become a tremendous ball eviane wrenched her eyes away to look up a structure was coming at her a cluster of bubbles on the tower the bubbles engulfed the car the elevator stopped and the doors opened noise hit her like a solid wall the cacophony of a hundred throats rumbling at the top of their collective voices a flood of images rushed in on her colliding somewhere between her ears eviane wandered away from charlene meandering through the group she felt both at home and alienated able to float along on the periphery of the groups skimming bits of conversations without the nerve to join in ive never been here before one gamer was saying he was about five and a half feet tall black and pudgy he juggled a drink in one hand and a fourinch saucer of little sandwiches in the other he wore a quasimilitary uniform that was too tight across the belly his name tag said f hebert but from what ive seen so far the whole thing is overpriced too expensive a stout extremely pretty blonde whose name tag was stenciled trianna attacked at once she may have been overweight but her selfpossession and beautifully cut blue suit made her mass a deadly weapon there was something else tooa sense of leashed sexuality that eviane found instantly intimidating if youve never been here before what are you comparing it to triannas target was overwhelmed another amusement parks i guess do other parks really have facilities like this well she snorted in disgust the word i get it costs more than youre paying they charge it off to research and use it to make cassette games oh thats but lets just assume theyre taking a thousand percent profit then what nobody else has what theyre selling what have you got to whimper about pay or dont pay an f hebert wandered away looking deflated there was a face all skin and bones one gaunt visage across a sky of full moons kevin she remembered him from the tar pits game fat ripper they call it but were not all overweight eating disorders substance abuse that one black man was round of face but hardly overweight still he had a twitchy look she was guessing only guessing but who would he kill for a drink or a cigar eviane heard a ripple of laughter over in one of the corners of the room and pivoted in time to catch a spherical dervish completing a complex pantomime she knew that man who wouldnt it was johnny welsh one of the featured players on kodak playhouse he was acclaimed as a brilliant comedian but she remembered hearing that he had lost a lucrative television contract because the insurance company wouldnt issue a bond too much excess weight he was laughing now and redfaced she had seen him this way a hundred times the rubbery red face and hiccoughing bray were as much a trademark as the famous profile he was surrounded by a circle of admiring faces and if they wanted me to lose weight then they should have stopped serving pasta in the commissary hey if i look at one it just cries out to me he crouched down and squinted up at them rubber face suddenly absurdly reminiscent of a lonesome lasagna it says johnny were here doncha love us anymore lasagna had an italian accent music blared in the opposite corner and several couples were on the dance floor moving languorously to the latest fusion of indonesian and latin music eviane stood on the outskirts and tapped her toes to it and felt a flutter of pleasure sucha nice group of people this is going to be fun unless something goes wrong her breathing was going haywire and she craved magic magic in the form of a black pill rimmed in white theres no point to this let the past stay dead what is there to gain but i have to know i have to know there were security cameras in every corner of the room information on eating habits conversational patterns and preferential interactions were being recorded on all game participants the data was carefully filed collated and processed in a hundred different ways computer programs weighed words and patterns of words one special technician per participant annotated and corrected planned and theorized as game time drew near the information went out to nutritionists psychotherapists experts in aversiveconditioning behavioral modification neurolinguistic programmers and the computer experts coordinating the effort and it went to one other desk at that desk a man watched brooding he frowned every time the camera crossed the features of the woman who called herself eviane her stringy red hair had once been well groomed the padded body had been svelte the confused frightened eyes filled with purpose dream park accepted gaming names but demanded a real one as well this woman had written michelle rivers in her file lies within lies he held in his hand the picture of a younger more slender prettier woman a picture summoned from a file eight years old the label read michelle sturgeon there were differences but the similarities were undeniable beneath the picture of michelle sturgeon was a short psychological evaluation concocted by the dream park psych division he traced it with a finger that shook eight years before michelle sturgeon had murdered one dream park actor and severely wounded another her alter ego the persona of eviane however was an adventuress who had defended herself against evil magicians it seemed that eviane had become the dominant identity how had she gotten past dream park security the rivers name shouldnt have fooled anyone came in with charlene dula okay they wouldnt want charlene irritated they need her uncles money in barsoom so no heavy security check he couldnt convince himself no dammit you couldnt stop the griffin with politics so what happened fekesh could have changed her records the mans voice trembled but if he did why because if harmony and the griffin saw the flag hmm he was afraid theyd use her somehow so why the hell didnt fekesh tell me damn damn damn he opened a bottle of headache tablets and swallowed two of them without water why now ill never get any sleep what kind of game he caught himself forced the panic into remission the office was empty dark except for the light of the holoscreen calm down he muttered i can handle it so shes back its not a trap its an accident she doesnt know anything i can get her out he scrolled evianes chart he read slowly he wasnt used to reading charts hes got to help fekesh hes got as much to lose finally he let out a sigh all right it started in the fimbulwinter game it can end there too kill her out he punched another button and the screen went dead chapter four the psychology of engagement an aroma of freshground coffee wafted in the air alex averted his eyes from the urn as he stormed into his office the west wall blinked through the spectrum in its alert mode the hubbub beyond quieted as the door closed he circled his desk when his weighi hit the chair the screen triggered cary mcgivvon griffins new assistant appeared on line her eggshaped face was drawn with panic chiefweve got a problem weve always got problems if it isnt an emergency its a b handle it yourself its an emergency isnt it always take a deep breath and talk to me cary stopped and sucked air flicking her head to get a few strands of brown hair out of her eyes well we had a punchout delegates from panafrican and the libyan group everybody says the other guys started it chief theyre talking about walking what is psych doing mcgivvon was a terrific worker but a little on the emotional side why dump this on him he had no control or anything even close to it over the actions of those zanies vail has already channeled them into the warbots scenario terrific this is what he designed it for ill bet his black heart is tickled pink for the chance to run it alexs nose twitched at the pungent coffee aroma from the outer office he would not walk out there and get a cup nor would he ask someone to fetch one time to put a fan in here whats the situation have they agreed more or less chala and rarul should be fighting it out now but everyone else is twitchy too he saw her beginning to relax now that shed passed the problem on he turned her off he still hadnt settled back into real space time yet the sounds and sights of the shaping of mars played against the back of his eyeballs if he closed his eyes even for a moment blackness exploded into light cary appeared in the doorway he missed her mischievous expression transfixed by the steaming mug in her hands was she going to drink that in front of him could she be so cruel looked as if you needed this more than me chief he stifled a whimper of relief you are an angel of mercy ten dispensation points shoot your husband tonight and move in with me youll still go to the front of the line on judgment day thanksill save it i may need it the next time my boss disappears for three hours and turns off his pager touchй he sipped from the mug then made a face halffull remember your ulcer he growled at her and then drained the cup damn that hit the spot it was the taste he loved honest the fact that decaffeinated coffee never tasted as good just meant that he loved the taste of caffeine give me a minute to digest this there wasnt any actual violence was there you may want to look at the tapes yourself code them through would you and any updates on the dula business arrgh there was just too much to do the panoramic window behind his desk looked out onto the little san gabriel mountains but the touch of a switch could display any part of dream park that he chose his fingers played on the keyboard and the window divided into sections from an overhead camera in one of the cafeterias he watched a replay of a pushingandshouting match six of one group and ten of another all africans he recognized razul the libyan ambassador so the other bigger group must be panafrica they screamed in each others faces mixing languages pausing to find a word but never finding the chance to use it the language barrier was driving them berserk their interpreters kept trying to interrupt now security men and women moved among them drawing the screamers aside the incident had been neatly averted whoever was working security had done well but could he have caught it quicker zoom the screen zoomed up and he had a clear view of mitch hasagawa good man on the floor almost psychically sharp reminded griffin a lot of marty bobbick before marty put in for desk operations a good man in the field a decent man in the office alex hoped that mitch would stay in the field he zoomed the second window it cleared and fogged again closeup of the arab rarul griffin remembered rarul he had briefed his officers on the man razul was kareem fekeshs man despite fekeshs staggering financial empire the industrialist was widely rumored to be a primary supporter of holy fire the radical political sect which had grown out of the united moslem activist front in the teens nothing had ever been proven but holy fire had openly threatened the life of charlene dula fekesh should never have been permitted within ten kilometers of the park but his influence had delivered most of the radical arab sects totaling billions of dollars of prospective investment capiml money talks and loudly enough to drown out the voice of a security chief dont disturb me for five minutes cary i need to breathe got it boss griffin looked out over the valley he stood twisted his back until his spine crackled the sun sat low on the horizon and the mountain shadows stretched slowly toward dream park there was too damn much to do and it was all too damned important not just for cowles industries but for the human race africa might be a lesson for them all perhaps the lines of nationalism and factionalism and every other goddamn ism in the world had reduced the chances for this weary planet or not nuclear devices had existed for over a century and only four of them had ever been used in anger this could be interpreted as proof of divine intervention good luck a sign that the human race was growing up or ominous portent depending upon ones standing in the halfempty halffull school of cocktailparty philosophy for most of recorded history military technology had been the cutting edge of human knowledge only the leap to space called forth more of mans natural and intellectual resources project barsoom was the most expansive dream in human history big enough to create a world vision to involve every world government it would create millions of jobs and circulate hundreds of billions of dollars it could be a rallying point a place to start over the door behind him swung open ahead of marty who bounced in talking around a mouthful of ham and cheese quite a madhouse chief cant get five goddamn minutes alex squashed the flash of irritation getting madder by the minute what now weve got the ifgs feed on line three we need to take this one together why me lord the question surprised him youve actually been through one of the games chief i need the input without waiting for alexs approval marty leaned over his desk and tapped the vidfeed through the screen cleared the pinched aquiline features of arlan myers appeared the man always looked like he had a wedge of lemon tucked in one bearded cheek mr griffin myers said with just the slightest hint of what alex assumed was resentment where was myers new york and what time was it there oops sorry for the hour arlan griffin said solicitously his imagination wandered and he found himself wondering what myers was wearing under the edge of the screen maybe the international fantasy gaming society had summoned him out of bed better still maybe myers was the resident ifgs satyr and something warm and pliant was waiting for him just off screen alex allowed a moments fantasy about the official ifgs kama sutra were going to be running that modified fimbuiwinter game in a few hours have you had a chance to scan the game tapes of course arlan sniffed a basic modification of the fimbulwinter scenario for the first time a touch of joy appeared on his face rather clever actually i worked on that one a few years back when the lopezes designed the control sequences he shook his head reproachfully its really too difficult for novice gamers i have to admit that i dont completely understand the method behind this particular madness the lower left screen cleared and dr vail appeared he was sixtyfour and looked thirtyeight with that lean and leathery californian healthierthanthou look about him his blue eyes always seemed feverishly bright and intense it looks like i timed this right mr myers pleased to meet you finally your work on the psychology of engagement has been instrumental in developing our behavioral programs dr vail arlan inclined his head slightly what does my little treatise on gaming theory have to do with weight loss vail smiled you expanded gaming theory beyond the mathematics of penetration envelopment and confrontation to the patterns of attention which influence an encounter rhythms of concentration you called them alex leaned back in his seat fingers laced fascinated and totally out of his depth arlan seemed pleased yes of course human existence is cyclical circadian rhythms kreb cycles the circular movements that the human eye makes even when trying to hold steady on a single point these things are well documented mental focus exhibits similar cycles regardless of the level of intelligence or concentration there are down points in the cycles perceptual blind spots floating holes where information simply slips through unnoticed the more fatigued or singleminded we become the larger the holes get yes and you timed the engagements in the original fimbulwinter game to hide sorrie of the clues in plain sight as it were you took advantage of temporary blackouts due to fatigue or attention engagement this idea forms the foundation of the fat ripper specials we hit the gamers on every level except conscious analytical they think that the point of the game is the exercise the exercise isnt the medicine its the spoon nothing up my sleeve arlan chuckled if my little postulations have been useful on a more practical level im glad tell me youve run several of the rippers why is this one a special problem now alex spoke up due to a security risk it has become advisable for me to enter one of our people into the game this run consists of thirteen gamers and up to fortythree actors playing multiple roles most of the gamers were on the waiting lists long before dula was announced for the game so no problems there actors are all dream park personnel and have been checked the park is closed to ordinary tourists so weve minimized risks across the board so what exactly is your problem i wouldnt want mr bobbick killed out i cant bend the rules to help him asian nodded approval even in the best of causes cheating is still cheating marty shifted uncomfortably in his seat ive seen plenty of games watched em from the outside i mean it doesnt look so hard asian myers laughed heartily oh i can hardly wait to see your tapes appearances can be deceiving mr bobbick griffin warmed remembering his own game i was wondering whether it might be permissible for marty to take a look at the actual game plans myers reddened no no no if he knows the answers he will give them away but if they arent playing for points no the other players will notice who is lucky or who is successful and rally around him dr vails blue eyes narrowed it throws the whole structure of the game off the actors are highly trained to conceal their knowledge youd be surprised how much eye and body movement gives information away in the last century a performer named kreskin ran a mindreading act you wouldnt believe basically by observing body language i agree with vail you could destroy the balance of the whole game myers turned and looked at marty what do you have three hours until the game begins seven hours time difference myerss lip curled oh yes well that gives you enough time to read i made the pits too big confessions of a retired deity the lopez biography yes that will give you an overview i can give you a rundown of the gaming rules one the duration of the game will be three days that is to say seventytwo hours two he ticked off on his fingers the number of participants thirteen three the wesslergrahm auditing company has produced a variant on the standard gaming tables for use in the rippers even though they have no credit with the ifgs they provide a means for ripper participants to reference their efforts this is new in earlier rippers there wasnt enough feedback competition is often valuable vail said feedback always is four myers continued there will be a penalty of fifty percent of accumulated points in the event of a players death twentyfive percent of which will be rebated if the player returns to the game as a tornrait a helpful undead five the game will be conducted for sixteen hours out of every twentyfour dr vail interrupted except that the programming will continue for twentyfour hours a day an yes six due to the nature of the game food and rest breaks will be subject to randomization and interruption seven the usual quartermoon symbol will indicate the presence of rest room facilities thats all dr vail smiled at myers like a cat inspecting a bowl of cream griffin had the distinct impression that he was calculating myerss body fat content from the thickness of the bearded cheeks thank you mr myers i think you will find that the adjustments weve made in the game actually make it more interesting i cant imagine any of our refinements modifications myers corrected politely an yes refinementh would interfere with security work mr bobbick you may find that you are more tired than usual by the end of the last day due to the fact that your brains are receiving constant input we balance that with the distribution of food excuse me nothing but fruit or raw vegetables after nine in the evening in that way your digestive system gets to rest while you sleep second all of the participants will be wearing heart and blood pressure transmitters wired into the mesh of their underwear these will be in constant operation welli think thatll do it for the time being youll find everything else you need to know as the game proceeds the two screens winked out griffin sipped the dregs of his coffee what do you think martys face broke into a huge smile you know for years ive been telling myself that i was going to do a game you seemed to have so much fun in the south seas treasure game but i just never did it now ive got the chance i love it ill make you a little side beti outpoint everyone there ive got a different bet for you lose twenty pounds within eight weeks and well see about that raise aw chief cmon i can still pin you two out of three thats the deal what do you say marty waited a minute then extended a heavy hand youre on griffin pumped it solemnly now then is warbots set up yet marty rubbed his hands together lets see griffin punched a series of buttons and the window cleared and razul sat in a tiny cabin that pitched and yawed as he manipulated his controls each thundering footstep of the warbot reverberated to the core of his spine the enemy warbot came at him again scarlet trimmed in black two hundred feet tall a thousand tons of mechanized thunder with andrew chala invisible in the torso it swung a gigantic fist that impacted like the direct strike of an avalanche rarul went down and when he did a row of buildings was crushed beneath him razul must keep the warbot rolling must bring it back to its feet but he was rolling across a park and into a block of apartment buildings while families screamed and fled tiny nannies pushed prams at sprinters speed or abandoned them to die beneath the metal behemoth hed smashed the base of a building it disintegrated concrete and screaming people showered his shoulders as he came to his feet have you never wished to fight a war all by yourself yourself the only general and the only warrior no ally to betray you no subordinate to ruin your plans through mistake or misunderstanding war reduced to its basics dream parks fool of a psychiatrist thought he knew raruls mind he was wrong rarul had accepted the warbots challenge in spite of vail he glimpsed his enemy through the wreckage razul and chala had agreed to fight without missiles but one could improvise rarul clutched a mass of the concrete beehive and hurled it it smashed through a shell of wall that was still standing the scarlet behemoth behind it staggered then came on by the sacred mountains of allah dream parks servants had violent bloody dreams he was a war all to himself facing one monolith of an enemy now wading toward him through waisthigh structures a bank some ancient business buildings that had become apartments it was good it was simpler than life it was a heady experience if only he couldnt hear the screams he could enjoy the battle concentrate on smashing andrew chala they were little white english antlike insignificant not his people at all yet his battle with the black man no matter what he did no matter what crushing blow he dealt continued to hurt the little people he couldnt help but feel the shame and guilt associated even as the exhaustion of moving the controls began to wear down his endurance but the warbot was back on its tremendous feet and razul waded back into the park sweat drooled down his face and the sounds of screaming and wailing rang in his ears razul readied himself for the assault his enemys great black and red machine stalked toward him nearly running now if chala maintained that speed he might be able to dodge its right foot suddenly sank to the knee razul screamed defiance and threw his machine forward behind its massive fist chalas behemoth was off balance its arms came around too slowly everything seemed slow the robots were so large but razuls fist plowed into the other robot just below the throat the world rang like a million broken bells now duck while the others arms came around where chalas robots foot had penetrated the turf white light flared from underneath turf exploded upward razul blinked dazzled and fought the controls to avoid falling over backward he could guess what had happened chala had stepped into the chunnel the vacuum subway that ran between britain and france a train must have impacted at meteor speed thousands dead in fractions of a second and his enemys leg was off at the knee razul threw three missilevelocity punches his enemy fell back and landed hard and razul had won he was crying like a baby as he struggled out of the cabin war reduced to its basics smash things hope your enemy is smashed too no honor in this only fatigue and death and blood ruining the pretty parks war reduced to its basics oh you sons of dogs he saw andrew chala climbing out of what was after all only the midsection of a giant red and black robot chala was sobbing helplessly we must keep war off mars razul told himself we will ill have to talk to chala later chapter five catch it and you keep it move it max sands ran as fast as he could thundering along on thick muscular legs what was who was a moment ago he and the rest of the group had been ambling toward the embarking area then an alarm whistle split the calm of the corridor and they broke into a stumbling confused gallop his heart hammered in adrenal overload what had gone wrong hed heard rumors that mad arabs were after moon maid had they max and exercise were ancient antagonists he went into a kind of fugue state where his body seemed to perform without his conscious intervention a sort of automatic overdrive he had learned while apprenticing in his curious profession just behind him eviane was puffing like a choochoo bouncing and jiggling but keeping up more her face was grinsplit with happy anticipation her elongated friend moon maid dula moved as if walking on stilts a continuous toppling run unsteady but still making tracks the tunnel boomed and shuddered far off he heard the rattle of gunshots the tunnel deadended at a curved metal door sealed with a thick rubber flange rows of fluorescent lights flickered around the edges a cluster of gamers were there ahead of him the guy who called himself hippogryph was pushing against the wall stretching his calves sweat streamed down his cheeks his chest heaved hippogryphs breathing was a conscious thing inhale through the nose only slowly exhale the guy acted like an outsiders image of a typical gamer big sappy permanent grin constant quotes from asimov and chang sly in references to luke skywalker and frodo max read him as a dream park security watchdog for charlene dula brother orson stumbled trying to keep up a very large conspicuously pretty blonde named trianna stithwood helped him right himself there was strength in that womans arms she had a baby face little pearly teeth a smile you could use for a heliograph he had heard she was a chef likely she was her own best customer two more ran up francis hebert was a short darkskinned crophaired career soldier pudgy only by military standards he ran easily the bagel in his fist explained his late start the second man was frankish oliver a gamer and a pure warrior even though at this point everyone was still in street clothes a blast of cold air hit max in the face as if the airconditioning units had suddenly gone berserk the door burst open banging against the tunnel wall a woman stood there looking gaunt and frightened in a neatly pressed red uniform the cords in her throat bunched as she screamed hurry it was the voice that had shrieked panic from the intercom the guard cant hold the cannibals back much longer cannibals max looked behind him two uniformed national guardsmen one black and slender the other white and burly were the ones firing the shots the burly man fell his hand clapped to a spreading red glow on his leg his face distorted with pain as he tried to crawl toward the silver door trianna orson and frankish oliver squeezed through charlene dula started back max grabbed charlenes arm urgently wrong way but that man hes hurt max pulled her toward the door hippogryph had her other arm and was following maxs lead and staring hard at max certainly he was security and max had touched charlene charlene looked back over her shoulder the concern on her face suddenly changed to horror from around the corner surged a horde of people in tattered clothing bundled in rags they grabbed the wounded guardsman and dragged him away his screaming grew acute then stopped the second soldier bellowed at them get that boat off the ground the cannibals were bearing down on him when the soldier took a silver cylinder from his belt pulled the pin and finally charlene seemed to understand she eeled through the doorway it was the curved thick doorway of an airplane wedged halfopen max feared he would tear skin pushing through after her hippogryph had similar trouble following him the soldier tucked and rolled as the corridor erupted into flame the plastic structure ruptured from floor to ceiling and what poured through was snow a blizzard of powder and white flakes gushed through the cracks frigid air slapped his face like a giant frozen hand sent him reeling back from the door the soldier scrambled into the plane snow and sweat streaking his dark face he turned and pulled the door shut the floor lurched under his feet max caught one last glimpse through the window the entire tunnel was collapsing screaming the raggedy maneaters tumbled through the ruptured floor and disappeared strap yourselves in were taking off now max looked around heaving for breath he could hear a good deal of panting around him francis hebert had had to pull johnny welsh inside the comedian was redfaced and heaving but recovering fast good lungs a standup comic would need that seats were four across the fuselage constricted halfway back where overhead wings showed through big curved windows max wasnt familiar with aircraft but this plane seemed old one of the smaller supersonic jets seats at the back had been ripped out and cargo was stacked nearly to the ceiling the seats were already crowded nobody knew what was going on any more than he did but they were moving he settled into a seat next to frankish oliver across the aisle from charlene and eviane charlenes height forced her to sit knees to chest and eviane was helping her settle in charlenes voice was a frantic squeal eviane whats happening eviane smiled uneasily seems to be the end of the world charlene gripped her seat silent lips pressed thin max admired the way eviane helped her friend in the midst of a whirlwind of panic and murder she seemed to be maintaining control something had changed in the silent withdrawn eviane of the time travel game there was a rumbling purr as the plane backed away from what max could now see was a ruined airline terminal the roof buckled under a crushing mantle of snow were very fortunate that the storm is dying the stewardess said she looked exhausted were the last plane out of san francisco airport i dont know what happened to the rest of them i can only hope her voice trailed off and she rubbed her eyes they were redrimmed and darkcircled as if she hadnt slept in days as she buckled herself against the wall the plane lurched bounded across the icy ground the windows smeared with snow flumes the plane tilted and went up at a steep angle snowlocked buildings and cars swiftly became toylike max craned over frankish oliver to peer out of the window at the city below the plane rose turning right the long overhead wing swung back max saw the ruin that had once been the showpiece of the west coast the rebuilt bay bridge lay broken and buckled and snow partially covered a string of cars that stretched from mann to oakland ships were frozen in the bay and the entire city lay under a bluewhite mantle of ice the light was dim the sky beyond the foldedback wing was slategray study eskimos dream parks instruction packet had read he was beginning to understand why the passengers had grown quiet a hush followed the wump as they eased through the sound bather the stewardess switched her throat mike on her voice was a near parody of the countless airplane safety recitations max had heard over the years the weather has continued to worsen she said we cant go south the airports in los angeles and san diego are swamped texas and new mexico are sealed theyre shooting unauthorized planes out of the sky the southwest just isnt prepared for this kind of weather new york has done better its people and social structures have survived while california is disintegrating since canada commandeered the oil pipeline thats no place for americans alaska is our best bet the plane slid through gray clouds and out eviane hissed charlene frowned whats wrong the sun only fools look straight at the sun charlene caught it in her peripheral vision glaring above an unbroken white cloud deck it looks fine eviane stared at her then looked out the window it looks that way from ceres i oh if its right for ceres then too small for earth not enough light what could cause that max cursed under his breath moon maid was deadon why hadnt he seen it he tried to shake the cobwebs away for the first time since the jumbled introductions at the tower of night he had a chance to really look at the people around him one man stood and introduced himself my name is robin bowles i owe you all and i guess you dont know why the group went silent eviane canted forward she whispered fiercely robin bowles the actor hes our guide max only vaguely recognized the name but he knew the face from latenight movies vidcassettes talk shows and tabloids none of that mattered now one of the first things that gamers learned was that somebody along on the trip would have been briefed on the game the rules the situation the mission when the guide spoke you listened its been almost two years since the series of operations that saved my life bowles was a hair over six feet tall and stout where many of the garners were merely chunky his hair and beard were long and bushy brown going gray the red cross had a severe blood shortage due to the blood bank terrorism of everyone was afraid infected needles infected plasma the entire system was beginning to fail and the ten of you donated blood that saved me he sighed it was a miracle and there was no way i could thank you id lost a fortune speculating on adverseenvironment gear i was betting on another oil strike in alaska his face darkened grim as a man staring into the depths of hell then the sun began to die six words said without drama without a roll of drums or a dimming of lights yet max felt the chill right down to the marrow bowles paused to let the implications sink in it wasnt just that the sun wasnt burning no fusion no neutrinos hell thats news from the last century but now the interior heat is going somewhere somehow interior heat inflates a star keeps it from collapsing the sun is shrinking the surface isnt any dimmer but its a smaller radiating surface the earths insulation is down to half and falling the weather changed and suddenly the gear that had been a drug on the market became gold the film industry in utah and illinois died overnight but i was making more money on the gear than id ever made in holos so i stayed in san francisco selling and manipulating sales until it became obvious that the city was falling it was time to move on and i remembered you all of you id kept track of you i found you and offered you this escape thank you for accepting my offer the sincerity in his thanks came through clearly this was a man who was delighted for the chance to repay a fraction of what he owed the plane is completely stocked i own a wildlife research station in the north country there will be heat and food enough to last a lifetime for us and any children we may have beyond that the optimism slipped like a loose mask we all know what awaits us awaits mankind eventually we can only hope that someone will find an answer some of you have technical skills he took a handful of manila file folders and moved down the aisle passing them out these are personalized dossiers please correct any faulty information we will have to depend on each other completely we are a totally closed society he passed max and handed down a folder max broke the seal with his thumbnail max sands lbs recreational therapistwhatever the heck that meant sounded sexier than what he really did hed never met the guy in the folder but already liked him better than the one in the mirror this max sands had stayed behind when the city began to empty he cared for the sick who couldnt be moved when the blizzard hit san francisco he snuck a peek over at charlene wondering if she had taken a fantasy identity she would have made a perfect tolkien elf but there were no elves in this game frankish olivers biography described an sfpd sergeant a vital job someone who had stayed behind during what must have been a long and painful exodus from the northern climes max closed his eyes it was easy to imagine the sun shrinking the weather cooling panic the beginning of the end for man on earth and what was happening to man in space with their dependence on solar power he examined the men and women around him these were the people he would have to depend upon for his survival he envisioned himself learning to use snow tractors working in hothouses tending the reactor max shook himself out of the reverie stop being so clever dont even try to guess frankish oliver was chuckling under his beard isnt he good robin bowles under all that hair last time i saw him he was balding actors ego hes on camera now he was nero wolfe in ferdelance and the mother hunt they couldnt be paying him enough for this he must want to lose weight for a movie oliver looked at him scanned him up and down so youre mr mountain eh you look bigger on holovid elevator tights max said quietly daminit hed hoped no one would recognize him listenyoure the only one who knows dont spread it around all right oliver chuckled well all right but i wouldnt worry about it were all playing roles here and he turned back to his dossier odd comment was oliver a gamer or an actor best to watch him see what he did maybe do the same he hoped oliver could keep a secret clouds were fragile veils that flashed past without leaving moisture on the windows the land streaming below might have been a boneyard shrouded with cotton seattle the stewardess said totally dead except for scavengers a few unfortunates who couldnt get out and the frozen unburied dead the stewardess was talking into a tape recorder she caught max staring and her lips gave an embarrassed upward twitch ive been trying to make a record it doesnt matter now maybe it wont ever matter but i have to believe there is hope someone has to the mood in the room was grim this was fun this was supposed to be entertainment it felt like a wake a gathering to mourn the death of mankind beneath the marching glaciers suddenly max felt so depressed that he couldnt there was a low rumbling in the engines so low that he almost didnt notice it now he caught it and recognized it subsonics the rumble died and he began to feel a little better damn it he knew that dream park was manipulating him with sound with subliminal visuals and if rumor had it right with smells that impacted below the threshold of conscious perception it didnt matter as his mood lifted he suddenly felt buoyant filled with hope and energy he looked around himself in the plane saw everyone sitting up straight eyes tight with determination bowles nodded i knew that i could count on you now listen to me he spoke in an odd measured cadence suspi ciously like a stage hypnotist max had seen on holo once sometimes we can do things for other people that we cant do for ourselves if thats what it takes to get you through this to help you survive then thats what i want you to do he scanned the room max felt a musical trilling sensation it was similar to the thrill hed experienced when he figured out the answer to the time travel game like someone using his bones for a piccolo he felt like he could whip the world were going to survive each of us is going to go beyond his ordinary limits every one of us is going to make sacrifices were going to give up things that we love to make a healthier situation for our friends our family i want you all to look into your hearts and be sure that you have permission to survive to win because if you dont have that then no matter how much food we have how much shelter or heat you wont make it bowles made very deliberate eye contact with each of them in turn max felt comfortablearifting warm he sank into an ocean of comfort and only when he bobbled up again did he realize that bowles had been talking the whole time help that is asked for no matter what it is agreed aye the gamers answered raggedly max joined in late too embarrassed to admit that he hadnt the foggiest notion what he was agreeing to but judging by the confused expressions around him his lapse of attention had been more rule than aberration something was being passed forward from the back he sniffed sharp cheese and beef and his mouth watered lunchlike substances waiting he suddenly realized that the plane was shuddering humming with stress this is your captain speaking we are running low on fuel but there is nothing to worry about the charts indicate a refueling depot just south of bethel within glide distance we will land there please strap yourselves in the shudder eased the plane had dropped back through sonic speed through the window he could see the ground looming close a vast expanse of white dotted with a few rectangular dwellings the wing had moved smoothly forward flaps were sliding out to extend the trailing edges his stomach crawled up into his throat looking for a place to hide there was a clutch of buildings ahead the land humped to the left a sharp black ridge and beyond that were more oblongs on the white blanket an eskimo village the plane shifted about outspread wings feeling the air the craft tilted and dropped gripped by a freak wind gamers gripped their seats with whiteknuckled fingers max glanced across the aisle evianes bright emerald eyes were as wide as saucers blinking rapidly as she peered out under the wing the craft straightened and surged and touched down in a snow bed plumes of white spewed to either side they slowed sliding toward a pair of snowshrouded refueling pumps then it was as if a malicious hand clutched the wheels on the right the plane lurched and slewed drunkenly heaving max against his seatbelt it smashed straight into the pumps and ripped them away half of the service station shell went next a thick splinter of metal gouged into the hull of the plane breaching the cabin max heard the clang and saw something ripping through the wall slicing toward him at knee level he pulled his knees to his belly as the jagged steel wedge slicked past the intoxicating stench of spilled fuel filled the air the stewardess screamed at them move the emergency exits are middle and front take the left side exits only but hurry the passenger cabin dissolved into chaos everyone grabbed gear or friends or both the copilot and pilot burst from the cockpit and reached the door ahead of the stewardess they pulled handles the side doors of the plane popped open completing the cabin temperatures descent to zero a chute hissed as it expanded the copilot jumped into the chute and disappeared from view his voice came back okay move the pilot stayed to help robin bowles into the chute bowles let out a boisterous yaahhoo as he hit the plastic he skidded to the ground and spun dizzily on the snow max was next he slid all of the way down on his butt hollering every inch of the way what a trip passengers followed at foursecond intervals the inflated chute bounced and flopped behind him he counted heads all out except the pilot the stewardess and the guardsman they were throwing things from the open door half a dozen bulky items fell in a cloud backpacks then crates what about damage but they were in haste i bought good stuff bowles bellowed faffing angels stuff antibiotics made in orbit lines thatll hold six elephants foamsteel backpack struts hey use the chute for that he caught a crate as it slid down the chute we may need those medicines the copilot was jogging around to the tail of the plane his feet thrashed in the air as he pulled the tail ramp down he yelled something undecipherable in the wind and excitement and then disappeared in a deceptively soft puff of fire yellow flame rolled up from the back of the plane like a flapping carpet darkening to a roll of oily smoke max was chilled the man had been cremated in an instant killed out one redundant guide gone its only a game come on eviane was running toward the flame the stew had her by the arm was shouting at her above the howling wind eviane desisted the exit had become a rush and he thought well get clear but what about the supplies the food max made himself move luggage was being thrown out of the forward door and they scrambled for it catching it as it fell in a bizarre game of what was it called he vaguely remembered an ancient comedy routine entitled catch it and you keep it something soft slammed into his chest and sent him stumbling backward he couldnt hold the belly laugh in even as he tried to catch his balance they were stranded their food was going up in smoke the copilot fried this was disastrous this was tragic this was getting really interesting chapter six supplies eviane watched francis hebert roll clumsily down the chute he managed to right himself and hit the ground running the stewardess helped trianna stithwood through the doorway for all her size trianna managed somehow to express panic in a dainty ladylike manner eviane decided that she definitely didnt like the woman crates of equipment lay scattered in the snow as bowles and the pilot struggled to haul luggage from the cargo hold the guardsman left the chute three feet above the ground hit the ground rolling and took off with rifle held at the ready the stewardess took a last look into the plane seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and stepped out into the chute the plane shuddered against the ground and an instant later the windows exploded gouting fire for an instant the stewardess was outlined in flame her body a blackened silhouette against a yellow corona then she was gone the planes deathcry flattened the hapless garners chunks of burning metal rained from the sky eviane lay facedown in the snow the snow just a few feet from her head flickered with gasoline flames and glistened as it melted a fragment of twisted steel lay just out of reach it was hot it would burn her if she touched it wouldnt it it was all real the mists were clearing she stood and looked down and out at the survivors thirteen in all passengers and crew they moved toward bowles gathering into a tight clump to hear each other over a hammering frigid wind the pilot yelled above the storm im sorry mr bowles made a right cockup of that one i think there must have been a bullet in the fuel tank wheres greg wheres the pilot gasped eyes fixed on a smoldering humanshaped mass lying crumpled in the snow at least thirty feet from the plane ashenfaced he ran toward it legs plowing unsteadily through the snow and at last stood silently above what was left of the stewardess he removed his outer jacket and draped it over her smoldering corpse his breath puffed little clouds into the air he shivered and wrapped his arms around himself rubbing his shoulders after a few seconds he rather guiltily took his jacket back bowles threw a blanket over the stews body he said grant weve got to reach the lodge apologize then he glanced up at the shrunken sun which was a third above the horizon i figure we have a month of daylight left it will just have to be enough then three or four months of night the pilot said and after that fimbulwinter bowles said carbon dioxide freezing out of the atmosphere maybe ah well sufficient unto the day the wind was whipping the fire to death snow ran in blinding flurries eviane shielded her face as her cheeks began to numb the guardsman ran up to them carrying his rifle at port arms supply store bowless scream competed with the storms growing wail he pointed into a white wall of driving snow cant see it but its out there eskimo village half a mile that way the soldier shouted back they must have seen us come down probably on their way now eviane picked up a box marked with a red cross it was heavy she trudged toward the cluster of buildings the other garners followed her carrying gear leaving tracks like a colony of snow snails the sky began to clear the wall of white slowing to a flurry charlene caught up with her whew off to a start arent we charlene lowered her voice youve gamed before what is happening game this isnt a game its its eviane shook her head clearing the smoky strands that wove themselves tighter and thicker by the moment a flicker of prescience made her say i dont know lets just play it by ear ear the door of the supply store was open a crack grant pushed against it cautiously with his fingertips the pilot had just lost a plane a copilot and a stewardess he might not be overwhelmingly eager to lose a halfdozen passengers the door creaked open throwing a wedge of light into an abandoned store as soon as grant nodded the gamers crowded in out of the freezing wind oh it was stocked well stocked in fact with all manner of food and suddenly eviane remembered that the alarm klaxon had sounded in the middle of breakfast a line of portable stoves several canisters of fuel they could cook too orson sands spread massive fingers grabbing three foil packets of pork and beans real men dont need sterno he proclaimed ill suck em cold kevin the skinny kid called from elsewhere in the store clothing coats hats its cold out there troops wait just a minute bowles seemed uneasy he ran thick fingers through his beard brushing out snow why isnt there anybody here where in the devil are they i dont know and dont really care orsons teeth tore a foil packets serrated corner he spat you had better start caring if you want to stay alive very long his brother max said cautiously evianes little pink heart leapt max was smart and despite his girth looked like a fighter she remembered him too from the tar pits minigame he was well over six feet tall inches shorter than charlene but three times as wide he looked a lot like his brother orson barring his neatly trimmed beard but he looked and moved more like an athlete his belly didnt sag the same way an exfootball player maybe his eyes were a luminous grayblack he said orson even up here would people just walk away from a store and leave the door open all right maybe they would but we have an exploding airplane out here and nobody has even come to take a look his voice was patient its another puzzle orson orson said aw max yeah eviane noticed charlene watching them she whispered brothers interested charlene nodded judiciously me too his names max the pilot was saying vote all in favor of checking to see what is happening around here say aye aye six hands and voices were raised three belonged to charlene and max and hippogryph opposed seven nos the nos have it grant said the gamers drifted among the shelves some were at the rear with kevin and hippogryph choosing coldweather gear more were finding dinner trianna stithwood called veal paprika johnny welshs head rotated degrees veal trianna rubbed the foil packet winking i make a veal loaf to die for thyme tarragon leaves minced parsley and tomato fondue sauce lady youre killing me there are worse bang the clatter of canned goods stopped another distant gunshot then a volley orson sands dropped the bag of freezedried pork and beans eyes sparkling puzzle right he and max thundered through the door the others crowding right behind they clustered outside looking out across the choppy permafrost of the valley floor into the blizzardshrouded ridge to the north had the shots come from there it was the only decent cover come on baby max sands spoke again and eviane found herself drifting closer to him craving an opportunity to watch more closely he was handsome in a massive sort of way and she liked the sound of his voice voices had always been it for her the sound of an announcers voice on the stereo others seemed fascinated by the glow and depth of the video arcades but she had always loved audio just the sound of a voice was enough and he had the voice something inside her melted captain grant and hebert struggled out carrying armfuls of bulky coats and hats with earmuffs dropped them in the snow and began sorting for something that would fit bowles emerged with a double armful of tennis rackets huh snowshoes more of the garners were wearing coats now it was cold eviane picked through coats chose one found a hat with folddown ear flap pulled on thermal galoshes all while listening with her whole body come on max sands said where is it give me another shot and they got it crack crackcrackcrack and a thin wavering scream they had their direction the group straggled off across the snow north toward the black ridge a long way to walk but the snow was packed hard eviane carried her snowshoes she cast a glance at charlene saw the fatigue in her friends face they linked arms and struggled up the grade they were making good time bowles lifted a hand and brought them to a halt before they reached the top they followed his lead dropped onto their stomachs scuttled over the ridge like a line of crabs and peered down it was night in the shadow of the ridge their eyes adjusted quickly four armed men lay in an arc facing a house that lay in partial ruins it was burning smoke and ashes boiling from the roof attached to one end of the house a smaller shedperhaps a smokehousehad been blown apart as if by an explosion around the main door two no three bodies stretched out on the snow in positions that only the dead could assume eviane heard a whimper after a long startled moment she recognized her own voice she had seen this before been here before prescience one of the riflemen barked out a challenge eviane didnt recognize the language but the meaning was obvious she had heard it a thousand times in flatfilms and holos and even radio plays come out with your hands up what had they tripped into was this the equivalent of the royal canadian mounted police were the people in the house desperate criminals eviane couldnt remember shed tried to forget shed fought to forget and now when it mattered it was all gone someone emerged from the smoky hell of the front door his hands were high in the air and he yelled something back to the attackers there was a guttural laugh and a rifle barked the man fell palms slapping to his forehead eviane closed her eyes her empty stomach curled into a knot charlenes whispered laughter rang in her ear youre overacting its embarrassing what are we supposed to do she had no answer dreamboats voice saved her well we know that theyre not the good guys we dont have any weapons hippogryph said we could get into a lot of trouble we have flares the guardsman called two boxes of them and my rifle listen with three flare guns we can convince them that theyre surrounded goners i say we give it a shot hebert objected flare guns all right they arent that well armed impatiently eviane snapped lead on after a few whispered instructions the group spread out eviane was all elbows and knees as she crawled along the ridge the curving sickle of snow that sheltered them from the war below just ahead of her dreamboat raised his flare pistol bowles slashed his hand in the air and with a chorus of dull phuts white streamers cut through the air suddenly a halfdozen smoking parachuting flares were drifting from the sky like burning blossoms the men on the ground looked up ooooobleobleoble charlene screamed out her cry swiftly echoed by everyone else in the group eviane joined them delightedlywho could resist an opportunity to scream baby talk with a bunch of supposedly grown adulttype people it was ridiculous and silly and somehow cleansing the men in the valley looked around in confusion but the sound was coming from everywhere and nowhere the guardsman aimed his rifle carefully and squeezed the trigger one of the enemy went down clutching his chest the remaining three sprang to their feet and spread their arms for a moment eviane thought that they were asking for mercy then the clouds parted no they hadnt parted the sky was slategray threatening snow but a northward wedge of cloud was brighter widening and sky and land were flowing off to the north the vast dim expanse of snow flowed to left and right as if a folded blanket was being pulled straight it was hard to see because what was summoned into being was only new snowscape no different from the old except that it glowed beneath a brighter sky the four gunmen hastened north two carrying their wounded member they didnt look back not even when the guardsman stopped gaping and fired after them he fired three careful shots snow puffed wide of the gunmen damn the guardsman said a distant ridge of snow humped ahead of them the four stopped and one gestured widearmed his face lifting as the white mass lifted and then the snowscape flowed the path closed the light dimmed eviane huffed as her legs gave out and dropped her in the snow they were gone there remained only a bare field of snow and four corpses to mark the place where a moment before a dreadful battle had raged chapter seven the qasgiq eviane stumbled down the bank of snow caught her balance for an exhilarating moment then tumbled again she wiped ice from her hair and snorted it from her nose as she came back to her feet the other refugees plowed furrows in the snow as they plunged down some rolled like pill bugs whooping max and the national guardsman both kept their balance all the way down at the last instant max lost his battle with momentum and plowed facefirst to the bottom charlene walked down fully upright slowly like an aged elvish queen with hippogryph alongside her as a dwarfish attendant evianes amusement vanished almost as quickly as it bubbled up what was happening here they had left the violence of the cities behind and now this something deep within her was untouched by the cold and the fear some voice whispered that it was all a dream only a recurrent nightmare eviane shook her head violently such thoughts were dangerous she approached the burning lodge cautiously avoiding the bodies of the dead eviane had seen corpses before a few more meant little one of the dead men was heartbreakingly young his eyes stared sightless freezing in the terrible cold his arms were outstretched as if begging for mercy or trying to provide some small measure of protection for his people inside charlene crunched through the snow behind her whispered close in her ear be careful why eviane asked surprised with how damned reasonable her voice sounded we can handle it or we cant if we cant were probably dead anyway lets go charlene looked at her with what could only have been amazement but charlene hailed from an earlier more benign world here the ice ruled and only the strong would survive somehow eviane would keep her friend alive until the tall girl had a chance to adapt to reality the national guardsman jogged up beside them eviane scanned him appraisingly he looked young and hard jaw square and tightcurled hair cropped short good an asset there were bad times ahead max sands she could trust max despite the run he wasnt really breathing hard hippogryph was no weakling either but bowles was bent over hands on knees panting stithwood was massaging her knee orson and kevin were still back on the slope johnny welsh hadnt told a joke in an hour kevin of the pipestem legs his padded clothing hung on him like a deflated balloon he was puffing a little but his smile was intact the rest could survive a day or two of starvation though theyd whine but for kevin theyd better find food hed build musclemeat on this trip or die trying smoke belched out of the front door as it creaked open fingers scrabbled on the inside pulling wealdy a man emerged his broad eskimo face was all planes and angles the face of a man who has known starvation or terrible illness his hands were lines and knobs only the eyes were alive they were piercing frozen blue like chips of flaming ice he gasped for breath and stretched the door wider so that a young woman could squeeze her way out the girl fell to her knees in the snow threw her anns around the young mans corpse wood owl she sobbed hysterically oh you fool oh my dear she was rounded solid beneath her furs so it wasnt starvation which had stolen the fat from the old mans face years of illness might do that as the old man stumbled from the doorframe the roof gave a sigh and collapsed his voice was as timeless as the howling wind we must find shelter come with me to the prayer lodge ahklut dares not violate that sacred place eviane nodded as if she understood and helped the girl to her feet the air grew even colder as they marched the wind drove the snow until it was almost a solid curtain the refugees stumbled on blindly following the old man he bent into the storm pushing on step after painful step who could tell what the old man was following instinct or memory or the distant outline of white knifeedged mountains momentarily visible through the terrible gale except for those brief moments they were in an endless impenetrable shell of white until eviane could see only the stunned shadow of johnny welsh struggling ahead of her one moments lapse of attention a single misplaced footstep and she would be lost after a time the storms fury diminished and she could distinguish the alien landscape around her there were no trees although the snow was clotted in irregular lumps that might have been trees shrouded and drowned in white there was no sign of life save for the line of silent travelers now that the wind was dying she heard their gasping charlene tapped her shoulder whispered down from her enormous height how do they do this it looks as if we can see for miles eviane frowned were on a hill sometimes i dont understand you at all charlene stared caught without a reply eviane withdrew to a deeper cooler place inside her mind charlene had already begun to crack snow madness shock it was to be expected in a group this size they might lose half simply to fear and despair eviane must be strong for all eviane snapped out of her reverie as they approached a large regular mound of snow the old man got down upon his hands and knees he oriented himself to the mountains then began digging in the snow in minutes he uncovered a mansized oval cave mouth he disappeared into it like a seal diving into an ice hole others followed eviane was sixth in line the floor of the passage was compressed and melted into an icy glaze the tunnel sloped down for the first eight feet then leveled out she pushed her pack ahead of her and nudged herself along with knees and elbows the tunnel gave her only a foot of clearance to the sides and if she had suffered from claustrophobia this would have been sheer terror wiggling another ten feet brought her to an upgrade where the lack of traction became treacherous hands grasped her pack from above and pulled she hung on for the ride she emerged from a trapdoor into a kind of lodge fifty or a hundred years earlier the lodge would probably have been constructed from wood and snow but more modern materials made other options available tubular plastic bladders filled with frozen water formed the rectangular structure of the walls the ceiling stretched over nine feet high and a conical sheet of clear plastic capped the roof the air smelled stale already warming with the scent of tired human flesh the old man poked a long spear through a vent hole in the center of the sheet knocking loose the snow in the middle of the room a blackened pit had been filled with branches chunks of log and tinder one by one the travelers came in out of the cold their collective bodies warmed the room outer coats were coming off the old man looked at them and eviane had a better opportunity to examine him in turn he and the young woman were similarly attired though the lower cut of her garment was more curved than his the furhooded robe had been sewn together from a variety of animals eviane recognized squirrel and mink and something that was probably muskrat there were other skins perhaps not native to alaska but traded hand to hand from hundreds or thousands of miles away was that a poodle skin she didnt see any machine stitching in the older mans clothing as the girl peeled off her external clothing she revealed a pair of jordache designer ski pants and boots girls will be girls she was cute in an eskimo kind of way eviane flickered a glance at max sands yes hed noticed call me martin qaterliaraq the old man said martin the arctic fox your christian missionaries named me martin long ago they were good people and i pay them the respect of keeping that name but although my daughter calls herself candice to me she is kanguq snow goose i serve the old ways his face fell once more he seemed impossibly ancient it is the old ways that brought you here to this place and only the old ways can save the world orson spoke into the silence what are you saving exactly from what wait we know the way to show you you have helped us already but we need more the trapdoor in the ground puffed again and more people emerged some were eskimos in traditional dress furs and skins some of the frocks looked to have been made of fish skin and others of waterproof gut some wore more modem coldweather gear perhaps even some of the plastic adverseenvironment gear bowles had mentioned both men and women wore earrings hanging from pierced earlobes as one wrinkled mongol face passed close by eviane caught a closer look at his flat rectangular earrings bits of ivory glass beads and colored rock were stuck into them the women were heavy but withered by time and environment many wore jewelry decorated with grotesque faces grinrnng demonshapes snarling animals two had bone needles projecting through their septa eviane counted a dozen men and women one two wore bloody bandages some were introduced by name names that made evianes head hurt to hear them kitngiq and pingayunelgen and tayarut and even less manageable mouthfuls all had the characteristic padding of fat the dark skin and epicanthic folds there was a kind of vitality to them that made the excess poundage seem appropriate in a way her own never had they carried it as if it was insulation above hard muscle when the room was threequarters full they arranged themselves around the fire pit in a circle with flint and steel martin started the fire smoke clouded the air although it was almost magically drawn up through the roof pouches were opened dried fish and meat went around the circle orson sands sneered at what he was holding this isnt even diet food there was plenty of real food back in the supply store martin shook his head sadly you must learn to see as the cabal see if you would best them at their game we must prepare you for the traditional ways my friend he doesnt mean eskimo pies max told his brother the pouch reached her hands what eviane pulled out had a texture like rough cardboard she began to chew it was stringy with a smoked flavor the inua of the fish must be respected they feed us and clothe us quiver our arrows and seal our boats their eggs tan hides and the oil of their bodies lights our homes eat and nourish your bodies and give reverence to the inua of the fish many of you will die before this is over and then your spirits will mingle with those beings you have consumed it would be best to make peace with them now the girlsnow goosesaid sedna is already gravely ill too ill to martin glared at her and she was silent eviane took martin at his word eating slowly chewing until each mouthful was almost a liquid the atmosphere in the lodge was close growing warmer her companions were having little trouble eating the peculiar food most of them must have tried stranger diets than this from the look of them when she stopped eating she wasnt full but the edge was off her hunger she felt in a state of readiness eager to hear the next of it several of the older men and one of the younger went to the fire and threw on crumbled handfuls of powder when they burned they made a smell like tobacco and dust the smoke grew thicker the flame hotter the eskimos were peeling off their external clothing soon they were all in underwear or twisted loincloths the refugees looked at each other in speculation or embarrassment or panic martin the arctic fox seemed halfstarved bones showing concave belly no navel qaterliaraq had no navel orson nudged max whispered the air grew thicker warmer eviane was perspiring no help for it she stripped and didnt stop until she was down to bra and panties she folded her clothes into a careful bundle the eskimos werent hiding themselves and she wouldnt either bowles and stithwood wore their near nudity with ease but orson sands held his shirt and jacket nervously in front of himself trying to cover as much flab as he could kevin spread his thin arms before the fire his eyes were halfclosed in bliss and his ribs were prominent hippogryph sweating freely had kept his clothes on until he couldnt take the heat now he was undressing in some haste he kept the bundled clothes in front of him blushing furiously max had stripped down to shorts without a tremor but many of evianes fleshy companions were embarrassed they shifted their considerable weight nervously from side to side like guilty children charlene tried to shrink into herself shoulders hunched arms hugging her knees guilty grin but she was relaxing even as eviane watched she was watching hippogryph hippogryph would not meet anyones eyes his ears were quite red he was hunched as charlene had been yet he had little to hide beneath his quite eskimolike fat layer the muscle was solid and what did charlene think she was hiding elvish alien beauty if she would only straighten up behind her johnny welsh whispered perhaps to himself i wish there wasnt so much light bowles chuckled steam bath scene take one johnny relaxed he smiled his voice rose gosh charles wasnt it nice of the cannibal king to let us use their bathhouse we should hurry johnny there must be a dozen tribes outside waiting for us to finish theyre probably here for the feast the king promised martin qaterliaraq spoke again this is the sweat lodge the qasgiq of my people mph the old man pronounced the word kuzzagick here we dream our dreams and see into the world beyond but ahklut has tttom the veil between matter and spirit he would bring the chaos of his greed and fear into the worldmphand destroy everything the other eskimos nodded assent but martins lips were twitching and some othзrs were having trouble keeping their faces solemn the trapdoor in the floor flapped open again more eskimos brought in handfuls of brittle driftwood and loaded them into the central fire pit smoke curled up from the crackling wood and twisted through the ceiling watching it lulled eviane into an almost hypnotic reverie the relaxation became dismay a few minutes later when the air grew so close as to be almost unbreathable several of the refugees were choking and gasping for breath then the smoke lightened pictures floated in a gray misty ocean that merged into a gray misty sky martins voice was strong once again it was the beginning and there were not yet people upon the earth he said for four days the first man lay coiled in the pod of a beach pea on the fifth he burst forth and stood fullgrown a man a protoeskimo stood naked in the mist a black shape emerged from the sky grew wings and a head became a gigantic raven in evianes mind the words of the ancient shaman and the images in the air melded together the room around her receded from her awareness she stood on an ancient beach could see the oily gray sky smell the protosurf the raven covered a sizable patch of sky it shrank as it glided to earth perspective in reverse it was mansized when it touched the sand it stared at the man cocking its head to the side and finally said what are you the man stuttered in fear and confusion the great raven pushed its beak aside and its feathers away revealing smooth brown skin beneath it became very like the man not fearsome at all the man relaxed i know not who i am i know that i hunger and thirst the raven opened his hand the flesh of his palm melted and ran and formed beads which darkened to berries the man took them and ate with the sweep of an arm that was also a wing the raven transformed the sea into a creek running at the base of a snowcapped mountain the raven scooped clay from the bank of the river and molded it lovingly he set two blobs on the earth and waved his feathered arms again two mountain sheep stood inanimate for a few moments then opened their eyes shuddered and ran off to the mountains the raven made everything that lives martins voice whispered behind her ear shapes were flowing from the ravens wing reindeer caribou rabbits the other wing swept out square miles of glossy black shadow and seals and whales and a thousand shapes of fish rained into the ocean the raven was studying the man again in that odd avian manner he molded clay into another manshape with a slightly different symmetry he took long grass from the bank of the stream to cover the new creatures head its eyes opened and it was woman she stretched her hand out for the mans they walked away as they passed over the land it blossomed the streain ran with fish and birds filled the sky eviane snorted at the smell of smoke and was back in the qasgiq martin halfvisible in the smoke was hunched over talking as if to himself the raven gave all sea life into the care of sedna all land life into the hands of her lover torngarsoak when these two are well all creatures are fruitful and multiply and within the murk eviane found herself deep underwater schools of fish streamed past a kneeling eskimo woman with long floating hair and a face not unlike that of snow goose playfully she brushed her hands through a school of fish her hands her fingers were stubs chopped off just below the first knuckle orson was whispering to max pretty typical myth pattern sedna was a beautiful eskimo girl who tried to escape an arranged marriage her father cut off her fingers the joints fell into the ocean became whales seals and so on and yet there was no sense of tragedy or regret in sednas beautiful face her eyes met evianes her lips twitched in a smile eviane was warmed by the beauty smoke swirled land again ice melting green sprouting she watched men multiplying expanding across the land the land filled with children laughing growing mating spreading their villages and hunting lands out beyond the horizon the seas swelled and suddenly eviane was in the prow of a small shallow boat skimming across the waves behind a flashing seal the seal was speared pulled aboard the hunters rattled quick memorized words and for a moment eviane was back underwater and the woman with the stubby fingers cocked her head to hear the voices eviane was on the ice belly flat against the floe as a walrus rose through a hole to take a precious mouthful of air a spear flashed past her viewpoint she ran with her companions beside a river stretching their nets nets heavy with salmon were pulled to land voices were raised in happy song she was surrounded by dancing children in the midst of a communal hall a qasgiq naked bodies bent and twisted to the rhythms of a hundred unfamiliar percussion instruments she stood on the shore and watched a strange and alien vessel approach across the water it was large larger than a whale large enough to hold whales gigantic white billowing wings caught the wind and breathed the thing in toward the land men sprang out hairy men with pale skin as she watched with impossible magical speed they began to build suddenly houses of woodmore wood than her people had ever seenbegan to sprout in tight clusters the new men killed whales and seals until their corpses littered the beach like poisoned ants and when there were no more whales and seals they dug the hills pulling out the yellow metal and when that slackened they drilled into the ground and pumped out thick black fluid the quickly shifting views of white intruders spilling across the land were becoming blurred behind them eviane could see the woman beneath the water the eskimo woman with mutilated hands sedna was sick a pale mass with white veinlike threads a fungus or parasite was spreading through her hair across her cheeks and neck down her shoulders she hunched her shoulders and hid her face in misery the people of the raven watched the destruction of their land she heard martins voice dimly in her mind the people learned the ways of the intruders and forgot their own sedna was ifi with their sins and the raven circling overhead watching his people seduced from the way of their ancestors was not happy the raven was a monstrous black shape diving like a hawk the earths surface tore like paper the raven ripped his way deep into the worlds heart he emerged with claws filled with sticky orangeglowing magma from that he made new shapes children boys and girls who glowed with force whose faces were filled with wisdom and knowledge theyuhhuhthey had no navels eviane watched as the raven swept the magical children into his claws and swooped up up until the entire globe of the earth was a hazy white arc beneath her and her heart was in her throat then the great bird swooped down and left pairs of children around the rim of the arctic circle she saw them swiftly gather together the tribes of the people and teach them to make fire with the fire drill to skin and tan to build houses of wood and stone and ice the old ways sedna showed in double exposure her hair was coming clean her head lifted she sighed she waved a languid stubfingered hand that streamed flocks of seals gone eviane blinked her eyes rousing slowly from the spell the pictures were gone and martin the arctic fox was speaking again the great raven made the new men to teach the old knowledge to our people to give us back the spirit world we had lost he dispersed us around the great circle of ice i came here to this land you call alaska my son is called ahklut and together we were powerful guardians of the old ways for half a century we used the power to help my people then sedna became sick again and ahklut formed other plans other ideas through dreams through chanting he reached our children the children of the children of the raven gathering them from tribes scattered around the ice around the world he formed the cabal the cabal seduced more than half of our children they kept their secrets from their parents and together they worked their magic an ocean of mist boiled away and when it cleared eviane was in a sweat lodge much like martins qasgiq but larger darker eight young men formed a circle around a smoky fire they were naked but for leather pouches slung on thongs around their necks their skins were burnt dark red by the heat perspiration drooled down their faces and slicked their bodies an alien evil sound coursed through the air one she finally recognized as a chorus of low mutterings malignant human voices joined in dark harmony one stood his face was very like martins leaner than a normal eskimo face with indented cheekbones and sunken eyes as if he had not only martins genes but the old shamans suggestion of deep sickness he was shavenheaded the dark eyes squinted in old hatred the corneas looked milky he reached into the pouch that hung from his neck fumbling and for a moment eviane saw a tiny withemd pair of human legs in the pouch and the rounded suggestion of a head then it vanished again and ahklut drew out a bar of chewing tobacco with dark stained teeth ahklut tore an enormous plug from the bar masticated it then spat a long brownish stream into the fire the flames leapt and the smoke became a pillar of fetid dark green masking and noxious the young ones our children martin said they were trying to heal a great wrong but they were impatient they wanted it quick and easy theyve done a dreadful thing the cabal passed the tobacco from hand to hand one at a time every man in the lodge spat tobacco juice into the fire until at last the smoke within the lodge was so deep that she could barely see faces at all ahklut turned picked up a robe and swept it aside the lump beneath glowed faintly blue ahklut picked it upit was heavyswung himself around and set it in the center of the fire sparks sprayed outward firelight masked the blue glow but set the irregular mass gleaming it was polished metal with shattered edges like curved daggers and thick tubing twisted and torn above the fire a huge face looked briefly through the smoke it was part bird part man enough of man to show its astonishment each man reached into the pouch hung around his neck and from it drew a handful of powders and bone fragments with each handful there was a brief flash of a shape that roiled within the smoke and then vanished again like a walrus roffing at the waters surface before disappearing back into the depths here was a monstrous caterpillar a writhing multiarmed abomination smoke churned and became a killer whale with stubby human arms it changed again into the malformed corpse of a fetus pushing its flattened head against its amniotic membrane a dead man clothed against bitter cold face hooded clothing and torso ripped open and empty there were other darker bloodier images higher within the pillar of smoke the birdface showed again its beak opened wide it screamed silently and faded and then the shrill cry of a bird burst through the illusory smokehouse the cabal bellowed in triumph when had they become nine ahklut stepped into the circle set his hands on a mans shoulders and pulled him to his feet eviane saw that the mans arms and anldes were bound he screamed like a bird she saw now the suggestion of a beak in his pointed face quite suddenly the fire was out an angular metal shape gleamed harsh blue within it shapes moved in the dark a shadow occluded the glow and fell into itmanshaped a bound man writhingand he was gone and the blue glow was gone and the firelight was the light of martins qasgiq chapter eight the mission the fire was down to coals and the smoke was thinning some of the refugees began to remember their halfnaked state but there were larger matters to consider martin said we believe that the ravens childrens children tricked their grandfather they piqued his curiosity until he assumed human form to spy upon them they cast their spells upon him then upon the sun the suns death spells the end of your world and the beginning of theirs martin within the smoky dark who spoke what was the metal object that glowed blue that a powerful talisman i traced when i was young the cabal has stolen it it was a fragment of a thing that fell from the sky in canada that was no meteor now eviane recognized the voice of orson sands no it was a machine from russia that fell before i was born talismans gain power from the distance they have traveled i learned that this object had gone round and round the world until whatever held it up stopped working so i sought it out now the cabal is using it to throttle the sun eviane heard herself saying theyll make the whole world into an eskimo world she wondered how she knew cold no crops only the animals wed have to learn her prescient vision ran far ahead of her tongue martin said yes you would have to learn aliklut would teach the white and black and yellow men our ways those who will not learn would starve we have guessed that much we can even guess why they have barred us from tending sedna sedna orson sands broke in shouldnt we know more about sedna ah i forget all who live at the rim of the world know sedna or nuliajuk or the food dish sedna has the care of the sea life that keeps us alive fish and seals and plants and the very core of our lifestyle she is the conscience of all mankind when the sins of men and women take refuge in her hair then sedna becomes sick if the sea dies the land dies and all men starve your people are starving now and will continue to starve until ahklut believes you are few enough what about this torngarsoak kevin asked hes her boyfriend why doesnt he help he is a hunter and roams the land martin said hunters are often gone for months at a time he may not know her plight okay sins its a missionary word hippogryph spoke sharply as if he were questioning a prisoner what do you mean by sins martins lips moved tasting his choice of words abortion is a sin were the eskimos practicing abortion you dont understand yet abortion of a creatures soul is also a sin to kill a whale or a walrus without proper respect this causes sedna pain such sins breed in her scalp and hair and cause her misery then an angakok must visit her and soothe her and comb away the sins sedna cant comb her own hair you know but the new people fixed that you taught the eskimos the old ways again right yes arctic fox said bitterly sedna was growing healthy then she grew sick again our children they didnt understand how could they we had no answers either we prayed to the raven we tended sedna but ahkluts secret cabal had a quicker answer now their magic prevents us from reaching sedna at all we left the cabal alone some of us thought their way might be right what freezing the world orson was shrill disbelieving how would that help anyone they hoped to end the sins by forcing you to learn our ways we couldnt fight them they are too powerful and they had the skyfall talisman but then ahklut demanded snow goose for his own to take his sister in marriage would give him children who were closer to the blood of the raven they would found a new tribe and rule the world i refused his forces clashed with mine ahklut used white mans guns from the other side of the circle i was not prepared for that my foolishness has killed what remained of our warriors max sand leaned forward hands on knees how can we help martins voice was grave we have already sent out warriors our children beyond the veil of seelumkadchluk and none have returned you are young and strongand ahklut will not expect to find white men in the world of spirits perhaps you can succeed where we have repeatedly failed we can do some of what needs doing but we cannot do all sedna must be tended but we can no longer reach her with our minds ahklut has imprisoned the raven and we must learn how and whether he can be freed martins eyes were on the fire and he seemed reluctant to speak did he have a plan or was he only reaching out in desperation there is your tribe a d my tribe he said one tribe must spy on the cabal one must tend sedna remove the parasites before famine takes all of the people of the white lands and half of us too which would you have hippogryph spoke what does tending sedna involve you would have to travel to her in the flesh through the realm of spirit go to her in her home beneath the sea soothe her comb the parasites from her hair learn from her why she is sick if she will speak if she knows fighting the cabal sounds like more fun max sands said evianes voice dripped daggers fun it has to be done but killing people isnt entertainment max his mouth dropped open but he didnt speak he remembered the tar pits game and the careful singleminded way eviane had gone after the key she was a gamer hed heard of the type she had donned her persona like a second skinlike a body condomand it wouldnt come off until the game was over hippogryph was speaking we dont know enough weve learned as much as were going to here havent we martin your skills have reached as far as they can unfortunately true id say lets find out what sedna knows before we tackle the cabal she might know where the raven went max shook his head butcant we follow ahklut he could take us right to the raven free the raven hell kick ass weve got guns do guns work in the spirit world martin of course why would a tool stop working vote bowles cried hands up for sedna hippogryph and five others raised hands orsons pudgy face was lined in concentration and his hand went up to make seven hands to follow ahklut maxs and evianes hands shot up and charlenes and three others bowles had abstained and so had trianna they would go to sedna underwater claustrophobia and sea monsters the sober roundfaced men and women around the sweat lodge nodded their heads as if at a prearranged signal they rattled segments of bone sealhide drums whittledivory percussion instruments strange musical devices that produced a flow of sound like nothing in the modern world rattling lilting now strident now coaxing but always seething with urgency you martin said pointing to each of the refugees in turn you who are young must go and right this terrible wrong what happened to your own men max asked softly martins eyes dropped they crossed the veil of seelumkadchluk where the sky meets the sea some went to sedna and some followed the cabal the most powerful of our angakoks carried the most powerful of our talismans none have returned we do not know why kevin clucked punching something into a little handheld keyboard this bodes not well martin ignored him but your power is greater you may find them as allies on the other side or not eviane looked around at her companions overweight and soft and youthful with the exceptionof robin bowles the man who had saved their lives in san francisco but they looked inspired could a dozen chubby but game neophytes match the unknown powers of these renegade ravenspawn the fire had nearly died one by one the old inuit rose and began to dance around the coals the walls of the sweat lodge shuddered with the low chants as they circled their miming at first cryptic and then discernible as hunting and fighting movements an old old man hopped around the fire in a crouch as if perched next to an ice hole awaiting a fish behind him another grandfather cast a spear and another raised an imaginary rifle to his shoulder squeezed the trigger spun and rolled on the floor in simulated deaththroes before springing up and repeating the ritual martin threw a handful of powders onto the fire it flared to new life and threw a ghastly emerald light against the walls a handful of dull green embers floated down were borne up by air currents and then settled down again one by one the old people sat snow goose stood wearing only a thin undergarment that might have been stitched from gut her body under it although zaftig moved with practiced grace evianes hands touched her own body selfconsciously she wanted to move like that she remembered faintly a time when she had the girl writhed beseechingly beckoning to each of them max sands jumped grinning to his feet and began to dance around the fire too close behind snow goose for evianes comfort eviane stood embarrassed in her underwear she gritted her teeth and began to dance moving with the flow of the pipes the rattles and drums even though the musical implements seemed like relics from another earlier time they blended together in surprisingly complex and precise rhythm one at a time the others stood the pilot charlene the guardsman hebert the soldier halfnaked they danced around the fire and as they did eviane felt her body pulse to the music her sense of self of midcentury midamerica began to fade there was no formal ceremony no verbal acknowledgment or speech but she knew that the inuit had accepted them had welcomed the refugees into their family the long shadows played upon the walls and the music the exertion and the swirling smoke began to weave their subtle magic the refugees took their place around the fire twisting and hopping eviane gasped heavily for breath blind to her exhaustion unmindful of her ungainly heaviness lost in the sheer exhilaration of it all for eviane it was total ecstasy the very best that life had offered her in a long long time chapter nine baptized in combat the world was blind with snow as max sands crawled out of the qasgiq the frozen ground was rough on hands and knees other adventurers popped out of the tunnel to sprawl gracelessly on the snow the sun was a pale disk daubed in watercolors upon a paler sky tiny flakes of ice flurried like flower petals driven by the wind max stretched his back he was cramped and sore a ragged chorus of barks split the air and a dog sled appeared around the curve of the lodge driven by an old woman the six dogs pulling the sled described a semicircle slowed to a crawl and stopped the sled carried one sootstained crate from the plane and an additional pile of equipment bowles and the guardsman went to the sled the guardsman opened a sheathed knife and went to work on the crate a slat creaked in protest then pulled loose with a long thin whine yeah max hefted out one of the rifles checked its action longforgotten rotc training flashed to mindthen passed it to orson the rifles were relayed hand to hand like fire brigade buckets when the last weapon had been distributed the national guardsman balanced a gun in one big fist then brandished it overhead is there anyone who doesnt know how to use one of these some of the refugees paused then raised uncertain hands all right these are remington thirtycaliber gasoperated semiautomatic carbines max sidled over to eviane ready to lend assistance she didnt need any as the guardsman called out instructions she worked with manic intensity with a mixture of dread and fascination that was almost alarming to watch during a pause in the instructions she relaxed and then looked up at max through max as if he wasnt there at all the bullets in her hand were blanks and she was not his enemy but there was something in her eyes something in the way she gripped the gun that made him feel queasy we dont know what were heading into but we do know that its dangerous we dont want to lose any of our own there were sober nods of agreement from the others but eviane stared fixedly ahead her eyes on the snowblown horizon or beyond damn she was really into this had she gamed before in the real games once her hands closed around the rifle she didnt seem to want to release it her reluctance created a neat topological puzzle as she tried to pull on her backpack need a little help there max volunteered why dont you let me hold that she clutched the rifle defensively for a moment he watched her face tighten and then reluctantly relax yes thank you very much she handed him her rjfle she shrugged into her pack bent and fastened on her snowshoes check me will you nothing looks broken from here maybe a closer look he ran a finger along her shoulder a smile struggled with her businesslike expression won for a moment then fluttered nervously and died youre nice she said shyly i hope we make it out of this stick with me kid he said giving it his best bogart im strong enough for both of us she took the rifle twirled heeltoe and was gone he knew he was pushing it bulky flirtatious helpful max sands some women seek a nonthreatening man he could usually tell but he couldnt tell with eviane maybe she didnt know herself he could switch out of that harmless mode he could do a jekyllhyde and become mr mountain but he didnt want to god he was tired of mr mountain and his lavender leotards distantly he heard a playful announcer singing about purple mountains majesty with a little help from dream parks magic he just might retire that role forever snow goose knelt by the lead dogs to hug a muscular light gray husky with reddish highlights in his fur they nuzzled each other like old friends max hunkered down next to her scratched the back of the dogs neck peered out toward the horizon the weather was clearing a bit but a curtain of snow rolled across the horizon reminding him of an arizona dust storm snow goose said this is takuka the red bear hail bear red bear sniffed at max found him mildly unobjectionable and then turned back to adoring snow goose she said he and otter are our last lead dogs all of the others just ciphered disappeared lost as if on cue red bear whined disconsolately well get em back well get everyone back she nodded silently then stood most of the gear had been tightly packed onto the sled then bound with tarps and oilskins antibiotics coils of thin line hardweather gear food the dogs came to attention shuffling and whining at snow goose impatiently as if awaiting a signal martin the arctic fox emerged from the qasgiq tunnel old age and despair seemed to have filled his joints with rust his neck virtually creaked as he scanned them he pulled a bag out after him he pulled out a fistful of little leather pouches on leather thongs hang around your necks he said you are angakoks now again he reached into the bag these are things of power he said he pressed a birds foot into maxs hand max took it grimacing owl claw give strong fists he gave a withered caribous ear to bowles who smiled and bowed make you quick of hearing he pulled a crumpled skin from the bag opened it to show that it was crusted with black soot and gave it to kevin for strength soot is stronger than fire for charlene he had a swatch of white fur sealskin hide you kevin whipped out his little computer and entered the new information soberly he moved along the gamers until the bag was empty then martin spoke to them all you from the hot countries are our final hope if you cannot prevail all is lost i trust the gods will grant you victory seek the thunderbirds only they can take you to the underworld snow goose hugged her father captain grant took his place at the sled and cracked his whip once the sled began to move the huskies snapped the reins taut straining against the inertia of the sled slowly it began to slide across the field toward a blank windwhipped horizon some of the adventurers were puffing but none were falling back max was easily able to keep pace with the sled staying abreast of snow goose he asked whats next she smiled enigmatically were off for seelumkadchluk where the sky meets the sea daddy did a number for us opened the path he peered out across the snow it was as desolate as a salt flat and not much more inviting i dont see anything special you will okay then what i still dont quite understand what were supposed to do the wind was a faint consistent howl around them hippogryph and charlene dula crunched through the snow to walk next to her daddy told you most of what i know somebody whacked sedna out and we have to undo it whacked her out orson puffed as he quickwalked up next to them you talk funny for an eskimo did you expect grunts and clicks i have a masters in cultural anthro from alaska state u nome she cracked the whip again humanely high above the backs of the trotting huskies that was before all of this began orson seemed a little embarrassed but max jumped into the gap cultural anthro id think youd be somebodys class project id love to read your thesis it does make you kind of splitbrained to grow up hearing all about the spirits and the raven and then go off to school when they talked about eskimo lore in the books they might as well be talking about the great pumpkin im not sure where i really stood i mean id seen some stuff that would weird anyone out but the books explained everything away made it all sound so reasonable anyway when everything came apart it was time to choose sides and quick daddy thinks that im the best choice to help you guys survive she paused reflecting rephrase im the only choice youve kind of run out of options you know max was enchanted orson puffed i think i know whats wrong with your dad yeah hes sick snow goose said thoughtfully and poor ahklut he went completely wacko some of the first genera tion the ravens children they look like that something wrong with the way they were made maybe no huff max i remembered something her dad said that talismanpuffwas a sateffite that fell on canada in the eighties okay why if its the one im thinking aboutpuffit had a nuclear plant aboard if martin and akhlut are both suffering from radiation poisoning damn good orson maybe thats where magic comes from snow goose considered a powerful talisman is one that has traveled a long way when i was just a cub i saw a swiss army knife that had been carried from quebec swapped over and over guy traded it for a bear fur and six cases of beer long nights plenty of time to party heh orson puffed that skyfall talisman went round and round the earth hundreds of times puff huff so we find the lady sedna what do we do then or is that a secret we have to comb her hair that doesnt sound very difficult well sedna is a very choosy lady it has to be done just right great orson called back along the line hey is there a beautician in the house max turned to look and that sweeping glance revealed something he hadnt noticed before the vista which had stretched out endlessly only minutes before was all beginning to change he said the sun looks a little bit brighter i dont get it why would the sun be brighter now the sky had cleared too the snow had subsided to flurries max was sweating in his fur parka and there were no buttons looks like the snows letting up orson said so we comb sednas hair then what snow goose examined orson with amusement you know youll probably be a lot happier if you think a little bit less about what happens later and check out whats happening now this isnt exactly safe and if you dont stay on top of it youre going to end up the worlds pinkest popsicle the dogs trotted heartily onward crunching the snow underneath the treads a faint cawing sound grew swiftly louder max whipped his head up as a flock of geese arced across the sky barely a stones throw away he quickly counted a dozen birds and there might have been more bra nta canadensis snow goose smiled sadly tuutangayak my canadian namesake i used to love them almost extinct now my brother she paused swallowed ahklut taught me all about the animals that was a long time ago orson saw an opening and went for it hes about thirty years older than you just about daddys had three wives that hell cop to the birds swept south and disappeared into a bank of clouds snow goose followed them with a wistful gaze it was remarkably easy to get into the spirit of it to play to the hidden cameras max laid a sympathetic hand on her shoulder well fix things dont worry worry for yourselfits your world on the chopping block the pilot cracked the whip picking up the pace slightly behind him the refugees had begun to huff the snowshoes crunclfed step after step rasping as the snow became thinner underfoot max stared at his feet and then at snow goose in astonishment dirt i saw dirt i was starting to think id never see dirt again check behind your ears orson hissed the dog sled dragged across the brown patches slowed by friction as the snow began to recede snow goose reached down flipped the sled blades up and replaced them with wheels the cart wheels bumped against what he could now see was a rude path that they had followed under the snow the first small plants were twisting their way up through the permafrost cracking their way through delicate rivulets of ice max plucked one up rubbed a tiny leaf between two fingers and chewed it as he walked along the sun was warmer and brighter now and he reveled in it he had taken that golden disk for granted as most people did and as it blazed anew an indefinable depression lifted from his spirits he dropped back until he was shoulder to shoulder with eviane her eyes were slitted and she was watching everything around her like a nervous tiger something in her gaze resurrected unanswered questions do you know anything about all of this that youre not telling picked up on a clue or something youre so quiet that i cant help but think that youve got a little hint for old max her answering smile was quizzical clue im just trying to survive like the rest of us i still get the feeling that i should stick with you does that make any sense she moved a halfstep away you dont mind do you ah great he started to something writhed against his back as if a sizable snake had slipped down his shirt his shoulders arched and he bellowed he reached back clawing for the alien thing attaching itself to his shoulder blades hooked claws reaching for his heart fangs gnashing for his spine something hard and cool moved in his grip he pulled it around in front ready for the worst horror imaginable ready for anything but what he saw my rifle it wiggled in his hands moving as if it had become a living thing he held it out from himself watching with awed fascination the rifle was barely recognizable and still stretching narrowing taking on a new configuration under his very hands the barrel elongated sharpened the front sight flattened and the bore closed flattened into a triangular shape the framework butt had closed into a tube the remington had become a long barbed harpoon max suddenly noticed the growing sounds of dismay behind him the entire group was chattering excitedly watching each others rifles change into spears and clubs hippogryphs rifle was now an older gun a flintlock a brightly glowing object appeared on the ground in front of him hippogryph scooped it up delighted looks like a magical powder horn in almost as magical a transformation the group which had been somewhat subdued and quiet was suddenly in the air whooping their approval do you believe in maaagic kevin sang and his skinny body pranced and twirled like a crazed scarecrow trianna caught one of his hands and swung him around once when his feet brushed the ground she set him afoot and composed herself in improbable dignity kevins ears were red and he stared at her even after she turned away hmmm to max it looked like well young lust at least suddenly max noticed evianes expression and the remington that she still held in her hands evianes weapon remained a rifle for the moment before her face went quite neutral shed looked griefstricken bereaved several rifles remained unchanged why the spirits must be preparing some but not all for situations where spears or clubs would be needed instead shoot a seal with a rifle and it slips back into the water a tethered harpoon might be more appropriate then again would some unnamed ghastly rather face a primitive spear than a rifle if so then their fighting efficiency had just been cut almost in half that thought having crossed his mind max sobered up and kept his eyes open they kept moving the national guardsman was watching running back and forth along the line almost like a rottweiler on extreme alert his rifle had transformed and he looked so absurd carrying a war club at port arms that it was all max could do to keep from laughing out loud maybe because of the increased wannth or perhaps because of the pace of their trek max was beginning to feel out of breath he would have been embarrassed to ask for a halt and in all his life he had never needed to he simply waited snow goose orson gasped very predictably anyone for gods sake take a break snow goose ignored him for a while her eyes on the horizon finally she said daddy said theres a frozen lake up ahead warm as it is this side of seelumkadchluk it might not be frozen anymore but that just makes it better for us the snow was receding and max could see hills now and splotches of brown and grassgreen spreading an arctic hare its blotches of pale brown conspicuous against this new backdrop poked its head at them curiously its ears twitched and it sprinted across the hill fatigue was a dull leaden throbbing now balanced by a growing awareness of hunger he hadnt really realized how starved he was at the end of this trek there would be a break with fresh water and food he scanned the sled as it slid along its wheels furrowing the icy ground what was in those packages tinned meat tinned cake hmmm army rations had been a joke since hannibal but max loved the pound cake in army surplus survival kits he hoped that there was an envelope of that in there was it likely in this crowd thin broth a lettuce leaf six spaghetti noodles with no sauce bet on it theyd told him the fat ripper didnt exactly starve the weight off run it off that they might do but no beer no cake he murmured and trianna said in tune with the flow of his thoughts no lasagna or steak diane or noodles romanoff and as for the crepes suzette forget it my very thoughts her laugh was musical without projecting it this woman had more sexual amperage than the other three combined she was holding it leashed max was getting no direct signals playing menus in my head is an old game she sighed its more fun than thinking about how tired i am she was too pretty not to give it a try do you play any other games she gave him a playful chuck with her elbow and dropped further back in line birds called somewhere although the horizon was still clear no waitthere at the edge of the sky he saw a few dark shapes coming closer until for a glorious few seconds the entire sky was filled with birds a gigantic flock that divided the sky with wing and call the clouds were more golden and a wider gray moving slowly across the sky the sun was burning higher and brighter hotter almost as bright as a normal sun nice he was falling into dream park reality it was becoming easy to distract himself with the teeming sky the chunky ponchowearing adventurers and rifles twisted into bizarre variants of spears and clubs it was easy to slip into the dream and believe that they were on their way to a great adventure and ignore orsons whimpering would a real adventure be this tiring worse dream park went easy on the fat rippers the path twisted up the low rise of a hill his ankle turned on the gravel he slipped and almost fell but caught his balance and straightened up again with evianes hand on his elbow he looked at her and she looked away quickly but the moment of contact was blistering there another distraction from hunger amazing he walked a little behind her and wondered when they were going to get a break a nice hourlong break and a chance to sit with eviane and schmooze he liked her without knowing exactly why mystery woman nothing like curling up with a good mystery at the top of the hillock they looked down on a shallow valley and a lake the air was so warm now that some of the garners were taking off their jackets red bear seemed overjoyed that the sled was pulling itself now and ran arfing toward the distant lake the garners broke into a run the lake swelled up in their sight surrounded by reeds and tall grass before they went too many more steps grant stopped them wait somethings wrong here orson wasnt the only one who groaned but kevin ran up puffing to the front of the sled freckled face burning with curiosity something like what his nose twitched as he scanned the lake ahead he puffed out his chest and glanced sideways at tnanna i can feel something wrong i dont know how snow goose knelt down took a closer look at the ground something scary big has moved through here and recently the group gathered at the lip of the hill gazing down as the wind blew thinly around them yeah the ground had a roiled look but wouldnt melting and refreezing frost do that snow goose chewed on her lip then shook her head the waters of the lake reflected the sun choppy windblown swells rolling up to lap at the shallows and the reeds oh nuts grant said finally maybe im just being paranoid the surface of the lake erupted and fifteen tons of madness intruded on their world it burst up spouting whistling like a blue and white nuke missile it hung in the air an impossible moment a thousand gallons of water raining from its back with a roar that shook the earth it slammed back into the lake maxs mind worked at mach speed trying to correlate this is a joke this is a freakin joke you dont find orcas in lakes f chrissakes water splashed away from the immense blue and white mass the killer whale lunged again but forward the thud shook the earth the whale had beached itself with motions reminiscent of a legless armless man crawling toward a hated enemy the whale pulled itself out of the water and humped up onto dry land wait there were arms a gnarled pair of treetrunksized human arms projected from the body of the beast fingers as thick as thighs gouged furrows in the ground as it lifted its head and bellowed in rage jesus christ grant screamed and tumbled off his sled as it slid down almost into the orcas mouth the sled dogs howled their terror they tried to run in different directions the reins held them in place the creature was on red bear and otter in a moment grinning and deadly its rows of lethal teeth gleaming the refugees were scattered across the slope as the beast finished making puppy chow out of the huskies eviane had her gun up and firing faster than anyone else blood and water sprayed from the beasts hide shucking his paralysis grant yelled dammit fire at will he dropped to one knee and began placing careful shots into the whale as it made a bloody mess of the last of the pilots huskies it noticed him it came straight at the pilot with dreadful unanticipated speed humping across the ground on its stubby grotesquely muscled human arms captain grant stood his ground those who still had rifles began to fire and more red splotches opened up on the whales flank it twitched but didnt slow hippogryph was running toward it zigzagging his flintlock would only have one bullet then the whale had reached the pilot thirty times his size with a mouthful of razors grant shrieked as the teeth closed on him ripped him into pieces and swallowed him in an eternity that couldnt have lasted more than six seconds the guns were useless snow goose pulled at maxs arm harpoon use your harpoon he had almost forgotten that he held it if rifles didnt work why would a harpoon because its magic you idiot he hefted the twisted spear and tried to find a balance what had he ever done that could prepare him for this pitch softball throw darts maybe the beasts next action ended his hesitancy it reared about managed somehow to give the impression of turning a neck that wasnt there and heaved itself directly at him max let fly as the creature came within singlelunge distance the spear impacted in the dome of its head instead of charging the creature screamed in palpable agony it flinched back the other refugees howled their encouragement and let fly with their weapons spears and war clubs sailed true and barbed the monsters hide until it ran with blood as it turned broadside hippogryph fired pointblank the beast shuddered and howled its misery spraying black fluid from its spouthole it fled for the safety of its lake it rolled once in an attempt to rake the spears from its body weapons came free clattering to the ground covered in whale blood the spears and spiked clubs baptized in combat glowed with power they sparkled green and red colors arcing from weapon to weapon like tame auroras the land whale smashed back into the water a huge wave expanded outward when it subsided the creature was gone red boiled to the surface and lissipated and left the water clear quietly at first they walked dazedly over the site of the combat and gathered up the weapons max found his harpoon in the rubble and hoisted it it seemed different somehow it tingled to the touch and the white glow crawled down the length of the spear and onto his arm the tingling grew more intense bowles was the first to scream in triumph lifting his war club to the sky his voice was drowned in a dozen others we did it orson cried he brandished a glowing spear longer than maxs harpoon with a smaller flatter head i dont get it snow goose said orson looked around irritated snow goose was a guide she was supposed to get it now what that was a land whale we should be dead now all we had were daddys talismans and they were the leftovers the weakest of the lot why arent we she paused puzzling darkly orson grinned weve got our own talismans when you said that a good talisman gets its magic fromwup they were dancing falling the land shuddered and roared max was on his hands and knees but he saw the earth split and a shaggy writhing wormlike shape rise questing into the light not twelve feet away snow gooses face paled she murmured now just a damn then changed her mind and screamed kogukhpuk max stalked it spear held ready the snake wasnt big no more than three meters were showing pythons came larger than that then the wormshape trumpeted with pachydermic fury the ground roared and crumbled above a great shaggy skull the creature heaved the ground up and away with such ease that it seemed capable of shouldering the very heavens aside tiny eyes glared the rest of it climbed free of the earth twelve feet tall and twenty feet long shaggy brownish fur almost draping the ground worn and cracked tusks curling up and around like the bow of a sousaphone a mammoth a goddamned mammoth but was all that the guardsman had time to say and then it was on him and and past it shuddered as if in agony twitching and throwing its head back and forth trumpeting it ignored the guardsman and went straight for eviane she was firing steadily at the last instant she turned to run the beast reared up and landed on her with both front feet she disappeared in a thundering avalanche of dust and was just gone for two or three seconds the mammoth stood like a stopmotion model and shimmied max could almost hear gears hum but max was in motion running to get past the great shield of its head then screaming as he hurled his harpoon into its side behind the short ribs aimed at the heart the spear went through it sailed out the other side and clattered audibly to the ground the mammoth flickered back and forth as if incapable of making up its mind other adventurers were attacking bowles whacked effortlessly through its leg with a war club and suddenly it was in motion again it flailed at bowles with its trunk then with blood streaming from a dozen wounds it crumpled to the ground and lay sagging like a halfempty rag doll max looked at snow goose and her face was dropjawed silly the guardsman looked the same what in the hell the mammoth sagged further it was dissolving within a minute it had become dust and bones then nothing but dust the torn ground around it healed until there was no trace that something singular had happened and where eviane had stood there was no blood no clothing nothing but flattened earth as if she had never existed at all oh shit rocks snow goose said blanching shes dead what shes dead i snow goose looked up bewildered at twentysix pairs of bewildered eyes she said the burrowing mammoth has claimed her for his own ttonight we mourn the formal words sounded utterly alien in her mouth she seemed uncertain of her next word or move i i guess we can camp here we ran it off we should be safe now with equal uncertainty the others shucked their packs max distinctly heard the guardsman mutter well if that dont beat all before their eyes met the guardsman was an actor wasnt he but the consternation in his face was real as for max it was as if the fates or dream park had promised him eviane and then reneged he prepared to make camp what else could he do but something had happened even if he couldnt figure out precisely what was it an accident or a glitch in the programming or more goddamn clues for once the guides seemed more shaken than the gamers chapter ten ive had dates like you pins of fire leavened the darkness that one much brighter than the rest had to be the sun there was little else to catch the eye but here was a tiny twiniding point there another there a tumbling snowball marked with black fissures alex griffins video wall was open to the realm of the protocomets weird skirling music floated in and out low in the background a tiny voice spoke of billions of iceballs a few kilometers in diameter spaced as far apart as earth and sun growing sparser yet as the sun dwindled aft compared to the inner solar system the oort cloud was nearly as empty as interstellar space the view zoomed in on a world banded in black and dull reds nested in a wide ring nemesis a giant planet in a wide eccentric orbit whose mass periodically hurled flurries of comets into the inner solar system nemesis was impure fiction there was reason to think there might be a nemesis a world too distant to have been found by probes or telescopes the oort cloud presentation must have been infinitely more impressive in gaming a this morning even so the illusion was so deep and complete that alex felt as if he and millicent were sitting sideways above a pit it surely had millicents attention her hands moved like independent entities bringing lobster to her mouth while comets buzzed her in the video wall he enjoyed watching her like that in profile he saw african and spanish and english in her features a recipe that brewed an almost irresistible meld of earthiness and intelligence she was just what he needed to salve the days frustrations but even if the doctor had prescribed her the nurse still had to agree to the treatment words from the screen caught his attention probes will be driven by solar sails powered by tremendous lasers stationed on earths moon that bothered me he said millicent looked at him why i eavesdropped on our guests they werent saying anything but i saw their faces some of the arabs and brazilians they dont care about the comets or mars they want those terrawatt lasers if a terrormonger could get control of one of those he could fry tebran or sгo paulo before earth could launch a ship not your department millicent said anyway i cant picture a terrormonger with enough schooling to run one dont kid yourself a lot of them are sending their kids off to college mit cambridge intelligence and fanaticism live in two overlapping worlds life isnt a sliding scale where you have singleminded fanatics on one end and intelligent people on the other some of us can be very singleminded about things which are purely emotional she said weve been moving asteroids for thirty years and no ones heaved one at us yet no thirty years right sixteen asteroids and three more on their way with falling angel crews thats not many one asteroid strike can ruin your whole day brrr youre rather grim tonight arent you definitely the wrong mood he reached across the table to squeeze her wrist which took some care because she was holding a forkful of scalloped potatoes sorry all work and no play makes jack et cetera millicent smiled no play at all thats my alex if i dont invite the occasional young beautiful account executive to my humble abode id never find surcease of sorrow he put on his sincerest expression one of the burdens of power is that communications can beep me twentyfive hours a day one of the advantages of a loyal staff is that theyve promised me the night off if its humanly possible she sipped at her wine peering at him over the edge of the glass her eyes were alight with mischief we can hope cant we does that mean yes he interpreted it as a good strong maybe and decided to back off softpedal and make another approach in a minute or two millicent sensed the mood change flowed with it she cracked open a lobster claw with sudden force hows marty doing hes keeping up he looks like the point man in a zimbabwe expedition theyve got him carrying a flintlock for christs sake oh alex sometimes its so easy for me to get lost in the accounts and the computers that i guess i just miss security a lot more craziness yeah but you have a lot more talent than we could hold back im glad you made it out she sighed and martys still playing games thats marty well im glad you recommended me it would have been criminal not to he found himself feeling slightly warmish she lowered her eyes and began pushing potatoes around the plate doodling her fork with great intensity which smile was that blossoming ah alex brrrrrng id hoped he said theyd keep that thing off until eight tomorrow millicents smile broadened no rest for the wicked ive been on duty for twenty hours straight millicent im plagued with these things called griffins nasty little nocturnal animals that only come out at night they usually brrrnnggmanage to wake up just about the time that my mating cycle is running riot i remember sex why back in naughtsix brrrrng alex the beeper aye aye griffin telephone the comets vanished replaced by the smooth round face of dwight welles twentyfouryearold dwight welles was senior computer tech for all of dream park a man whose fourposter at cowles modular saw him far less than his cot at research and development whats up dwight griff we got a problem here more arab madness tell me alex somebodys messed with my program for the fimbulwinter game i know i got all of the bugs out of it hold it hold it hold it tell me what happened first somebody got killed out of the game drown me what how suddenly he felt very foolish sorry killed out right my heart will return to normal presently he thought for a minute i thought none of the garners got killed out of fat rippers not for the first two days definite glitch a glitch hmmm it wasnt charlene dula was it or marty then it wasnt really a security matter so dont you leave room for random random events sure we leave room for random events but you dont understand it wasnt one of those freak things it wasnt an accident a monster came up out of sequence we call it a burrowing mammoth according to legend they die on contact with air this one lived long enough to target and kill a gamer it shouldnt have been possible the thing hunted her i want to know whos been tampering with my friggin program the other line was beeping now and millicent was suddenly all business alex should i no no wait dwight welless voice muted as the second line flashed to life the screen divided into two and on the other side was dr vail he see med tight tired agitated mr griffin something unusual has happened here im on it somebody has gotten killed out of the game hah if that was all the problem is that the gamer who was killed out is coming apart id be a little pissed myself vail shook his head watch the screen split again the new entry was a chunky redheaded woman her gaze was all daggers as she studied first vail and then a slender japanese nurse i dont know why or how you did this but i know this is a trick she said griffin recoiled from the raw hatred in her voice tell ahklut hell get nothing from me do you understand nothing you have warmth here and food people are starving by the millions and its your doing ahklut miss rivers vails recorded tones were carefully soothing the fimbulwinter game is just that a game there was an accident and you were killed out now we are prepared to refund her face twisted with anger and for a moment griffin heard martial music in the air he looked for insanity but saw only righteous wrath in that moment she was beautiful a valkyrie a leopard protecting her young you call the death of civilization a game you call the slaughter of millions an accident you wait my people will come for me theyll come she paused and her next words were delivered with lethal calm unless i get you first the recorded image froze and then the realtime vail returned alex was on his feet ill be right down there he clicked that part of the screen off dwight are you there im here im coming right in no wait first pipe the records in on the office com line i want to see what happened to this rivers then ill come he looked at mifficent damn im so sorry about dinner ive eaten it gruff oh yeah you want to go home or come with can i come with sounds like old times glad to have you got a bad feeling about this he beeped for a shuttle and one was waiting at the rail by the time his side door hissed shut the hatch lifted and he and millicent scooted in the pressure of her thigh against his was more comforting than stimulating his mind was already on the job ahead cowles modular community dwindling behind the shuttle looked to alex like a spreading clump of young mushrooms irregular eccentric but very organic the people who worked for dream park had a lot of respect for the environment for the way things fit together for elegance something about this action the way michelle rivers had been yanked unceremoniously from the game was jarringly inelegant by the time that the modular community had faded into the distance millicent had collected her thoughts ah if its not a glitch and welles seems certain that its not a glitch then what is it a glitch people who say that they have all the bugs usually havent turned over enough rocks what do you think i think you sound like a man trying to convince himself the shuttle sank into the labyrinth beneath the largest entertainment complex in the world and kept sinking three stories deep there hidden beneath the surface were the concrete steel and plastic guts of the park no one mind knew all of the thousands of turnings the hundreds of miles of tunnels here were the transportation systems sewage systems food networks walkways slideways the routes for cars trucks transports the monorails the conduits that kept the water and electricity flowing the people moving here were millions of feet of superconducting wire steel pipe pvc tubing and fiber optic cable as they slid along in the shuttle passing through the center of the labyrinth endless connecting corridors stretching off in all directions like krell tunnels dream park felt more myth than reality who was to say that there werent trolls in those tunnels demons in those depths perhaps the real illusion of dream park was the pretense of technology the shuttle eased to a stop they hopped out and took three steps to the elevator the sealed tube rose swiftly to the seventh floor of the security building his office was a stormstruck anthill cary mcgivvon met him at the door with a stack of printouts their initial security file on michelle rivers the flat photo showed intensely red hair around a pale heavily freckled face very plump with high cheekbones under the padding the girl was trying to look angry or competent or dangerous she was none of those really to griffins eye she seemed depressingly young and plain wasnt she with ambassador arbenzs niece christno wonder weve got so little on her cary sniffed charlene dula sneaked her buddy in on a diplomatic pass we didnt match her michelle rivers name with anything in our files computer just assumed she was a firsttimer great alex said but everyone in the game went through psych why the hell didnt they catch this looney tune she was short one look would tell anyone this was no old friend from the lowgravity places this was someone the ambassadors niece had met on earth maybe a terrorists plant and theyd want to examine her brain no answers yet cary seemed almost defensive it just happened griff sony cary honest she got through me somehow too that damned diplomatic override he slammed his hand down on the desk hard enough to scatter papers why the hell didnt we catch her she has a real social security number she was clean shed worked as a clerical assistant in montana spent some time in a hospital in utah applied for credit with nipponamericard she cleared her throat uncomfortably its starting to look like some of her previous history might have been falsified cary brightened we matched her fingerprints though fingerprints millicent asked you always try fingerprints just because its easy but its not supposed to work does she have a police record no she has no record at all but shes been here before we had trouble with her under the name michelle sturgeon alexs ears perked up what kind of trouble damned if i know its in a sealed file havent been able to find the access code who sealed it harmony did you get in touch with him he hasnt answered his beep griff play it for me again the death scene cary punched her console and the wall disappeared griffin saw the mammoth rise from the earth the attack heard the screaming felt his own adrenaline pump he saw the flicker as the monster stalked and killed the redhead hate to meet that glitch in the dark dr vail said just behind him vail was sipping at a cup of coffee the aroma was heavenly alex took odd satisfaction that vail didnt look quite so damned hearty at eleven at night glad you made it doe yeah i dont believe it either its worse cary said glumly we have an actor stranded in the game whats going on in there stranded right the monster did stalk her its obvious was it supposed to stalk somebody else because yes yarnall the national guardsman later tonight now hes in there with no script mr griffin hes a recovering alcoholic hes in there as an actor but it was supposed to be therapy too this game were watching the actors as well as the garners vail said maybe we can work on a players head better if he thinks he knows the script its worth a try and were trying it this run what are the other garners doing i mean right now eating vail said in an ordinary game this would be their down time their rest and meal time because this is a fat ripper were using this to program the game is still live its just a different phase show me the garners were all sitting around eating and it was a queer spectacle indeed reminiscent of nothing if not the banquet sequence at the end of through the lookingglass the food on their plates was alive it was smiling at them occasionally talking back to them some garners seemed to have adjusted others had pushed their plates aside appetite vanished the computer was coding and recognizing the players so that their names and id numbers appeared below their images yarnall was quiet he seemed to be uneasy restless and griffin could understand why he should have been home by now on the other hand salarywise he was probably on golden time marty and charlene dula were sharing a flattopped rock for a table they seemed companionable enough but didnt have much to say to each other a hefty guy named max sands looked uncomfortable too he kept casting eyes at one of the dream park temporary actors gwen ryder norliss an actress in the game she was garbed as an eskimo and she was sitting next to a warrior with the same last name a husband sands would be suffering from thwarted lust griffin could sympathize he keyed in the audio orson sands the thing is were carrying gear from falling angel the frames in some of our backpacks the medicines thishe hefted a spool of thin linethat eviane was carrying its all magical its all been run around the world enough times to make the cabal sick with envy gwen ryder thats wonderful but dont underestimate the cabal kevin titus was the skinniest one out there alex winced at the sharpness of cheekbones under tightly stretched skin bonethin fingers leafed through a somewhat dogeared folder did you see this my dossier has changed it read different this morning someone said youre crazy but there was a brief flurry of files and yelps of amusement as the garners discovered that the print in every file had miraculously changed kevin brayed victoriously switched mine talks about pewitu taboos i cant kill a seal until its on the land he pulled a handheld computer from an inner pocket started onefinger typing on it sounds easy enough he said distractedly what about you trianna there was a lot of energy in that glance trianna didnt seem to notice my friendlyghost assistant is named kaspar clerk from oregon white died in nome in shot i mustnt eat eggs but i can eat the birds after they hatch yucko if we follow these taboos do you think we can win she was looking at johnny welsh but kevin answered why not we kicked their butts first time we saw em well do it again he tucked his computer away max but did eviane break a taboo or something i dont understand why it went after her like that as he talked max cut into what looked like a swordfish steak and it squealed on his plate a face formed in the grain of the steak and said will you please pay attention to me try not to talk so much while youre eating do you have any idea how irritating it is to be eaten by somebody who doesnt pay any attention to you johnny welsh cocked an eyebrow at maxs plate ive had dates like you tnanna hit him in the side of the head with a balled napkin max glared at his swordfish now listen we had a fight you lost thats no excuse for rudeness i died to keep you alive and one day you will die to feed my ancestors think about it mister alice pudding pudding alice remove the pudding the campfire conversation began to chill vail chuckled maliciously a perfect example it is unconscious and emotional ingestion of food drugs alcohol whatever for other than conscious motivations that gets people most deeply in trouble the more respectful attention you pay to your body and the things you put in it the less likely you are to abuse it thats really interesting but not what i need alex wished vail would stop waving his coffee around the smell was driving him nuts then again dream parks mad psychiatrist might be ghoulish enough to do it deliberately studying griffins conditioned responses alex gritted his teeth and punched in martys silent code knowing that a steady vibratory trill would alert the security man hippogryph waited a few seconds and then got up and moved away from the others he walked toward where a line of scrubby bushes shaped a crescent moon but he turned aside before he reached it the curve of the hill hid him when he took out his communications kit marty what happened out there with this eviane woman she was stomped by a ghastly griff we just lost somebody its no big thing marty you dont get it no one is supposed to be killed out of a fat ripper beat what this isnt a game for points you read the material this is a game to teach people lessons why should she get killed out she didnt make a mistake later on youll have opportunities to get killed out if you make a mistake but not now what point would there be i all right i see the logic i suppose this is a secret you bet we dont want everybody knowing we have a problem marty must have heard the impatience in his voice im slow catching up boss they rap me half to death in truth marty looked exhausted it would not do to forget that others besides alex griffin might be having problems how are you marty are you going to get through this we warriors will carry out our duty griffin besides the worst part must be over have you been watching griff he hadnt but marty would surely expect him to a little that scene in the sauna the smokehouse most of us are overweight griff and we all look like it with our clothes off and i looked just like them i felt so fat any sign of trouble aside from terminal embarrassment i mean no nobodys trying to off ambassador arbenzs niece far as i can tell gruff its hard to tell whats funny in this environment i should have been told that we cant be killed out i wasnt told till this morning i might have told you and then youd have been too relaxed youll be too relaxed unless you watch yourself so how did it happen to eviane the one thing that i do know is that evianeher real name is michelle sturgeonwas in dream park before and her file has been sealed well who sealed it harmony im going to have to take it up with him i dont know whats going on maybe harmony kicked her out of the game i dont think so he wouldnt have interfered without talking to me even so its awfully queer and clumsy clumsy so what are you going to do with her griffin looked at the picture of michelle sturgeon smiling and happy in the file contrasted it with the pudgier angrier woman who had challenged vail and his nurse unless get you first id better talk to harmony he said finally i guess its time i did just exactly that chapter eleven high finance for twentyseven minutes harmony had ignored his personal pager cary mcgivvon looked at alex expectantly her fingers floating above the red button on her keyboard should i try the priority override no even harmony has a personal life i tell you what he moved around behind her hands resting lightly on her shoulders give me a mqvement scan tell me the last time his personal code passed one of the checkpoints lets be sure hes still inside the park she ran the scan there was a brief flicker of schematics and the outline of the entire structure of dream park appeared in the wall a sixteenhundredacre rotating pie studded with towers and arcs the skeletal outlines of roller coasters and dropshafts the single long loop of the gravity whip the facades of thousands of rides exhibits experiences shops stages minihotels restaurants tram and train stations security and information kiosks and more street vendors than anyone could count code colors red blue green and finally executive silver flashed thirtyseven hundred and twelve personal checkpoints flashed negative his beeper is still in his office griff hes inside the grid alex liked this less by the moment well why in the world wouldnt he answer the page an unpleasant suspicion niggled at the back of his mind get his medivac channel get a complete scan milicent jumped chief ah griff thats personal space cary nodded i dont have clearance for that alex fished a flat clearplastic card out of his wallet i do override it all right she slipped alexs card into a narrow slot on her console and waited a moment as the wall began to fill with alphanumerics well pulse rate is ninetyeight its erratic blood pressure high skin temperature low hes very agitated griff somethings wrong cary had discreetly omitted mention of harmonys alcohol level it was skyhigh alex drummed thick fingers on the desk all right dont go to priority override i want to keep this personal until i find out whats going on around here millicent raised an eyebrow i think id better stay here i think youre right harmonys office was in the dark tower the tallest building in the communications and research complex thadeus had been booted up there eight years ago when alex was brought in after a short stint at cowles seattle and a longer service in military intelligence considering harmonys importance one might have expected his office door to be larger the vestibule more ostentatious it could easily have been the entrance to a secretarial pool the scan system showed that harmony was still in his private quarters just off his office clearly he didnt want to be disturbed just as clearly there was no way alex could honor his wish all dream park executives and personnel above class were on duty twentyfour hours a day excluding specific vacation time get above class and even that was no protection harmony had accepted the whole bill when he accepted promotion not that he was given a choice in cowles as in most major corporations it was up or out harmony still didnt answer the buzzer alex didnt want to make a stink with the central computer so he used his priority override card passed it through the electric scan answered the vocal scans impertinent questions and waited as the door decided whether or not to slide open for him it slid it was terribly hot in the office the wall furnace had been turned up to near max harmony was in one of his overstuffed chairs sitting with his hands wrapped around a glass his blunt features were heavy and slack alex he said his normally mellifluous tones slurred the slurring blurred the line between amusement and irritation are you going to stand there or are you going to come in and pour yourself a drink well im still on duty youre not on duty nobodys on duty goddamit i aiii well get off duty i need to talk to you harmony raised his voice until it shook the room im not talking to anyone whos on goddamned duty you want to talk to me get off your fucking duty alex moved to the compact wet bar and mixed himself a scotch and soda weak but not quite weak enough to be a token he sat down opposite harmony and waited watching as the gas flames painted shifting patterns across the vast expanse of his friends face for all the heat harmonys eyes were cold black pits the telephone rang and rang harmony didnt answer it they wont even let you forget his voice was unspeakably tired they rub your nose in shit you eat it for them and they wont even let you brush your teeth harmony looked at him and said alex youve had good times and bad times i know you didnt like sending that mcwhirter kid to prison well ive been able to do some things for him there anyone who can break through my security system is someone i want on my side hell hes turned chino into a career college when he gets out next year hes got a job waiting for him i still work with him sometimes yeah thats okay i had to do worse than that i had to turn my back on murder i knew who the son of a bitch was and in the end i had to turn around and smile at him smile at him the corners of harmonys mouth tugged up hard alex supposed that the result had to be called a smile but in the firelight it looked like something peeled off a jackolantem thats the worst thing in the whole world his next drink emptied the glass he turned it upside down shook it the whole mess started about two years before you came alex in or so wed had problems around here some real problems at dream park wed been so damned successful that wed had psychosclerosis hardening of the attitudes our creative arteries were blocked with administrative fat hell we had it made everybody loved dream park we were so damned good and what was bad was we knew it so we made some bad mistakes a couple of ninetymilliondollar movies bombed we tried to push through that dream park coproduction deal in the mediterranean remember that synthetic island hell we lost a quarter billion dollars in three years we couldnt even get the idiots out of here because half of them were related to old man cowles well to say we were cash poor would be like calling australia an island in the pacific i see alex said not seeing at all alex watched harmony study his glass and decide that he really really didnt want another just now this was all happening at the same time that an interesting new theory was evolving in the surgeon generals psychological services office it really started with the development of the show scan system back in the s the system that old doug trumbull created superfast film projection enough frames flashing per second that your brain cant tell whats real and what isnt the big problem was not only were the images as real as real but they were also bigger than life a hot medium griffin offered struggling to remember an ancient college lecture twentiethcentury television was a cool medium because the images were smaller than you bingo when cowles industries introduced interactive holography hot went supernova they called it reality distortion the papers called it dream park syndrome confusion nervous exhaustion memory disorders the whole lot too many people dont realize that dream park techs can make it look even realer than they do were afraid to afraid of overloading people two thousand years of civilization does not undo a million years of genetics rumor has it that the original haunted mansion at old disneyland was so realistic that people were fainting and vomiting story probably grew in the telling maybe harmony took a pull at his drink the upshot of all of this is that there was a slight but unnerving downward stock market trend for cowles industries as the price dropped somebody out there was buying it up now at the same time cowles management was being raided by corporate headhunters hitting us hard made jivaros look like altar boys kind of odd that all of this was happening at the same time harmony smiled sarcastically yes isnt it it was not in the immortal words of bartholomew cubbins something that had just happened to happen and was not very likely to happen again it was a massively well financed utterly ruthless takeover bid wasnt even that hard to figure out who our saudi arabian friend fekesh kareem fekesh the very one funded by oil backed by the same radical assholes who tried to blow up a space shuttle forty years ago hes built an empire like few in the twentyfirst century he thrives on destabilizationof people organizations countries hell he doesnt give a shit about opec or allah or anything well once we knew what was at stake we were able to kind of circle the wagons act with a little common sense and foresight then it happenedthe one thing wed always been afraid of it was in the first run of the fimbuiwinter game he paused noting alexs take oh yes the same game thats playing right now in gaming b drastically altered of course a real gun got in there people got shot oh shit how badly two down one badly injured but recovered one got nailed square in the hooter dead before he hit the ground alex drained his glass and headed back to the bar he was going to need some help with this one we moved the garners out and sealed the area game ended the woman who actually pulled the trigger was shattered emotionally arrangements were made with her father he rubbed his thumb and forefinger together indicating money he was a real winnerdidnt give a damn about her thought she wasfrom venus anyway all that sci fi drove her nuts we threw in some mumbojumbo about dream park syndrome coughed up a generous annuity and he never peeped harmonys face was so dark alex could barely read it we sent her to brigham young theyre the best i wanted to keep track of her but the doctors didnt want us meddling i prayed shed come out of it she was so frail alex for years ive watched the faces come in and out of this place and ive seen the portfolios on the century club the people who have been here more than a hundred times she was just a poor lost thing alex harmony stood throwing out his arms for emphasis this was realer than real alex bigger than life it was her refuge from a world that had no room for magic a family that didnt care we let her down then we buried her for a long time harmony was silent and alex thought he was finished but then he began to speak again we never found out how the gun got in alex said it was an inside job wasnt it it had to be everything was perfect someone knew exactly how to get through the holes i hate to think about that we cleaned up security afterward more complacency there shouldnt have been holes still no outsider could have done it harmony stood next to the fire the flames and shadows laying his body with a shifting mask of black and red ive had eight goddamned years to sit here and think about it every time i deal with someone who worked here in i think about it why do you think i had you brought in from up north in why do you think i went right over good people damned good people like bobbick and promoted you why because i didnt know who to trust do you know how that makes me feel i sit here and i eat with these people and i play with them their children ive watched some of their kids grow up i know most of them love what were building here that they believe in what arthur cowles dreamed all those years ago and one of them is a killer one of those wonderful wackos at r d one of the gaming staff what would you bribe em with for christs sake what could you give em that they havent already got but somebody did somebody got to em somebody gave em something we couldnt give and so i work here because i love it but all the time i work here all the time i do i look at the faces alex i look at the faces and i wonder which one which one alex let harmony wind down waited for the great body to relax before he spoke again so what happened thadeus oh the whole thing was hushed up the kid who died calvin izumi was out of r d he was only there because he had the right facial characteristics for the game lucky calvin calvin his brother tom and his mother were all rabid for dream park they had their lives their money everything wrapped up here drowned if they were going to let some goddamned terrorists get away with this they helped us hush it up we bought off the coroner alex i hope you dont want me to pretty it up we greased palms we made it look like a hunting accident we covered up murder we had to itd have knocked our stock through the floor there were about twelve of us who knew everything that had happened twelve of us with blood on our hands four have retired i dont know how they handle it we dont talk much anymore and you think fekesh fekesh i know it in my guts and cant prove a thing when the barsoom project came along they told me to just forget the whole thing you know close my eyes and think of england and like a good little monkey i did griffin waited to see if harmony was going to add anything else the only sound in the room was the slow crackle of the fireplace then he threw his ace onto the table and watched his friend carefully was this womans name michelle sturgeon harmony turned snakequick his gunmetal eyes were level and cold how did you know that shes back thadeus griffin smiled do you believe in providence shes come back to dream park and at the same time as the man who destroyed her what are the odds of that weve been making miracles for everyone else for so long maybe were in line for a little one ourselves harmony leaned forward his eyes were intense his thick fingers templed against each other trembled shes come back and fekesh knows it somebody kicked her out of our replay of the fimbulwinter game almost destroyed her mind griffin had seen piranha with more kindly inviting smiles lovely timing dont you think the bastard who originally seeded that rifle into the game must be fudging his shorts poor girls mind must be like a scrambled egg but maybe she still knows something well or somebodys afraid she knows something you know we won but we lost fekesh lost but he won missed his takeover bid by four votes but the bastard bought his stock low and made his profit when cowles won the design bid for the transcontinental subway didnt lose a dime how can you be so sure about fekesh when you follow the money back through all the filters and all the fronts after it changed hands through all the brokers it went right back in his lap alex rolled his glass in his hands you could follow the money and that would tell you the truth all right but it was nothing that could be proved in court even if fekesh had been a us citizen even if there had been a reported crime shit what a tangle harmony was looking more peaceful his shoulders were more relaxed and his voice less strained damn well should be hes dumped it all onto you boyo i grew up in the corporate world we bent a lot of rules sometimes broke rules but it was a structured world the world worked because of structure and you know sometimes in the back of my head i always hoped youd fix it alex i brought you in from the outside you grew up in a different tradition where the world was a little more real i was hoping that you could trace this all down help me make sense of it maybe im asking for too much alex maybe its all been dead for too long but ive got to hope alex thought for a long time he sat watching the fire he thought about all of the people all of the time all of the factors there would be few leads to follow nothing to prove but if there wasnt something why would the unknown traitor have tipped his hand by trying to kill michelle sturgeon out of the game that didnt make any sense either there had to be something and if there was it still had to be found maybe if the griffin stirred things up a little all right thadeus i know my move good what i dont know what else to do its not fair to anyone involved but it might work it might work small or it might work big the girl is the key eviane this michelle sturgeon somebody wanted her out of the game hah ill put her back in harmony sat heavily his eyes glittered in the firelight you cant do that shes emotionally unstable its against the rules alex grinned mirthlessly thats where youre wrong thats where our traitors made a big mistake there arent any rules thadeus there arent any rules at all chapter twelve breakfast eggs warm in the foillfoam sandwich of her sleeping bag gwen rolled onto her side and pressed herself back against ollie her sigh of satisfaction quite appropriately sounded much like an oldfashioned kettle venting steam exhausted surrounded by berserk gamers and mad actors she and ollie had managed to attain a little madness of their own sly very sly he had been wiggling up behind her for warmth hehheh then came the stealthy linking of the bags and much suppressed giggling and jouncing about while the gamers around them slept or pretended to sleep franldy my dears she didnt give a damn the air was warm the dome above them covered with fluffy dream park clouds she snuck a peek at her watch eight oclock unfortunate not enough time to get in a quicky with ollie fair enough it was the long slowies she liked best anyway there was a crackling sound behind her gwen craned her head and saw trianna standing just beyond the circle of heatreflective cocoons dressed in some kind of pink leotard going through a slow dancelike stretch routine with surprising grace for so bulky a woman trianna torqued and twisted her body a joint at a time working out the morning kinks behind her stretched a jagged misty whitecapped stand of irongray mountains the object of the days exercise a low criniding sound from behind caught her attention francis hebert dark face soft with fascination was watching trianna she was lovely gwen conceded there was a woman of tremendous sensuality hiding in that lumpy body every twist and turn was a scream to be touched kevin and hebert were both interested what did trianna want hebert had much the better body arrrgh the voice was right behind her she rolled over and got up on her elbows amused as johnny welsh fought toward consciousness mother he moaned what has become of your little boy the crackle of his foam and foil sleeping envelope was enough to rouse robin bowles who sat up suddenly not yet completely awake bowles looked around with eyes that seemed still focused on the last dream his gray beard was ragged his hair mussed and he wore a ridiculous pair of red and black flannel pajamas for all of that he carried himself with immense dignity bowless wandering eyes fell on welsh and the flickering smile which had raised feminine pulses for three decades curled his lips well jonathan are you determined to subject us to another litany of woe welsh smiled sheepishly oh dont pay any attention to me you may rely upon it i know i need this i saw the tapes from my last concert those closeups were the worst i had more chins than the taiwan telephone directory jeez max sands hoisted himself up on an elbow its too early for this shit all around the campsite the garners were stirring to life gwen reached down into her sleeping bag found the torn remnants of her body stocking and slipped it on jumpsuit on top of that and then she reached around until she found her costume pulled it down inside the bag and began to dress she felt pretty good about the fimbuiwinter game so far the group had started pulling as a unit by the end of the first day and judging by her mildly urgent hunger the dream park magicians had been up to their standard tricks in the night usually she wanted crescent rolls oatmeal with cream and sugar eggs sausage and biscuits for breakfast for some reason all she wanted right now was fresh fruit and she wanted answers and didnt have them the national guardsman was a few feet away he had slept in a makeshift bag formed out of two emergency thermal blankets he was sitting crosslegged glaring out at the world his name was yarnail and the problem was that he had no game personality at all like the pilot and copilot and stewardess his part was over he was to have been killed out trailing his sleeping bag like a snake half out of its skin yarnall wiggled over to the center of the campsite breakfast had magically appeared during the night small mercies he muttered he was in his late thirties a lightskinned black man with a goodhumored face that made it difficult to take his grumbling seriously i cant believe this screwup still gets to ya huh kevin titus stood and stretched the bones of his ribcage like barrel bands under his skin he was startlingly thin and pale just relax and enjoy it whatcha makin now time and a haff double time so whats your beef im tired i thought i was going to sleep in a bed last night i want a scotch and water if i cant have that leave out the water worst of all i aint got no script join the crowd kevin said yawning when they fix the screwup the first thing theyll try to do is kill you out the longer you can keep em from doing that the more money you make yarnall thought about that for a minute by by the implementors if they give me a direct order to throw myself in front of a spear i suppose ill have to do it he raised his voice until it was almost a shout of course since it wasnt my fault maybe the gods will give me a fighting chance to stay in the game he waited and stared up at the sky and then shrugged good thought though the clouds above them shimmered and twisted themselves into a fleecy cheshire cat grin a thunderous reverberation rolled across the space of gaming b are you a gambling man mr yarnall bet your ass who speaks subdeity welles kindly restrain your language there are cherubim listening as you must know i have a discretionary budget i would be willing to bet you say triple time against zip that i can kill you out before the end of the day without bending any rules what do you say yarnall realized that he suddenly had an audience gwen was fascinatedyou could hear the gears churning in his head no cheating gods dont need to cheat we know what fools you mortals be if i lose you forfeit yesterdays salary yarnall looked around him all of the garners were awake now gazing up at that ethereal grin waiting for the national guardsmans answer he slapped his leg all right welles you son of a bitch youre on the cloudsmile transmuted into a tenfoot hand and snaked down from the heavens it hovered just above yarnall and then the actor reached up and shook it the garners broke into cheers as the hand dissolved and yamall looked around sheepishly johnny welsh was in stitches tears rolling down his face he slapped yarnall on the back lets see em top that in vegas ollies arms came around gwen from behind gave her a little squeeze good morning lets get going he whispered all right she called fortyfive minutes to game time mens showers in the gully womens in that stand of trees breakfast is on the table hurry up people we have a big day today yarnall still stood silently staring up at the dissipating clouds gwen was overwhelmed with admiration welles had taken a bad situation and turned it into a day at the circus belatedly she wondered if she could have gotten the same deal they had been on the march for an hour and now max sands could make out more detail on the mountains ahead he and his brother orson walked abreast and to maxs satisfaction orson was humming softly kevin titus had been looking at him oddly since breakfast as if trying to place that face and body oh well he could understand that feeling he had been staring at robin bowles memories of countless bmovies flooding through his mind he found it vastly amusing that before bowles got his first major roles he had played lowbudget quickies if memory served him right before the two oscars had come a golden turkey award for his portrayal of abdul alhazred in the musical comedy version of the fungi from yuggoth yamall carried his rifle club at port arms scanning in every direction for trouble he expected something to drop from the sky pop out of the ground materialize from thin air so far nothing had happened too soon max thought welles would wait and wear him down up in the mountains were the nests of the tinmiukpuks or thunderbirds fabulous creatures which snow goose said could take them closer to sedna if they had enough magic to command the creatures snow goose wasnt sure if not they might just as well paint themselves with mustard lie down and be lunch minus eviane there were nine garners and three actors it should have been ten and two by now and even that felt a little sparse how could they run so expensive a game with so few players certainly not on the fees max had been charged though steep they couldnt pay for all of this the actors outnumbered the garners snow goose had explained it to him just after breakfast dream park has most of the bugs out of the program now theyre going to monitor our progress if everything goes as planned home marketing follows theyll sell a cassette see a tougher game your average player would have to run it a dozen times before he gets all the way through they figure that much interactive role playing in a total environment room can affect a major behavior shift sixtythree percent of americans have tes available to them could be a major sideline the slopes had begun to get steeper and his legs ached a little max looked back down the mountain and was surprised they had climbed close to a thousand feet the campsite was far below them looking down he could see the lake and the floor of a gentle valley that swept away to a snowcrested horizon it was difficult to believe that anything ugly could be hiding in this world around them the mountains stretched endlessly and although the going was increasingly steep he found that he enjoyed the effort the breath came harshly in his throat he was sweating he liked the sharp heat of exertion the air was very clean bracing cold enough to make him feel totally awake and alive beside him brother orson was having a harder time of it sweating and gasping but gritting his teeth and gamely humming a tune max listened long enough to pick it up and then started humming along trianna was right behind him her breathing though labored was as evenly paced as his whats that song ah im not sure ask orson orson she called out yes maam what are you humming orson grimaced the ballad of eskimo nell can you sing it for me orson started to blush it i well the truth is that i dont know the words do you max never learned em he said rolling his eyes soulfully i was deprived as a child oh she said dejected orson breathed a sigh of relief when a squeaking voice cried out i know it i know it i might have known kevin now keep it to yourself would you trianna turned and grabbed kevins arm oh come on singing always makes a hike more fun give us a verse maybe the little shits too winded to sing orson hissed hopefully no such luck kevins eyes glowed at triannas contact where are you lets see so deadeye dick and mexican pete dahdedahde dah heinhaleddeeply trying to remember and as they blazed their randy way no man their path withstood and many a bride her husbands pride knew pregnant widowhood de dah de dah thats enough kevin orson commanded no im trying to get to the good stuff kevin i will pitch you off this mountain max looked down and damned if it didnt look like they were halfway up everest the campside lake was barely visible clouds veiled most of the valley diffusing the morning sun into a weak yellow splotch now deadeye dick he bangs em quickhe cast the first aside and made a dart at the second tart when the swing doors opened wide then entered into that hall of sin into that harlots hell walked a lusty maid who was unafraid and her name was eskimo nell orsons ears were getting red kevin kevin me boyo dont do this ill make it worth your while whatja have in mind my next dessert max choked is that all it takes heyanybody ever heard kafoozalem hiho kafoozalem harlot of jerusalem prostitate of illrepute and daughter of a rabbi orsons scream echoed up and down the mountain they heard the sound before they saw anything the group was far above the clouds now and the mountain trail was little more than ribbonwide robin bowles actually lost his footing once he should have fallen but bounced back onto the ledge propelled by he knew not what a hidden net author control they were in the midst of clouds barely able to see more than a few feet nets would make sense the first sound they heard was a tittering scraping sound followed by a dull crack snow goose crept up to the front of the line to where the trail deadended against a ridge of rocks she stealthily climbed up and peered over within moments she returned shuddering i ive never seen anything like it orsons embarrassment evaporated in a flare of curiosity max lets take a look he hefted his mutated spear as if he meant business maybe he did he and francis hebert were the first to the top of the ridge hebert moved like an indian out max puffed as he climbed the last few feet and then gaped at what he saw in a saucershaped stone depression thirty feet across lay a nest a nest for birds the size of rocs the parents were gone and there had been six eggs in the nest two of the eggs had been shattered the chicks within dragged out and brutally hacked apart attackers were at work on a third egg they might have been barrels covered with black hair or obscenely fat fourlimbed spiders their fingernails were immense and crusted with filth and grew out of the fingers like knives stuck on the ends of sausages they chortled as a third thunderbird chick a wet yellowfeathered infant the size of a plump turkey struggled sluggishly for life they tore it to pieces with their fingernails and consumed it raw each of the six monstrosities was larger than a man orson ducked back beneath the ridge of rock his breathing was asthmatically harsh do you know what that is heberts little eyes were wide with excitement yes i know what that is orson said the book calls them mountain trolls flesheaters man we dont want to mess with them i dont remember anything about how to survive an encounter hebert checked the action on his rifle one of the few that hadnt been converted bull we cant let them kill the thunderbird chicks this is our chance to look good to the birds johnny welsh and hippogryph had joined them without peering up over the edge of the basin everyone seemed to know exactly what would have to be all right hebert said are we together on this snow goose gulped yarnall gave the sky a dirty look no cheating he muttered thenlets do it hippogryph and hebert began firing heberts remington was unimpaired by magic but hippogryph had to pause to add powder and shot with every blast from the flintlock the trolls screamed their misshapen barrel bodies shuddering with the shock a monsters flat hideous face dissolved to a smear of red light it fell back twitching but the others charged howling their rage with gibbonlike agility they scampered over the rocks mouths dripping with thunderchick blood and yolk impossibly long arms sweeping out like scythes fear froze him for a moment then max broke free ducked under the sweeping black arms and thrust upward with his harpoon the creature swatted the spear aside and grabbed him by the arm not a hologram its other hand almost lovingly displayed the footlong nails traced them lightly across his neck and then hissed and drew back yarnall the guardsman smashed into it with his war club the troll squealed and released max max hit the ground heart triphammering all around him were scuffles and screaming and the sound of rocks sliding beneath climbing running feet his hands searched until he found the harpoon he grabbed it in the middle and turned as the troll advanced on yarnall screaming he raised the spear it plunged deep into the furred back and for just a moment he wondered if he had seen correctly in other circumstances he would have sworn he saw the head of the spear retract and the flesh around the wound actually close in to grasp the haft ah well the troll gasped in pain blood flowing from its mouth it turned and ran max wrenched his spear from its back as it plunged over the side of the cliff and disappeared into the clouds below max and yarnall slapped hands then whooped and searched for fresh meat there trianna stood her ground firing into an advancing hulk although its blood drizzled onto the rocky ground still it plodded another step forward and another johnny welsh and max got there at the same time max un able to contain his exuberance performed mr mountains avalanche he sprang into the air knees flexing to chest feet hammering out slowing down at the last minute so that his partner wouldnt be hurt oops the monster slammed into the ground and max heard it say ow goddamn as it tried to crawl away johnny welsh was staring at him well ill be mr mountain i watched you wrestle last month against skinhead slade max groaned not so loud ill tell you about it later lets finish this up pleasure nearby a troll was being clubbed and speared into a glowing mess the knifelike projections of its nails scratched blindly at the rock the other trolls were either dead or in retreat the adventurers screamed challenge at them and whooped with bloodthirsty joy we beat em yeah we sure as hell did it orson bellowed at the top of his lungs snow goose was examining the eggs where once there had been six now there were three and one of those had a cracked shell she looked worried whats wrong yarnall asked wiping a smear of troll blood off his club im not sure we should be up here right now before anyone could ask why the sky rang with a scream of primal despair above them two titanic winged creatures circled in the sky they were like eagles only with silver fringes to their golden feathers the sun caught their highlights ignited them gloriously transforming the thunderbirds into flaming avengers they circled twice cawing then plunged straight down at the garners hooked talons spread and gleaming chapter thirteen aerobics the male tinmiukpuk carried a caribou in its outsize claws as it caught sight of the carnage it screamed and released the carcass garners froze as it dropped toward them that mass was carrying enough kinetic energy to kill rambo xii the caribou brushed the edge of the nest and dropped into the mist amid a shower of leafy debris lost before it crashed against the side of the mountain max was frozen as the male approached and swooped down as close as he came it was the female who actually landed first she stalked directly to her babies as her mate circled overhead she nudged one of the broken shells her eyes and body language almost unendurably griefstricken one of the turkeysized feathered corpses was still partially intact she nudged it pushed her great beak against its lifeless mass before giving up and inspecting the other shells the male landed the birds werent as big as houses but certainly twice the size of dray horses the size of small elephants the smaller of them easily sported a twentyfoot wingspan their bodies were goldeneagle bodies tinged with silver for birds they were extraordinarily muscular each clawed footstep each ripple of a wing conveyed a sense of majesty authority power the male studied each of them in turn nobody panic snow goose commanded we might just survive this she turned her head mr welsh give me your charm and no jokes johnny stared then shut his mouth he fumbled in his pack extracted a small carved bird figure max caught only a glimpse of it as it passed from hand to hand but it seemed exquisitely rendered in some dark smooth stone the female approached the male and rubbed her great head against his and they cooed together he silently inspected the nest and intact eggs then returned to nudge at the bodies of the slain monsters he looked up at the gamers with a clear question in those huge black intelligent eyes snow goose stepped forward charm in upraised hand hail to you great warriors of the wind we saved your children from the mountain trolls in return we ask a favor max was aghast the two enormous creatures looked at snow goose as if she were insane their babies lay at their feettheir feet were wet with yolk and bloodand this impertinent tidbit was asking for favors max gripped his harpoon and readied for some fancy footwork take us to the top of the world snow goose demanded only with your help can we enter sednas realm and set right that which has gone awry will you help us the garners drew back as the two birds came nearer and then nearer still until either could have lunged forward and caught a plump screaming human in its softly gleaming talons max shivered as the iale inspected him it cocked its head sideways and stared at max with one huge hypnotically deep black eye gazing into its depth was dizzying but max dared not back down he was spinning spinning and prayed not to fall without knowing why max stretched out one trembling hand the thunderbird watched his hand suspiciously then jerked its head out of reach whatd i do watch your hands smartass orson hissed thunderbirds are not pets in inuit mythology theyre usually the villains whatever snow goose did i hope its strong enough the male threw his head back and the golden feathers around his neck ruffled his scream reverberated to the heavens rang up and down the mountain range like a thunderclap for a moment the adventurers were frozen in their tracks then from far away there came an answering scream of recogrntion johnny welsh coughed nervously i think someone just rejected a collect call on the edge of the horizon looming up now came a quartet of winged figures identical to the first two but even larger the newcomers were older the gold in their feathers more tarnished by time and the elements they carried curious leather appliances in their claws fitted with dangling straps and buckles weve got the grandparents i think orson said nervously they circled then came in for a landing while the younger couple kept an eye on the garners the older thunderbirds examined the evidence they found a spear still lodged in a bloodspattered troll corpse bit and wrenched it out with the toss of a great plumed head one of the thunderbirds carried it over and respectfully laid it before snow goose the others folded their wings and sat in front of the garners heads bowed well ill be dipped hurry snow goose said handing the charm back to johnny we have five birds one will stay to watch over the eggs break into groups of two or three fix the saddles and mount up docilely the great beasts presented themselves as max approached and nervously threw a saddle across the back of the nearest thunderbird hologram must be and yet they expect us to the saddle landed on something solid max reached forward and touched feathers he struggled with his surprise and then subdued it stop trying to figure out when they make the switch hebert and trianna were the handiest with the leather saddles were fastest following snow gooses directions as she helped them buckle and strap the contraptions into place guess theyve had riders before eh hebert puffed snow goose smiled enigmatically so the legends say i assume you mean the birds max and orson nodded to each other then split up orson went with charlene and hippogryph while max got into line in front of trianna and francis hebert he tugged at the saddle anchored just ahead of the giant wings as much as the idea scared him they were really very secure he climbed up onto the waiting back and strapped himself in trianna slid up behind wrapped her arms around his waist her breath warmed his cheek had that sweetandsour excited tang that is irritating from a man but a turnon from a woman and trianna was a lot of woman his belly muscles flexed within her arms feel the hardness without consulting his forebrain his lower body tingled with localized increased circulation ah well his heart yearned for eviane but the rest of him seemed more pragmatic hebert climbed on behind triannaand the three of them he estimated added up to a hefty tonnage he hoped the thunderbirds were as strong as they looked the last gamer had boarded his mount snow goose checked all of the buckles with sober expert care then climbed aboard the lead male it ruffled its feathers and ran at the edge of the bluff without a moments hesitation it dove over and disappeared into the clouds max barely had time to say what when his own mount turned stiffly toward the cliff it took five running steps that reminded him of something out of a disney film on ostriches and dove off he screamed and swore to himself that he would scream all of the way down his stomach contracted as if trying to squeeze his intestines out of his nostrils when he opened his eyes his thunderbird was plunging straight for the bottom and he remembered briefly a quote from twentiethcentury stunt man eve knievel ive gotten to where i can say the lords prayer in ten seconds ourfatherwhoartin the bird eveed up and began to climb and climb up and up and when he looked back he saw the other thunderbirds and their passengers behind and below him sleek black wings beating against a dwindling backdrop of mountains the wind burned his eyes and they began to water the clouds drifted past within a few moments the plateau was a memory he turned around and faced trianna who although strapped onto the saddle still gripped his waist with eyes closed were all right he said when that produced no visible result he nudged her again go ahead open your eyes im afraid of heights he looked down distantly a blue carpet of sparkling sea glimmered through the clouds not the place for an acrophobe better keep em shut then behind her francis hebert was gazing down at the view eyes as wide as a childs in santas toy shop the view was somewhere beyond wonderful after a few minutes the birds curved around and began to head toward a range of mountains so distant that they registered only as wrinkles on a far horizon this was the life the air beating against his face was pleasantly cool the strong steady stroke of the thunderbirds wings was a heartbeat rhythm as soothing as it was exhilarating he began to lose track of time pleasantly mesmerized by the frozen vistas below endless stretches of glacial ice and snowlocked rivers passed from time to time his mount would bank gently and then level out again but on the whole the trip was hypnotically placid hebert was the first to spot trouble max heard the mans shout and followed his pointing finger detected a flock of tiny black dots approaching from the eastern horizon theyve got wings hebert bellowed leaning far out around triannas shoulder more big birds does it look to you like theyre coming right at us could be max said i wish we could ask snow goose max wished he could ask orson the other thunderbirds were lumbering along with slow steady wing strokes but they were too far away for a good shout again he scanned the horizon the other flying creatures were disquietingly close more thunderbirds he doubted it the line of wing and tail on these great golden eagles was a marvel of nature the new figures were somehow misshapen hebert was checking his rifle hope thisll be more use than last time trianna dammitopen your eyes i cant im scared max swore under his breath well then give me your rifle he reached back to try to tug it out of her hands but she hung on like an alligator shit no he looked back again the creatures were only a kilometer away and now he could distinguish them more clearly they seemed a melding of bird and beast he could make out a gigantic misshapen woffs head grafted onto the body of an enormous falcon they werent as large as the thunderbirds but there were nine make that ten of them before he could say or think anything else the creatures swooped to the attack he had a brief glimpse of wolf snout and falcon claw as his mount suddenly folded its wings and dove toward the earth he gripped a handful of feathers for dear life and squeezed his eyes shut sun earth cloud and whitespeckled mountains merged dizzyingly his stomach and the fluid contents therein sloshed every way but out and up his thunderbird swooped and dove careened like a berserk roller coaster striving to evade the two monstrous wolfalcons which had set upon it suddenly and with a speed that left his spine somewhere back at the last loop the thunderbird doubled back on its own trail and caught one of the unholy hybrids the beast screamed but its scream was the scream of a wolf and it was the wolf head which turned and set its teeth into the thunderbirds neck feathers and skin came away as the thunderbird shook its tormentor loose and then savaged it to pieces max peeked around his mounts shoulder saw the wolfalcon fight back then go limp and offer no resistance its ravaged body plummeted toward the ground the second wolfalcon swooped close with the whoosh of wings trianna stithwood finally opened her eyes and her gun almost flew into her hands hysterically she pumped bullets into the creatures face that face exploded with crimson and it flopped away vanishing into a cloud the thunderbird wheeled around and dove back toward its family the eight remaining wolfalcons fought demonically one went straight for the guardsman he ducked and swung his war club futilely then laughed hysterically when a second divebombing was snatched from the air by the vengeful claws of maxs bird hey welles he yelled hands cupped to mouth missed me nyahh nyahh their mounts took terrible damage and the aerobatics continued in dizzying flurries max was no longer sure which way was up at last the final two wolfalcons screamed in frustration the cries were not those of beasts but of menmen rendered inhuman by bloodlust and hate one of the two remaining enemy swooped close before it withdrew from the fray there in its chest max saw the face of a human being embedded among the feathers it was the face of a man who lived to hate fed on hate felt no other human emotion it was quite mad the eyes alight with sufficient loathing to fry maxs marrow then both were gone chapter fourteen the afterlife the girl on the couch was drowsy her head hung from an unsteady neck and her eyes were defocused the tranquilizing tabs vail had placed on the skin over michelle sturgeons carotid artery had done their work the tiny holding room in medical central was adequate for a situation like this but not particularly comfortable vail stared at a computer screen he cleared it summoned up a new batch of data cleared it again griffin rapped the desk impatiently well we could get sued for our lungs and kidneys to hell with that he growled listen for eight years her father took our money and tucked this woman into that hospital in salt lake city then he demanded the rest of the money in a lump sum we gave it to him he blew it and tucked her into a state home in saint paul when minnesota went through a recession last year they let her go thats when she started using the name rivers shes still pardon the expression a loon i dont understand those esoteric medical terms alex im hardly a doctor precisely dr vail alexs voice was deceptively mild lets cooperate with each other shall we we both made mistakes it could be argued that yours was largerunless youd like me to believe a sealed file kept you from reading her rorschach blots to alexs immense satisfaction vail stammered for a beat before composing himself wenh utilize a more complex battery of tests than that i assure you but michelle sturgeon is a classic schizophrenic and she took the test as her eviane personality there were ah no pathological symptoms vails voice wavered griffin almost felt sorry for him but bored in relentlessly oh im sure shes as right as rain now doctor why do you think she came back here dont you think she had a reason she thinks dream park is the medicine she needs i think shes right im not sure you understand the significance dont be patronizing alex said im not in your league but i minored in psychology you tell me if im remembering straight vail narrowed his eyes cautiously all tight shoot were talking selective amnesia and a multiplepersonality disorder brought on by a strong tendency toward dissociation and a high hypnotic responsiveness the doctor sat up straight thatsactually quite perceptive go on alex now bear with me when michelle sturgeon shot three players in a game she subjected herself to massive guilt in essence yes michelle sturgeon sees herself as a murderess even though she was innocent eviane on the other hand is a heroine who only fought to protect her cause michelle is a rabid mouse eviane a lioness she needs to become eviane to live with herself you have about half of it vail said almost reluctantly the question is what is she doing back here she intends to relive that shattering moment do you have any idea how dangerous it would be to put her back into the game dangerous to her shes already pretty screwed up wouldnt you say could it get worse dangerous to us hell we can put a security shield around her we already have marty in the game it wont happen a second time i can guarantee that he leaned very close and consciously flexed the muscles in his chest a big mans trick alex was perfectly willing to use subliminal physical intimidation if it would get him what he wanted and vail this is what it boils down to we dont know whether or not she can identify the killer but the killer cant be sure either thats good enough for me vail thought about it for a long moment if you put it like that i do then it seems there is very little to lose and much to gain dont get cutei know were risking whats left of her sanity i think eviane and michelle would both agree with me and approve of the cause vail tapped his fingers he touched a few more buttons on his computer then crooned to it softly all right i think that i may have an answer when i was in medical school we performed a rather interesting experiment if modified it may suggest a solution the key to it is her susceptibility to hypnosis he looked at griffin face showing the traces of surprise by the wayhow did you figure that its not in her dossier shes a dream park junkie griffin said this whole place is an altered state of consciousness alex paused you mentioned her father what about her mother dead and i think you guessed ither mothers maiden name was eviane rivers michelle sturgeon floated in a tank of water a few degrees cooler than skin temperature hundreds of pounds of epsom salts were dissolved in the water she was as buoyant as a balloon there was no light there was no sound mg of synthetic tranquilizer hypnotic had left her without the urge to do anything but lie here and relax without light without sound without a reference of physical sensation her mind drifted in its cocoon of warmth and her recent troubled sensations died away who was she eviane yes eviane strong powerful who else some part of her was far far away alone and miserable as she should be michelle was bad had done something terrible eviane didnt want to think about that part wait now there were lights in the darkness they sparkled and moved in rhythm across her line of sight they were differing colors jewellike she liked them there was sound a heartbeat sound one that she felt in the water in her body in her chest she was getting not sleepy she was beyond sleepy somehow but still awake her body was sleepy her mind alert at least part of her mind it was confusing everything seemed to be happening so slowly so much had happened in the past hours it seemed like a dream everything was slowing slowing eviane fought to hold on but felt herself swirling down and down into the void into an infinitely deep black hole rimmed with red following the steady pulse of the light the rhythmic beat of the sound the gentle lapping of the warm water down and down and down and dark out of the dark came light she was in a place she knew a beach a place from her past the surf rolled in and she sat in the warm sand watching passively she was warmed and comforted by the touch of the sun and utterly content a man came out of the surf dripping water and foam smiling at her he was a tall man with light red hair his smile made her feel warm he reached out his hands to her they were large and broad had she seen him before could she trust him she wasnt sure but she liked him where was mommy michelle looked for her mother eviane the stern one the protecting one and didnt see her her hand stole nervously into the hand of the stranger and he held it warmly they smiled at each other for a time shared the sun and the warm hissing surf michelle he said youre a very good girl ive heard that from everyone youre a wonderful girl michelle liked hearing that her heart opened to the stranger can you remember all of the times you knew that you were good had done something good were told that you were good she nodded her head good remember those times he paused and a deep wave of warmth and positive feelings swept her he nodded thats right now do you know that sometimes good people can be tricked into doing bad things the beach suddenly wavered the water crashing against the sand became icy and something rose thrashing from the foam look at me he commanded look at me she did as he said breathing steadily slowly the thing in the surf began to dissolve good good she liked the feel of his arms around her and pressed close their heartbeats seemed to merge sometimes good people can be tricked into doing bad things by bad people they try to hurt little girls and then the little girls need their mommies they need eviane and eviane is here to help you whenever you need her but right now i need to talk to michelle she trembled and clung to him and examined his words he held her without judging his arms were strong and his voice soft and he promised that mommy could come back frightened but relaxing into trust she pulled back and gazed into his face yes she said i know will michelle help me yes michelle will help you good thank you the big man with the rough face smiled and touched her nose softly i want you to tell eviane that she is going back to her friends magic will take her back her friends need her they will find her in the land of the dead and then everything will be as it was she will remember nothing once her friends find her michelle nodded without comprehending but listen he added urgently all the time that eviane is with her friends fighting and helping them michelle will hide behind her mommy and watch michelle will learn and when michelle learns what she came here to learn she will find a way to let us know in her own way in her own time but she will let us know will you help us mommy doesnt have to go away no and the big mans arms were warm around her mommy doesnt have to go away he stopped and added but neither does michelle griffin watched as a heavylidded michelle sturgeon was led from the executive total environment room he wiped his brow with a moist shaking hand he hadnt realized what a drain it would be playing out that role vail opened the door and peered at griffin with amusement that was rather well done alex maybe you went into the wrong career i just figured that dream park has something that none of the doctors have what was that we have what she wants a shot at the son of a bitch who screwed her up id say we can ride that rascal all the way home a video window opened in the wall and alex watched michelle sturgeon enter the frame numbly without protest or eagerness michelle slipped back into the isolation tank for additional work say another two hours prep and she should be ready alex have you looked into the game do you know what a tornrait is a ghost a helpful ghost why were going to give michelleexcuse me we can give eviane an excuse for remembering the future vail glanced at his watch you know i could be making more money in private practice alex but goddamn where would i find cases like this write it up alex sighed he sniffed at his collar the epsom salts were still moist upon it mixed in it was another fragrance the scent of a delicate young woman cruelly used and something else something feral chapter fifteen holy smoke maxs thunderbird was wounded its left wing fluttered weakly against the driving wind the great eagle strove to pace itself two strong beats and then a rest gain altitude and then pause into a gentle downward glide they flew through a clear layer between two cloud decks the upper haze layer let the sun through as a brighter disk it was thirty degrees above the horizon of the lower cloud deck though the time must have been about noon they flew above a knobby white landscape so dense that max could see no trace of an earth below suddenly and for the first time he felt the primal fear of falling that clingtomommy hairlessapeinthetreetops fear his thunderbirds beak was open and he could hear the ragged whistling of its breath even above the wind tnanna put her lips to his ear and whispered look and pointed down curiously as his air sickness increased hers had begun to fade a mile below them there was a break in the clouds they could find outlines of a mountain range vast and foreboding all jagged peaks sheathed in impenetrable ice the thunderbird began to glide down making its slow and gentle descent a mist of blood streamed from the wounded right wing the thunderbird was fighting for its life for their lives max felt gratitude and admiration for the creatures repaying their debt in so heroic a fashion the only problem was that he could see no place to land the mountain was all cliffs all bare rock faces at varying angles there might be ledges landing places somewhere below but diving blind through the clouds would be suicide what would the wounded bird do halfhidden by mist was a tiny ledge too narrow narrower than the birds spread wings maxs chest ached with the tortured wheeze of its breathing he felt its triumph of will as gilded wings spread wide it swooped toward the ledge the wings halffoldedhe felt the drop in the pit of his stomachand the birds feet slammed into rock three hopping steps brought it to a halt it looked back at them in its eyes shone a mixture of pride and anger and gratitude max swung himself over and landed heavily on rock offi get off trianna let the beast rest he helped her descend she was heavy and he saw her surprise at the strength in his arms francis hebert descended without help and at once began trying to stretch his back out the other birds came down behind them landing with halffolded wings on the same narrow fogshrouded ledge stiffly the gamers unstrapped themselves from their mounts and tumbled to the ground maxs toes curled hard against the ground and his knees halfbuckled then became firm again his stomach felt a little shaky and he called an old trick into play find a spot on the horizon gaze at it until the dizziness passes he chose the distant pale disk of the sun yellowwhite and wan in the mist he had to squint a little but this worlds sun crippled by magic was such that his eye could meet it squarely even on this side of the magical barrier seelumkadchluk there was something visibly wrong with sols disk a shadow perhaps an enormous sunspot an alien shape that didnt quite belong the clouds thinned for a moment but max held his gaze against the increased glare what in the world his eyes were squeezed tight against tears does anyone have a pair of binoculars kevin titus dismounted just behind snow goose he reached into his backpack he pulled out a leather case he extracted a pair of binoculars with molded plastic handgrips and gave them to max a bit reluctantly be careful with em actually i was planning to heave em off the max aimed and focused squinting hard even through the clouds it was too damned bright but i will be dipped in shit there in the center of a pale wavering disk was the shadowed form of a great black bird the shadows beaked profile turned looked at him he handed the binoculars to his brother orson what do you make of that orson focused the glasses presently he said id say we know where the cabal is hiding the raven wouldnt you there was a general ripple of excitement as news of the discovery spread down the line then max handed the binoculars back he felt pretty damned good they had just solved a major piece of the puzzle snow goose was gazing into the sun i cant believe it how could the cabal get enough power to do something like this what would it take robin bowles asked he walked with an exaggerated bowlegged gait the ride must have left him sore the raven created the world i cant even imagine that much power i just dont know the satellite orson asked hopefully right sure the satellite and they caught the raven while he was in human form she sounded doubtful but afraid weve got to find sedna the five thunderbirds preened and ministered to each other and inspected their wounds from time to time one would glance up at the frail humans who had set them an impossible task the birds seemed so beautiful so terrible but there was a fragility beneath the strength try as he might he couldnt get the image of those shattered eggshells out of his mind human and thunderbird owed each other much max felt fumbletongued but he knew he should speak they let him approach watching him from the depths of those emotionless voidblack eyes max stood close enough to touch but didnt dammit he didnt know when dream park switched from hologram to mechanical and he didnt want to spoil the illusion now for him at this moment these creatures were as real as his companions thank you great ones a low buzzing voice reverberated through his body we have repaid our debt when next we meet beware then the great eagles one at a time spread their wings and veered away the gamers stood silently in the snow watching until the thunderbirds vanished into the clouds snow goose spoke legend says that the entrance is here in the mountains i dont know exactly where a gust of wind blew her straight black hair into her face and she paused to wipe the strand aside were going to form a circle and have a prayer smoke she motioned them down against the mountain wall under a slight overhang where they had a little protection from the weather when they were all seated in a circle she produced a leather pouch from her backpack she undid the thong tie with fingers and teeth and shook a handrolled cigarette out tobacco max was shocked i havent seen tobacco since milan nicotine can save your life snow goose said piously she lit it inhaled deeply and then exhaled in a thin stream that was so white it seemed to glow to my brothers in the north she said brothers of the mind children of the wind guide us help us help us find the doorway to the nether kingdom to the land of the dead to the realm of the allmother she blew a second puff directly into the whistling wind the smoke should have vanished instantly but it didnt it merely drifted as if on the faintest of breezes the south brothers of the heart help me feel my way let your water nurture us and help us in our quest another breath brothers of the east you who are of spirit beings of fire and light open the path show us the way with a final puff she saluted the west brothers of the west children of the earth holders of physical form guardians of the body protect us in our quest the smoke it had not dissipated into the wind although the wind continued to build four tendrils of smoke were drifting haphazardly ignoring the wind snow goose was sliding into a trance ohhh they are near the dead the endless legions of dead are near show us great great evil there is great evil four tendrils of smoke turned and twisted in the wind but would not go where the wind went instead they were beginning to move all in the same direction turning like four blind snakes who have caught a scent they drifted toward the mountain wall one by one they brushed against the gray rock and again and gradually were gone scattered by the wind or absorbed by the rock the mountain began to shudder jesus whats going on orson yelled the snow above them began to tremble snow goose stirring from her trance suddenly screamed up against the wall kevin muttered motherfuckers but he was moving rolling like the other garners snow gooses warning barely came in time the slight rumbling that had alarmed orson abruptly became a thunderous malevolent roar and their entire world turned white as countless tons of snow and displaced rock crashed past them they huddled together tight against the wall somebody down at the other end screamed and max didnt blame him a bit he felt sick to his stomach genuine gutfear hammering at his desperate attempt to remember that it was only a game he closed his eyes tightly and waited after an endless time the ground stopped shaking and max opened his eyes again and could see nothing his reaching hand met a solid layer of snow francis hebert triggered a flashlight the luminescence lit them an eerie yellow in their tomb of ice the overhang was all that had saved them for a long time no one spoke there was the sound of their constricted breathing and the low bass rumble of a distant tremor then even that died away snow goose broke the silence i guess the gods were listening she said calmly and lit another cigarette she exhaled in a long long stream in fact she didnt stop exhaling even after a solid thirty seconds of feathery breath the smoke formed a glowing cocoon around her it lit the interior of their makeshift snow cave so brightly that hebert switched off his flashlight without another word she turned and walked directly at the wall of snow it melted before her the water flowing and fusing into the crystal ice walls of a snow tunnel she almost floated as she walked yesterdays collegegirl persona completely submerged she seemed to be a different person entirely one not wholly of this world all they could do was follow her max looked to orson for advice or comment and orson shook his head the snow tunnel twisted and wound angling steeply into the very heart of the mountain max stretched out a hand to touch the walls they were hard and cold although the air in the tunnel was pleasant ahead of them walked the glowing snow goose carrying herself as might a great lady a princess the mistress of all dark secrets she had stopped puffing on the cigarette but a steady stream of vapor poured from her mouth her nosejesus her eyes and ears continually reforming that glowing cocoon that melted snow and rock ahead of her building a way for the rest of them she stopped canting her head as if to hear phantom music snow goose shuffled a few more steps then halted again at the low end of the audible max heard the rumble and felt it in his bones sudden claustrophobia raged at him were they going to be trapped underground were they no the screaming had a personality it was the roar of something alive something huge they were approaching the gates of hell didnt he expect the inuit equivalent of cerberus orson gripped his spear snow goose can i have one of those cigarettes she nodded and a twitch at the corners of her lips told max that his brother as usual had been dead on the money there was a swift babble of requests as the rest of them followed suit and then swift multiple fires as the sacred cylinders were lit all around max braced himself for the worst and sucked smoke he was surprised for unfiltered handrolled cigarettes these were mild almost like smoking air but luminous smoke poured from his mouth and nose as he exhaled and his harpoon began to glow ahead of him snow goose stopped exhaling smoke against an unyielding wall hebert joined her blew hard against it then slapped at it with the pink palm of his hand whats the matter the ices been protected against magic she said it in one of those matteroffact voices that made you ashamed to have asked such a stupid question how do we get through it we cant stop here the way to sedna lies beyond the underworld snow goose frowned where magic fails perhaps muscle the face of the ice sheet measured eight feet across behind it something flickered dimly a vague sluggish movement max had the impression of something monstrously tall that moved with unnatural vitality it seemed to be balancing on one leg then the shadow was gone and the skin on the back of his neck ceased to creep karate kid kevin said part seventeen exactly snow goose said softly lets put our backs to it max set his cheek against the ice orson and trianna joined him both flinched from the cold go said orson and they heaved the ice might have moved a tenth of an inch charlene moved between orson and max heave nothing she and orson shared a ragged smile whats a nice boy like you doing in a place like this she gasped my brother said lets go for a walk heave max said and they heaved the ice wall might have shifted or not rest let it settle heave kevin consulted his pocket computer then politely moved charlene and orson aside ive got soot he chirped and max has an owl claw that makes us the strongest ones here he leaned against the ice and strained mightily there was no more conversation just the sound of fevered breathing in a confined space as the largest and smallest of the garners bent their backs against eight feet of ice with a long brittle note the first fissure appeared in the wall as it deepened a vast network of tiny cracks turned the entire sheet milky max stepped back he heaved for breath and said hulk smash and ran at the wall the thud must have been audible in gaming a there was a moment in which nothing happened and then the entire barrier shattered almost in slow motion max lurched through a couple of steps skidding on shards before he could stop kevin flexed his arm and made a tiny biceps face positively luminous the air was gray with a dense mist that flowed like an angry ocean churned in the cavernous opening like cold smoke every sound they made every footstep or whisper reverberated like a sneeze in a tomb the mist chilled max to the bone it was a sticky cold the furs and thermalreflective lining of his jacket seemed helpless against it his mind noted trying to make sensible shapes out of that roiling fog it formed and reformed itself into grotesque illusions shadows cast by impossible shapes a suggestion of tremendous jaws a sudden glimpse of a hundred pairs of eyes the bones of a hand brushing across his face as the other adven turers pushed through behind him he felt their unease as an extension of his own welcome to hell he said quietly helping tnanna past a stack of ice chips she looked pained without any stated intention the group formed a circle standing close enough to touch shoulders one could not see the size of it but the moving rivers of fog the echoes all told of a cavern as big as the world max felt the urge to scream to do something to fill the horrid emptiness around him he felt utterly cowed it must be your decision to go ahead snow goose said i dont know how much protection i can offer you yarnall peered out into the mist somewhere on the other side of that shifting veil a vibration sounded it might have been something naturalthe sound of the earth shifting perhaps or the cry of an animal if it was an animal it was a maddened one and the hair on maxs arms stood up and tingled weve gotta go the national guardsman said listen theres something out there we cant go backthe sun is dying and so will we we cant stay where we are the cabal will just send something to get us frankish olivers club raised in agreement lets meet it headon snow goose nodded approvingly we will sing songs for the spirits of those who die unless we all buy it orson reminded her a rainbow of light and happiness you are chapter sixteen the paija the fog swallowed them snow goose seemed sure of her directions there was rarely a choice they followed ridges and smooth rock the path of least resistance where the path forked max glimpsed smoke drifting from snow gooses mouth now they were crossing a land bridge so high up that the floor vanished into the mist and only giant stalagmites rising up like mountains through the clouds told them there was any floor at all they trooped single file and max found himself behind charlene she was limping a glimpse of her profile showed excitement and anticipation and a certain sadness charlene she halfturned with that oddly angular grace she reminded him of a praying mantis she was breathing too hard trying to disguise it behind a game smile do you miss your friend eviane charlene sighed as tall as she was she was losing inches drooping gravity was pulling her down brother orson hung back to listen to the conversation were friends but wed barely met she said wistfully hows that orson asked we met on the gaming channels for maybe a year weve been playing everything we could get into and she kept telling me about dream park id heard of it she said that i had to come tell the truth i wasnt all that hot on it i thought one of the cook islands or maybe greece but i wanted to meet eviane she paused i dont have that many friends so i came and before i could blink eviane was killed doesnt seem fair does it hows your leg she smiled ruefully i thought i was hiding that i can walk it out orson noticeably straightened up if you need help carrying anything let me know her long face softened and her eyes shone gratefully the bridge narrowed up ahead and now walking single file became more critical max knew he shouldnt look down but his eyes wouldnt obey down there in the frozen crawling wastes something lived something watched he knew it maybe not alive maybe dead and damned from up ahead came a repetition of the roaring piercing bass note quake the entire cave shook with it max dropped to his belly set his cheek against the stone of the natural bridge and waited he saw johnny welsh lose his balance drop to his hands and knees and roll toward the edge anyway trianna caught him with one arm helped him shaking to his feet im always falling for blondes he said the mist thickened and thinned in pulses the tremors had not quite died yarnall taking an unsteady lead kept peeking back over his shoulder as if the bunch of them might rabbit at any moment the bridge now measured barely two feet across beneath gaped infinity if you focused your eyes carefully into the depths the mists occasionally parted and the cavern stretched away into endless night it seemed to max that he could see stars down there but it might have been the reflection of strange light on ice crystals he shivered step by careful step they crossed that bridge those two feet of path began to feel like a tightrope snow goose stopped them wait stop now and find your breathing what bowles said cautiously your breathing she placed her hands about an inch below her navel breathe down to here to the center of your body you will find the balance you will need i dont know what youre talking about orson complained center of my body ignore the flesh she insisted feel your way to the center steady your breathing and visualize or you will not survive what i visualize orson whimpered is getting chucked off this bridge and controlling my breathing all the way to the bottom the wind keened sighed mockingly despite his uneasy balance and the strangeness and the fear he felt here on the edge of infinity max searched within himself struggled to see something beneath the layers of clothing the muscle the organs and tissues and down to the bones themselves saw himself as a skeleton standing on a twofoot bridge over the very pit of hell that damned wind whistling hollow through his bones when he found that place curiously he felt warmer more relaxed when he opened his eyes there was less fear her next words touched his ears as from across a gulf now keep your breathing constant and smooth and follow me max chose his steps with care once he stumbled wavered lost his balance but his toe found purchase where there should have been only air the path began to widen the group had just heaved a collective sigh of relief when another terrible scream of rage close and from no discernible direction yarnall moved more quickly trying to get them onto the widened path it was almost six feet across here and they began to walk in twos yarnall and kevin in the front war clubs facing off against the unknown kevin clutched at the bag around his neck as if milking it for strength behind him were orson and snow goose and behind them max and charlene the mist congealed and cleared again and showed him unreality illusion max tried to blink it away it stood twenty feet tall he would have called it a woman because of the pendulous breasts only partially concealed by an eightfoot cascade of flowing black hair but the face was a demons face wild and inhuman with brown teeth like chisels and eyes that closed to slits with each breath the entire wrinkled face expanded and contracted her arms muscular and widespread were tipped with evil hooked nails longer than the head of maxs spear that wasnt the worst not by a bunch the creature had only one leg and that leg came from well from the genitalia what do you call someone with no arms and no legs with a wooden stick up his backside johnny asked quietly that thick obscene leg flexed and the creature stretched down hooked nails curled around a misted stalagmite a quick convulsion of python muscles and the great chunk of rock snapped off in its hand a tenfoot limestone club that coruscated in the darkness like a wet fuse snow goose backed them up paija she said urgently weve gotta go back to where the path is too narrow for her to follow and get ready no argument here max heard yarnall mutter they backed up along the path the paija hissed venomously at them cerberus at the gates of hades your amulets she cried where did i put that max rooted around in his bag until he found his gift from martin the arctic fox an owls claw petrified almost into a knot snow goose took it she took kevins leather pouch and poured a thin stream of black powder into the palm of her hand her round face crinided happily strength soot is stronger than fire i should be carrying ajax cleanser johnny welsh said stronger than soot trianna rubbed his shoulder your bird worked when we needed it johnny he abandoned his scowl and gave her a quick hug each adventurer made his contribution in turn and the little pile grew the womandemon grew tired of waiting she hopped a step closer along the stone bridge the bridge groaned in distress hurry snow goose bit her lip thinking quickly you spoke of the fiber in your backpacks you said it had power perhaps more power than the amulets quickly take them off stack them in a pile yarnall hebert and ollie shucked their backpacks and complied they kept worried eyes on the shething and flapped their arms for balance but moved as quickly as possible the suspense is killing me kevin said to johnny as they shucked backpacks what do you call someone with no arms and no legs with a wooden stick up the backside pop groan hippogryph added his backpack to the pile what is that creature bowles asked good question max said ruminatively looks like something out of saucer sluts meet hercules bowles looked pained please i was a child when i signed the contracts they called it space maidens on olympus sorry about that shh snow goose said urgently its called a paija its a demon but the cabal must have brought it here to guard the entrance this isnt good max whispered why would it be heh yes but they must have more power than daddy thought hurry she took a leather thong from around her neck pulled a tiny goosedoll out of her cleavage she looked around at the others ahh johnny we dont want to deplete your charm lets see oliver frankish oliver ollie stepped forward and she opened the bundle that he wore around his neck and sighed with relief good you also have a winged inua we can lead she hunkered down now the rest of you all of you have spirit selves all of you have both flesh and a spirit form the fleshly form is not strong enough but perhaps our spirit forms could prevail if we can trick it then its magic its life force will be ours to command she took her totem and olivers a hawk carved from some hard black substance i need string and i need something that was part of a sateffite she said charlene handed her a pair of gloves put these on no its for put them on snow goose the inuit maiden shrugged with her eyebrows and pulled the thin gloves over her hands delicately charlene handed her a spool of thread falling angel cable the gloves are made of it too you dont want to touch the cable with anything but the gloves she nodded she wrapped the two totems together with the thread then looped the spool into the bundle as well we need a song she said a sacred song we dont know any max protested noone of yours will do werent you singing one earlier that spoke of our land we must pull our worlds closer together orson groaned kevin smiling and bucktoothed kevin strode forward let me see orson covered his ears as kevin elaborated on his previous theme picking up the adventures of eskimo nell deadeye dick and mexican pete in the midst of the most grueling contest in the annals of song snow goose was all business chanting happily over her little bundle the group chimed along with kevin as the ballad of eskimo nell progressed to its glorious climax now snow goose said her eyes rolled up her lips moved dah dee dah dee dah diddity dee inua of my ancestors we fight to keep your rite inua of my ancestors be at our side this night children of the freezing air come live within me now air spirits come and join in war to shatter ahkluts dream ally with us against an evil folk who would blaspheme set us free of heavy flesh set us free from our illusions set us free the air was humming the bridge beneath their feet vibrated like a plucked guitar string max could feel it in his teeth in his fillings snow goose joined hands with frankish oliver he seemed nervous at first trying to twist his hand out of her grip but she held on as the vibration grew stronger and stronger at last the sound was recognizable as human voices stripped of euphonics and amplified staggeringly it was a chant a ritual chant that was all undertones a sound like a row of giant gongs ringing beneath three feet of oil snow gooses outline was the first to change followed swiftly by frankish olivers they became like fluid metal running together peeling apart and the light expanded until it surrounded the other garners as well bathing them all in a silvery gloriously fluxing incandescence at first max saw only a blurred glow it moved shifted and he understood something intangible was pulling itself free from max a moment later he could see its shape it was himself in a way once after a debilitating stretch of fever he had lost enough weight in his face to see the cheekbones that shaped it and he recognized them now but that perfect idyllic shape turned and gave him a nod smiling as if they shared some great secret max couldnt hear the undertone chanting anymoreit was more like he was a part of it his body one of the notes he turned to the other gamers and was astonished from each of them flowed an ectomorphic form more beautiful than anything they could have aspired to in life the forms rose above them hovered there then joined hands in a circle max stared trying to absorb what he was seeing the cave once the very heart of darkness glowed with a light which was not of man or of mans doing it was a holy light a miniature aurora borealis a light which flowed from within the floating flaming figures the floating spirit of snow goose rotated slowly in the air her face a calm oval now she said we go the spirit forms ranged ahead max felt his spear humming with power and clutched it tightly it felt warm the stone bridge they traversed was as narrow and as frighteningly high over an unfathomable pit as it had been before but there was something else something new had entered the equation it was a sense of possibilities the paija stood waiting for them it was gigantic bestially beautiful profane beyond his imaginings balancing on that single obscene leg like something spawned in a tijuana freak show its single leg was more like the trunk of an elephant boneless flexible it weaved from side to side like some kind of topheavy cobra beckoning them onward to death for a moment the tableau was complete and still max faded back a little watching the others saw frankish oliver gripping his war club as if it connected him to the spirit image floating above his head the paija sniffed at the air her thick bovine nose wrinkling as if scenting something distasteful she gripped her stalagmite club and screamed defiantly and smashed it down on the bridge the span of rock danced savagely dust and rock rained from the invisible ceiling kevin fell to his knees and had to be helped up by bowles for a moment a twist of genuine fear crossed that freckled face then bravado won out and he was strong and brave once again the paija opened its mouth her mouth and grinned max had never seen so many broken edges in one place it looked like a junkyard for dental cutlery the teeth were set in at odd angles rows and rows of them like sharks teeth the paija attacked onward snow goose yelled and like the fools they were they charged and above them so moved their ethereal doubles with every step they took the floating figures above them seemed to gain power they shone more brightly the paija ceased her raving examined them suspiciously seemed to reconsider max saw triannas spirit fly at the enormous creature like a fairy on speed moving with such grace and agility that the breath froze in his throat quite simply she was beautiful the paija swung at her with its improvised club and she backpedaled doing a kind of breast stroke in the air max snuck a peek at the fleshandblood trianna who was transfixed her lips slightly parted eyes gleaming with excitement the paija couldnt seem to touch her now the other spirit forms flew in and when they linked together that aurora effect was magnified a fluxing electric rainbow blossomed and touched the paija the creature screeched in pain and indignation that these tiny creatures would dare to harm it far from being slowed it charged swinging the club the stalagmite smashed down just short of snow goose who scrambled back and then caught her balance again dont run dont run it will feed on your fear the paija glared at them the forest of black hair shadowing her face grunting it took another step the ethereal figures fluttered above it weaving in and out like a flock of glowing hummingbirds the paija swiped at them with the club handling it like a flyswatter and only the unnatural agility of the spirit forms kept them from oops the paija made contact with orsons image just a glancing blow but maxs brother said ooof and rubbed at his shoulder where a red glowing mark began to grow the paija was beginning to catch the rhythm now charlenes image caught a nasty wallop and charlene cried wha a red stain began to grow on one leg glowing in the dark like some kind of phosphorescent fungus the spirit creatures began to fade join hands snow goose grabbed hebert and hippogryph panting as if with physical exertion max reached out for yarnalls wrist yarnall joined with kevin the twelve adventurers formed a semicircle facing the beast the creature snarled sensing victory the club smashed again on the bridge the paija dropped the entire force of its being into the blow an eightfoot section of rock gave way splintering and crumbling with a roar like the end of worlds max stutterstepped struggling for balance snow goose remained erect but her face was no longer so strong and determined she stared down into the gulf before them the chunks of rock spinning in crazy slow motion into infinity and she was no longer sure the paija grinned at them and leapt over the gap her suctioncup foot gripped the bridge leaving a moist ring where it landed she hopped forward max saw snow goose crumbling and he forced himself to his feet dammit he had to do something and he had to do it now tagteam in a pro wrestling match the audience would see you screaming obscenities but they couldnt hear it didnt matter what you said max stood as tall as he could and he screamed up at the paija monsterrr we challenge you were gonna rip your lips off and make you kiss your own backside not particularly inspired but it got her attention she smiled a smile that said me and you numbnuts in a universal language he hefted his spear and pointed it waiting for magic nothing im dead he thought but the ethereal double was more substantial now brighter he could no longer see through it it was true the paija fed on their fear and their doubles fed on their courage he put on his best drill sergeants voice get up you slackers face this thing off the paija growled at them as if undecided and then max saw his double launch its spirit spear directly between the paijas eyes the monster screamed reared back and clasped its wound the club rose up and thundered down again directly at max here goes nothing max gritted his teeth and kept the spear upraised the club landed to the side deflected by his spear thrust the monster was horribly confused now and in pain the other adventurers joined him joined hands screamed in concert they backed the paija up a short hop and when they gestured aggressively their doubles attacked it was playing possum it sprang back to life and caught hippogryphs double a good lick hippogryph yelped and grabbed his shoulder which began to glow red charlenes double trying to swoop in close for a shot at its eyes caught a grazing blow and went spiraling off to the side almost slamming into a stalagmite before it could catch itself charlenes entire right side went red but slowly surely the paija was driven back they cheered and they screamed and max said what the hell and hurled his spear it caught the creature in the throat the paija staggered backward a hop teetered for balance and fell from the bridge howling it tumbled blindly into the blackness they all moved to the edge to see it fall watch it die maxs double landed in front of him beautiful lean and muscular glowing in that darkness within the earth and it smiled hell he was a hero chapter seventeen butterflies slightly bluefaced gwen exhaled with relief for a few seconds the wail of the wind and the paijas receding deathhowl were the only sounds then the garners behind her were leaping and screeching and clapping each other on the back gwen watched hippogryph with some amusement hippogryph screeched and hippogryph leapt but his face didnt turn toward the sky in triumph his eyes remained at the level his big bouncing body formed an unobtrusive barrier between the others and charlene just as well her legs looked a little unsteady the darkness helped but gwen could never quite believe that the holograms would mask her and ollie well enough to produce the illusion of flight but everything had gone perfectly now the gamers crowded at the lip of the precipice watching the paijas image fall to its death she saw their faces every damned one of them had been moved by the sight of his spirit image they stood straighter walked prouder gwen knew the gimmicks hidden in the game and still she felt the effect she took the time to square herself then dove headfirst into her snow goose routine again all right team way to go that was great orson was vibrating where he stood his considerable mass jiggling and wiggling with delight i feel ready for anything thats whats next charlene surmised she was panting as much from excitement as exertion gwen heard a low beeping tone in her ear and she glanced over at ollie his left hand was covering his ear as he listened to medical reports from central processing with his right hand he signaled her a finger pointing to the ground followed by a horizontal palm slow down it might be that charlenes vital functions picked up and broadcast through mesh underwear had alerted central processing maybe it was the heavier sands brother for all orsons jolly sarcasm ollie thought he looked ripe for a nice juicy cardiac incident so gwens eyes unfocused and her hand closed powerfully on orsons wrist as he was about to speak i hear them she said whispering rolling her eyes the gods they she waited for their attentive silence then squeezed her eyes shut and made a happy pout they are most pleased they say that they will bring us gifts through the darkness at the caves unimaginably distant roof there shone a shaft of golden light it pierced the black and danced palely on the far side of the gap the beam was broken up by a fluttering motion something like fat snowflakes but every flake was a living thing reflecting and adding to the light trianna said it first butterflies exactly right white butterflies they drifted this way and that creasing the light reflecting it questing into the darkness for a moment then returning to coruscate and sparkle anew they landed in a cone prancing and fluttering in heaps and covered the ground as if huddling together for warmth against the winter they crawled over each other in a churning brownian movement any trace of individual identity was submerged in an amoeboid tangle gwen watched the gamers eyes squeezed offies hand in acknowledgment and thanks for his signal then the butterflies took to the air again leaving behind them a huge platter heaped with apples and grapes and pears there was a small mountain of crackers and breads four widemouthed jugs and some miscellaneous cans lunch johnny welsh said reverently my stomach was about to sue me for desertion wait a minute the paija had shattered the stone bridge they looked at lunch across an eightfoot gap kevin asked how do we get to it orson said why dont we just twist you into a rope bridge and walk across haha said johnny welsh humor makes me hungry listen to me gwen said the stone bridge is destroyed but in conquering the paija we have all gained great power you must now have pure intention in order to use it you must truly desire the food they were looking at gwen warily crazy and dangerous believe me honey hebert promised that food and i are going to share a deep spiritual communion do you remember the lessons you learned from the food last night sheepishly trianna raised her hand we need to treat the food like a living thing is that different from the way you usually treat it she hunched her shoulders i remember the lectures dear i love food but its like building blocks to me i can make pretty tasty things out of it the pile of food rustled and a bunch of grapes turned into butterflies and flew away gwen said watch it the food here is very sensitive i pay honor to the inua of the food kevin said perfect id be surprised if he eats at all orson growled did you say something mr sands gwen made her voice deceptively sweet well puzzles orson had to solve puzzles i pledge that if this food will will serve me he paused to hunt for the right words then we will serve the food johnny welsh said solemnly hippogryph blindsided burst into helpless laughter but orson had his lines worked out i will pay honor to it and attention to what i eat and only take into my body what i need for nourishment gwens eyebrows went up cant argue with that max leaned over to bowles and stagewhispered did you pack your hip boots a shaft of light shone down from the heavens directly upon orson step forward orson if that was the truth i think its mealtime i meant it another bunch of grapes started turning white and orson shrieked all right all right give me a minute will you damn he was the picture of frustration he glared menacingly at gwen howd you know the great spirits or maybe a lucky guess you have that kind of face dont i know it all right he forced his shoulders to relax and then shrugged i havent done it until now i was just testing but i will try for this meal at least i promise the butterflies fluttered back into the light settled and transformed back into grapes if you told the truth gwen said step out the great spirit will support you you want me to step out on air no she said piously on faith hehheh orson peered out over the precipice his lips made a wet unhappy sound he took a step feeling out over the gap with his toe the rest of his balance safely held in reserve his foot was balancing on nothing he breathed a sigh of relief and took another step then orson sands was by god doing magic walking on air like gene kelly all he needed was jerry mouse dancing alongside he stopped in the middle of the gap and looked down past his feet down into the depths where the paija had vanished and then back at them with a smile that showed every tooth when he crossed to the other side he salaamed deeply damn near kissed the ground then did a little jigstep which took him over to the food orson prodded a grape with one heavy finger the sun came up behind his eyes its real he plopped down and grabbed handfuls a pear in one hand and a bunch of purple grapes in the other then he set the pear down and began eating grapes one at a time gwen beamed next one at a time they went through the ritual the great spirits seemed to know when they were lying and when they werent gwen savored their bewilderment now that they had enough of a break to realize how long it had been since breakfast hunger was a raging fire the butterflies returned every time a lie was told and gwen called them on it trianna swore she would honor her food but she was lying gwen knew it trianna knew it and most importantly the technicians back in gaming central knew they knew from reading body signs from the mesh underwear blood pressure skin ternperature galvanic skin response heartbeat and respiration rates tears streamed down triannas lovely face her shoulder length blond hair seemed flat and lifeless what do you want from me i love food how can you say i dont how do you think i got this heavy if i didnt do you love it gwen asked soberly or do you use it you hide in your body trianna trianna was so upset that she was actually bawling now what do you want me to say ii shit kevin took her shoulders just slow down and notice your food her eyes raked him they should have raised welts and you you damn skeleton when did you ever notice food you look like nobody ever told you about that part those words had hurt kevin blinked his hollow eyes against the pain im here too he said quietly were pretty much the same trianna both of us need to be okay with not being perfect im tired of being scared he smiled tentatively arent you tnanna swallowed hard gwen felt sympathy but bit it back trianna ate sedately enough around the group but it was increasingly easy to picture her at home alone in her apartment a mindless oreo cookie zombie shoveling food into her mouth as if that gorgeous face and that lumpy body lived in different zip codes deli of the living dead trianna said i swear ill try i want to tell the truth about it her voice was a little girls barely a squeak i want to this time gwen didnt get a warning beep in her ear trianna tottered across the bridge and sat snuffling quietly and picked at her lunch kevin watched her licked his lips and ran a thin hand across the parchment of his face on the far side of that gap was health selfrespect salvation what war was it he fought he spoke of perfection what was his unattainable ideal that he compensated by being perfect at selfdenial what was so spindizzy in his life that he made up for it by controlling every crumb he ate would take perverse pride in his conquest of the physical hungers his anguish was almost too painful to watch what do you want from me he asked finally ollies voice was kind just the truth kevin if i eat too much ill have to throw up he said it as if the admission had cost him skin kevin was afraid literally afraid to cross that gap to where the others sat eating bathed in golden light slowly trianna came to her feet tears stifi slicked her face she held her anns out to kevin and gwen could almost see lines of strange magnetism connecting the two of them as if they were bizarre mirrorimages of each other the fat lady and the skeleton boy prides of the sideshow no one said a word there was no sound and then kevin made a soft wet desperate sound and stumbled across the gap dancing on air into triannas comforting arms one by one they went through it gwen was relieved to note that nobody tried to test the boundaries it might have been interesting to try keeping max sands from charging across that bridge he could carry her and ollie without much of a second thought carry or dump them over the side but at last they were all seated eating actually enjoying the meal dream park had set for them the pears were crisp and flavorful and the cheddar cheese was so sharp it almost singed her tongue gwen herself loved pears it was easy to respect a good pear because a bad pear was so bad johnny welsh was drinking coffee from a paper cup thoughtfully provided by the gods and chewing on a makeshift cheese sandwich he looked as if he had died and gone to heaven everyone ate more slowly than they had at breakfast maybe the excellence of the food and drink had something to do with that something but not all johnny belched contentedly java blend he said last coffee i had was on the tube out from denver he made a face hippogryph was willing that bad lets put it this way i had the concierge send it out to a lab got a call back saying congratulations your moose is pregnant hippogryph sprayed a mouthful of grape juice narrowly missing kevin who lunged out of the way jeezewill you watch your timing kevin said plaintively johnny smiled wickedly sorry about that orson popped open one of the cans drank and made a face at snow goose you brought me all the way to hell for sugarfree up they sat in a circle on a stone bridge over the pit of infinity max looked a little distant wistful that massive muscular body sagging somewhat in repose gwen wondered what he was think ing there was no way for dream park magic to give her that piece of information yet they were on the move again and the trail began to lead gently downward the air was chilling and the wind plucked at maxs face and hair more fiercely part of it was his imagination the howl of the wind had increased more than its velocity the temperature had only dropped a few degrees the path grew narrower and narrower and then the walls were well within reach rock glazed with ice the wind was a hollow reedlike whistle in their ears moods recently elevated by a fine meal went edgy they gripped their weapons tightly and walked single file at first the cries might have been mistaken for a trick of the wind then max heard them for what they werethe endless moaning and shrieking of the eskimo damned so far there was nothing to see light had diminished to a murky dusk then a glowing aurora illuminated the scene and max felt the pit of his stomach tighten naked men and women stumbled blindly through deep snow one man staggered across jagged rocks with a caribou lashed across his shoulders his feet were torn and bleeding blood trailed down his back from a gash along the caribous ribs the caribou kicked and wriggled in nightmarish slowmotion snow goose stiffened then ran jerkily to a spot where a stone wall caused the path to branch an eskimo was lashed to the wall with leather thongs butterflies fluttered around his head and he snapped at them with his teeth he caught one and ate it other eskimos were bound identically their movements were sluggish and awkward as they lunged uselessly against their fetters wood owl snow goose cried he looked up at her dully who who is there then she stepped closer and his eyes focused his lips curved making a small sad smile snow goose it is you how did you die no wood owl i come with friends we fight to destroy the cabal he nodded a butterfly fluttered too close to his mouth he snapped it out of the air and chewed thoughtfully could use a little salt whats it like being dead hebert asked not bad really wood owl answered after a moments consideration like waiting for a tax refund only slower he looked at snow goose regretfully i would not have made you a good mate but i loved you you died for me so you were a lousy hunter i turned vegetarian at asu no problem when you see your father again tell him ive seen cousin gray otter we can stop wondering about why gray otters wife cut his throat and drowned herself seems he was sharing furs with weeping walrus when he was supposed to be fishing soap operas in hell bowles mused the mind boggles death will not release you wood owl agreed snow goose smiled bravely and they continued on max kept looking back at wood owl lashed to his stone and snapping at the cluster of butterflies around his face until they rounded the corner of the wall hell was a small place evidently the next group of damned they encountered were all halfnaked women blue lines and dots made patterns on their faces they cried holding their hands out to the travelers and begging in a language that he couldnt understand what was their sin max asked snow goose they have bad tattoos orsons jaw dropped and he looked at the eskimo dead with new interest studying their tattoos of course max said thats pretty minor what kind of gods are these petty like all gods on the other hand theres no penalty at all for masturbation im changing religion kevin said positively obviously i have strong eskimo blood and never knew it the women were all blackhaired and sullen except for a woman in her thirties with flaming red hair who hung numbly in her bonds her green eyes were partially unfocused slowly she lifted her head who max cried eviane her confusion lasted only a moment recognition following swiftly my comrades eviane said tears streaked her face i knew you would come for me even hell couldnt keep us apart chapter eighteen research and development transit time from security to research and development on the far side of the park was about fortyfive seconds when alex could catch the right routing there was the gentle bump as his shuttle capsule hit the bottom of the vertical tube a moments hesitation as the gyros rotated the capsule and then a shush as he accelerated like a bullet fired beneath the thriving metropolis that was dream park for some of the trip the clear walls of the shuttle revealed nothing save an occasional flash of light the maintenance shops were along this route the chief of maintenance liked the transit tubes through her sector to be clear so that she could see the shuttles streaking past six years ago a study had given maintenance the greatest efficiency level of any department in dream park this was considered puzzling someone noted that instead of the green or blue worn by maintenance personnel in the other companies the dream park crew wore white more like a doctors gown than the uniform of one who keeps pipes and wires humming sandy khresla a chunky little woman with a phd in environmental engineering was the pipesmoking head of the division when someone asked her why she chose such untraditional garb she smiled as if she had been watching her clock and her calendar wondering when the big brains would get around to asking that question we service the veins and arteries of dream park she said around a mouthful of sweet quasicontraband turkish smoke you guys are the brains or the arms and transportation is the legs but were the heart without us everything dies alex griffin remembered that story as sandys offices flashed by three white uniforms huddled in conversation a pair of eyes flicked in his direction then indifferently away he thought of all the people who took their jobs so damned seriously toiling for seventeen and twenty hours a day who often had to be pried away from their desks and terminals they believed in the dream how would they feel if they knew what if they knew of his mission the capsule shushed to a halt in the basement of r d quieted for a moment as it was switched to a rail and then began to rise the shuttles sat up to four people and were completely modular capable of hooking onto either the vertical or diagonal tracks that could take them anywhere in the park an insanely complex machine there were problems with such complexity of course the more complex a machine is the more vulnerable it is to sabotage or simple breakdown obviously fekesh had implanted a cancer somewhere in the organism that was drea park alex hoped it had not yet metastasized the shuttle door clicked open alex stretched his legs and pushed himself out he was standing on his head in the middle of a desert date palms hung by their roots below the horizon a slowmoving line of camels walked upside down in the distance alex stopped checking his sense of balance he didnt think hed fallen over so he took a few cautious steps in that direction to see if the perspective would shift it didnt he looked down at his feet he was standing on a cloud arms stretched up to their maximum buried his hands in intangible sand hello is anyone here no answer but he thought that he heard a cough the sun was beating up with unnatural ferocity but there was no heat it felt more like the air conditioning was turned up to full possibly as a minor side effect of turning the entire region upside down dream park had finally figured out a way to make the sahara livable how much would fekesh pay for that hello this is alex griffin from security oh shit someone said from behind a shimmering dune the entire illusion flickered then died he was standing right side up in the hall surrounded by gleaming formica floors and fluorescent ceilings and all of the usual floating video boards and packed trophy cases the only unusual thing was the holo projection device out in the middle of the hallway inverted and poking halfway out of a door curious alex approached cautiously ahhello what exactly are you doing the young man wiggling from under the machine was browneyed and innocent with long wavy brown hair and an engaging thinlipped smile he looked more like a fullback than a lab tech and was dressed in a pair of blue denim overalls he spread his hands in supplication i dont know who the hell built this thing he said but the only way you can reach the main processor is from the bottom the function keys are on the top im having a wonderful time the device was a standard holo projection unit an older model vaguely reminiscent of an old planetarium projector can i help you with something the young man asked im looking for dr izumi oh yeah he twisted over from his uncomfortable position and pointed down the hall third door to the left think hes in bioworks today as alex walked away man and machine vanished again into the desert and the young man said eureka a second before the entire machine shorted out a colorful stream of adjectives and gerunds followed alex down the hall the second door to the left was standing open in the midst of a lab filled with monitors cameras and floodlights a human skeleton sat calmly on a folding canvas chair it turned and looked at alex and said yes can i help you alex managed a rather lopsided smile searching for the human being operating the armature ah yes im looking for dr izumi the skeleton clicked its teeth in a bizarre rictus that might have been a smile how would you know if a skeleton was smiling it was the lip articulation that made most of a smile happen it stood up and stalked across the room like something out of a nightmare it held out a bony hand all right hed go along with the joke and as soon as the hand went through his he would declare the joke over and force izumi to get down to business his fingers closed on warm fleshand then dissolved the flesh of his hand ended at the wrist and two sets of finger bones intertwined he gritted his teeth the skeleton laughed heartily that was priceless it said just the expression on your face excuse me it turned its head alex expected to hear a creak of tortured bone but what he got instead was that bemused cultured voice saying izumi save program twoeightinternal and mute the air shimmered and tom izumi appeared he was of medium height with straight black hair and an incongruously small mouth for an embarrassing moment he reminded griffin of a villain from an old dick tracy comic strip the kind whose physical features mirrored and indicated their criminal tendencies what in the hell was that griffin asked a realtime holographic medical analysis simulator utilizes ultrasound projectors built into the walls dont you need lasers to make a hologram heavens no any form of energy that can be carried by waves sound light microwaves or xrays whatever happened to turn your head and cough theres a ton of diagnostic devices in here ive been scanned up and down and sideways we just create a threedimensional model and project it onto the patient what kind of ah depth i guess depth is the word im looking for oh we can adjust it to any level izumi circulation his skin disappeared alex looked into a coursing network of veins and arteries with the contracting fistsized muscle of izumis heart pulsing queasily in stage center the room behind the missing flesh shimmered as if he was seeing it through a heat mirage could you disappear entirely here in the room sure could i play invisible man out in the street nobodys miniaturized the equipment that far but i suppose its possible the problem would be in reproducing every conceivable angle so that anyone looking from any direction would see what he expects to see a little adjustment for focus maybe he became thoughtful come back next month great a security chiefs worst nightmare available next month from the gentle lunatics at research and development mind turning that off its giving me a headache sure izumi smiled toothily and appeared fully clothed youre alex griffin he said tomisuburo izumi alex shook the mans hand again it was soft like a babys there was something curiously childlike about the man he had that soft round cheekiness without the angularity which normally intrudes during adolescence there was no trace of a beard and the black hair was undisciplined the eyes didnt fit in that face dark and deepset they were fiercely inteffigent what can i do for you i dont feel comfortable in a room with so many scans hooked up to it is there somewhere we can talk privately izumi thought for a moment theres the party room come on izumi carefully locked the door behind them and escorted him down the hall party room alex asked yes our rotation doesnt come up until two in the morning australia and canada will keep things going most of the day whats the record nonstop holo party thirteen months with the feeds weve got right now theres no reason to assume that it will ever stop were at eight months and cruising they stopped in front of a small green door with the legend environmental stress workshop please sign in alex stifled a laugh as izumi thumbed the door open and they entered the room buzzed with activity people laughed drank ate from a buffet table a couple in the far corner were dancing a rumba some of the guests looked a little tired they raised their glasses as izumi closed the door and a male voice said tommy yold slacker gday ey good to see you whos the straight this is alex griffin chief of security here griffin meet robin schultz he was short and a bit pudgy with a magnificent sandy beard he tilted a bit as he stood up welcome to the party mate shake hands if i could but you know how it is alex was overwhelmed with curiosity where are you sending from university of melbourne old love plasma physics weve had to shuffle the party around from one lab to the other this week its been hysteric why rules officially no ones supposed to know unofficially its the biggest open secret on campus and they queue up waiting for us to drop a line he glanced at his watch well we only have to host for the next twelve hours then canada takes over be glad too three days ago i was the only person here for two whole hours lonely of course but hey the party rnust go on listen robin izumi said i need a quiet conversation with mr griffin and this is the best place here so were going to drop off line for a while all right tommy later hey the room disappeared they were in a small studio maybe a third the size of the ballroom and alex swallowed his amazement dammit he wasnt going to get goggleeyed again he just wasnt going to do it izumi said so what can i do for you are you sure were secure here very izumi gestured to a couch and alex tested it with the tip of his toe before sitting i want to talk to you about your brother calvin tom izumi stopped breathing for a moment and his eyes closed a network of little muscles clenched and relaxed under his eyes when the minirebellion was over he opened them again and examined griffin you were not even at dream park when calvin died mr griffin what is it that you wish i need to know more about the circumstances of his death all of the files are sealed or erased the county coroners office had a terrible accident about eight years ago impounded some kind of electromagnet as evidence and ended up erasing data ifies your brothers included that is most unfortunate they paused as someone walked down the hall outside hum reached over and bolted the door what can you tell me about the death humi leaned back against the wall holding a private debate with himself then he began to speak it was in april april of i believe calvin was working on the combat rifle range we had set up for the california state sheriffs association he took one of the rifles outside the park for additional testing up in the mountains one of two shells had been a hangfire while he was changing targets it detonated and he was struck in the head killed instantly a hunter found him he paused and alex saw calculations flashing behind those penetrating eyes thats really all there is to say what is it that youre looking for the truth i know that calvin died here in dream park i know that there was an accident in a game involving live ammunition i know that it was no accident i know about the coverup tom izumi was silent slowly he rose im afraid that i have to get back to my work im sure you can understand i can understand your wish to protect dream park i can appreciate your loyalty youre thinking this is what calvin would have wanted but what you have to understand is that there is a chance just a chance that if you help me we can nail the people involved we can do it without airing dream parks laundry in public izumi sat back down again i dont understand how something new has been added the fimbuiwinter game is running again i know that the girls back too shes in the game under a pseudonym izumi mulled it what of it persons unknown got her killed out ive put her back in and thats it tom thats all ive got i dont understand enough of what happened yet tell me help me somebodys frightened if i can get enough information maybe i can find a pressure point and if you cant then well be no worse off than we are now i wont do anything to jeopardize dream park or your family and at least well know that we tried izumi seemed to weigh his words then he shrugged tried okay calvin was a little heavyset and he liked acting they asked him to be an eskimo in one of the games over in gaming a hed done it a couple of times i think certainly no one expected any trouble then we got the callthere had been a terrible accident who called you medical staff one of the doctors all right go on my mother and i were working on one of the displays in a trade show setup and we hurried to the dispensary it had been cleared out dr vails no vail that was his name vail chief of psychiatric services no not then he was just one of the psychs and harmony was there and two others a halfdozen security people knew the truth and three medical personnel they were all sworn to secrecy when they showed us the body we had to make our own choice just like that no it wasnt just like that mother fell apart we had to sedate her but when she was calm we realized that justice could not be served if we tried to find the murderer publicly the whole thing would come out and the killers would get the disruption they were seeking so we covered it up and we all helped mr griffin he paused it killed her you know she only lasted another year in some corner of his mind alex tallied up another life gone for nothing how did you manage it calvin and i were about the same height the head of prosthetics joined the conspiracy she made me up to look like calvin mother started crying again when she saw how good the job was really unbelievable and then i went to a couple of conferences as calvin let myself be seen and then took that rifle out into the mountains alex visualized the pieces thus far presented letting them fall into place in proper perspective you said you couldnt try to find the murderer publicly what about privately tom izumi smiled mirthlessly we went over every possibility mr griffin and we came up with only two ways that rifle could have gotten into the game id like to know i want to see izumi paused and nodded and said all right come with me griffin wondered briefly how his subconscious had known that they would end up in maintenance why else would he have had such a strong reaction to passing that window sandy khresla spent a lot of time outdoors the sun had put streams of red in her straight black hair and turned her skin nutbrown she was a demon softball pitcher hed watched her she had the muscle to put speed on that heavy ball most women develop soft smooth muscle contours but a few like sandy khresla grow hard and defined hed lay long odds she pumped iron the blue smoke of an aromatic pipe tobacco hovered around her alex missed her leathery smile she looked dangerous with out it she had never looked at him like this like an enemy he said so you know about all of this too sandys voice was surprisingly deep when they started poking around gruff there was only one place to go were the only people who have complete knowledge of every entrance and exit how everything moves i was just a junior supervisor then but calvin and i were tight when his brother came to me and told me the truth they knew they could trust me alex nodded he felt like a johnnycomelately around these oldtimers so what conclusions did you come to we have to go back to an earlier set of detail maps a lot of additions were made six years ago and new security put in she called maps up on the computer until a scale map of dream park rotated on the table in front of them the image flashed and expanded flashed and expanded until they were looking at the dome of gaming b tangential to gaming a but sharing no walls or surface connections if i remember right the game was this winter thing eskimos sun going out we had every refrigerator unit pumping at once fimbulwinter whatever okay at the end of the game the gamers have lost almost everything but there are still some weapons left behind after an airplane crash these are handed out to the gamers who need them so they can fight this last big battle are you with me so far no problem now all of the rifles are coded and numbered the rifle that killed was indistinguishable from a dream park rifle it hadnt been modified somebody smuggled it in at the last minute and handed it to that poor little mouse michelle sturgeon yeah that was it kid never had a chance she had the highest score of anyone in the game you know that they may have picked her for that alex examined the checkpoints the dream park armory was an ultrahigh security area and all weapons were checked rechecked and the complete breakdown recorded on videochip for reference some of the weapons were replicas and could never fire many were fantasy weapons dreamed up by r d but a few were antiques or army surplus and needed safety modification tom izumi traced his finger along the underground connecting tunnels this rifle entered the game here at a service duct or here at the players entrance this corridor where the equipment is brought up is very secure but but one of our eskimos disappeared after the game poof gone laid a false trail and was out of the country as far as we can determine pictures yes izumi said i can have them to your office this afternoon one of the actors smuggled in a rifle switched it and carted the modified rifle away it seems the simplest explanation sandy said alex thought and thought and finally sighed i need more information i think there must be a simple answer get me the data on the actor what was his name called himself toby lee harlow jr all of the files were lifted but i got them out of the system and kept them once again griffin was treated to that utterly merciless smile just in case chapter nineteen old friends millicent summerss office was tucked away beneath the blue lagoon swimming spa a wallwide window piped in a view of clear blue water healthy young and firm old bodies smashed through the rippling mirrorsurface and drove swarms of bubbles under as they plunged millicents head snapped around and she sprang out of her chair delightedly alex i was hoping youd come by couldnt stay away he said he didnt need a mirror to know that his smile wasnt very convincing besides he said with more bitterness than he had intended i dont know who i can trust she was taken aback opened her mouth and closed it without speaking millicent spun without touching him and raised her voice are you there jackie yes miss summers hold all my calls for the next hour yes maam millicent led alex by the hand over to her desk and sat with him why dont you tell me about it i dont have enough yet but he reached over to her key pad mind whats mine is yours he typed his security code in and made a few quick routing instructions when he looked up he saw that she was seriously concerned alex you dont usually ignore an innuendo millie i cant trust anyone who was here ten years ago you came in seven years ago so thats why were talking and here i thought it was my lucid personality i need that too so talk the smile was gone millicent knew him too well to expect pleasantries or anything pleasant at all he took a deep breath all right ten years ago cowles industries was in trouble financial trouble i know ive got it in my files there was going to be a hostile takeover but enough stockholders held on out of loyalty to make it difficult and then somebody no ones sure who but his initials are kareem fekesh set up an accident that would help to scare off some of our supporters enough to tip the scales kareem fekesh ill look him up what kind of an accident murder a man named calvin izumi was killed during the playing of the fimbulwinter game the woman who killed him is a michelle sturgeon she popped back up in the park two days ago millicent sat down hard her face tight oh that michelle sturgeon she searched his face for clues all right griff what can i do help me sort througif this this first part isnt pleasant at all and maybe only harmony has had the nerve to look at it whats that it was no outside job the current theory among the bereaved is that someone came in as an actor switched rifles and carried the dummy away somehow you dont buy that not for a hot second ah millicents wall screen beeped and a picture took form it showed a man in eskimo makeup pouchy cheeks epicanthic folds and long glossy black mongol hair the next picture was of the same man out of makeup the two pictures matched only vaguely have they run this through fbi how long ago did this all happen maybe ten years and the fbi wouldnt have looked too carefully we never let them know just how serious it was millicents puzzlement was obvious and easy to understand griffin took a few minutes to explain the facts of life when he was done she exhaled harshly wait im going to need some coffee for this you no thanks my ulcer already has all the acid it needs anyway my bet is that that picture isnt of our man anyone who could tamper with the game data banks to reprogram a hologram can certainly change a few pictures and the person who can do both of those things is no shorttime employee even if he was his intimate knowledge of dream park security and operations means that he had a collaborator so what do you think happened not that difficult our traitor entered himself pseudonymously into the gaming actor roster donned makeup on the day of the game guards ferried rifles from the annory to gaming b our traitor got several of them to be distributed he disassembled one and restored it to firing condition for a practiced expert maybe two minutes of work but he had to be carrying the tools and parts he needed he passed the rifle to michelle sturgeon and got out of there let himself be killed out id guess the stolen parts were dumped in a scrapmetal recycler alex sighed thats really all there is to it mu i wish there were more sure theres more did he replace another actor or was there just one extra eskimo in the game made up out of whole cloth one extra numbers changed throughout the program she mulled it so what can i do for you first i want to know which dream park employees at the time had large registered blocks of stock in the company its thin but a natural way to pay off the traitor second i want you to put a trace on the level of interest mr kareem fekesh had in the park at the time that will be hard im sure that he covered his trail i dont know whether i can get that information alex not alone im going to get you help help youll see sunlight was beginning to dwindle by the time millicent teased the first precious pieces of data out of the computer banks the list of stockholders in cowles industries circa was immensethere had been a profitsharing plan in place far earlier than that and many employees funneled their funds back into the park only about twenty current employees had had over two hundred shares harmonys name was there and so was dr vail the other names were just names does this give you what you need alex scanned the list nodding slowly he glanced at his watch and my helper should be available any moment now are you deliberately trying to be mysterious no more than usualah a beep on millicents desk told him that the new call had been routed through it hadnt taken long one section of her screen cleared and a young man appeared he had reddish hair and a thin face his eyes looked tired but still very alive his lips were curled sardonically griffin how go things in lala land not so good tony hows chino another eight months and im out till then i sleep on my back i dont suppose he finally seemed to see millicent scuse me have we met i dont think so tony tony mcwhirter few years back the griffin was responsible for sponsoring me into this boys club she nodded right curiously enough once i was here he did just about everything he could to make it as comfortable as possible almost as if he had a bad conscience about the whole thing why would griff have that millicent was not a good liar she should have shown surprise the very question ive asked myself that one many times and come to no useful conclusion at any rate i doubt that this is a social call whats the job griffin tony i got you a work dispensation to get you points with the parole board and to keep you current on computers until we can get you out if youre smart enough to break our security system i want you on our side ladedah ssdd same shit different day come on whats the pitch you need something dont you i surely do i need you to investigate a man named kareem fekesh offices in the dupont building downtown los angeles find out everything you can about his involvement with dream park cowles industhes as far back as you have to go a lot of it will be hidden do i get to violate his civil rights hes not a citizen tonys sardonic manner dropped away he studied griffins screen image with wonder and a little fear that doesnt make it ethical anyway itll take more computer time than they give me here yes millicent will make one of the banks here available to you set up the program and let it run overnight if you have to i need you to break security on his accounts stockbrokers banks anything else illegal too youre a criminal arent you such a mouth whats in it for me more time if im caught tony everything ive done for you was gratis because i know you never wanted that guard to die you do this for me and you will have paid back everything if you work it through the lines here at dream park your legal risk is minimized mcwhirter stared at the ceiling i dont know ive only got eight months till parole maybe ill just coast millicent laughed both men looked at her she said gruff hed do it for the phone calls emotions chased each other across mcwhirters face ultimately he said millicent wasnt it id like to meet you meet sure in eight months dont count on anything till the second date no just meet youre something griffin shes just barely wrong i get lonely its enough to drive me crazy you have to meet these people they never heard of roleplaying games they compete for who can remember the bloodiest scene in a slasher movie they fight over what v channel to watch but this is dangerous isnt it i wont die to get phone calls from the griffin the calls were that important to him alex found that unnerving he said all right tony this is the most i can say if you can definitely prove that fekesh was behind a takeover bid about ten years ago or that his present involvement in the park is malign ill pull every string ive got and well get you out of there youll have a job here waiting for you prove it in court tony mcwhirter thought in court and hes not a citizen its a poor bet griffin and i have a holding account on bix dump your data in there along with my password and account number into cowles unlimited access dont try to screw me tony you play this straight and your life will turn out fine try to take advantage play with files you shouldnt and you wont see sunlight until the next ice age aye aye capn tony signed off whew millicent said thats a hell of a days work im not through yet get me kareem fekesh millicent routed the request through the switchboard and from there a probe hunted for his whereabouts and finally located him in one of the theme hotels the beeper sounded over and over then a face of middle eastern extraction appeared on the screen yes may i help you i need to talk to mr fekesh alex suddenly recognized him it was razul from the warbots scenario razul clearly didnt recognize griffin as anything but some random american there might have been a gleam of satisfaction under those heavy eyebrows or it might have been alexs imagination im sorry but he is not available just now this is alex griffin head of dream park security the man thought for a moment and then the screen went blank alex drummed his fingers for a full minute and then the screen came on again fekesh was the picture the very soul of elegance and alex had the distinct impression that he would have felt underdressed in a tuxedo yes mr griffin he spoke like a man on his way to catch a tube i was wondering if i might speak to you for a few minutes person to person on what subject shall we say unresolved matters of business and how long have these matters remained unresolved eight years he smiled blandly then im afraid they can remain so a while longer i am a very busy man mr griffin in fact i am due in san diego in half an hour please call my secretary perhaps i can find you five minutes next month he inclined his head politely and the screen cleared griffin spoke sadly to the blank screen i assume you realize this means war tough cookie millicent said even tough cookies crumble i just hope tony can come up with the leverage chapter twenty sin city a butterfly formed out of the thin fog and fluttered near her mouth it was a delicate yellow thing wings tinged with black and it came too close she snapped at it didnt feel her teeth touch anything but tasted a sweet mellow tang like sugared toast eviane sighed it was butterflies today butterflies tomorrow butterflies until the end of time she was trapped in this drifting darkness surrounded by strangers and silence she had resigned herself to that fate then clumsy footfalls and raucous voices broke the silence tnd she knew that her living comrades had come for her now this was curious she felt no surprise she didnt even turn her head she only waited with the placid patience of the dead until the moment she heard max sandss wonderful vibrant voice a moment later he was beaming at her like a full moon his huge round face shining with astonished pleasure at the sight of her evianes heart leapt as if she lived she noticed snow goose cupping her ear frowning eviane the eskimo princess said we were she stopped and conferred with frankish oliver for a moment yes she said frankish oliver went away for a few seconds he came back holding a viciouslooking modern rifle this led us to you because you held it close to your body snow goose paused then shook her head violently eviane im not used to this youre dead any of my professors would freak i dont understand eviane said and she didnt but by her own unreasoning fear of the rifle she sensed its power it was with you at your death it has great power and its link to you was strong if you wish we could use it to bring you with us from the underworld bring me back to life eviane asked as though somehow she already knew the answer snow goose was embarrassed no dear im sorry as a shade one of the dead a tornrait you would serve me the way a tornrait serves an angakok you would gather information that human senses cant reach you could be of great help to us if you would there wasnt a moments hesitation i wifi come she took the rifle the inuit women around her nodded their approval eviane stood and joined the line of heroes a butterfly drifted too close reflexively eviane snapped it out of the air again the sugary taste also and curiously her teeth met no resistance and she felt nothing go down her throat as she swallowed max was ready to whiq worlds he walked beside eviane and could barely restrain himself from grabbing and hugging her well he said trying to begin a conversation whats it feel like to die the smile froze on his face unmistakably she was searching herself for an answer well she said after a long pause its sort of like gym class only quicker he took five more steps before he turned and stared at her her face was perfectly serious her eyes met his it couldnt have been a joke eviane never joked and yet and yet the path wound among flat boulders of sedimentary rock more and more of them until they faced a wall of boulders rising into the gloom of the underworld cavern the troupe of adventurers trickled to a halt eviane looked terrified max asked nervously something wrong i remember eviane began and then her voice trailed off charlene and hippogryph loomed close you remember what charlene asked im not sure it was back when i was alive hippogryph looked concerned charlene said eviane dear if youve got anything to say that might save a life please to give information is the task of a tornrait snow goose said flatly eviane did her best falling slowly shapes around me big massive shadows like a dream like being dead but i wasnt afraid of going splat i was afraid of being crushed anything else she shook her head snow goose walked out to where the path disappeared into the boulders the rocks were flatsided slabs eight to twelve feet long by half that wide a bit too uniform for credibility thirty or forty feet up the darkness swallowed them she gestured to the rest come on bubbles burst from her mouth and streamed upward max gaped and she grinned at him bubbles a fish swam past his head more of an eel really some kind of curvy twisty thing that wiggled fluidly its tail almost flicked his nose son of a bitch he said bubbles obscured his vision for a moment snow goose gestured to them again impatiently come on were going to have to climb max didnt look down he could guess how many of the other gamers were still at the bottom staring up thinking how impossible it all was the rocks were not that badly tilted it was like climbing a crude stairway if each stair was a meter higher than the previous one hippogryph was climbing backward pulling charlene upward by her wrists they both seemed to be enjoying themselves it got harder as max got higher but he couldnt catch eviane she climbed steadily unstoppable panting through gritted teeth pushing forward and upward toward what terrified her and now he saw that the wave of boulders spilled against a vertical rock wall the wall rose seamless into darkness it might have been a thousand miles high the core of a hollow earth we have to breach the wall snow goose said everyone needs to push come on swell but max could see what eviane was doing choosing a big nearly flat boulder for her perch setting her feet hands flat against the monolithic wall the boulders were not big enough for two he chose one next to hers charlene and hippogryph took evianes other side like max they tried to imitate eviane strange wasnt it that she always seemed to know just what to do so she was just a bit quicker than anyone else was he the only one who noticed kevin was giving it his all but he had climbed no higher than orson who was sweating and glaring up at his brother tnanna and johnny welsh had reached the top welsh said hulk smash snow goose grinned and nodded welsh chose a boulder and set his feet push push all at once one two three heave they heaved max pushed with everything he had he could sense the mass of his companions if they had anything going for them at all it was mass but the mass of the stone wall felt infinite and yet there was a gritty crunchy sound against his ear theyd done something orson and kevin reached the top paused a moment to suck air then joined the effort push harder snow goose dropped back gasping all right take a rest and then the rest of snow gcoses sentence was lost in a growing rumble the rocks began to shimmy evianes eyes flew open oh my gosh this is about to all at once and nothing first the wall disintegrated the pile of boulders spilled outward screams sounded muffled bubbles streamed from their mouths and the party was falling through dark water in a cloud of shattered rock the entire cavern had dissolved crumbled max was on a falling boulder for that matter everyone was on a faffing boulder they sank in a murky cloud of detritus but they sank faster smaller boulders rocks pebbles grit all rose out of sight and left the view clear each adventurer astride his own individual boulder sank sleekly into depths that graded from dark to utter black max felt his ears pop he laughed that was too realistic he hooted and waved his arms to brother orson whose rock was spinning in a slow lazy circle although they had to be far below the surface of the ocean and the water was murky shafts of light pierced the darkness like silver pillars the travelers sank down into the depths on a gentle diagonal slipping through dark and light past the finny denizens of the deep a school of ugly blind fish cozied past him showing more good mammalian sense than their cold blood should have allowed they waited for trianna they made kissing motions at her following almost close enough to touch vaguely through the murk the bottom was taking shape max could almost he could make out the titanic outline of a woman in repose though the head was wrong lumpy misshapen a flutter of panic the paija nahhh too big it was a woman and she was huge three hundred feet high if an inch bigger sedna the surrounding murk made anything but a vague impression difficult but it seemed to him that she sat in an attitude of sorrow her arms and knees hid her face she might have been carved of alabaster or of mud it was just not possible to make out detail her shoulders were gently rounded slumped although she was a giantess a goddess sedna the mother of life max felt the burden which hung heavy upon her he wanted to hold her shelter her protect her well damnthat was why hed come wasnt it a wayward current was floating them down toward the gigantic head hed been right sednas head was misshapen a pale brownish mass capped the back and left side of her skull and was spreading down her neck it had an angular look less like fungus than like a growth of crystals white veinlike threads intersected everywhere like roads orson screamed max theyve built a goddamn city in her hair charlene called were going past the current was sweeping the falling boulders past that growth good landing in a parasite city would have given them no time to think to plan but the current was dropping them toward flowing black locks this close sednas hair looked like tangled cables max began to feel like a windcaught flea their impossible little rockchariots sifted like sand grains into sednas scalp max squeezed his eyes shut and braced himself for a bump there was none only a gentle settling sensation the boulder seemed to have landed on solid ground but damned if he would just assume that max got down on hands and knees and backed off the boulder feeling with his toes until solidity pushed against the metatarsals he stood ankledeep in a mass of cables of hairs he reached down and hefted one a quarterinch thick soft to the touch running back out of sight the hair was relatively sparse thank god or the adventurers would have been choked immediately upon arrival he checked that the others had arrived safely there was no need to wonder each and every boulder had dropped without mishap onto the glorious head of sedna max had an absurd urge to plant a flag was this how neil annstrong had felt his peripheral vision caught something on a strand of hair something crawled away disappearing as he watched something bigger than his hand it gave him the creeps hebert was the first to comment i see some kind of big bugs around here i dont know what to call them johnny welsh volunteered water bugs maybe the rest of them began to look around peering in the mesh of cables for water bugs but found nothing snow goose called them to attention all right i think we can safely assume that we made it here in one piece which way do we go arent you the one who knows that she laughed please ive just about run out of magic why dont one of you take control of that point robin bowles looked very serious just as serious in fact as he had been when passing sentence on the psychokifier in judge knott a little more puzzled perhaps i think i heard something from over in that direction he said finally lets take a look the hair was piled into thick rows it was slightly greasy to maxs touch youd think that a goddess could wash her hair twice a week wouldnt you orson shot him a dirty look trianna said she cant comb her hair that much i remember no fingers something crunched under his feet and he heard a highpitched squealing noise peering carefully through the forest of fofficles he saw three more water bugs they gave him the creeps smaller than a dog pack but far too big for bugs yerch before he had any clue as to what was happening a net of webbing had settled over him before he could respond to it effectively a second flew over from the opposite direction and he was entangled then his feet were gone from under him and if the hair hadnt been so spongy and resilient he might have had a nasty fall as it was it was a lot like faffing into a stack of freshcut grass embarrassing but not at all uncomfortable dream park wants no lawsuits behind him bowles shouted something that shakespeare never wrote and grabbed at hair with one hand while trying to keep his balance with the other it didnt matter he went down anyway all of the adventurers were going down kevin dodged and ran and there were multiple sputt sounds before they managed to catch him and drag him down max tumbled and rolled as unseen forces pulled him along at the lowest threshold of hearing he could hear tiny squeaky voices singing hi ho hi ho its off to work we go bump bump a hair as thick as a pencil flapped across his face sednas hair flagged out above him in the drifting currents like abed of kelp they came to rest in a broad bare area a bald spot in the middle of sednas scalp max tugged at the net strong was it strong enough to stop him if he gave it everything he had probably he wiggled over until he was on his other side brother orson lay about four feet away one eye visible through the black stalks looks like were cooked orson said resigned such a pollyanna he is max hoisted himself to one knee then tumbled over the hair began to tremble and only then did he really focus his eyes on it multicolored bumps moved along the strands they were seven and eight inches long by half that wide they moved and crawled and when he rolled over in his net to look at them they squealed and ran away finally one turned and looked at him cocked its head sideways and hissed it was a cross between a human being and an insect of some kind the head was disproportionately large its face was a punchandjudy caricature medieval in its exaggeration even on a face that tiny the projection of evil glee was unmistakable it grinned at him and skittered away but another faced him a bug with the body of a walrus turned inside out and below that one was a lascivious womancreature it whistled at himtiny very highpitchedand wriggled its twoinchwide derriere suggestively just what did you have in mind honey kevin choked back a face full of laughter what is all of this its the sins of mankind i think ive seen vanity and wasteful killing and loose sexual practice jesus hebert hissed by wriggling around in the net max could just make out his dark face i think youre right ive got murder i think and maybe theft all right then we know where we are but what do we do there wasnt long to wait the sins were busy around them busy busy busy and from the roots of sednas hair rose a city they watched it form one shell at a time built by carapaced creatures that flowed from every follicle it was an array too vast and differentiated to even begin to categorize there was every sin that he could recognize sloth and gluttony and greed and murder and actions mimed but beyond his understanding the creatures reached sednas bald spot and there they shed their shells and wriggled forth like glistening varicolored slugs the shells built up and up in a heap it grew like a coral reef hundreds upon thousands of individual beings contributed one bit at a time a bizarre castlescape rose up and up while the sluglike occupants mingled in obscene pools or piles in front of the structure the castle ringed them twice as tall as a human being with walls several feet thick how many sins how many teninch sins did it take to make a structure of that size he searched his mind the confusion drowning out the equations before he could come up with an answer but the net was relaxing he could move max shucked the net smoothly the way he would wiggle out of a full nelson sednas scalp was resilient bouncy max crawled on hands and knees found eviane and helped her out of her net this time she didnt fight him and her fingers stayed warm on his wrist for a lingering second cityscape stretched around and above them a megalopolis for rats sins were still swarming forth like denuded rats writhing and fluxing in vile pools in a moat of living tissue the corners of sin city were four parabolic arches and the flat wall beneath each arch was bulging sculpting itself until four human figures faced them standing in the corners of the miniature city like dark brothers of the four cardinal directions the shells that shaped them were still occupied crawling sins even shaped a suggestion of faces but the features moved restlessly semiindependently european african asian eskimo the nightmare figures examined the adventurers reaching out of the architecture to poke and then drawing back as if the prospect of touching a human being was distasteful they retreated back into their directional corners and sighed heavily the european figure spoke and max could see a hundred mouths moving its voice was a buzzing composite we have it wanted s sounds where there were none the sibilance was disturbingly reptilian it adjusted slightly yesss we have waited for you long long time and now you are here yesss it turned to its brothers lifted its arms jubilantly and screamed let the trial begin chapter twentyone temptations dwight welles watched waiting his fingers splayed over the keyboard like a concert pianists bare feet gently touching the pedals he watched the four screens occasionally his eyes flicked to the bob stage where the entire judgment scene was displayed in miniature truth be told he preferred the twodee screenit flattened and simplified the images and thereby sped his responses this was vital even though he had timedelays built into the program he needed every split second to focus the massive power of dream parks computer banks on the job at hand in play and at his best dream parks chief computer wizard was a blur of motion fingers and feet moving so swiftly that they dazzled the eye but unlike a concert virtuoso welles was engaged in a piano duel in which the theme alone had been preselected melody tempo hannonies and phrasing were all variable it was the ultimate challenge and only a game as complex as fimbulwinter could have lured welles from his dry theorizing for three days of extemporaneous madness he felt drunk with power even the lopezes would have flinched from running the next scene he flexed his fingers wiped moisture on the pale tshirt which read nice computers dont go down hell sex couldnt even come close four composite creatures stood at the four corners of the clearing max sands found it easy to guess which figures represented what one positioned to what he assumed was the north had stereotypical eskimo features the figure was short and pudgy and nutbrown the shape to his right was oriental colored comicbook yellow like a jaundice victim further around the clockface to the south stood an ebony figure made of crawling black shells and to the west as white as a sheet was the figure representing european man the sins of mankind you came to destroy us the eskimoshape said grinning like a happyface button but we knew of your coming and have captured you now we decide your fates kevin titus spoke up you mean your buddies the cabal they are not our friends they seek to use us eviane surged against her bonds then relaxed watching the creatures with eyes that were cold and hard the cabal will free sedna when they choose and then inherit the world their power will destroy them they will be corrupted by their own sins the eskimo inspected each of them as it spoke its eyes were hard to meet its grin was wide and white its teeth were miniature bald heads the eskimo spoke in a chorus of tiny voices thousands upon thousands of them each chanting in the same rhythm let me tell you it said its voice buzzed maddeningly since the time of the great raven the world has been in balance the raven creates sedna sustains the shamans and witches those who functioned in the realms between worlds helped to keep the balance but the sins of mankind always weighed heavily on sedna when the eskimos break taboos and forget the laws of their fathers then we break free sort of like zits max whispered the eskimo smiled vastly in the year a man named robert j flaherty came to us came to the people of the ice and he made a movie nanook of the north and when it was released in the entire structure of the world was thrown out of balance hebert squinted confused why because the white world the outside world became a part of the community under sednas protection every culture has its gods and deities and some are powerful and some are powerless sedna is powerful as she must be to protect her children who live in the most rugged region of the world in his peripheral vision max watched the other three composites they were almost immobile from time to time they nod ded or the shells that made their expressions shifted slightly there seemed little chance of starting an argument among them they were too close they were four lobes of a single brain max guessed and the sins were its cells orson spoke why wouldnt sednas discovery by the outside world give her greater strength because there is nothing in your culture which adds to the spiritual strength of the inuit people in truth we owe you much the eskimo said it is through you that we the sins of man came into our true power ever have we been a secondary force mere symbols of your misdeeds verbs acrawl on sednas scalp now we thrive as never before now we may cripple your world kevin was the first to speak if weve done you so much good why dont you turn us loose to do more because we can use you the black south africa shape said we your sins can use you against the cabal if man and cabal can both be neutralized then we may rule ever we have been both effect and cause we are the corruptors and the product of corruption the beginning and the end alpha and omega we wish to take our true position as masters of the universe then whats stopping you orson said testily why cant you just take what you want you must welcome us into your lives white west europe said solicitously actions performed by coercion are not sins we know that among you are hearts eager to touch and be touched by our ultimate pleasures you will come to us voluntarily orson wasnt buying it if you cant make us do it if you have to have our cooperation then you arent the ultimate forces that you imagine theres gotta be law and order even in a game even here who are you afraid of max glowed come on little brother none bullshit eviane said suddenly everyone turned to hear her if we created you then we have power youre joined in a big dance with us what is in our hearts determines our fates isnt that right the oriental snarled at her its neck stretched out toward her shells taking new alignments until it resembled a cobra standing in a basket the yellow east asia composite glared down into her welles jerked his mind back on track it was too damned easy to get lost playing whatif games and there was work to do this the image of africa said this and more can we give you and it is only the beginning wait robin bowles said shaking his head youre talking about the death of mankind if mankind dies our sins die with us yesss the eskimo nodded we are hoping to recruit you powerful virile breeders you will stay here with us eating reveling in pleasure a nonstop orgy mounting each other breeding sins for all eternity our two worlds will truly coexist as they were meant to from the beginning of time all four voices joined together and spoke thunderously let the trial begin the walls flowed the cityscape closed in abruptly the walls had become solid and waisthigh barriers had risen before each of the composite figures whiteshelled sins spilled across their heads to form periwigs sin city had become a courtroom their four judges surrounded them at the four cardinal directions hear ye hear ye the eskimo image began between the shells that formed the walls individual sins popped up made rude faces and disappeared little eightinch abominations stood on each others backs and shoulders cheered and hissed and laughed and wriggled their glistening bare behinds at the garners this court is now in session robin bowles said but not as if he believed it i insist on the right to legal counsel the white judge leaned over grinning ah yes and if you cannot afford one one will be appointed for you let me see out of the reeking pool of sin a ghastly caricature of the figure of blind justice rose up grinning at them clattering her teetering scales to hell with that max shouted i vote that robin bowles represent us bowles turned a little shocked are you sure welles was just as startled granted that bowles was prepped to handle the defense so were ollie and gwen with prompting from welles of course welles had expected to have to push a little argue a little but the adventurers seemed to have made their decision and in bowless favor welles hit the stall button and a prerecorded loop played buying him five seconds to think whoa hippogryph yelped max glanced over and saw a troop of six sins dragging a roast beef across the courtroom floor tumbling and fumbling like circus clowns with their load they were almost to the far side of the room when three sinsheriffs complete with badges and riding sea horses scampered in pursuit the entire tableau took about five seconds then kevin remembered himself you do want the job dont you mr bowles i saw you in the judge crater story you and six other people bowles said ruefully but you can handle it snow goose cried all in favor a thunderous chorus of ayes filled the air opposed not a single nay the ayes have it the black judge looked at them impatiently we are here today to try mankind represented by these sorry assholes for its sins in the court we use the code napoleon your guilt is presumed until you can prove yourselves ah whats that word a skeletal bailiff goosestepped over to them its joints and bones constructed of tittering sins standing on one anothers grotesque shoulders it stagewhispered innocent why yes that is the word i was looking for he harumphed cleared his throat and spat out a sin it landed at charlenes feet it wore a black robbers mask across its face and a threedigit number across its chest chittenng it ran up to her and dug under her trouser cuff she squeaked and pulled away the sin hugged a big gold coin to its chest smiled evilly and sprinted fol cover robin b wles sighed and then spoke in a voice like rolling thunder we are willing to go on trial but only if we know that we will be tried fairly if this is a mockery of a trial where you can bend law and logic to fit your own dictates then we might as well be silent and keep our dignity while you do with us as you will orson hissed at bowles who bent over listening and whispering the oriental hadnt waited we will play fair with you there is no need lying is a sin but sins do not lie robin bowles straightened his back and smiled unpleasantly you had better not my colleague has reminded me of something maxs little brother stood cracking his knuckles with glee all right the raven and sedna are out of operation but sedna has a mate and eviane is a tornrait kevin hastily consulted his pocket computer torngarsoak lord of the land animals thaaats the one eviane gives us a direct connection to the spirit world torngarsoak is out there listening and watching if we are guilty then he will punish mankind for harming his sweetheart if were innocent he smiled charmingly then torngarsoak will be upset with you he turned bowed sweepingly from the waist to the wild applause of the garners charlene dula seemed beside herself with enthusiasm thank you colleague orson it was nothing colleague robin bowles spoke in his most professorial tones all right he said that having been said i move for a dismissal of all charges on what grounds on the grounds that we representing the western world were ignorant of eskimo law and therefore must be held blameless the four judges conferred for a moment then shook their heads no your motion is disallowed for two reasons first even if we discounted sins which are exclusive to the eskimo world there are enough overlapping sinsmurder for instance to condemn you and the second ignorance of the law is no excuse this is well known in our western law robin nodded his head and paced back and forth suddenly he stopped what are the sins of which we stand accused murder abortion of children in times of plenty men who have no hunting skills women who disgrace their communities by dressing poorly destruction of the family units i submit to you bowles said that these sins have been with mankind since time immemorial and that the universe was created in balance despite them there has been no increase in sinit merely looks that way because of the increase in communications the four manshapes laughed in a thousand voices we have heard that argument before if you hadnt caught me it wouldnt be a crime and it is disallowed but you must admit bowles continued that more than the human race is on trial here what must also be weighed is whether you have overstepped the bounds of your power if you are wrong and there has been no vast upsurge of sin then you yourselves have acted to throw the universe out of balance torngarsoaks vengeance would be terrible the question is have you sinned robin asked it in powerfully insinuating tones the judges recoiled for a moment then answered we cannot sin we are sin breathing harshly bowles mopped his forehead sweating underwater i propose bowles continued that we simplify the issues choose the one sin of which we are most demonstrably guilty and let us defend ourselves against that choose the onewe can only be hung once as a species as a culture if modern man is so wicked has fallen so far from the path then choose one max was thunderstruck bowles projected more power more sheer emotional force than the screen had ever conveyed to be this close to a master actor at the height of his craft was aweinspiring murder the white europe judge suggested i think not bowles replied we punish our murderers they often repent the gods have always granted the right of repentance and loved a people who police their own the gods made man flaws and all they have also made it possible for men to repent abortion bowles thought your concept of abortion includes yours the eskimo finished trianna stithwood was on her feet bowles noticed and deferred to her in body language she didnt notice at all she was already talking in times of hardship eskimo babies were sometimes left in the snow given back to the elements there are places where a baby doesnt even get a name until it can name itself i dont say thats a good idea we dont like itwe never have the fact that some people have abortions just because theyreshe paused for a moment and her voice went a little tighttoo lazy to get implants is is bad we dont like it any better than you do but you cant make abortions illegalyoud just drive poor women to backalley clinics while their rich cousins go to nice clean family doctors thats murder too at least the children who are born are really wanted dont condemn us because the gods gave us love and reproduction but limited the available food and space when she finished her outburst and sat down she was crying hippogryph seemed embarrassed but charlene reached forward and held her shoulder welles paused what had brought that on a few taps of the finger and trianna stithwoods personal file was on the screen he could only devote a tiny fraction of his attention to it his quick scan found no reference to abortion or trauma or specific incidents which might have triggered it not surprisingthe dossiers were voluntary and easy enough to leave discreetly incomplete ah well he thought not his concern he might mention it to vail the judges began to confer they were yards apart but they buzzed at each other in a torrent of tiny incomprehensible voices it was all buzzing now rising in vehemence and falling back while the judges blurred with internal motion the water seemed a little thicker a few more fish wafted by the judged turned back we have come to a decision we believe that it is possible to select a single sin one unrepented in your culture we are willing to condenm you for this one sin the eskimo leaned forward and gave a conspiratorial wink a thin translucent eyelid covering a tiny screaming head i believe that this is called plea bargaining among your people robin bowles nodded we choose your meatpacking industry orson blinked in confusion excuse me every year billions of animals are raised in captivity in dis graceful barbaric circumstances and then shunted down assembly lines the air above the sins wavered and they were in a meatpacking plant and the smell of blood and animal fear was in the air an endless line of steers streamed toward an ironwalled factory building a fluid camera movement took them into the slaughterhouse itself a castrated bull waited its head in the killingslot a milky foam bubbling from its mouth a robot arm pivoted braced an automatic gun against the head of the hapless bovine there came a brief explosive hiss and the cracking sound of a shot the steer collapsed this is the way that your people slaughter cowsand chickens there was an immediate accompanying image of an endless conveyer belt of chickens each hapless fowl in its own metal collar heading toward the decapitation machine a nauseating bloodspurting closeup the chickens legs twitched spastically as the conveyer belt rolled on and another bird took its place it was a treblinka an auschwitz an infinite chorus line locked in a mechanized dance of death there were images of seafaring boats catching countless millions of tuna and then those fish dumped through automatic sizing and gutting machines the sequence culminated in a mountain of fishy refuse guts and heads stinking in the sun they could see it and smell it to maxs right trianna stithwood was turning green to us this is the ultimate sin to us and to sedna this is abortion and on a scale almost beyond imagination compare this practice with the old ways the traditional ways the judges said suddenly there was a crisp calm alaskan vista men tracked caribou across the tundra furred hunters crouched beside ice holes for the momentary appearance of a walrus and then the sudden thrust of a spear max could feel the howl of the wind the adrenaline burn as the inuit hunted in the manner of his ancestors something told him that yes this was the way that these things were supposed to be the way it should have been done should always have been done they were pitching on a high sea seized in the black grip of an angry ocean a boat rode the water a whalebone framework with a sealskin envelope carrying four men they were tough men hardened to the elements inured to suffering they were staking their lives against an unpitying wasteland in hope of bringing home precious food they pitched and yawed and then a flash just a momentary flash and a seal broke the surface the lead hunter made his cast and a modern supermarket bovine doughy shoppers pushed baskets down gleaming muzakgentled aisles choosing between packages of prewrapped precleaned prekilled meat the buzz was almost gone from the voice of their eskimo judge where is the threat here where is the life you have lost all sense of the unity of man with his world and of the price which is paid in blood and suffering by one creature to give life to another and your sin is greater than this the eskimo said his voice rising hes really getting into this max thought good a demigod should enjoy his work otherwise whats the point of demideity the supermarket fogged and cleared to show a cartoon image it was ferdinand the bull oh yes max knew ferdinand everyone in america and sixteen other countries knew ferdinand spokesbull for the lazy taco string of mexican restaurants famous infamous having gone from mouthpiece for a fastfood emporium to a series of bmovie misadventures to an eventual holovision series ferdinand the lazy bull who slyly coaxed cows into the clover and other bulls into the bullring or onto the dinner table was instantly recognizable ferdinand looked out at them and said come on down to lazy taco we serve the best beeefs in the wooorld suddenly he grinned stupidly and his eyes grew huge with mock surprise oh beeef thass me i theenk max was humiliated to remember the many times his sides had ached from ferdinands routine it didnt stop there the parade of animals real and cartoon who had encouraged or begged customers to eat them over the years was long and disturbing foghorn leghorn charlie the tuna the parade was endless daffy duck clarabelle cow porky pig chiquita bananaorson put his head down into his hands oh no even the plants were screwwwwed all were dancing and prancing shaking their collective rear ends happy happy happy to make that consummate sacrifice distracting consumers from the bloody reality of death max felt shamed the four judges of the apocalypse looked out at them the eskimo figure said there can be no defense you have dishonored the inua of the creatures which give you life sin sin said the black man sin agreed the white and the yellow men it only remains to pronounce sentence ah say now just a cottonpickin minute there boy the voice was foghorn leghorns and every head snapped around johnny welsh had spoken a moment later he was hypersupercilious i believe this is my field of expertisedo you mind robin not at all the distinguished actor looked both surprised and relieved bowles sat heavily johnny paused gathering himself you knowi dont think the issue here is the killing of animalsthe more people you have the more food you need having babies is honored in your culturein fact anything that builds up the community am i right couples without children pray for babies its expected that we be fruitful and multiply right the eskimo judge nodded sagely all right the meatpacking industry is just trying to feed our babies if we didnt do that that would be a sin we want more of our babies to survive so we have people who are doctors and engineers and teachers and cops and everything else that it takes for a society to survive were like fishermen who stock the lakes or the farms or whatever and we kill the animals as humanely as we can is there really anything more humane about dying with a spear through your guts at twenty below a gutshot reindeertrianna trianna had a plump arm up she said the dietary rules in the torah demand that kosher meat be slaughtered as humanely as possible im sure that every culture has rules like that johnny beamed approval orsons head was up his eyes were unfocused the oriental judge peered down at trianna not every cul ture japan differs and where exactly does this line of reasoning lead you welsh mocked the orientals tones it leads me to believe the issue is whether we have honored the spirits of the animals you think that charlie the tuna and ferdinand the bull and chicken boy and tom turkey and the rest are insults to their spirit the judges nodded vigorously and so they are johnny shook his head his cheeks jiggled no you missed it where we come from one of the highest forms of compliment is the joke i know this stuff i make my living with this stuff only after an actor or politician has become great do we bother to make jokes about him if there is a disaster in our lives the first thing we try to do is find the light side thats how we keep things in perspective its how we survive johnny was beginning to roll and max finally understood where he was going out of the corner of his eye he saw orson relax when we take a chicken or a cow and make a cartoon out of it were giving em the same treatment we give our dogs and cats and considering that dog and cat care is a multibilliondollar industry youd better not even suggest we dont love the little fuzzballs they end up running our homes eating our food and breaking our hearts oh yeahwe know damned well how much we depend on animals for our survival orson leapt up snow gooses father showed us implements utensils that had carved images of animals out of proportion almost grotesque what we would call caricatures i submit to you that these advertisements are our offerings to the inua they are our way of giving affectionate respect and more than that we dont just make one or two little carvedbone items we send these images out to billions of people every day we pay more honor to the inua of the animals than the inuit peoples did in a century we are absolutely in the spirit of the eskimos and we say that you have lied and stolen and tricked your way into the balance of power we ask the gods whatever they be to look into our hearts every time we say grace every time we make a joke every time somebody works overtime to make a little more money so he can spend two hundred bucks on sushi for four its a tribute i call this whole damn thing a mistrial the judges seemed frozen only their faces were in motion but their features were little lost sins randomly acrawl then the judges began to come apart one buzzing voice spoke the voice of west white europe noyou are lying we have the right of inheritance we have that right the ocean above them swirled the water beginning to boil and the walls dissolving too piece by horrid piece sin city was falling apart the water boiled more swiftly they clung to the strands of hair dug in their tiny claws the current took them away then all was hidden in a wash of bubbles it felt like sednas scalp was sagging beneath max then the bubbles cleared and he saw he was in a bubble and the bubble was rising the other garners were rising around him each in his own bubble welles sat back and relaxedthe rest of it was programmed he pushed himself away from the console and yawned suddenly aware of the massive energy output of the past forty minutes he heard a patter of applause and turned to see dr vails slender sardonic figureat the door of the control room a beer in each hand thirsty unbelievably welles snatched one before vail could blink and downed half before coming up for air ahhh i pay belated honor to the inua of the beer that was nicely done vail said and weve almost completed our programming welles made puppy eyes does that mean i can start killing them please sir just a few of em for their own good he drank in haste then called up an image from the tunnels the subterranean world beneath the gaming areas a cluster of uniformed men and women were working hydraulic lifts switching supports and props under the garners so that they could make their ascent i still cant believe how many gamers dont care how we do it vail sipped his brew watched the screen lips curled with gentle humor ill bet you read magic books when you were a kid and told everybody how the lady turns into a tiger better there was an old magician in town he put on shows in a magic shop and on saturday night hed get drunk hed screw up his timing and you could see the rabbit peeking out of his coat i loved it the fact that the old man had lost it welles took another drink is that wrong hed lost it just enough so that i could see how the miracle was done maybe some of the other people laughed but i thought he used to be great now hes just good he drained his beer and tossed it hell anybody can be good it only takes practice but looking at that old man for the first time in my life i thought that maybe i could be great he rubbed his eyes then looked at vail with sudden suspicion are you working on my psych evaluation tuttut vail said innocently just curious just curious max looked down through the water and he saw her sedna eskimo or inuit and beautiful the encrustations around her face were cracking and chipping away revealing smooth brown flesh beneath she was still burdened by her load of sins but many of them were breaking free unable to maintain their hold sedna had a chance the universe was coming back into balance the paija beaten the angakoks could cleanse sedna if the road remained clear above them far above them light sparkled and shimmered on the surface of the water chapter twentytwo skyhooks a rocket rose up the sky up the dome of gaming a off to alex griffins left at first the launch looked normal enough but stratospheric winds twisted the vapor trail into a bizarre knot of subliminal skywriting and the oversized phoenix craft still hadnt tipped over to make orbit it was roaring straight up the flame died but the tiny silver dot kept rising if something else didnt happen it would prзsently come roaring straight down alex had come in in the middle of something seeking enlightenment he plucked earphones from a rack rockets are inefficient even fusion rockets even antimatter rockets are wasteful compared to most of the machines in common use to a zapcar for instance a zapcar uses only stored electricity its reaction mass is the road beneath the wheels and the planet earth beneath the road there are ways to send spacecraft into the solar system without burning tremendous masses of onboard fuel collectively these devices are called skylzooks none have been built some of them wont work but we only need one that does tenperson carts were available but not many were in use the majority of guests were spaced around the rim of the dome in little clumps watching but also pressing the flesh meeting contacts making deals high on the dome the rocket was still rising peripheral vision caught something coming from alexs right it drifted across the sky toward the rising spacecraft like a widemouthed predator of the deep long and narrow like an eel with luminous markings no he could see stars through it the crisscrossed lines he had thought were markings were it it was just a net a net of superconducting wire shaped by magnetic fields into a bizarre largemouthed eel drifting on great square fins that must be solar power collectors the starwhale is no more than an orbiting rail gun but it will serve our purpose to put a spacecraft into orbit costs fuel wed find it much cheaper merely to fire a craft two hundred miles straight up at that point the starwhale ate the spacecraft the ship was tiny it entered the mouth of the net at tremendous speed at five miles per second or better if the starwhale was in orbit the starwhale was much bigger than alex had thought and moving much faster the ship slowed and came to a halt before it reached the tail we can catch it accelerate it to orbit and leave it there or we can continue accelerating the ship it sped back toward the mouth of the beast up to another five miles per second to send it to the moon or mars or the asteroids of course we must steal kinetic energy from the starwhale but f we can catch incoming ships to decelerate them a ship entered the starwhales tail at meteoric speed slowed near the mouth sped back down the long long torso left the tail and began to fall toward earth ships carrying cargo from mars or the asteroids we can put the kinetic energy back most of those in gaming a were listening to the presentation alex griffin wasnt and he didnt believe harmony was he had come in late and he felt a little lost but the presentation wasnt his prime motive here alex had avoided thadeus harmony for the past halfhour it was no mean trick the big man had stalked him purposefully alex had declined to answer three phone messages and ducked out of the back of his office once it was easy to guess what thadeus wanted and alex wasnt prepared to give it the beanstalk was the earliest skyhook conceived the narrators voice said it would be the most useful and the most expensive a satellite orbiting miles above the earths equator will circle the earth in the same time it takes the earth to turn in twentyfour hours it remains in orbit above one point on the earths equator a glowing dotted line painted itself wide around a huge blue and white earth suppose we were to put a space station at geosynch a classic wheelshaped space station appeared with a greenskinned giant atop it and let down a line to the earths surface the giant flung coils of heavy rope downward maybe it was vine the giant was garbed in leaves it would fall of course the weight of thousands of miles of vine dragged the startled giant off the station and down he became a streak of meteor flame two more giants popped up on opposite sides of the space station they hurled lines inward and outward we must extend another line outward for ballast to keep the center of mass at geosynch alex spotted kareem fekesh without difficulty the dark slender elegant sheik was the still center of a flow pattern of supplicants from a score of factions seeking a word with him his man was letting few of them through that was razul recovered nicely from his battling robots duel fekesh was watching the artificial sky neither razul nor fekesh appeared to have noticed alex griffin the green giants line had mutated had become one smooth continuous tether capsules ran up and down its length in faintly visible nets of magnetic force elevator cars running with no cables of all of these proposed skyhooks the beanstalk is the most difficult to build it must stand the greatest stresses but the beanstalk can lift cargo from ground to orbit and fling them out to the stars for the cost of the electricity a few dollars a pound but that cost is deceptive the beanstalk is also the most dangerous of the skyhooks for if the cable ever snapped flame flashed where the cable broke somewhere above the midpoint meteor strike or only the sudden release of terrible energies part of the cable fell toward interplanetary space the rest thirty thousand miles of singlecrystal iron fiber composite wrapped itself around the earths equator carrying meteoric energy levels the earth strangled in a noose of fire a hundred voices murmured uneasily alex was watching kareem fekesh was that a smile what kind of smile alex had seen smiles like that a faint curl of the lips before dream park personnel plunged into the details of a major problem a very bright businessman might be envisioning an answer to a potential difficulty or a terrormonger might be watching a new and exotic means to trigger megadeath fekesh turned and whispered to razul razul frowned considered nodded a large hand fell on alexs shoulder alex harmony said urgently ive got to talk to you shhh this will be over in a few minutes and youll arrange to be paged away now alex thadeuss eyes were blazing alex nodded and backed up until they were under the shadow of a model mining derrick on the dome above them the barsoom project was building a tower they built it from the ground up and it was already too high no material known to man would support it the tower stood because it was another linear accelerator ferrous rings shot upward through the interior at scores of miles per second the towers magnetic field pushed down on them as they rose lifting itself against gravity slowing the rings to a stop near the towers crown pushed down on them as they fell still lifting itself accelerating the rings until they reached bottom there at scores of miles per second they looped around in a bitch kitty of a magnetic field and started back up the tower it was a staggering feat of engineering alex ignored it what are you doing harmony asked furtively it wasnt until this morning that i realized what ive done name of god man dont worry alex said soothingly im just keeping an eye on things and talking to izumi and khresla and activating tony mcwhirter what busy little ears we have it was all that harmony could do to keep his voice from cracking alex i was drunk i should never have said anything at all so there you have it through the skeletal derrick alex could see four skyhooks on the dome at once tower starwhale beanstalk and a tremendous spinning cable whose endpoints dipped into the earths atmosphere even the cheapest of these projects would be expensive the others are much worse each of these fantasy devices could ljft cargo to space at a few dollars a pound each would cause awesome destruction if it failed and each would be far cheaper easier to build less massive and less dangerous f built to serve mars mars replaced earth mars rotates in just over twentyfour hours but is far less massive than earth stressed by only twofifths of a gravity sudden closeups of the beanstalk and pinwheel showed each to be considerably shorter and much more slender the rings being fired up and down the tower moved more slowly the starwhale was scores of miles long instead of hundreds of miles each of these devices can serve mars for around fifteen percent of their cost at earth their lower energies make each far safer more to the point they may loft their goods from the surface of mars and land supplies for the colonists and materials for the terraforming project but iftheyfail they failed all at once the beanstalk wrapped mars in fire the endpoints of the pinwheel which had been dipping low above the surface six times per orbit now pounded the desert itself until shock waves shattered it misdirected rings shredded the tower a rising spacecraft entered the orbiting rail gun offcenter and tore it into a chaff of shredded superconducting wire disasterlight painted harmonys broad battered face with crimson highlights his eyes blazed alex could see the panic there he asked what do you think im going to do publish a letter in the times activate the dream park hit squad alexs minds eye built him an army of threedimensional cartoon figures dressed as ninjas a blackrobed minnie mouse a swordwielding baby huey and popeye the sailor covered with yakuza tattoos closed in on a whimpering fekesh alex harmonys voice was rigid with alarm stop smiling like that sorry im easily distracted dammit this is serious youre likely to stir up more problems than youve ever dreamed of behind them with staggering sound and visual effects martian colonists were battening hatches and shoveling marsdust to cover glass walls mars was ringed in fire and meteoroids alex pulled back from his friend deeper into the shadow of the derrick away from the illumination of the fireclouds thadeus you hired me because you trust me not just to do the daytoday work but on the big things and just maybe you hired me specifically for this harmony wagged his head regretfully i was crazy were talking about a hundred billion dollars at least alex something on alexs face must have given harmony pause because suddenly he was speechless thadeus alex said softly did somebody get to you if they fail the meteors will pound only a lifeless world well build again and again until we get it right and then we can build skyhooks for earth and then the solar system is ours spacecraft rose from earth and mars all sizes all shapes in everdenser numbers flung outward by beanstaiks and pinwheels they spread across the solar system but alex griffin and thadeus harmony saw none of that harmony wiped a broad hand over his vast forehead checked the palm for sweat no alex theyre just watching all the time sometimes i feel like a goldfish in a bowl listen im worried you should be but thadeus now its in my lap we backed down before that son of a bitch harmony had glimpsed fekesh he studied the tall arab then abruptly looked away we backed down but we had reason we dont do that lightly alex he had us youd almost whipped yourselves before fekesh ever got there you told me about it remember were stronger now thadeus and the girl came back raw coincidence the stuff of dreams and parables if theres a trace of superstition in kareem fekesh he must think the fates have come for him harmonys mouth opened and shut twice without producing sound then youre dreaming maybe will you at least let me know whats going on minute by minute harmony gave a long sighing exhalation all right all right im going to go and make a public face just hell ill be in touch harmony slouched away a big worried bear with an artificial smile plastered across his face trying to make happy with the guests alex watched him harmony wandered across the room shaking a hand here clasping a shoulder there then as if in response to alexs somewhat sadistic prayer found himself facing kareem fekesh both froze then fekesh smiled graciously walked around harmony and disappeared into the crowd alex watched harmonys expression as he turned to watch fekesh leave the public smile had cracked open beneath it was something incandescent with loathing max popped out of the water the bubble above him burst left him standing on a perfectly balanced piece of ice in a choppy sea other garners popped to the surface around him the world buoyed for a few moments then righted a few yards away hippogryph and charlene bobbed up charlene was leaning on her rotund companion they werent exactly holding hands but brother orsons eyes were fixed on the couple and there was if not primal fury at the very least disappointment and discomfiture in his gaze maxs chunk of ice drifted to the edge of an ice field and fit into the rest of the floe as neatly as a piece of a jigsaw puzzle the sky flowed with an endless ribbon of color the northern lights aurora borealis it was stunningly bright seemed near enough to touch and he stood on tiptoes stretching his fingers up what in the world are you doing eviane asked ah stretches she was pulling a lightweight jacket out of her backpack and he followed suit the aircarried a bit more chill here nothing but white nothing but ice in all directions wherever they were it was in the heart of the arctic they had no magical reprieve from the cold he looked down at evianes feet startled to realize that she cast no shadow where she walked her feet left no imprint it gave him the creeps there were no birds overhead there were no mountains or trees to break the endless bleak plain the wind howled and the chill seemed to penetrate to a level beyond the physical the other gamers donned their jackets max noted that yarnall the national guardsman was still with them how hard had the gods tried to kill him out hard to guess but max expected the game to get considerably rougher now he put a hand on evianes shoulder and then walked over to snow goose a light wind from the east blew steadily carrying an unwelcome load of snow what next ceremony snow goose said we need shelter from this wind so that we can perform a ceremony there arent enough of us who are eskimo to build a snow shelter so well just have to use robins prefab units the gamers gathered around in a circle to hear her they looked tired but exultant the wind around them moaned a dirge but their mood was unaffected they were strong they were victorious they were on a goddamned roll were going to need to construct shelter she told them theres a storm coming in robin bowles took center stage in the bottom of everyones pack there should be a segment of a shelter unit please extract that now there are instructions included but if youll just listen to me you wont need to take the time to read them the adventurers formed a circle and max fit in next to eviane each shelter section was roughly triangular and included telescoping rods that clicked together into a rigid frame additional coiled wire ran through cloth conduits the whole thing swelled and stiffened admirably until it looked more like an igloo than anything they had seen since their plane crashed the plane crash how long ago had that been fortyeight hours it seemed worlds away and so much had changed since then eviane still looked somewhat pale and perhaps a bit forlorn he imagined that was appropriate he thought that if he were officially dead he would be somewhat forlorn as well but with strong busy fingers she helped in all likelihood as cheerful as any dead person could be the igloo grew until it was about twelve feet across and five feet high the actor attached a hissing gas cylinder to the tent struts swelled with pressure the tent had become a gelatin mold they crawled in single file the temperature outside had begun to drop in the last few minutes of their task maxs fingers had grown numb he was delighted to get inside where bowles was already setting up a small conical heater temperatures rapidly grew comfortable if not toasty snow goose removed the tin can of cigarettes from her pack and sat crosslegged on the ground waiting for the others to arrive she was centered and calm every bit the picture of a woman who strode between two worlds the inuit and the white outside the wind howled ferociously max could almost hear the voices of the cabal thwarted angry vengeful but in the igloo there was peace eviane gazed at snow goose as if trying to remember something studying absorbing then she seemed to give up the adventurers ringed them round bowles stithwood hippogryph yarnall the sands brothers dula titus frankish oliver welsh eviane hebert these were the warriors of the west and they had to be enough snow goose spoke you know weve won like major gold there was a round of applause and a great hearty lot of backslapping snow goose let it die back down she said we should get a chance to rest pretty soon now i was wondering if anyone was going to remember that part trianna said im pooped there was a general chorus of agreements about that too we need another ceremony first we must reach my father the elders who helped us with our last ceremony cannot aid us now but i have something that they didntone of the dead whose love for this world brought her back to be with us she walks between worlds and in traveling from death to life has gained great power eviane you will sit at the center of our circle you will help us to open a window between worlds with evident reluctance eviane moved forward and sat next to snow goose cigarettes were passed around max shifted and then shifted again trying to get comfortable on the thin padding under his aching buttocks nothing helped finally he folded his jacket and sat on it again the cigarette was unfiltered and a little shorter than those of which he had seen pictures he didnt personally know anyone with a nicotine prescription but one could still find a bootlegger here or there smuggling oaxacan tobacco rumor had it that a few outlaw smokies still grew the precious leaf up in oregon in patches disguised as marijuana fields they lit and exhaled once again the smoke streamed up toward the roof but this time it congealed above evianes head as well as snow gooses a glowing image formed martin the arctic fox was kneeling before a foamplastic crate they could hear him chanting and though they could not understand it was clear what he was doing for several seconds they watched him negotiating with the inua of a score of cans of corned beef then his head jerked up and his leathery face crinkled in delight snow goose you still live yes daddy have you made any progress how many of the strangers still survive weve only lost one snow goose said and eviane is still with us as my tornrait daddy we have warred with the sins on sednas scalp and defeated them but they must still be combed away you didnt stay to no daddy were warriors not barbers our people may need help to attack the cabal will you take care of sedna its really your job yes i must dress her hair while others fight martin said glumly carry on daughter well done he faded snow goose rubbed her palms together briskly well thats that the tension in the air slackened johnny welsh coughed politely i dont want to interrupt the reunion but my stomach is about to sue me for nonsupport do you think we could get some food there was a sharp popping sound like a vacuum tube imploding suddenly another vision misted the air it wasnt of malevolent cabal members though it was a beautiful woman whose long straight black hair fanned out in an ethereal halo sedna she smiled on them through full lips my children she said and each word had not the bubbling sound he would have expected but a lush hushed womans voice you have freed me from my bondage you have justified my faith in you though you were of another culture you are joined in a dance with us though you unknowingly sinned you have repentedwhat is in your hearts will determine your fates the cabal awaits you you have freed me but they have gained great power and still hold the raven in thrall they will be all the more dangerous now that they know you are strong enough to thwart them you must be careful somewhere out over the ice is the next challenge your penultimate test sednas face wavered and in its place there appeared a strange vista it seemed to be a mountainous island no not a mountain what max had seen as a natural formation was an endless network of slabs of ice set against one another at crazed impossible angles kevin shook his head in disbelief but max was more dis turbed by evianes gasp of recognition her eyes were fixed staring he took her hand it was rigid here is your challenge sedna said there will be dangers both physical and psychic my own energy is taken with healing i can give you one gift i can return to life one who has suffered in your service one who died and even through death served you rise eviane a nimbus of pale light played around eviane her mouth opened in a surprised the other adventurers stared eviane began to shake then the light faded and eviane stared at her hands in amazement max prodded her with a sturdy forefinger yep all meat no filling sednas full lips smiled warmly rise living woman restored to your compatriots restored to life still you have seen beyond the veil of death the power of foresight is yours now and forever rise eviane restored to hope to love rise chapter twentythree the snowmans war gotcha max ducked too late the snowball hit him in the side of the head exploding in a burst of fluff point one of the two judges called the judges were unusual they looked like snowmen more the frosty than the abominable variety complete with carrot noses and black top hats the two odd creatures had appeared at the beginning of the evening break and led the garners on a whistling march to a mountain concealing a network of ice caves inside the cave was a suspiciously warm spring and a banquet of fresh fruit vegetables hot breads and lean proteins after the meal most of the adventurers had been coaxed back into the bracing cold for a little game with the glowing sky above them the vast expanse of arctic plain surrounding them and the specter of tomorrows destruction before them the gamers had adopted very much of a tomorrow we die air and engaged in the greatest snow war of all time johnny welsh wouldnt play he didnt like things hitting him in the face orson wouldnt play it just didnt sound like fun max no longer found that surprising but it still bothered him those two watched from the sidelines looking obscenely comfortable there were two trenches twenty feet apart with low parapets of snow max eviane and trianna manned the battlements behind them crouched hebert and kevin together they composed the reds a gang of desperados if ever there was one they sucked frigid air dizzy with exhaustion a few minutes earlier they had repulsed an allout assault by the blues they had charlene on defense and although she had to stop every few minutes to massage her knees she was actually quite good she couldnt run anymore but dogged practice had given her fair control of a snowball and indecently high speed her first attempts were hilarious her reflexes didnt know which way gravity went kevin threw himself into the game with maniac zeal which was already beginning to flag he had no reserves at all the blues were headed by hippogryph max had experienced firsthand the full brunt of the mans tactical brilliance the cabal hippogryph screamed when kevin turned his head to look pop and his courage hiding behind a shrieking charlene approaching under a white flag to strike swiftly and devastatingly max decided that he didnt like the man the only reasonable course was assassination kevin kevin was winded and flushed from where a snowball had brushed the end of his nose followed a moment later by a dinosaurkiller that exploded on his parka the skinny computerwarrior wasnt going to be much use much longer the situation was grim we have to lure that son of a bitch out max said how pant pant got any ideas pant well he already used the white flag so thats no good what about single combat what i remember reading about a form of eskimo single combat i could challenge him if it looked like i was losing you could bomb him why do you think hed go for that youre bigger than he is max grinned yeahbut i think hes dream park security if he is hes well trained he wont be intimidated by size eviane nodded sounds good her face clouded for a moment are you sure we have guards posted i like playing were on break kevin started max shut him down with a wave stay in character ive got johnny and orson keeping an eye out for the cabal we need the relaxation yes yes im sure eviane seemed vague so whats got you so worried i feel blind i still get glimpses of the future max from back when i was dead but i dont remember any of this trianna and kevin tried not to roll their eyes too obtrusively the two snowmen referees looked somewhat like fluffy white gumbies one waddled over to the red teams walls and intoned the score is twentyfour to twentyfour the rules allow for an extension of the play period or you can go for sudden death max beamed sudden death and the preferred mode mano a mano get that lardass hippogryph off his duff quote me the snowmans eyes twinkled an odd sight you can be sure of it sir kevin brushed snow out of his hair and plopped back against the snowdrift do you really think hell go for it i can hope and if he does do you think you can tuck him up kevin do you eat with that mouth kevin shuffled his feet embarrassed what i meant was ive never actually seen you fight but this isnt some choreographed bullshit max batted an arm at him kevin yiped and skipped away eviane drew lines in the snow with her finger thinking absently ive been here before here you mean this exact place reliving this exact day she smiled shyly something like that its the place and i think i was doing the same thing and it was just as important as everything is today but but different people were there no snowmen and four of us were dead before we ever reached here weve been lucky i wasnt there her green eyes flashed at him devastating no you werent the snowman plodded back over to him the leader of the blue team has accepted your challenge we have a traditional eskimo combat ready for you max peered up over the lip to be sure that no snowballs were arcing merrily toward him and then climbed up out of the slit opposite him hippogryph was discarding his external garb he peeled down to a thermal shirt charlene dula stood beside him delighted my hero she grinned a challenge at eviane max saw his chance and took it my lady he said to eviane i fight for all of us but would you honor me by allowing me to be your personal champion eviane stared blankly what do you mean allow me to carry some little memento into battle with me a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth and finally she giggled actually giggled and said sure she took off her belt and handed it to him max wrapped it around his thigh cinched it tight and tucked the tail in he bowed expansively to her and trudged off to do battle the two snowmen led the way they were great clumsy beasts the heads sometimes wobbling for balance one of them tripped the head fell off made a squashing sound as it hit the ground he had to feel around for a moment to find it the procession marched along it was a moment before max realized that there were actually martial strains in the background soft integrated with the wind until he could persuade himself that it was his imagination but no there it was sousa nfarch maybe a hundred yards from the snowball battle area was a patch of ice fifteen feet across max looked down into it he saw a stirring in the depths a mermaid floated to the surface and blew a kiss at him pressing lips and palms against the surface of the ice she was gone before he could react wasnt she cold dressed like that secrets of the deep the snowman said solemnly and now will the two antagonists please take their places on the opposite sides of the ice rink max looked back at eviane then waved toward the sidelines the object is to cause your opponent to lose his balance while keeping your own if you cause any part of his body except his foot to touch the ice he is debited a point if you lose your balance at the same time no point if you force him out of the ring one point if you both go no points the first to gain three points wins are there any questions what is illegal the snowman grinned that can be decided by the two of you we merely act as referees max and hippogryph approached each other across the ice maxs boots didnt grip the ice at all well he wondered how hippogryph liked it max sized his opponent up hippogryph was four inches shorter but almost as large across the shoulders the man was disturbingly lightfooted for his girth no punching max said agreed or kicking or poking fine or any of that stuff max paused how do you feel about slapping fair enough hippogryph said but not to the eyes or face max studied him hippogryph had a secret dream park security training something else max had a secret too he turned to the snowmen we havent started yet have we not until you return to the edge of the ring all right he extended his hand he didnt trust this guy shake hippogryphs gloved hands clasped his strong man knew gripping judo maybe made sense that plus some standard police tactics would cover any ordinary security situation well he was sure as hell going to find out in a hurry he looked up at the sky the aurora was rippling like a magic banner any minute now it might branch into a go team pennant it was warm for an arctic day at the end of the world max flexed his knees felt and heard them crinklepop out of the corner of his eye he saw evianes face a pale oval partly bleached by snow glare but he could stifi make out the expression if worshipful was too strong a word admiring was too weak they could sort it out later hippogryph and max faced off across the ice max shuffled forward trying to keep his center of balance low one false move and he would end up on the ground with hippogryph that wouldnt do what might do he didnt have enough traction for a lot of the techniques he knew and this was just a friendly match hippogryph bodychecked him max felt strong arms reach up wrap themselves around his neck and torque him over suddenly he was in the air he hit the ice hard hippogryph atop him max was more surprised than hurt and thrashed for a moment before righting himself hippogryph was grinning at him manmountain eh max squinted up at the smaller man does everybody in the world know that no point a snowman called hippogryph came in low and max stiffanned him hippogryph lost his balance started to go downgrabbed maxs arm as he went curled his body and max was in the air again max hit the ice hard but was up before his opponent hey whats going on here no point the snowman said hippogryph was softening him up these tactics wouldnt win him any direct points but they would slow max down all right then sauce for the goose he circled hippogryph who lunged then pulled back too fast he lost traction on the ice waved his anns and max wagged his finger and waited playing a little possum are we he could wait on the sidelines evianes eyes were unblinkingly wide as she watched the action one of maxs hands was hanging out there a little slow to react hippogryph lunged for it and caught the wrist max caught the catching hand yanked torqued sideways and did a jumping scissorsleft leg in front right leg in the back and twisted his hips clockwise both of them hit the ice but poor hippogryph was underneath trianna screamed in sympathy next to her francis hebert winced goddamn charlene looked first bewildered then alarmed girl still doesnt understand gravity no point hippogryph got back up but some of the deviltry was out of his eye and in its place was a little more respect for a clown you move pretty good max grinned and glowed he charged right at hippogryph and then pulled back as the smaller man dropped to hands and knees maxs feet slid on the ice he lost his balance and wobbled wildly trying to save it he couldnt aw shit he screeched flopping back against the ice as hippogryph stood up point max looked ruefully back at the crowd and winced as they groaned hippogryph was at him before he could finish getting up and scythed his standing leg out from beneath him arrgh max screamed and slammed into the ice again this time he stayed there for a minute and glared up two points two points down just like that how embarrassing well he was back up to his knees and hippogryph circled him he wobbled favored the left leg and circled hippogryph limping hippogryph grabbed one of his hands whipped max around until max countergrabbed and stopped himself dead on the ice the two men were frozen then max inhaled powerfully reached down between hippogryphs legs and hoisted him completely off his feet and into the air all two hundred and thirty pounds of him then slammed him into the ice point hippogryph lay stunned eyes unfocused and started to get up he thought better of it and stayed down the two mermaids floated up to throw kisses at him through the ice hippogryph stood up they circled each other hippogryph more cautious now he had learned something that he didnt enjoy max slid a step forward tried to steady himself balanced on one foot and hippogryph unable to resist the opportunity lunged in with a pushing hand max spun and banged bodies with him he grabbed and threw somersaulting in midair and landed back first on top of hippogryph he felt the impact heard the wind driven completely out of his opponents lungs max carefully picked himself up he had never touched the ice the snowman looked at him with an expression which could only have been incredulity ah point hippogryph stood his face darkened poisonously then cleared he shook his head with regret nice move he said we could have used you in mexico city max laughed and extended a hand hippogryph snatched at it max calmly pulled his back and watched hippogryphs feet dance on the ice as he fought desperately to regain balance max leaned forward and pushed hippogryphs left shoulder with his forefinger the smaller mans feet flew out from underneath him and he thundered into the ice the applause was even louder max bent and untied the belt from his thigh and turned back toward eviane her mouth hung open slightly and she stared at him those beautiful green eyes as wide as saucers my lady he said holding the belt out i won this for you and for you alone it is to your pleasure and in your name have i battled he handed it to her and she was still staring up at him dazed and and she was standing very close to him very and i claim my reward he said and bent to kiss her her lips brushed his her eyes so clear and bright clouded with no warning at all she turned and ran the others laughed as she disappeared but max had seen something in that moment a glimpse of a different person he wasnt sure who or what it was he had seen but it was nothing to laugh at or about leaving the others behind he ran out after her max stood in a gentle snowfall peering through the white for the woman who had fledthe recent battleground eviane he called her name heard his voice echoed by the low whine of the wind reflected from far mountains there were more mountains visible now dotting what had earlier seemed an endless plain they were just barely visible in the drifting snow despite the crispness of the air and the comparative clarity ow a lightly packed snowball hit him in the side of the head causing more surprise than dismay he whipped around she smiled at him then ran prototypical womanreaction and he loved it the storm swallowed them both she ran not quite fast enough to stay ahead of him at the end of those short sturdy legs her feet kicked up brief blizzards of dream park snow tossed them back at him the sound of her giggle was intoxicating she winded he didnt max caught her by the wrist and she laughed grabbed his wrist and turned her back into him clumsily trying to throw him over her shoulder failing she broke away again finally plopping down into the snow beneath a small overhang on the outer wall of the ice cave he sat next to her the ridge overlooked a frozen sea it didnt stretch out indefinitely though fog clouded it up at the far end an endlessly breaking wave of fog that rolled and hovered and seemed to want to stay just exactly where it was eviane was breathing hard one thing about being mr mountain for all of his bulk he was actually in decent condition i didnt know you were such a fighter eviane said yeah well neither did i she smiled shyly does that make a big difference he asked hesitantly always she said she stared at that bank of fog as if it concealed answers to every important question oh girls say that they want strong sensitive men when we cant find both we settle for strong some part of him resented that evolution in action she nodded sure deep down inside we all know that something like this could happen that the civilization wed spent so much time and money building up could all come toppling down and if it did what would get us through is strength not just physical strength though he was trying to get into her mindset he expected this to be more entertaining than easy she was too deep into the game he believed she was nicecrazy harmless crazy maybe just lost in the fantasy a little more than most somehow the fight with hippogryph had changed him in her eyes her admiration turned him on hell hed always wanted to be someones knight in shining armor out on the horizon distant winds shaped the fog picked it up and curled it like a gray stormtossed ocean eviane shuddered and leaned almost imperceptibly closer im afraid her whisper was so soft it could almost have been a trick of the wind are you he felt rather than saw her answering nod i dont know what were going to face tomorrow i know its important i know that everyone is counting on me she paused fumbling for correct phrasing michelle is counting on me michelle no answer just im afraid crazier than hed realized yet it felt good to have her lean against him and even better to slip his arm around her shoulder at first he thought she would let it remain there but she stood i think we should be heading back she said as if there was something spoken or unspoken that had ruined the moment for both of them max got to his feet it was not love but lack of love that caused madness and max could not have told where he got that notion in his mind other notions were equally powerful love cannot be forced and were all in this to find help i think i know what you mean about being afraid he said i always get the jitters just before i go out to fight even though its only scripted she looked at him uncomprehendingly you havent figured it out figured what out they had begun walking slowly back to the ice cave the ground had a snowcone feel to it crunching under every step im mr mountain for the past four years ive been a professional wrestler is that good bless you child i dont know its honest farce i guess i guess there are maybe seven people who still believe its real even the grannies are in on the joke we honestly work hard and do the best show that we ean i guess its as good as i let it be so you make a living fakefighting yup three or four nights a week it was fun at first but lately she stopped leaning against the outer crystalline wall of the cave he could hear the others inside hooting and calling to each other as they played games and now youre tired of playing a role tired of playing that game yeah he said i dont want to be the clown anymore i want to be the hero i want the crowds to cheer me not laugh at me i just want he groped for the words respect how does it feel thats what i cant handle every time i go out there in those goddamned purple tights i feel like ive betrayed myself you want to be a hero her eyes shone at him you are a hero i saw what you did in there i saw the way you faced those monsters ive never seen anything more heroic than that how can you say youre not a hero but its not real how crazy its as real as you let it be he closed his eyes and let her words sink in he was a hero underneath all of the flab beneath the memories of jeering crowds so i dont have to be all muscle silly she slapped his hand lightly held it to her cheek then she dropped it their eyes locked the contact became entirely too intense max saw something someone else behind those eyes who are you he whispered she broke the gaze and turned away eviane who is michelle michelle her expression became vague again questioning michelle is someone who needs me someone i let down max touched her cheek it was warm and firm the tip of his finger painted a little heart there with melted snow it was just the two of them in the little overhang max saw some of the others running and playing absorbed in their break time running out sore muscles sharing their fantasies and here he was with this fragile powerful girl she burned with such energy and seemed so terribly weary she pushed her cheek against his hand and made a sound in her throat very like a muffled sob he took her chin in his other hand and tilted it up until their faces were only a bare inch apart just a fraction just a breath of frosty air separating them they were sharing the same breath of air now and then her eyelashes moist with melted snow and eyes shiny with repressed tears closed slowly she tilted her face forward kissing her was like kissing an artless child their eyes met and then hers lowered im sorry im really please forgive me for what theres nothing to forgive he could feel her contracting into herself like a hermit crab it disturbed him im so ashamed if you knew me if you really knew me she looked up at him trembling she kept trying to be strong to be eviane untouchable unflappable a woman who could stare down monsters and fight demons from thunderbirdback he tried to smooth her hair were all here to heal he said as softly as he could its so hard i feel so guilty i heard something once that helped me through a lot of bad times it was written by a man named neal birt he said the only way we can be perfect is to be perfectly willing youre willing eviane or you wouldnt be here if you let michelle down or if michelle let you down you have to be willing to forgive each other and get on with life things dont always turn out the way you want them to just like that her voice was wondering you can forgive yourself just that easily hahaha no sorry but i sure love it when someone holds me and reminds me that it can be that easy and how often is that not often enough he admitted not nearly often enough she looked up at him max she said shyly could we try that kiss again hey it was fine the first time oh well then anything worth doing is worth overdoing she must have missed the lessons on banter she only kissed him but this time there was both child and woman in her kiss and her anns tightened around him outside in dream parks winter wonderland the light was fading but here in their ice cave amid small tremulous gaspings and the rustle of unneeded unwelcome clothing a special kind of light was coming up and it was just exactly as warm as they needed it to be chapter twentyfour overview outside the snow might have been howling but inside the ice cave it was comfortably warm warmed even more by the unexpected circumstance of a warmwater spring the cave was half the size of a football field with vaulted ceilings that sparkled with meterlong icicles yarnall was doing laps in the spring charlene had never really noticed but his lean dark body was actually quite nice probably the best among the adventurers at falling angel only firstcomers carried muscle like that if yarnall hadnt been so intense and serious she might have been interested a flash of pain shattered her train of thought did that hurt oliver let a little air pressure out of the pneumatic bandage on her knee ill be all right she gritted her teeth her knees ached but there was no swelling and no grinding and she was damned if she was going to let a little pain get between her and what she hoped was going to be a memorable evening trianna stithwood and johnny welsh dove in tandem water splashed high and far they bobbled up laughing and spitting warm water playful as seal pups race you trianna yelled splashing a palmiul of water into johnnys face whats the wager he said mischievously what do you want she asked their eyes locked for a moment and then he pushed off and thrashed across the pool i am a follower of cthulhu and lead a mad horde searching everywhere for our vanished overlord but though we need him more than want him still well have him for all time when his city of rlyeh ascends from the sliiimmme snow goosegwenwas leading the other gamers in a series of rousing bawdy songs orson sandss voice was surprisingly high and sweet though it broke occasionally she sighed orson might have been interesting but the hippogryph wasnt letting anyone close he was her personal bloodhound and a dear boy she wished he would be less protective or else make a move on her himself there was something about this dream park that got her hormones running the environments within falling angel were designed for survival and for work one could lose oneself in the thousand little necessities of life software and momentum and radiation shielding and recycling of toilet paper and forget that human beings need more than air water and food to be whole then again charlene pula was ambassador arbenzs niece she was damned rich and that kept a lot of the men at bay and there was her height what it boiled down to was a set of teenaged nerves in a twentyfiveyearold body there i think thats all we need ollie slapped the side of her knee gently and aside from the knee how am i doing everything is fine hon ollie cocked his head at her my professional opinion is that with plenty of sleep and the help of your calcium supplements wed have your muscular and skeletal system up to earth normal in about two months but youre handling the stress just fine nowgo and have fun doctors orders married he was just testing doctors orders she pushed herself up and tested the knee carefully walked over to the campfire by the side of the spring there had been plenty of driftwood available for a fire much to nobodys surprise in dream park the gods provided the adventurers circled the bonfire clapping drinking fruit juice and finishing their dinners two paid special attention to her approach hippogryph marty and snow goose gwen gwens face lit up she asked is ollie all finished with you so he says good kevin kevin had been keeping an eye on the spring watching trianna and johnny cavorting those two climbed out of the water now they dried each other primly but shared the same towel johnny wound it into a rope and snapped the tip at triannas bottom she squealed and ran jiggling to the firelight gwen said kevin oh yeah have you got the verses he was a little sad but forced some jollity into his thin voice sure you go ahead gwen kissed kevin on the cheek and ran off to join ollie kevin swung into the next verse you see i met this crazy arab and he showed me his book i thought it couldnt hurt me just to take one little look but though i couldnt read the language it did something to my mind now im searching for something id rather not fund charlene kneed hippogryph in the shoulder he made a contented grunting sound and scooted aside to make room for her he had been trying to sing but the poor darling couldnt carry a tune if it had handles he was trying hard to be a gamer but just wasnt quite fitting in hows the knee nice she said and extended her leg flexing it a couple of times feel hippogryph probed it gingerly with a forefinger a little light went on in his eye as he carried the probe down to the meat of her thigh she flexed unobtrusively she hoped she had worked long and hard to put firmness there too many of the women of falling angel never put in their full time on the treadmills and climbing racks they had rubbery gelatinous thighs in spite of countless posted cautionary notices and the imposition of penalty points there was even a fashion movement to suggest that it was more attractive sexier somehow to be flabby ridiculous char lene screwed up her courage and asked you like hippogryph tried to slap his professional mask back down lady she reached over and touched her forefinger to his lips ill tell you what you take a walk with me tell me all about it i dont know about this his face was darkly humorous he was attracted to her no questioning that but duty was calling of course if you dont want to ill just stroll outside by myself maybe i can find a nice terrorist to keep me company marty levered himself up truly whither thou walkest i must walk too so she walked him over to a quieter corner of the cave her bedroll was already out and a plate of fruit was nearby just in case as a girl she had been a moon scout charlene believed in being prepared marty squinted im being seduced yes he sat down and offered his arm for support oh well a thick blackfurred arm as solid as an angle iron they sat together in the shadows marty put his arm around her ribcage and sighed i wonder if i can be fired for this bushwah youre supposed to be a bodyguard so guard my body his wide neck was in the crook of her elbow her fingers played in the thick fur of his chest she leaned her cheek against his scalp his hair still smelled a little of good clean sweat from his match with max she giggled what now oh i was just thinking about watching you throw max around hes a lot bigger than you you really did well yeah he growled but theyre the ones off celebrating she nibbled at his ear oh were allowed to celebrate too call it a moral victory another softer laugh besides eviane deserves it shes been taking this whole thing so seriously then getting killed out then brought back and shes so perfect she never falls out of character youd think it was for real points or real money with a piece of the gross evianes a strange one oh shes nice i like her charlene paused listen youre in security you must have seen her files what do you know about her or is that classified he laughed not much to tell shes not an actress if thats what youre thinking and eviane isnt her real name but i didnt pay much attention to the gamer files before i jumped into the game never saw her before what is her real name he chucked her under the chin now that is classified aw pleeease nope she rolled him over on his back and started looking for places to tickle pretty please with moondust on top help he was laughing uncontrollably now dammit stop taking my mind off work her hands started moving slower more surely and marty stopped laughing suddenly relaxed oh bloody hell he said and rolled her over careful lover she said eyes alight youll break something the only thing im breaking is training he said and pulled her to him he murmured into her breath into lips just touching his my selfcontrol is legendary half history half myth you feel solid enough are you fragile blood was rushing in charlenes ears when they broke the kiss very distantly she could hear the gamers singing we will have a mighty orgy in the honor of astarte it will be one helluva party and its good enough for me give me that oldtime religion give me that oldtime religion give me that oldtime religion its good enough for me yes indeed she thought contentedly yes indeed it was everything that happened in the game came to dr vail everything whether it was supposed to or not questions of morality or privacy meant little to vail efficiency was everything and it was efficient for him to know everything that went on when where what who dr vails jaw hung loose as he watched the monitors jagged greenongreen lines shaping hillscapes columns of numbers colorcoded max sands and michelle sturgeon in a pile of clothing yarnall moving smoothly through the warm water trianna and welsh testing a selfinflating mattress to destruction bowles in a circle of conversation breaking off suddenly to bellow a chorus vail looked stupid he looked stunned a camera watching him would have shown no more but vails mind was racing correlating he had just learned something very strange but what was he to do with it he would have to tell griffin something chapter twentyfive madeleine down the corridor down the long dark hall framed with steel bars and steel doors punctuated with steel windows peering out onto a steel courtyard tony mcwhirter heard screams likely it was a wirehead in need of his juice it probably wasnt a beating it probably wasnt a rape not tonight not again for the ten millionth time tony cursed his stupidity cursed the day that an oliveskinned woman tempted him with an unusual proposition one bad stupid decision could twist a life completely out of true it had started out as a lark as a hack a theft of information a bit of industrial espionage committed in a deeper reality like dream parks games and tony mcwhirter wouldbe soldier of fortune was sent to chino mens prison to pay his debt to society the words and symbols on the computer screen blurred out he stopped rested his head against the keyboard tried to find a little breathing space two more years god in heaven two more years of this place if he didnt make parole at first he had been able to con himself into looking at it as another great adventure filled with sinister secrets and a certain noble romanticism then acacia stopped writing because of alex gr ffin tony rubbed his wrists they were numb often felt cold the doctors said that it was in his mind that there had been no nerve damageno permanent nerve damage caused by the jagged chunk of glass and the frantic midnight attempt to take his own life the cold was just an externalization of the emotional void within him hang on two more years maybe less if you can get this he reminded himself hell youre tony mcwhirter boy genius soldier offortune hacker supreme you can get through any defense system in the world alex griffin knows that thats why he comes to you with the tough problems thats why hes done things to make chino tolerable tony forced himself to concentrate these moments were so sweet normally he had access to a computer only three hours a day and even then he was denied access to outside lines he could program and run programs but they werent going to give him a chance to tie into the bank of new caledonia and transfer a zillion or so into his legal defense fund right now his only goal was to penetrate the defensive shields of a man or corporate entity named kareem fekesh the routing was standard dream park had an executive line which automatically allo ed it to talk to the computers of other companies on a more intimate basis it was like knowing the address of your intended victim and having enough grease to get past the guards at the front gate you still had to have the chutzpah to get through the guard at the front door con your way up to the bedroom find the combination safe and crack it but he was in the front gate dream parks computer called one of fekeshs subsidiaries there were over two hundred in spite of his general misery mcwhirter had to whistle this man was loaded oil gold entertainment and transportation were the very least of it entertainment a tiny light went on in the back of his mind tony mcwhirter had a private obsession and part of his mind traced back over it even as he was probing the defenses of an autoteller system that served a merchant bank he was tinkering teasing the system trying to understand its protocols and methods and while he did he thought back over the years every time griffin opened dream parks communications systems to him tony had taken a little of his time not enough so that anyone could notice to investigate the structure of dream park and cowles industries he knew just about everything that there was to know about alex griffin tony even knew how many times acacia had visited him at cowles modular community he knew that they had gone skiing together twice in aspen he didnt want to know any more than that he forced himself to be satisfied knowing that they had last communicated by phone eighteen months ago this was only selfflagellation other probes were more practical seven years ago a darkskinned woman named madeleine offered him twenty thousand dollars for a special job during trial proceedings dream parks artists had asked for a complete description of madeleine to be made into a computerbuilt identifax portrait tony had given them everything he could remember they had searched he had checked they had found no trace of the mystery woman later he had fished the composite out of dream parks memory banks every time he penetrated the security system of a company having anything at all to do with chemicals or entertainment he entered their personnel files and looked for madeleine no luck over seven hundred major companies and subsidiary lines had given him nothing at all still he looked the automatic program had wormed its way through the exterior defensive shields more involved ones would be coming up tony bore down for an hour testing doors looking for a way into fekeshs system he found it in their accounting department he couldnt transfer funds not at this level of sophistication but he could look into files which had been set aside for a tax audit there he found a coded key which got him up to the next tier he ran around the edge of the tier and then found a bridge to enter the core system he was in just looking but in and while he was in he began to coprocess the personnel files looking for madeleine oh yes fekesh was into everything and everything was into fekesh there were no direct financial ties to what griffin was looking for but beyond a shadow of a doubt fekesh had invested heavily in cowles industries eight years before tony wondered about something and took another look this time at the current investment portfolio interesting there were tens of millions of dollars invested in entertainment and none of it was headed for cowles he insti gated a side search program looking for corporate shells and something snagged in his peripheral vision a little red flag in the lower left corner of the screen for a moment he didnt realize what it meant he hadnt seen it in this context in over seven hundred attempts now cautiously he opened the flag and studied what came through the name madeleine wasnt mentioned the face which matched dream parks identifax belonged to a woman named collia aziz she had accompanied kareem fekesh to a company picnic and was described as attractive the man who had written that line could never have been close enough to touch her or smell her perfume or watch her moving lips and changing posture and the signals they sent across a room or the width of an oil mattress tony clamped down hard shutting out the memories that way lay madness collia or madeleine or eleanor roosevelt she could call herself but tony mcwhirter would never forget shed cost him acacia shed cost him seven years of life and counting and it was her and wasnt it interesting that the woman who had destroyed his life had connections to a company griffin was interested in right now the other processing job finished itself routed through a halfdozen corporate shells and offshore accounts over this past year fekesh had put together an investment company which had bought sell orders of cowles industries now why would fekesh be expecting the price to drop tony sat back feeling muscles relax throughout his body his success had the taste of new threats fekesh was planning something hed tried to destroy dream park once maybe twice this time would he succeed why was tony mcwhirter feeling protective of dream park fekeshs machinations had put him in chino thwarting fekesh would be appropriate and hey hed done it hed found his ticket out griffin was going to shit bricks chapter twentysix the beanstalk brunch alex griffin snapped awake totally alert and sweating he had to have been dreaming those were the only times when he awoke wondering confused eyes focused and staring lips pursed to whistle for the ceiling light then pausing he had to have been dreaming but he couldnt remember the dream since childhood alex had had trouble remembering his dreams it rarely deviled him alex supposed he was one of those rare and fortunate people for whom reality was enough but when he woke up slimed with sweat gelatinous nightimages sliding away like corpses sinking in oily water then he knew that he was lying to himself of course he dreamed hed never stopped he just didnt really want to know what was down there in the depths he lay there for a few moments breathing shallowly then rolled out of bed he felt around for his slippers and slipped them on he turned the clock to face him onethirty in five hours he would be expected to be up and about attending to the business of the day he might as well get to it now alex lifted his body out of bed he felt heavy and didnt quite understand whyhe was in perfect physical condition disconcerting a diet maybe how about the fat ripper special there was something intrinsically absurd in that idea but he didnt laugh he was too tired one part of his mind kept digging for that last elusive dreamimage and it kept wiggling away from him musing he headed for the shower if there was really something important lurking in his subconscious it would eventually come out and say hi the midnight streets of dream park were deserted facades once again but in alex griffins mind they were full he nodded occasionally to a roving security or maintenance man ordinarily he loved walking these streets at moments like this it seemed that the park existed for him alone oh there were the times that the park or a section of it was closed to all but employees and their families at those times the entertainers put on their very best performances it was rawer and bawdier outsiders had paid hefty bribes to get into those parties that backstage feel was dream park at its best celebration for its own sake and an opportunity for them all to take a breath and relax and see what they had accomplished and smile to each other we are the magicians they could say did say at those times we bring the dream to life and were the only ones who can and around the world people put hours and sweat into jobs that often have little meaning to them saving up to come to dream park to buy the most perfectly par caged dreams in the world and now alex wandered along glory road by dead of night tonight there were no couples from kansas and calcutta towheaded or oliveskinned children tagging along in a state of shock the deserted streets offered his imagination a panoply of clowns and capering performers there was so much here so many exhibits that he rarely roamed the streets without discovering something new and precious he smiled fleetingly up as the faintly glowing shape of the stapuft marshmallow man swaggered past tonight he had no real sense of wonder tonight he searched the faces of the employees looked at the buildings remembered the illusions contemplated his tomorrow because something was happening in dream park it was going on right under his nose in the middle of the barsoom project in the middle of the fimbulwinter game it deviled him because instinct or some subrational thought system had identified a world of true problems potentials for hideous disruption and they wouldnt let him sleep or was his nightmare only a memory of failed skyhooks smashing across mars and earth for a time alex griffin had looked upon this magical place as a job cushier and more interesting than most other jobs to be sure but the south seas treasure game had taught him things about himself and his ability to slip into fantasy that he never would have believed he had learned something about dream park that he never could have learned from the outside looking in at the next board meeting alex had formally proposed that every employee be required to attend a game as a condition for promotion alex griffins lesson had come late and hit hard in the south seas treasure game reality had intruded lethally upon fantasy there were zombies and monsters and wizards and thieves a hidden murderer and a wonderful magical interlude with a beautiful girl named acacia and all of his conceptions of dream park were jarred to the core hed been voted down but how else would his people learn the true nature of the park how easily could cynicism grow if one saw only the nuts and bolts and rarely experienced the final product how could you empathize with the customer unless you saw what the customer saw unless at least once you felt what he felt if you truly understood then when you saw customers staggering around the park in a general state of emotional overload you could help them or at the very least comfort them with a silent yes i know and that made all the difference how would the public feel if they knew about the men in black who manipulated the puppets the stage assistants who spirited the lady out of the box and put the tiger in and other darker uglier magics they shouldnt know didnt want to know and it was his job their job to protect the illusion that was why it was necessary to understand to experience that illusion deeply and intimately the streets were deserted now only a few of the neon plastic or holographic signs were functioning a few forlorn sweeper bots cruised the streets and one of them cruised at him then paused humming at his feet it beeped apologetically and continued on its industrious way alex griffin understood how it felt ambassador arbenz had been surprised but polite and responsive to alexs request for a midmorning interview i havent time for a private breakfast but ill take my morning constitutional on my way to the beanstalk conference so alex tubed over to the hotel gulliver to meet the ambassador at nine oclock hotel gulliver was always a wild experience the furniture was constructed as if by miniature hands for the pleasure of giants or roughly hewn as if by giant hands for brownies the desk clerks were helpful elfsized figures who happily balanced atop one another in their eagerness to sign you into the books elevators were hauled up and down the elevator wells by giants who paced outside the windows pulling enormous cables ambassador arbenz was in the brobdingnag wing alex took the outside elevator through the glass wall he could see a titanic man with a receding hairline pulling him upward by a thick hemp rope the giant panted he perspired there was a conspicuous knot in the rope where it must have broken beyond the great bald head alex could see the laputa tower floating unsupported he couldnt see his favorite the tower of the houyhnhnm with its statues of saint francis and saint ed mr griffin the ambassador said he strode across the room and clasped alexs hand firmly richard arbenz wore a wellcut purple walking suit that flattered his ectomorphic profile his hair was gray he might be the oldest of the falling angel crowd but he seemed perfectly comfortable in earths gravity griffin guessed that arbenz worked long and hard to keep his muscles bones and ligaments strong i have a very full schedule today please forgive me if we can only talk on the move these are crucial times in the negotiations what i came for wont take much time alex assured him in the kitchenette the smell of freshbrewed coffee was becoming obtrusive coffee arbenz asked the president of colombia sends it personally an appreciation for a hydroelectric project falling angel helped to plan and execute alex found he was edging backward with that wonderful scent in his nose and a memory of battery acid in his belly sorry no ulcer may castros ghost raise revolution in colombia oh pity arbenz finished his own cup in one smooth gulp well then lets proceed the ambassador led alex out and to the nearest elevator he set a swift pace their elevator was lowered by the same perspir ing bald giant the city beyond him seemed composed of blocks the size of houses despite the size of the inhabitants the view was really rather enchanting very well arbenz said looking down on the top of alexs head what is it that i can do for you well alex still felt a bit uncomfortable arbenz was seven inches taller than he even though earths gravity had stooped him by an inch or two there was an incident in one of our games its the game your niece is in arbenz became very alert indeed an incident the elevator thudded down the door opened as if jarred and arbenz strode through the lobby at a brisk walking pace at least for arbenz it was walking alex would have felt ridiculous breaking into a jog but as he tried to match the ambassadors longlegged stride for the first time in his life he understood why racewalking was an olympic sport the gray hair must be premature no old man raised in low gravity could outrun alex griffin it took him a minute to make his pace both efficient and comfortable that gave him his breath back he said it could mean nothing its one of those a hologram monster attacked the wrong person and the computer killed her out of the game alex spread his hands no real problem no explanation either arbenzs long face creased with concern was it charlene alex gulped air felt the first flush of perspiration under his collar arbenz looked perfectly comfortable no it was her friend eviane arbenz passed through the vip gate and headed for the tower of night a slender silver projection glistening in the morning light alex blinked hed passed the tower yesterday evening it had been tall this morning it went up forever what he knew to be the towers roof continued without a break tapering to a silver line stretching into the blue zenith three years ago hed seen the plans for two years alex had been looking at the restaurant itself hed eaten here hed loved the way the elevator took him into the sky and still he hadnt known it for what it was now he remembered the barsoom projects discussion of bridges to the planets the tower of night had been a beanstalk all along by now dream parks special guests were used to the sight of the ambassador and barely noticed his passing all things considered he was one of dream parks less startling sights even on the reduced schedule demanded by the barsoom project there were still enough kaleidoklowns dancing toons and multispecies street vendors to steal the thunder from a mere sixfootfive lunarian a strange girl arbenz said finally with savage satisfaction alex noted that arbenz had finally broken into a sweat i met her only briefly apparently she and charlene are quite close no one was hurt no one what i want is to go back over the threats that were made against you arbenz hadnt looked tired until griffin said that the usual they consider the barsoom project an abomination the desecration of the heavens even the name falling angel has been considered demonic it is an absurd pseudofundamental moslem view of the world people are being exploited for personal gain they had reached the tower of night they entered the elevator as the door closed dream park vanished outside the clearplastic windows was burntumber sand and a pink sky shading to black dead waterless almost windless a dust storm receded toward the tooclose horizon you said personal gain who stands to gain by scaring you off or killing you considering the number of contracts that are at stake id consider that question unanswerable and i surely dont understand why an imaginary monster should have attacked my niece and missed alex nodded reluctantly he didnt either the elevator rose rapidly the tiny martian spaceport town dropped away at fantastic speed and even without the accompanying sense of acceleration his stomach flopped and gurgled he gulped as mons olympus rose over the horizon with thin clouds streaming from its shallow flank at two levels then shrank to become a bump on a shrinking sphere if charlene dula had been killed out where would she go someplace unprotected if the terrorist had missed charlene he must be a fool but fool enough to think that marty would stay in the game with charlene out mr ambassador has your niece ever been named directly in one of these threats no but indirectly yes and a kidnap attempt was made on mitch de camps boy dr camps the president of falling angel correct alex closed his eyes reviewing the information when he opened them again mars was a beach ball held at arms length and the beanstalk span stretched below them like a tightrope across the abyss all right is there anything else you can tell me not really arbenz said the elevator came to a halt and now i must ask you to excuse me there are appointments waiting the inner door opened beyond was conversation and sanity the smell of food and the feel of solid ground thank you for your time alex said and shook the long broad hand that arbenz extended to him ah i think ill come in for a moment i need to check on some things by all means the door hissed shut behind them chapter twentyseven the island eviane shielded her eyes guarding them from a killing glare far away across a vast bluewhite sheet of ice their destiny waited now it seemed like nothing so much as an empty plain but she knew in her heart she knew her pack was heavy against her shoulders but her heart was light for the first time in many months years ever inwardly she shuddered why didnt her memory reveal other friends other lovers it was all a mist perhaps she had taken a blow on the head max adjusted the strap on his pack and looked down at her one massive arm resting on her shoulder it was a comforting weight and she took unutterable comfort from his nearness last night last night the panic had been there as if he really were her first lover she had been prepared to hide it as she would hide her fear before a battle but it hadnt been like that at all he had been so gentle with her that her panic had fluttered and receded as his hands those large clumsylooking powerful gentle hands somehow did their magic his hands were so strong she thought that he could mold rocks the way children use modeling clay but last night he had treated her with such consuming tenderness that she had finally dug fingernails into his neck bitten his shoulder hissed and whimpered until he had treated her like a woman not an overgrown child and panic turned into something else something that was desperate for human contact something that used him and welcomed his use of her what started out as a cry of loneliness became a scream of triumph both of them together howled against the wind and laughed and laughed and touched she grinned thinking how it must have sounded on the other side of the rock at least nobody had come to the rescue afterward they just held each other and whispered in the darkness of the ice cave no talking about the past no talking about the future when the cabal had been defeated max had said when the game is over men even in the direst of circumstances they somehow still believed life was all a big game just the kind of talk that two strangers make when the roar of their glands has momentarily subsided and the flesh is cooling and the wonderful terrifyingly intimate afterglow is erasing the barriers between them in those times lovers talk speak quickly say anything to keep that space open as long as possible knowing that too soon it will iris closed or in other times times that she dimly remembered during those same moments partners sometimes turned away lit cigarettes rose to fetch drinks visited the bathroom succored every bodily need except intimacy fought like demons to keep the moment from becoming too intimate as if intimacy was the most terrifying thing in the world and eviane reflected perhaps it was there were gentle clouds on the horizon the twelve other adventurers stood assessing the coming challenge measuring each other for strength and weakness charlene and her escort hippogryph were only a few steps away soon eviane thought she and max she liked the sound of that eviane and max just like a real couple just like a normal healthy charlene dula broke the spell she angled over to eviane her slender face was still a little slack with sleep a light breakfast hadnt dispelled the dreams completely she stood four inches taller than any of the others and was starting to carry the extra height and weight more comfortably whatever aches and pains she had started with her body was making the necessary adjustments all in all id say that you have had an excellent night charlene cocked an inquisitive eye perhaps hoping for details eviane hugged maxs arm max looked up at the clouds and whistled tunelessly snow goose slidestepped across the icy ground like the rest of them she had fastened a pad of velcrolike hooking blades to her shoes they increased the traction wonderfully she came close to eviane all right she said which way do we go eviane closed her eyes in the darkness shimmering like a heat mirage was the city the ruins she raised a hand and pointed toward the horizon snow goose touched her arm lightly correcting it a few degrees the spirits say that if we head north well reach our goal kevin shrugged his bony shoulders the air was chilly but not quite unpleasant the adventurers formed a line and began to move out the blades on their shoe bottoms grating against the ice keeping them stable hippogryph sidled up next to max good bout yesterday mr mountain max smiled yeah i guess it was he looked at his former opponent you were really trying werent you nobody takes falls like that for fun i should have brought a goddamn parachute maxs grin broadened and a little tune came into his whistle his bear paw of a hand slid over hippogryphs thanks he said that means a lot there were no signs of life it was as though they had gone beyond the pale nothing but the incessantly howling winds no birds no plants just the slow crawl of the bluepink fantasia arcing endlessly overhead eviane began to feel a certain heaviness in her guts a sourness she looked back over her shoulder already the mountains were far behind them in this strange and magical land time and distance didnt seem to have the same significance they did in the outside world more of the cabals doing she would imagine are you afraid she asked max he wore a threeday stubble of beard and frankly she liked it without it there was a certain babyishness to him he seemed soft and vulnerable with the dark beard he seemed dangerous for that matter so did orson of course maxs eyes were hooded serious but his voice was merry only a fool wouldnt be afraid ah her man he didnt fool her for a moment he was the bravest handsomest once again she caught a sidewise glance at those flashing eyes peering ahead into the danger as if there was nothing in the world that could stop him at that moment she was sure that he was right and she was happy that he was hers and michelle still hiding behind stern strong eviane giggled like a happy child they had been walking for an hour before the ice began to vibrate it was a gentle sensation at first and she marked it down to loose shoes or the slipping of her ice grips on her soles or the sound of the marchers around her but terror was already rising along evianes spine a few seconds later she heard it thrumming more powerfully rhythmically a deep ringing like a man striking a gong she felt it more than heard it as if she were an ant crawling along the edge of the gong and now the terror was yammering in her frontal lobes hey robin bowles was the first of the others to comment on it and there it was again this time the entire field shook the memory of the burrowing mammoth flashed through her mind and body and held her paralyzed and mute max grabbed her shoulder and yanked her back all of the others stepped back away from the locus of vibration the waves shivered through their feet up their legs rattling their brains shaking them as if with titanic hammer blows back yarnall screamed for gods sake get back and the ice began to split the fissure line was tiny a delicate hairline that suddenly tore apart and became something hideous jagged sheets of ancient frozen water cracked and jutted like a miniature mountain range eviane rose clumsily to her feet and scrambled backward she grabbed maxs hand but lost it as he rose up five feet on an angled ice cliff she yelped and slid down on her backside thumping into an abutment of ice the environmental craziness began to spread the sky crackled the aurora borealis was temporarily obscured in a swirl of storm clouds and blinding sheets of lightning the roar of the storm the thunder melded with the sound of the ice just a few hundred yards away as the entire shelf split a dark and mazelike form loomed up from beneath it it must have been two or three kilometers across the cry of the shattering groaning ice was a terrible thing rising above the wind above the clash of lightning filling earth and sky with a bonejarring cacophony the birth of a mountain range might have been like that it overwhelmed the senses eye and ear and sense of touch all overloaded to the point that the adventurers couldnt run couldnt hide could do nothing but watch mouths agape with shock the mist and the hail grew thick enough to turn day to twilight the hissing of a dark ocean somewhere deep beneath the ice roared as if regurgitating the last drop of caustic from a poisoned system what burst into the air was impossible and the adventurers sprawled on the ruined ice floe gazed at it in amazement and horror it was a maze of sorts like a windowless alien city carved out of some black stone the angles of it actually hurt evianes head to examine maxs arms snaked around her from the side as she pressed palms against her temples sweetheart he asked in alarm are you all right she couldnt speak her answer could only press tightly into his comforting warmth the citys skyline was jagged with crystal spires too thin to support themselves that should have vibrated and shattered in the wind and spans between towers that twisted like facets of a gem viewed through the center of that perfect stone the angles were there the angles could be perceived but not understood they didnt make any sense max and orson helped each other down from one of the higher shelves and looked at it in astonishment like something out of an escher painting max muttered orson for once just shook his head then looked around for the skinny redhead kevin what have we got here kevin sighed mythologically i havent the foggiest fuck of a notion effectswise i think its a modified threedimensional holographic binary decomposition of a mandeibrot set kevin orson said yeah get a life would you the other adventurers had collected around them by now gazing up at the impossible reality what is this yarnall whispered anybody read about anything like this in eskimo lore there was no direct answer but kevin looked at the vast crystal forest of buildings and shook his head slowly damned if it doesnt remind me of something but i cant remember what eskimos orson said but does it specifically have to be eskimo mythology or could it include mythology about eskimos trianna pulled her collar tighter why whats the difference i remember something from lovecraft about a tribe of degenerate eskimos who worshiped worshiped im sorry it just wont come cautiously they began to move forward the ground although uneven had better traction here the maze was only about three hundred meters away the avenues between the blocks were slick with ocean damp freezing dry a glare of ice forming over everything even as they watched frankish oliver was the first to step onto the new ground he tested it with one foot then looked back at them and nodded his head in a sickly approval lets do it he said thumping his war club against the ground he might have been trying to convince himself that the street wouldnt collapse under him max leaned close to eviane this is weird he whispered long time ago i saw a movie made in about silent black and white flatfilm name of nosferatu none of the angles looked right everything looked wrong this is like that only worse worse he rubbed at his eyes yeah not only cant these angles work to hold buildings up they shouldnt even be angles that doesnt make sense neither does what im seeing snow goose shushed them and pushed them back into the shadows look something came shambling by mercifully it passed at a distance an enormous black shape an impossible cross between an ape and a spider with long hairy arms and the gait of a man who has had his limbs broken repeatedly and set at weird angles and then can still move with a strange and fluid coordination that set evianes hindbrain aflame with panic from past or future she remembered this thing with a dull heavy certainty she knew that some of her friends were going to die the world began to darken and the breath came hard in her throat for a moment she lost it completely and didnt know where she was until max was suddenly shaking her shoulders eviane are you charlene and hippogryph and the others were looking at her with alarm im all right snow goose and oliver examined her carefully comforting her oliver consulted some sort of a monitoring device strapped to his wrist strange sh had never seen it before he peered fixedly into her eyes were you ah having visions maybe that monster its called an amartoq isnt it oliver gave snow goose a sidelong glance said something that eviane couldnt hear yes snow goose said i was just about to tell you that and if you get scratched by its nails you die snow goose nodded eviane reached out for robin bowles and hugged him gripped at his arm with pitiful strength dont dont go in there youll be murdered worse he pulled back what and she turned back to snow goose and you youre going to be killed by things things with no heads snow goose took a moment to collect herself and then spoke calmly eviane we have to go forward there are things to do things to learn if we have to face monsters then thats the biz she smiled wistfully i dont want to be here id rather be back in the dorm eating pizza but we have an ace we have you and you can see things and youll tell us what you see wont you it wasnt a question eviane nodded numbly she turned her head into maxs arms and sobbed chapter twentyeight second thoughts by now max was totally confused the woman he held in his anns wasnt the warrior or even the passionate creature it had been his pleasure to discover last night it was someone new almost a different personality motivated now by a balance of knowledge and blind fear the bizarrely twisted spires of the cabals stronghold rose around them ice sculptures that were a twisted wonderland of disturbing angles and facets hippogryph bent over them concern in his round flat face is there anything i can do max sighed i think shes going to be all right i think weve just got a certain amount of exhaustion here its been a hard couple of days just another few hours hippogryph said but he must have been wondering if she could hold together that long charlene dula slid in next to them and her long long arms went around evianes trembling shoulders why dont you go on for a while and let us girls have some privacy youve got it max crept around the side of the ice wall and looked down at the shambling amartoq it paced as if keeping guard cant we just go around it he whispered to snow goose i doubt its alone this is the stronghold of the cabal its mobile they must keep it moving around the arctic circle johnny welsh was suddenly behind them his voice for once completely serious what for ahtheyre racking up traveling points the further something magical travels that must be it hebert hefted his rifle weve got all of this wonderful falling angels gear arent we powerful enough to just take them snow goose shook her head we have powerful artifacts more powerful than theirs but they have the knowledge if we go blundering in there they could take our talismans from us and become twice the threat what can we do snow goose slid down and sat on the ice her eyes scanned the misted horizon one last ceremony one final spell we must work the magic of our talismans and call for their strength max drew his collar up tighter around his ears goddamn its cold yes snow goose said ahklut may have misjudged we dont have much time she gathered them around in a circle we have been through much together we have slain beasts and overcome fears have walked through the land of the dead we have much more power now than we did at the beginning of our trek but our task now is the greatest of all ive got to tell you that eviane is probably rightnot all of us will survive but we had to try this is our time each adventurer nodded or murmured assent not exactly sure of what to think or expect but willing to go along we must prayif sedna has grown healthy enough she may be able to help us help us what johnny welsh asked although you have totems and magical objects you are still too european we must complete your transformation again they sat in the sacred circle this time buffeted by the wind for a third time they smoked the sacred cigarettes max wondered what the old tobacco companies would have made of this back when you could display tobacco ads on a hundred million tv sets and never face a misdemeanor rap what an advertising campaign smoke camels the cigarette that saved the world warning the surgeon general is known to be a member of the cabal once again the smoke rose up ignoring the wind and the driving snow the smoke puffs shaped a beautiful eskimo woman without fingers sedna her hair was still unkempt but there was more life to her now and she smiled to them he heard the words but not through his ears there was a general buzzing all over his body the very wind seemed to be modulated by the sound so that the gusts of snow seemed almost to be talking my children she said and max felt all gushywarm at the sound of the words i know that you need me and i am ready to give you what help i can look look to the sea my creatures gladly give their lives that this evil may come to an end once again the ice beneath their feet began to vibrate but this was no quake there was a drumbeat music to it a rhythm that reminded max of the music in the qasgiq a rift formed in the ice not fifteen meters from where they stood a black ocean swelled beneath that shattered ice an ocean tossed by strange powers an ocean that rolled and screamed its spray dissolving before the driving wind and out of the ocean crawled a seal but no ordinary seal its eyes were huge and black and they were fixed on orson it humped across the land to him shuddered and died as he reached to touch it its body deflated muscle and bones dissolving like a melting ice sculpture orson frozen with his hand outstretched completed the motion and picked up a flaccid sealskin snow goose said put it on orson lifted the spotted brown skin and wrapped it around his shoulders immediately his expression changed ooo its its so warm as the seals transformation ran to completion the sea began giving them more gifts max heard another splash to his right and a gigantic walrus crashed up onto the land it rolled onto its side and began to melt away a killer whale thrashed painfully out of that black and restless ocean humped across ten meters of ice and died while the gamers shuffled toward the great gross corpse the wind flensed the flesh then etched away some of the bones until only six naked gleaming ribs protruded from the spine the ribs were pointed grooved spearlike max touched one of them ran his hands along the smooth polished length the other adventurers gathered around reached out and grabbed ribs pulled and torqued until one at a time the ribs detached from the spine clubs spears each rib was carved covered in runes max examined the side of the rib he had chosen pictoglyphs carved by no human hand there he was popping out of reality again he sighed and resigned himself to ride the illusion out to the end of the game if they put him away afterward and gave charge of his finances to orson well he was riding with eviane depicting the marriage of earth and sky hardy men and women battling the elements the denizens of the sea sacrificing themselves that frail humans might live trianna had reached the whale too late to get a spear and was kicking at the spine in irritation max handed her his and examined the walrus already the beast was half etched away its intact eyes gleamed at him blackly also intact was an enormous obtrusive erection must be mating season max thought eviane was beside him and her eyes flashed from the walrus to max and back again max began to blush usik she said flatly what here in front of everyone the genital bone its magic her voice was far away the walrus was gone by now only the one bone remained lying on the ground he hefted it a war club and a magical one he wondered if the eskimos had ascribed any noncombative more intimate powers to one who wielded such a mighty tool no dont take it eviane pulled at his arm the first note of a belly laugh emerged like a dogs bark max throttled the rest she didnt notice if you do youll die what i saw someone her eyes were getting that unfocused look again dear its war she stared up at him her red hair flagged in the wind ice frosted the collar of her coat she looked absurdly like the archetypical little match girl she shuddered i dont want to lose you she whispered ive lost too much she leaned forward into his arms what in the hell do you say there was a pause all weapons were checked there were rifles and a few rounds of ammunition hippogryph still carried his flintlock the rest of the toolsknives clubs spearswere all traditional these were checked and made ready yarnall raised his hand if none of you mind ill take the lead he shrugged ive been on borrowed time here anyway if anyone gets killed let it be me i dont know listen yarnall was grinning broadly through two days of stubble his eyes squinted against the driving snow i got through the full day i beat the implementor the only thing that i ask from you is that when you nail those bastards do it good do it solid robin bowles nodded soberly black beard black hair caked with ice until he looked like a mountain man all right in a thin line they entered the maze of ancient ice yarnall held up a hand to bring them to a halt frankish oliver came up tight behind him and they conferred max couldnt hear then yarnall turned lets break into teams i want one force to cross this open space while the other team circles around to approach from the other side a pincers what do you think johnny welsh raised his hand listen everybody id like a chance to lead im just a funny fat man but if were coming down to the line id like to be some use there may not be another chance if you need a decoy what the hellive always been an odd duck kevin a rifle in one hand and a spear in the other raised a skinny arm the skin from the deflated corpse of a sea lion made him look a little less like a walking skeleton me too first group any other volunteers there were and the group split into halves max moved forward to join the first group eviane hung back pulled at his hand imploringly there was work to do max thought squeezing evianes small hand dangerous work but they were heroes all heroes all chapter twentynine the maze maxs breath sounded rough in his throat he was too aware of his hurts muscles hurt everywhere as if hed been in a match a rough match against an inept and overpowered opponent a match that had lasted for days he was worried about eviane getting into a partthat he could understand it came to him now that he had never seen her leave it how were the others doing kevin was doing fine the kid had seemed all sticks and parchment a few days before now he was whalebone and rawhide the wind blew snow into his thin face fluttered the furred edges of his parka and he barely seemed to notice kevin had taken the lead in their colunm the two groups of adventurers moved in a modified pincer movement through the tumbled blocks of the city the oddly angled blocks rose twenty stories tall at first max had thought that they were composed of ice now he saw that they were stone ancient blocks of stone sheathed in ice carved with hieroglyphs unlike anything he had ever seen kevin clutched his war club and sidled up to the edge of an abutment poking the club out and waving it gently as if trying to draw sniper fire nothing he looked back at them sugarcube teeth showing in a wide smile he was nervous but trying not to show it just a game right right they peered out across the space separating them from the central citadel most of the chunks of wreckage seemed to have been abandoned ages before he guessed that the ice on the blocks was as layered as a crosscut redwood lights showed in a central corn plex of buildings somebody lived there or something the presence of life in the midst of this black desolation was no comfort at all behind him eviane was wheezing she was a little better than she had been a halfhour before no longer paralyzed with fear but she was still baggage there was movement in the ruins the thing that shambled through the ruins was manshaped but had no head it was huge it reminded max of one of the goons in an old popeye cartoon it stumbled through the ruins making odd sniffing sounds poking in the shadows it wasnt exactly alert but it was tenacious consistent it kept moving constantly but without a head there was another movement in the plaza a door on the far side opened and a line of human beings trudged out they were naked they walked as if they were asleep robin bowles asked kevin for his binoculars he focused them through the snow on the line of slow marchers he grunted in surprise what is it kevin asked bowles dropped back down into the snow beside him it looks like mikluk he worked for me at the trading post why is he walking naked in this cold magic bowles rubbed snow out of his beard maybe the cabal has some kind of spell on him if they do and i can get him to recognize me it could be the break were looking for the six of them thought for a minute yarnall looked doubtful on the other hand it could get you very killed if i dont go down there and try to save him im betraying our friendship he hefted his whale rib i have this sedna wouldnt have given em to us if they wouldnt do the job then we all go yarnall said eviane would meet nobodys eyes she shuddered bowles shook his head no no need to risk everyone the rest of the team is moving around from the other side someone has to be here to tell them what happened just in case well then what about two of us max asked me and yarnall bowles considered it for a moment then nodded all right yarnall turned to ollie trade you he exchanged his war club for ollies rifle he hefted it lovingly sighted along the barrel that will give us one modern weapon and two traditional ones thats a decent spread eviane clung to maxs arm max have you had another premonition he was only halfkidding she closed her eyes and he saw her eyes moving under the closed lids searching for visions no no but it comes and goes max i dont know if she could play for the hidden cameras so could he listen eviane he said damn he could almost hear the music swelling in the background a mans gotta do what a mans his miserable attempt at humor was wasted on her her eyes overflowed with genuine tears and she pulled herself against his chest and sobbed he looked beyond her to brother orson who shrugged max pushed her out to anns length now hear this you knew that all of us might die on this trip we all understood that im just playing out the hand as dealt she nodded dully max shucked his pack he peeked over the wall the wind had died down a bit the line of naked brown bodies was still trudging along overseen by the one headless creature its long arms lashed at them urged them one at a time into a low stoneslab building on the far side of the clearing from that building flush against the jagged rise of cliff there issued forth irregular horrifying screams the line moved forward again mikluk was third in line at the door carefully cautiously yarnall robin bowles and max moved out from their hiding places covering each other as best they could max ran a modified zigzag pattern through the ruins he stopped heaving for breath max turned and ran his fingers over one of the blocks hard cold carved the layers of ice prevented his fingers from actually touching the carving he saw glyphs and pictographs portraying strangely shaped creatures some of which looked like the result of an obscene and surely fatal mating of human and pachyderm they were oddly hypnotic he wanted to spend more time studying them but a whisper from across the path pulled him back to his mission yarnall motioned with his war club bowles had moved on ahead maneuvering to a piece of masonry within ten yards of the line of naked eskimos max was twenty yards away from here the men and women appeared listless they stood as if in a deep trance or drugged state their hair fluttered in the wind and they stared straight ahead toward the low opening he could see a little into the room now there was no door just an arch formed by stone slabs that seemed almost haphazardly thrown about by earthquake or tidal wave or long ages under water certainly no living force could move blocks so massive deep within the recesses of the alcove lights flickered and shapes moved when the wind ceased howling for even a few moments he heard screams that turned his stomach bowles was right no one could leave a friend to such ministrations regardless of the risk they were heroes he checked both sides and joined yarnall yarnall slapped him on the shoulder and crouching ran up to join bowles bowles was flattened out against the wall heh well the stout actor was certainly trying to flatten himself watching waiting he showed max a sickly smile max read fear and hope and a touch of genuine heroism in that smile bowles motioned yarnall over to the other side of the divide both took aim at the headless thing and it turned to face them max almost screamed it was brownish with skin that folded over and over itself like an old overcoat cracked and blistered moving like sheaths of heavy leather it had no head but it had a face the face was set into its belly it was heavy and bovine leadenjowled with bright little eyes the shape and size of almonds it was utterly evil almost an abstraction of malevolence slits for eyes and a mouth that looked like the teeth within it had chewed their way to the surface leaving the lips raw and tattered the incisors sharp and encrusted with red and brown filth it was the face of a yeti and it snarled at them and opened its mouth for a scream bowles threw his spear it missed and clattered on the far side yarnall began firing the first two shots seemed to have no effect at all but the third drove the beast to its knees the fourth knocked its bowed legs from beneath it it flopped back onto its massive gnarled shoulders bowles motioned them back and dashed out and pulled one of the naked men out of the line the others stood cowed afraid to move or too numb from cold or something but the instant that bowles grabbed mikluk the eskimo grabbed him back his mouth opened hugely in less than a second it had expanded to the size of a kitchen oven he screamed like a dying wind bowless scream was quite a lot louder as he tried to tear himself loose max started out from his hiding place and saw shadows emerging from the depths of those odd disquieting angles bowles screamed get back get back hes already that was all that he had time to say before the others were on him all of the naked frozen men bowles went down their nails and teeth savaging him a second amartoq stepped out in front of yarnall the guardsman was too close to get his rifle up the torn lipless mouth set in its stomachface snarled and it wrenched the rifle from his hands and bent it into a u shape yarnall was frozen for a moment and only bowless screams roused him from his shock from bowles they heard a last inarticulate cry as the light within the alcove brightened and robin bowles was dragged inside yarnall scrambled back tripped and fell max looked at the guardsmans face the fear there was not an act the sight of the beast advancing on him was as intimidating as anything that max could imagine though by now his imagination had turned wild and crazy but max was in motion moving forward swinging the usik he brought it down with a thump squarely between the monstrous shoulders he felt the thump it startled him the beast grunted with pain other shapes other forms emerged from the shadows hissing curses he swung the club backhand across the things face and howled victory as he saw the damage it screamed again covered its maimed face and staggered back max scooped up yarnall shoulder under armpit come on weve got to get bowles no no max yarnall had found his feet he was right we need a unified plan otherwise were just going to get picked apart from shadows all around them the misshapen figures clawed their way out grunting and slobbering reaching for them with long black nails yarnall picked up his twisted rifle mothers are strong max and yarnall helped each other stumble back a few feet before they were cut off three of the creatures lumbered toward them the eyes in the misplaced faces alight with blood fever yarnall and max stood back to back max jabbed at the nearest it tested their defensive perimeter with a looping paw stroke max swung felt no contact but saw a paw flash red the creature sniffed at the wounded arm and slowed but the others charged a claw got past his guard although he felt only a buzzing sensation in his shoulder a bright red splotch appeared he cursed and began to swing his usik lefthanded but the creatures for all their size and strength were clumsier than he and at a disadvantage none of them used weapons time and again yarnall and max bloodied them and maxs usik struck one of them a thundering blow crushing it to the ground the amartoqs torn lipless mouths snarled at him and max snarled back there came a swirl of motion and now the creatures were caught between two groups of screaming bloodmaddened garners johnny welsh had abandoned his rifle for the moment his whalerib sword rose and fell in a glittering arc an ainartoq howled as its hologram chest was cloven to the teeth maxs peripheral vision found charlene dula as a sevenfoot elvish beauty with long thin anus and long slender legs and pale skin and a lantern jaw making her look like nothing so much as elric of melnibonй her ivory sword flashed and struck she moved in and out on those improbably long legs sore knees forgotten in the heat of the moment she was glorious swirling in her skins a primal woman from some lost tribe of albino nba superstars and then the rest of his comrades arrived max howled flash ing his war club noting the red slashes that appeared on the bodies of the enemy as he struck out of the corner of his eye he saw yarnall take another hit from a monsters claw and a shocking buzz surrounded him made his whole body tingle he hadnt been paying attention and a stroke from a fiveclawed hand had almost disemboweled him he staggered back and looked at his midsection in disbelief the spreading red stain wasnt exactly realistic but it was damned disturbing he lifted his club and got a warning shock he backed up this wasnt fair it wasnt supposed to be like this he was about to die the monster was coming closer and closer its lidless eyes staring its mouth drooling blood as broken teeth chewed at its own lips max backed into a wall and he lifted his one good arm in defense or in supplication and suddenly orson was there twoton orson sands ran thudding to the rescue on the point of the b team as they rushed from the shadows tumbling pollmell into the jaws of battle orson interposed himself twixt brother max and the monster and thrust his whalerib spear with a speed that max would never have suspected the monster looked down at its guts in amazement and crumpled max started to jump back into the fray an electrical buzz in his underwear told him that dream park had other ideas so max lay where he was covered his face with his ann and moaned helplessly paralyzed he watched orson the barbarian carry the day orson carried it fine the fighting snarl on his lips would have done credit to a bloodmaddened jungle cat orson parried the deadly paws slashed and mashed sliced and diced and generally made a red ruin out of the ainartoqs as they shambled in to attack the helpless maxwell what a man through and occasionally around orsons trunklike legs max glimpsed snatches of the rest of the battle there was trianna capering with her spear moving with the grace and poise of a dancer hippogryph used a harpoon more adroitly than brother orson and was giving the monsters the old whatfer at a frightening rate max admired his erstwhile antagonists form and style oh what a lovely fight it was the claret flowed war cries arced to the heavens and in general a mighty fine time was had by all max searched the battlefield for eviane and finally spied her hiding behind a piece of bizarre convoluted statuary she was sighting her rifle and carefully placing shot after shot down into the battleground to devastating effect one amartoq fell to the ground shot in the gut and forehead by a single bullet quite possibly max mused an alltime first he only glimpsed eviane for a few instants at a time her face was a small pale oval screwed up in concentration she punctured another beast it staggered to the ground long black paws scratching its back moaned and thrashed then was still kevin titus was a tiny redhaired whirlwind in the midst of the madness swinging a war club almost as big as himself he was a nowyouseehim nowyoudont dervish of motion as long as he kept moving nothing was able to touch him but then he reeled and fell against a skewed block of black ice face to the wall panting like a dying man and an aniartoq clubbed him down from behind the arm passed through kevin he looked down at himself suddenly saw all of the blinking black and red light he said something which though inaudible was doubtless vile enough to blister paint he followed it by saying now wait just a secondow kevin grabbed at his buttocks moved by the hand of the almighty then he bowed to the inevitable bowed further and toppled to the ice dead he glowed black and red in the snow sprawled as if boneless chest still heaving so the kid gloves were off the rules had changed and now death was a very real possibility they had lost two max looked down at himself at the huge red stain across his midsection three the last monster fell the garners leaned on their weapons panting and gasping for breath really heaving this time orson had dropped his weapon he stood with hands braced on knees giving himself over solely to panting kevin was on his back on the ice eyes open to the sky dead breathing more easily now robin bowles was gone this engagement had been more intense had continued longer than any of the others redfaced and sweating in the snow they stared at one another counting only ten of them were left snow goose came out of hiding her eyes flicked to each of her companions studying them their breathing their color at last she stood over kevin he looked up at her isnt there anything you can do she turned away sorrowfully in this damned place even the dead still speak we must perform ceremony or else this one will be awakened to life against us ahceremony kevin asked blankly oliver snow goose said solemnly we need your war club now just a secondow kevin was shocked back into silence oliver appeared beside her implement of destruction in hand all right what is it that you need the head must be crushed the arms and legs severed or he will walk against us wait just a cottonpickingow will you stopow snow gooses expression was mournful truly it is easier on the recently slain if they accept their new station gracefully kevin gritted his teeth and lay still max wasnt watching kevin he was watching oliver who had stealthily made an adjustment on his war club he had palmed one of the blades an illusion now projected from the back of the war club nasty and axelike i dont think the rest of you want to watch snow goose said they gawked now wait just aahhh kevin said mighty uncooperative for a corpse as olivers war club rose and fell and the blade clove one of kevins thin legs the entire leg went black kevin stared at it jesus christ snow goose ahh the war club rose and fell again and again and now kevin was armless and legless basically a trunk murder victim stifi conscious enough to complain about it he looked up at them and sighed in resignation aint life a bitch the war club fell again his head went black kevin muttered inaudible curses snow goose examined max carefully you can be saved but we must make ceremony for you not like that i hope to god despite herself a grin touched her face no i think we have something a little more peaceful for you he tried to sit up well then i a sharp shock made him lie back down again lets get on with it she touched his chest with her fingertips no i dont think that you should try to get up and around the strain could be fatal she turned to the others stretchers we need to move this man to a safe place several of the adventurers dug into their backpacks pulled out flexible shelter sections and joined them into a makeshift stretcher it took five of them to carry him and they didnt have breath to complain tnanna was the only woman and she seemed as strong as hebert i didnt know cooking built that kind of muscle max whispered she just gritted her teeth and kept going bumpity bump the procession ended in a tumbled pile of slabs and blocks it might conceivably have been a temple once but not for any inuit or other shamanic civilization that he could imagine the inside was covered with those oddly ominous symbols again he had the feeling that the glyphs portrayed something important the images were fascinating but until they got some torches set up it was too dark to see anything snow goose shucked her backpack and came to stand over him hemming and hawing well daddy said thered be days like this like what im going to have to perform a healing ceremony on you have you done it before only on a dog well thats something the dog died on the other hand modern miracle drugs will avail you nothing falling angels stuff magic you have been injured by a headless one an amartoq without spiritual treatment you will die she turned and examined each gamer in turn any of you who have been wounded by the amartoqs come forward orson charlene and johnny welsh stepped forward you three lie on the ground next to max not my idea of a dream date but johnny grumbled but lay down snow goose rummaged in her pack and after a few moments pulled out a flat twisted pearshaped mask tufted with caribou hair the mouth featured a rather surreal gaptoothed smile one eye was closed almost to a slit the nose seemed less a nose than a continuation of the deep eyesockets it was carved of some dark wood snow goose slipped the mask on now the rest of you step back she mumbled under her breath and began to chant hopping and dancing around in a great circle their lanterns threw odd shadows on the wall as snow goose moved slowly around the injured gamers as she danced she seemed to become another person left behind the trappings of the twentyfirst century she took on a more primitive aspect hearkening to an earlier crueler time in human history max being very near death rolled his eyes and strove to look the part he wondered how many people would see the final tape and vaguely he wondered how much money it would make perhaps his agent should have looked at that release form before he signed it ah well money be damned dying or not he was a trooper the show must go on he moaned he thrashed his body twitched in time to each of snow gooses capers the other garners got into the spirit of it moaning twitching leaping damned if orson didnt begin to foam at the lips and heaved with sympathetic convulsions orson had watched max perform often enough they squatted in the shadows of that tumbled space and chanted and grunted and slammed their spears and clubs and rifle butts against the ground in primal rhythm snow goose was lost in her dance the thrum of slamming feet and the strike of the weapons the voices rising in crude harmony the torches and the leaping shadows the writhing bodies of the wounded it was all incredibly hypnotic he felt his body pulsing with it rising and falling with it as if it called to something in him that not only had forgotten that this was a game but that he was a twentyfirstcentury man a part that didnt care whether the capering of the witch doc tor or shaman was fraud or fact magic or science a part that lost itself in the arhythmic movements the animal postures taken on for brief moments then abandoned snow gooses dark hair was plastered against her head with sweat snow goose came close to him the leering mouth of her mask was momentarily shocking and disturbing and he felt his entire body tingle another shock through the underwear this one was more like a trill of sensation the same kind of quasimusical note that he had first experienced on the plane it was exhilarating and frightening too snow goose screamed shaking a bone at him then screamed again he arched his body in response and opened his mouth wide shrieking with all his strength gee that felt good the red stain began to fade snow goose screamed the cacophony growing louder and the other gamers stomping their feet to the rhythm chanted uttoeseek snow goose said bouncing on one leg repeatedly aypok pinayoke sutomok aiiyeee and she turned to the others and nodded encouraging them to chant along with her uttoeseek aypok pinayoke sutomok hiyeee over and over until they caught the rhythm max realized that she was counting up to four over and over again and she hopped first on one foot and then the other she bent over them and shook her bone at them his body tingled and the red spot grew smaller uttoeseek and charlenes body arched and she screamed and sobbed aypok and orson thrashed his hand reflexively reached out and found charlenes and they clasped fingers pinayoke and there was an answering chant from the six chanting adventurers they slammed their weapons and their feet against the ground sutomok aiyeee snow gooses body arched and in her furs she seemed not even human but suddenly and spectacularly her form momentarily shifted he saw it saw the flicker of change she was flowing changing the furs transformed for an instant into white feathers her neck was long and elegant and when she stretched out her arms she seemed almost to hover her feet not touching the ground he felt that trilling again the torches flickered and the shadows on the wall took on lives of their own became the shadows of animals in that moment the garners saw their animal toterns in shadow form or sharp relief here was a seal there a walrus there a great eagle dark wings stretching and folding and there and there and snow goose human again collapsed onto the ground foaming convulsing hips and shoulders slamming against the ground again and again as if electric shocks were coursing through her and then she was still for a moment there was no sound max rolled over slowly examining each round sweatstreaked face in turn were these really the same people who had been pulled into a game in an airline terminal a few days before they looked so different huddled here in the darkness protected from the shadows by the flickering of oily torches faces smudged with smoke and oiled with sweat eyes that had seen death and destruction the end of one world and the opening of another snow goose rose to her feet she was panting heaving damn she said i never believed max looked at himself the red was faded almost gone and as he watched it winked out rise snow goose said you are healed chapter thirty the cabal as max sat up groggily eviane threw her arms around him and squeezed until she could hardly breathe it didnt matter that the others laughed their little party of ten was almost alone in the world the survivors would inevitably pair off for mating she was staking out her territory now and any woman who trifled with max was going to be sorrier than she could believe orson and charlene roused muzzily and shared a brief intense hug hippogryphs face darkened evidently he didnt like that much she didnt blame him shed seen the way hippogryph stayed next to charlene a subtle but effective barrier between the moon maid and the rest since the beginning he seemed to consider anyone including eviane a potential threat to her franidy she hoped that orson was slipping into what hippogryph had considered exclusive territory serve him right her man stood once again strong and firm it was good to know that eskimo white magic was as powerful as the dark variety there were not only evil forces but forces of light and warmth in this strange new world it was comforting hey look here hebert cried excitedly in a corner of the cave hitherto unnoticed were what seemed to be a pile of rags and a small stack of boxes a quick and feverish inspection revealed the grim truth the rags were what remained of an eskimo expedition under the rags were human bones gnawed and broken jesus christ orson said they must have made a last stand here been attacked by some of these creatures max looked at the boxes they were marked flare grenades id think we could make use of these and these hebert said there was a cache of survival choc olate in one of the boxes hebert grabbed a handful peeled wrappers with his teeth and began to chow down ah maybe youd better go easy on those tnanna said nervously hey you wait for a bowl of fruit to show up orson began to inspect the wall carvings you know he said theres something about these drawings that bugs the hell out of me im not totally sure what it is maybe it isnt anything important but i think that ive seen them somewhere before charlene stood next to him six inches taller these dont look like eskimos no not a whole lot these other things dont look like any beasties weve seen so far the creatures were vaguely starshaped or octopusheaded one image set the creature next to what might have been a brontosaurus the creature stood a head higher eviane felt awful pressure behind her eyes and fought against the darkness there was an image of an enormous door opening something lurked behind it something unspeakably large and horribly alien are you all right hon max said she leaned back into him let him wrap his arms around her for a moment she lost herself had the sensation of floating above her own head watching as she was cuddled safe in the strong arms of a man who cared for her some tense knotted part of her began to relax after all its just a game her head nodded to her just a game thank you michelle theres that michelle again max said who is this lady who i she thought for a moment then disentangled herself from his arms i didnt realize i was talking im sorry she touched her lips to his and went over to talk with charlene the moon woman rolled her shoulders and twisted the slender bonesword around and around in her grip experimenting with different positions hi she said without looking around hippogryph was bristling eviane laughed inwardly what kind of name was hippogryph anyway we might not get another chance to talk she said to charlene i know that were close to the end charlene said we havent spent much time together you look like youve been enjoying yourself though charlene can i ask you something sure anything i know that we knew each other knew each other somehow before this all happened but im not sure how i just dont know now charlene turned around boy you really get into it dont you eviane tried to smile but the strain was too much please i know that it sounds strange humor me maybe i took a little bump back there in the fight a little amnesia charlene was ready to laugh again you know i dont know whether to take you seriously or not eviane youve gotten so deeply into the game eviane raised a hand the game i keep hearing everyone talking about the game i need to know what you mean by that i meanthe whole fimbulwinter game charlene said mystified all of this you know monsters eskimos fighting talking swordfish steaks and butterflyeating ghosts charlene was looking worried now its a commercial product or you could say were dreaming somebody elses dream somebody elses dream something in evianes mind relaxed for a moment for just that moment everything seemed clear it was all a game and charlene was her friend and they were all in a place called dream dream park the mists closed in again but this time they left her feeling unaccountably calm and centered she stood brushed herself off in a businesslike fashion and said well shall we get on with it sure charlene said she tried to keep her face sober but another grin broke out you know youve really made my vacation impulsively eviane bent over and gave her friend charlene a quick affectionate peck on the cheek it felt right the shadows of the tilted slabs offered shelter from prying inhuman eyes but not enough to make max comfortable they had lost two that realization hit him hard they had been living in a fools paradise death waited around every corner the island fortress had the appearance of a city partially destroyed by an earthquake great slabs of rubble lay toppled everywhere he had the disturbing impression that a gigantic insane child had striven to build a city and then tired of its accomplishment had destroyed it in a fit of pique and there were things moving in the rubble things that had no analog in the world that he knew creatures grotesque beyond his imaginings creatures on the hunt he didnt have to be told what they were hunting for johnny welsh crawled up through the shadow to crouch next to max they were in an enclave formed by the shadow of two slabs joined together in a steeple shape from their perch they could look down on the cabals meeting place the cave was ringed with broken statuary once again the statues seemed not of inuit derivation they portrayed strange alien shapes hideous shapes and max felt a little ill just examining them from a distance but there was worse going on down there although the line of shambling eskimo zombies had disappeared a ceremony continued in full swing they could hear it and through the dark heavily veined chanting they could hear a familiar voice screaming in agony thats robin johnny said theyve got him and i dont know what the hell theyre doing with him but weve got to stop them just ahead of max yarnall agreed all right now listeni think we can work our way around above the place theyve taken robin he pointed see that stream of smoke i think theres a vent hole there we can spy lets be careful max said that terrain looks rough last thing in the world we need is a twisted anlde the three of them crawled backward along the narrow tunnel until theyd reached the other adventurers all right yarnall said he scanned each anxious face in turn we have to mount a rescue operation for robin weve got to work our way to the other side of the clearing i need volunteers charlene raised her hand and then hippogryph and max evianes shot up an instant later all right heres the plan ahjust a second yarnall hebert interjected who died and made you king if youve got a plan now would be a terrific time to share it yarnall was smiling indulgently otherwise i would suggest that we proceed hebert reluctantly agreed yarnall was warming to his task all right two groups volunteer group how are you at climbing charlene was most enthusiastic i can do that ive been feeling stronger every day all right then both groups will work their way around one at a time each group watch for the other cover in teams when we reach the far side thats when we need the most care then we send the volunteer team in he began to draw a diagram on the ground ive been here before ive eviane stumbled but darling max caught her hand and pulled her to safety the jumble of tumbled slabs was disturbing in a way that she found difficult to express at other times during their adventure she had experienced dйjа vu here she had the feeling that some of the angles werent angles at all that they were illusory pockets when she stared at them it was like staring at one of those damned optical illusions where the angle went from obtuse to acute as your depth of focus changed she waited in the shadow waited for yarnall to give her the signal to cross the space was so vast the hieroglyphics so disturbingly unearthly that she felt like a bug dashing across an alien cereal box she ran as fast as she could heart pounding in her chest hippogryph caught her hand and pulled her up to the level of the next slab their eyes met for a long tense moment and then he crinlded in a smile come ontoo late for thatyoure spoken for from somewhere deep inside she summoned a laugh but it was in no way genuine her hand found a grip and she pulled herself up the last few feet of horizontal slab had been somewhat spongy damned lucky in case anyone fell she looked down at the slab from where she was the hieroglyphics took on a new appearance like viewing the abstract rock drawings in the andes that old von daniken had used to prove that the ancients had set out welcome mats for vacationing aliens from up here the hieroglyphics seemed to fit together she could see that the images were in series as she climbed higher from slab to slab she could see more of them in this whole area the crumbled wall which seemed to stretch a thousand yards and more the hieroglyphics resembled nothing so much as a comic strip an illustrated story as max helped her to the top slab she lay down on her stomach and read the story stretched out below do you see what i yeah he said but i dont quite understand what it means manna was climbing below her she stopped too and brushed a few strands of blond hair out of her face to examine the pictures below come on max hissed time to read the comics later eviane crawled across a pitted stone surface to the other side where finally they could look down on the stronghold of the cabal the sound of chanting and screaming had grown more pervasive and robin bowless voice more distinct eviane clutched her hands to her head visions of horror crushed in on her devouring her desperately needed confidence when she thought about the plain of hieroglyphics below she could see the pieces the shadows and outlines but she also saw a hideous shape a form thpt was only hinted at in the drawings and this was no drawing in her mind she saw it titanic octopusheaded making sounds that it would be blasphemy to translate into any human tongue are you all right trianna asked eviane opened her eyes stared into her companions face was this woman going to die she had had visions about some of the others and one of them had already come true they were trying to rescue robin bowles but with every fiber of her being eviane knew that it was already too late but was trianna specifically already one of the dead eviane stared into the face trying not to listen to the wind to remember the creature around her to resolve her riddle named michelle and discover was tnanna going to die why are you looking at me like that the girl asked eviane lied i just realized that this is almost over and we never really sat down and talked i dont know you at all trianna smiled well have time after its all over i hope so eviane said i really hope so the adventurers looked down over the rocky decline that separated them from the stronghold of the cabal a wisp of pale smoke drifted up from a round ventilation hole marking the spot i think i see a path francis hebert said see there max shielded his eyes dammit i cant tell whether thats concave or convex this place is crazier than chopsticks for a snake ill go first francis said hebert slipped the first couple of feet adjusted himself and found purchase eviane noted the bonebreaking distance that he would fall if the next slip were as bad as the first she held her breath ollie and orson followed him down the side of the cliff at intervals ollie had juryrigged a bandoleer from his belt and strung a string of flare grenades from shoulder to hip they clanked when he moved hebert winced at one of the clanks he glared back at ollie and just for a moment forgot to watch where he was stepping eviane saw what was going to happen a good three seconds before she managed to scream one of the shadows fluxed it concealed an angle which had seemed convex until heberts foot moved across it then it was no angle at all it was a black gap and heberts foot was in it and hebert was still descending then it was too late hebert scrambled for purchase eyes mad ollie tried to get down to him but it was to no avail hebert didnt cry out even at the moment of death he kept control knowing that the sound of a scream would betray them all and then he was gone mistake max said nervously he made a mistake orson looked back over his shoulder test the ground test the ground at every step too late for hebert eviane muttered ollie tested the ground where hebert had fallen through there was no ground there just the illusion of solidity and a shadow that seemed too dark to be entirely natural cautiously ollie moved around it three they had lost three in as many hours it made them nervous they slid down the side of the defile testing those odd hallucinogenic angles one after another staying in the shadows ever closer to the place of robin bowless torture and imprisonment they reached the smoke hole without incident and paused as the music fluxed and robin bowles screamed again the stone throbbed beneath evianes feet she could hear the chanting and she could feel the moans of agony what were they doing to bowles she remembered those soundsdйjа vubut she had no image of what was going on just the deep terrible dread she bumped into yarnalls foot and swallowed an oops he touched a finger to his lips then scooted sideways so that she could move in next to him there was a spot where the stone slabs parted to make room for a rising column of smoke from time to time the pulse of smoke ceased and then yarnall shielded his eyes and looked down into the hole he pulled his head away struggling against a retching cough i cant see a thing he whispered as another soultearing scream vibrated the stones charlene reached into her backpack extracting a pair of snow goggles she whispered here try these eviane adjusted the strap and snugged the glasses down over her eyes she touched yarnalls shoulder to move him out of the way and peered down for a few seconds she coudnt see anything then the smoke began to shift every few seconds she turned her head away from the hole to pull in a breath of fresh air and then looked back down slowly slowly she began to place the objects and events in the ancient temple below the room functioned as a qasgiq of sorts perhaps even the one seen in their earlier vision there was a circle of men and women around a central fire and there was something else stretched out on a lateral framework writhing in torment wasthe corpse of robin bowles oh he was dead all right eviane knew that much a low fire cast hellish orange shadows on the walls illuminated the proceedings to show her more than she wanted to see robin bowless corpse was stretched spreadeagled on the rack and his internal organs very carefully removed a cavernous hole gaped in the middle of his body one of the men sitting in the circle stood and reached into the corpse he wrenched free a handful of glistening red and cast it onto the fire eviane gagged the wind changed and she accidentally inhaled a rancid whiff of sickeningly sweet smoke the man spoke interloper he said you who came to break our power your soul is ours now and i command you to tell us everything robin twisted on the rack as if he was still alive the bonds cutting into his already red and raw wrists told you told you no the cabalist thundered everything everything eviane pulled her head away from the hole breathed a few gulps of clean air and then hazarded another peek she recognized the man this time it was ahklut the son of martin the arctic fox his dark scarred face was twisted and gaunt now that she thought of it all of them looked sick her tendency was to mark that down to the unspeakable evil of their practices but now looking at the twelve members of the cabal she saw that one and all seemed spent sickly and diseased as if each had paid some ungodly price for the necromantic gifts and powers they coveted the leader reached into robins body and chanted something so low that she couldnt hear it and then he twisted robin screamed she hoped never to hear another such scream she slid back against the rock slab panting yarnall pulled her goggles away from her and donned them hanging over the smoke stack to hear what was going on aiiiee robin sounded like a soul dragged over the coals all right all right all right the leaders voice was smarmy with selfsatisfaction good speak what could have given you enough power to overcome our bathers we my companions carried magic of our own magic greater than the skymetal there was a general hush of anticipation and eviane heard herself saying no robin wherever your soul is dont let them force you aiiie she didnt need to see to know what had been done yarnall crawled back next to her choking good lord did you see what they were charlene took the goggles away from yarnall and looked for herself for about three seconds they play rough she said bowles shrieked madly falling angel wire woven into our backpacks and tents round and round it goes and where it stops yarnall blanched lets get the hell out of here robin just spilled his g i mean hes told them everything theyre going to be looking for us for us charlene asked her lantern jaw worked furiously on a nonexistent stick of gum if they can get the falling angel wire theyll have more power than ever before we may have made a mistake bringing it to them the three of them cautiously climbed back up the mountainside testing the shadows as they went eviane felt sickened but utterly determined they worked their way back to where seven gamers waited for them in a pocket of shadows johnny welsh and snow goose spoke simultaneously what did you see yarnall informed them in graphic terms of the cabals dread necromancy can we turn him off somehow robin is beyond any help i can offer snow goose looked sickened orson and max squatted together whats our play orson leaned back against one of the stone slabs well i would say that yarnall is right were in for a bad time look at it this way weve freed sedna and shes growing healthier by the moment id guess the cabal must be desperate they need that wire they also know were here so i would expect things to hot up frankish oliver crouched next to them looking slightly pancho villaesque in his bandoleer what are our options weve come too far to back out and if we run we have nowhere to run toas long as the cabal is safe the whole world is in danger so what do you think snow goose asked wellthe satellite the skymetal its here somewhere they worship it its been the source of much of their power it has to be here we cant take it with usyou can see what it did to them damned thing is radioactive they were downcast looking at each other as if hoping that one of their faces might hold an answer snow goose spoke quietly i hate to suggest it because it is a totem of such power but if it cannot be used safely id say not yarnall reiterated look how sick the cabal are nothing but magic is holding those bastards together she nodded then it must be found and destroyed destroyed charlene said how thats a good question daddy never said anything about this maybe we could get it out of their reach charlene offered bury it under a glacier or in the sea or maybe give it to one of those land whales i think one of them is a land whale orson said blow it up yarnall said olivers got those flare grenades johnny welsh shook his head not enough id think orson had been staring into the wall listen people he said voice dreamy these magical objects are like storage batteriesthe further they travel the more magic they hold right yeah johnny welshs mobile face was twisted with concentration as he strove to secondguess orson orson rubbed his hands together warming to his theme what if the storage battery metaphor holds true in more ways than one couldnt we rig some kind of forced discharge i mean or shortcircuit them got it max said snow goose if we gathered all of the falling angel wire into one place all of the backpacks and tents dumped them on the satellite wreckage do you think you could cook up a spell that would drain it snow goose thought for a moment wait she said i need to meditate about this she closed her eyes and pressed her hands against her ears chanting softly eviane felt the excitement it was a terrific idea executed properly it could destroy the power that the cabal had used to bind the raven throwing the whole situation into a new ball game done wrong of course it could kill them all she could not foresee the result and that was the best part what she could foresee from the choices she knew was blood and ice and universal death she could hear all of the breathing in the confined space as if it was her own finally snow goose opened her eyes all right she said we can do it they would have hooted or hollered or something but the nasties that haunted the island would have heard them and come for lunch so they just formed a circle and hugged each other and began to lay their plans chapter thirtyone challenge the multitowered rise of san diegos encom plaza was a billiondollar paean to the ego and accomplishments of one man kareem fekesh alex griffin shielded his eyes as he emerged from the tube station although only an eighteenminute ride from dream park the tubes had been relatively quiet and dark alex had closed his eyes trying to keep the tension at a dull roar understandable considering what was sitting in his lap and what he had to attempt the sidewalks buzzed with activity and in the midst of it he felt slightly uncomfortable how long had it been since he ventured outside the environs of cowles industries with all of the resorts shopping malls entertainment complexes and health services he actually hadnt needed to leave the corporate environment for over a year astonishing now that he actually thought of it closer to two years maybe the executive jets the tubes the vacations in aspen and fishing in bermuda all of these things had been owned controlled designed by cowles industries if not outright owned and maintained for the use of the executive staff a totally selfcontained world alex was suddenly painfully aware of how vulnerable he felt there was no nod of recognition from the hundreds and thousands of people passing him on the street the street sounds were foreign to himthere were still internalcombustion engines in san diego albeit small efficient ones he could smell it in the air it was new and in a way exciting he ran up the dozen steps to the glass tower the tallest and most prominent building in encom plaza rising above the others like a giant standing on stilts he ran up those steps a tall redheaded man lean in his threepiece suit extremely fit and alert perhaps the nervousness didnt show perhaps the guard at the front door stopped himhimand asked his business the guard was portly with dark skin that didnt seem to be any protection from the sun his skin was peeling badly on the tip of his nose and on his neck alex handed him the coded card fekeshs secretary had sent via courier oh very well mr griffin if you insist that your business is that important and that personal i suppose mr fekesh could squeeze you inforfive minutes tomorrow mighty white of her arriving in encom plaza now griffin could begin to believe that the man was actually as busy as that the guard grudgingly took the card and entered it in a computer slot read the results he had a more respectful look when he returned to the door not much but an improvement one moment sir alex stepped back as a door hummed open for him and stepped into a shielded pocket between two threeinchthick slabs of plastiglass he felt an initial humming and then nothing for several seconds although the skin on his forearms tingled probably just nerves right the inner door slid open alex watched everything the guard clipped a card on his pocket and said penthouse unnecessarily pointing toward an elevator alex had seen the plans for the buildingthere were six elevators visible and two hidden executive and freight the door hissed shut behind him he didnt find it easy to violate the ageless ritual of watching the numbers change on the digital display it took effort to observe his surroundings typical elevator cubicle five feet deep four wide seven feet high moved soundlessly the walls seemed made out of burnished copper but were smoother to the touch they felt like some kind of plastic had the elevator started moving yet the door opened soundlessly griffin found himself in a suite of luxury offices the entire floor seemed to be walled in glass partitioned off with wood it made for an interesting mixture somehow elemental earth and sky mingled together a beautiful brunette at the front desk rose and extended her hand in greeting mr griffin of course mr fekesh is expecting you i ii just bet he is thank you may i go in in a moment may i get you something the ritual question coffee club soda if you have it she laughed musically in twentysix flavors lemon then ill just be a moment alex sat aware of his own nervousness aware that he was probably being watched the sweet lull of the musicwhat was that something by mozart he wasnt up on his classical music and for some reason that added to his discomfiture there were a dozen people working at various desks in various stages of activity but the real work was undoubtedly going on behind the various closed doors they simply hummed with hidden power the receptionist returned clucking to herself as if she were keeper of the worlds best private joke she handed him a foamplastic cup and mr fekesh will see you in a moment please she motioned him to an office door down the hail he smiled his thanks took a sip it was at the perfect edge of coldness brisk and refreshing he had always liked the way lemon tasted in fizzing drinks cleansing somehow the office door was open and he walked in the office was a little smaller than he would have expected and perhaps a touch less opulent there was a whisper of air and a faint canned smell to it he consciously noted something that had only been peripherally registered the pneumatic hiss of the doors as they shut fekesh had a selfcontained air supply doubtless computercontrolled no hydrocarbons or nitrogenous compounds for fekeshs aristocratic lungs the entire office was walled in glass from fekeshs perch atop the world he could see the entire sprawl griffin looked out the damage from the great quake had gobbled a bit of shoreline but something like that couldnt stop developers not when they were talking about the most expensive land in the world so beach fronts had been reclaimed from the tide at enormous costs passed right along to the consumers tidal breaks stilts condos with subsealevel apartments and every stunt possible to human ingenuity had been employed to steal back a few extra meters from the sea eventually the sea would have them back again for now the men and women who built her who had stolen those precious cubic meters could enjoy the illusion of a conquest worth the battle until the next time he would hate to be in one of those sublevel apartments bedroom window looking out on the kelp beds come the next quake the office door opened and kareem fekesh walked in alex was a little taller and a little broader than fekesh and needed every cubic centimeter the man was impressive it wasnt just the clothes although they made alex feel impoverished or the grooming a man with a personal barber on twentyfourhour call could look as good as fekesh no problem no it was little things in the carnage he moved like a totally healthy animal his smile was broad and warm his teeth an orthodontial dream his eyes were bright bright black and were laughing even when the rest of the face was at rest fekesh rolled into the room sat at his desk and smiled out at alex please he said wont you have a seat im sorry that it has been so difficult for me to arrange this meeting but there are as always a thousand things to do i understand alex said trying to create rapport fekesh smiled a smile that said i doubt that folded his hands and said and so what is it that i can do for you mr griffin im going to be presumptuous and assume that you know what i am alex began not presumptuous at all we have dealt before if not directly then over the video i make it my business to know all i can about the people with whom i work this is going to be a difficult meeting and i hope to simplify it a little please by all means alex cleared his throat as i believe you know approximately eight years ago there was an attempted takeover of cowles industries fekeshs expression never changed and although nothing can be proven it is believed that you had a major stake in that takeover bid mr griffin such things are hardly the concern of the security chief of dream park mnim but by an interesting coincidence a terrible accident occurred at the same time one which if it had become public knowledge would have driven down the price of cowles stock making a takeover all the more feasible well then let us rejoice that the information never did become public have you any interest in clarifying your role in all of this fekesh drummed his fingers on the table in front of him mr griffin i am a busy man i was under the impression that you had matters of urgency to discuss not issues dead a decade ago and i do alex said he opened his briefcase and extracted two folders he pushed them across the desk to fekesh i know that you have been a principal player in the barsoom project so what i am about to say m y sound a bit strange yes fekesh opened one of the folders and glanced through the information expression noncomittal i spoke of a terrible accident at dream park some eight years ago a woman who was an unwitting accomplice to the sabotagewe might as well call it that fekeshs eyebrows lifted a quarterinch in question recently returned to the park to attempt to play out the same game that she was injured in someone tried to get her out of the game someone someone it suggests that whoever was responsible for the first occurrence is still present at dream park this suggests the possibility that something is scheduled to happen something big involving the barsoom project as you see in the folders we know that someone has taken a major position on cowles industries again there are indications that twentysix percent of your liquid funds are tied up in assets unknown you are known to be intimately involved with the barsoom project im afraid that i dont know where all of this is going where is it going if anything unusual happens i want you to know that were going to be right on top of you fekesh came as close as a human being could to yawning without actually opening his mouth and doing so mr griffin i wonder how your superiors would feel if they knew that you had threatened me in such a manner alexs lips twitched harmony would have a calf it wasnt exactly a threat nonsense dont insult my intelligence as you have my integrity he browsed through the folders you have quite a bit of information here on my financial activities i wonder how you got it griffin smiled thinly we have our sources indeed you do and some of your sources have obviously reached into our computer files we have security of our own mr griffin and i daresay more efficient security than that of dream park he smiled with those astonishingly white teeth present company excluded of course tell me mr griffin have you ever thought about changing companies we have excellent benefits for men who honestly know their jobs and loyalties i do in both categories he didnt say anything more just smiled well well leave it open all right but this other matter he looked at the files again we can no more tolerate security leaks than you mr griffin im afraid that we will have to do something about this computer theft requireshow would you say a terminal solution griffins back straightened i dont think indeed you dont and you obviously didnt before you started this mr griffin the records say that at one time you were in military intelligence for the last eight years you have been living in fantasyland apparently you have forgotten how the real world works very well i shall have to remind you he looked at his watch ah my time is up if you would excuse me he stood until another time perhaps griffin stood uncertainly he tried to find a conversational riposte but cleverness eluded him that wasnt what this was all about anyway so he left chapter thirtytwo dreams r us it was big and mean and sounded hungry the thing shambled past their cave hairy and brownishwhite sniffing in their direction snow goose held the spooi of falling angel wire like a crucifix in her hands it glowed like tame lightning her eyes were tightly closed the beast at the entrance sniffed she whispered winigo under her breath more aprayer than a comment finally it turned and left what in the hell was that johnny asked orson snorted looked like an abominable snowman we call them winigos they eat people i should have been able to make us totally invisible to it it went away trianna said reasonably it came too close her round pretty face was troubled i think that it wasnt just a winigo what do you think it was i think that the cabal is taking over the minds of their beasts seeing through their eyes hearing through their ears oh shit now just a minute here if theyre out looking for us they cant be protecting their sanctum properly now can they yarnall thought it over ill buy that look we need some distractions say a couple of flares on the far ridges while were doing that a couple of us can slip into that ruined building temple whatever well have to work fasttake on the cabal destroy the satellite snow goose looked doubtful never work mmm unless we split their attention max was warming to it now rightill buy that now listen who was it that got the sealskin charlene raised a nervous hand me white seal against the snow hard to see right maybe hard to sense too snow goose was hiding a grin it sounds plausible what are you thinking we split into three teams two of the teams provide distraction while the third sneaks into the temple spearheaded by charlene under the camouflage of the sealskin do you really think your plan can work orson dont see why not he said the gods have looked upon the play with favor snow goose added she need not describe the conversation that shed heard from gaming central wait a minute that wasnt in the original scenario theyre supposed to retreat find that beached eskimo canoe and the dynamite well welles had chuckled they came up with another approach can we handle it well more laughter hell boss is we dreams r us or aint we then lets give it a shot max looked back at trianna and orson shushed them and pushed them back into the shadow they stood on a narrow ridge up around the lip of the valley something was scuttling around the other side of the trail and he wasnt sure he wanted to meet it without a formal introduction a tickle of fear stirred in the depths of his stomach there was only one thing to do and that was to do what a man had to do max squared his shoulders inhaled deeply and said johnny you want to lead for a while johnny welshs eyes flicked to him and away back to where a long horny hairy leg was coming around the corner earlier looking up toward the ridge theyd have to reach theyd seen something that might have been an immense spider a cross between a daddy longlegs and a tarantula this could be its leg there was a sharp molded tusk fixed to its ankle anchored by rivets in the chitin a second leg came probing armed with a second tusk max was reminded of the fighting spikes mounted on the collars of pit bulls back before the dogs were bred into animals so vicious they would no longer mate or nurse their young the spiders torso emerged six feet up it scuttled backward for a moment as surprised to see them as they were to see the spider its black eyes were multifaceted and slightly reflective max saw his own face in the creatures orbs distorted with shock and fear trianna whispered why didnt you chop it max winced i froze up the creature opened its mouth revealing a black redrimmed cavity it hissed and charged this was like no spider max had ever studied in biology each of its legs seemed capable of bending in either direction it flickered those leg spikes with disturbing speed the ledge was narrow and max backpedaled behind him trianna said theres a wider spot back about fifteen meters get to it he started backing up he tripped over his feet and fell heavily oh shit a rifle fired behind him he glanced back to see trianna huddled on all fours to give johnny his chance johnny with carbine to shoulder was firing into the thing as it advanced it slowed licking at the blood and came on eviane watched hippogryph for a signal somehow what they were doing sneaking around to split the attention of the gabal seemed vaguely wrong they had found a boat with provisions and dynamite the canoe was shattered and bloodstained and she rubbed her hands against her temples there was a fragment of a human foot in the canoe as f something had risen from the depths and devoured the occupants but they werent supposed to discharge the satellite they were supposed to find the boat and the dynamite and blow up that was a different game game she smiled to herself even as the confusion threatened to drive her batshit game how could all of this be a game and yet and yet hadnt she seen light shining through one of those monsters or a war club sailing through one of them yet they crushed physical objects or seemed to could the whole thing be some kind of monstrous joke but why who had the answers max dear max had tried to tell her over and over that it was only a game she watched hippogryph she looked at ollie damned if it didnt look like ollie was having fun he had stuck flares into his bandoleer now it looked like an editorial cartoon of a libertarian revolutionary hippogryph wasnt having fun he was helping them pick their way through a maze of shattered masonry and doing a fairly good serious job of it he was tired though the masonry broke into a wider area here as if whatever forces had destroyed this island city had found nothing to attack in this one spot she looked across it again it looked like the huge hieroglyph she had seen from the top of the ridge hippogryph turned to them this might not be a bad place to set off the flares right out in the middle there and then hightail it back to the ruins as soon as anything shows i think that we can fight a delaying action ollie nodded that sounds good to me eviane stared at ollie had she seen his face before or hippogryphs there was something familiar eviane sound reasonable sure lets do it they stared out across the plain eviane was watching the sky things moved in the shadows and they hunched close to the ground suddenly very aware of their vulnerability ahmaybe this wasnt a great idea the idea ollie reminded him was to get the cabals attention preferably with minimal tissue damage not necessarily to survive nobody here but us chickens ollie and hippogryph both had flare grenades while they prepared to ignite them eviane watched the shadows everything was so dizzying so familiar and unfamiliar at the same time it was making her groggy who was michelle all right were ready here they had lashed eight stubby silver flare cylinders together into two bundles of four and propped them up with snow the wind that blew from over the great ridge of the plateau herded an eerie howling sound before it ghost riders in the sky ollie twisted the fuse ring on his grenade bundle with a soft pop and a burst of incandescently white light it ignited the glow was brighter than the eye could comfortably tolerate shielding her face barely helped come on hippogryph yelled as he triggered his own he scampered back for the shelter of the ruins she ran as fast as she could but back over her shoulder she saw the magnesium flares erupting into the sky shooting fire up and up damned if that wouldnt attract attention now what they had to do was they hadnt quite reached the edge of the ruins when they saw the first stirrings of movement within four of the amartoqs moved out of the maze advancing carrying clubs and spears they had attracted attention all right too much too soon snow goose saw the false dawn as the first flare went off to what she assumed was the east she waited for a few moments according to their timetable the second batch of flares should be going off simultaneously but when a minute passed and nothing happened she could only figure that something had gone wrong so max and his bunch had encountered some obstacles tsktsk how very unfortunate ah well best not to worry about ones compatriots fighting for their lives against the ghastly minions of the cabal best to concentrate on the job ahead charlene had taken point orson stayed just behind her moving veritably on tippytoe despite his size they had reached the crumbled door of the cabals sanctum they hid behind one of the enormous slabs of fallen rock watching waiting yarnall had crawled down from the defile and was poised on the temples ruined stone roof goggles in place he was ready to warn them of danger from the temple mouth came three figures two male and one female they were naked they faced into the driving frigid wind as if standing on a beach at maui and as the adventurers watched the figures began to flow changing shifting shape and color first they hunched down onto all fours and then the limbs themselves lengthened and shifted flowing flowing feathers fangs and claws sprouted where three human beings had stood three wolfalcons nodded to each other and sprang howling into the air rapid strokes of mammoth wings lifted them up up toward the crags and away this is the best chance were going to get snow goose said some of them are gone the rest are in deep meditation lets move it troops charlene wrapped the seal fur around her shoulders and she began to fade her outer clothing seemed to evaporate and for an instant she stood unembarrassed in pale nakedness then the skin itself became translucent and the internal organs pulsed and played against the light charlenes organs slipped away into invisibility leaving bones the bones faded there was just the slightest waver of displacement in the air where charlene had been and a ghostly grin and the sound of a voice delighted beyond all belief oh boy oboy she laughed clapping her hands delightedly this is great have they got a home model ahem snow goose reprimanded lets finish saving the world shall we charlene entered the temple mouth with yarnall right behind the hallway was cracked and warped by the elements a lustrous ivory finish obscured by dust and cracked by the elements orson watched the ground charlenes footprints appeared with little powdery puffs something with heavy feet moved up ahead and they flattened against the wall trying to control their breathing they saw the figure now squatly mongolian with beetled brows and heavy dark skin hiswhoops charlene had missed the heavy sagging breasts the masses of wrinided skin that were the closest this creature came to secondary sexual characteristics the bovine nose sniffed at the air as if trying to scent them charlenes knife rose and fell and the troglodyte fell to her knees hands reaching helplessly back for the blade she pitched faceforward into the dust twitched and was still orson rolled her over patted her down come on charlene whispered in the indirect light she was just a bare shimmering weve got to get going orson nodded and got yarnall to help him roll the body over to the side the invisible charlene continued down the cothdor ahead was a chamber of some kind torches glowed within charlenes ghostly hand appeared and motioned them to come closer snow goose was the last of them to reach the edge of the doorway the tunnel opened up into a larger chamber with a ruined cracked ceiling fifteen feet high at the far end perched a fat mongol idol perhaps twice the size of a human being it might have been gold and silver crusted with jewels but all was scummed with a thick coat of dust its thick lips curled in silent mocking laughter a fire roared at its feet in front of the fire robin bowless body lay stretched on a rack partially dissected in a semicircle around bowles sat six men and women in the center of the temple shimmering with such force that a preternatural thrill tickled charlenes spine was the satellite once it might have been a shining testimonial to the creative powers of the industrial soviet empire now it was little more than an irregularly shaped heap of slag an ironcored meteorite barely recognizable as something that had been machinetooled filled with the most delicate and expensive mechanisms of an advanced culture and yet something of the devices original intent still remained in that heap of slag what had it been a surveillance device a targeting system had it watched the weather or found locations and bearings for vulnerable human targets had this twisted piece of blackened metal been friend or foe or like so many creations of the human mind and hand had it been merely neutral reporting back to its masters so that they could make decisions of life and death now it was an object of power it had been used to throw the entire balance of the world out of control it controlled the raven controlled the sun controlled the fate of millions billions because it was the balancing point for a world of technology and magic now was a moment of truth of surpassing importance and it was all up to them charlene tiptoed closer to the device carrying the backpacks charlene blended into the shadows she was more a perfect reflection of her surroundings than a truly invisible woman if she stood still it was almost impossible to see her one noted a bit of shimmering perhaps a slight disturbance in the air but at the core of her image almost nothing could be seen at the outer edges there was a bit more and if you knew exactly where to look you could see the invaluable pile of backpacks the magical falling angel materialthe hope of mankind the ranks of the angakoks had been thinned two women four men they were young perhaps surprisingly so but withered and pocked and diseased one was taller broader than the others his voice rose louder rang with power his eyes were wide open but blind comeas scarred and white ahklut orson sands waved at charlene to move forward robin bowles dead but locked into necromantic spells stirred and turned to look at charlene charlene didnt couldnt look at robin through her peripheral vision she had an impression of enormous damage to his central body of skin peeled away and organs laid out or cast upon the fire but still he was conscious he drooled from the corner of his mouth but his eyes focused on charlene from his newfound wisdom the perspective of death the sealskins magic deceived him not a bit charlene paused for a minute and locked eyes with robin his eyes blazed he winked her path took her close enough to ahklut that he could have reached out and grabbed her foot the blind eyes looked on infinity lost in trance and darkness he sensed nothing the firelight cast their shadows against the wall wild and irregular as if they were standing and dancing rather than sitting still in fact the shadows were more active more alive than the sitting figures they were becoming less and less the shadows of human beings or of anything normal and sane and more and more the outlines of horrible things nightmare things it was as if that strange flame knew the true shapes of its masters souls and illuminated that reality rather than their mere fleshly disguises quashing a nervous flutter charlene edged closer to the satellite she could have reached out and touched it now but dared not its only a game then why did the hairs on the back of her neck stand up the way they did whence came this deep gutwrenching fear why did the sight of the cabal six men and women with ravaged complexions and dead staring eyes disturb her as it did if she didnt get her mind back on track shed never get through this charlene unfolded the first of the backpacks and laid it across the satellite orson had suggested it magical objects in this world in a way seem to act like storage batteries they store up power absorb power by traveling like an electric motor rotating through lines of magnetic force they are discharged through the spells or circumstances dictated by tradition batteries now thats the model that we want to look at if this thing has traveled around the world thousands of times then it is a supercharged battery and how the hell does that help us max was partly irritated partly fascinated orson could do that to him a battery can be discharged orson said if you lay a conductor across the poles you can force the battery to give up its power more quickly than the manufacturer ever intended charlene unfolded the backpacks carefully with no idea how things were going to happen once the first step was taken it could be spectacular it might be lethal five backpacks reinforced at the edges with falling angel cable single crystal carbon fibers in an epoxy matrix almost unbreakable one after the other the backpacks landed on the satellite at first there was no change then the satellite began to hum and the shadows ceased to writhe in their obscene dance but the backpacks the backpacks began to smolder it was as if the magic changed forms as if the reinforcing filaments in the backpacks were conducting more power than they could safely hold they began to sputter and smoke the cabalists began to rouse as from a long slow dream ahkluts scarred eyes began to shift blindly charlene backed out of the cave now the backpacks were melting actually changing shape and glowed as if with heat the glow shifted and flared with color like a miniature aurora borealis additional small fires raced across the hidden wires within the fabric the cabalists slowly oh so slowly began to rouse from their trances orson stood unable to move for a moment then stepped forward and raised his ivory spear snow goose caught his arm no she whispered fiercely you wouldnt stand a chance he looked back at them regretfully ahklut seemed so helpless so ready for a killing stroke he fought with himself and then agreed lets get out of here they turned and bolted behind them the satellites hum grew chillingly loud an amartoq with vast sloping shoulders emerged from the shadows shuffling in a clumsily hurried gait orson jabbed with his spear the creatures batted it aside almost nonchalantly it reached out for orson with blackened claws and the invisible charlene struck her spear sank into its back and for a moment its face took on an almost pitiable countenance as its nails reached back digging for the shaft its deathscream was bloodcurdling for a moment they were transfixed there by the sound and then they heard another sound the sly deadly shuffle of feet against the bare rock coming from the mouth of the cave trapped chapter thirtythree when the sleeper wakes the second spider came slowdancing around the ledge on eight long delicate coarsehaired legs it hissed and the hair on the back of maxs neck stood up and danced as he saw it more clearly it was five feet tall at the shoulder or at the thick of the body if that was the proper way to describe it he couldnt take his eyes off the jaws johnny welsh said shit and backpedaled he faced the rock wall and tried to squeeze himself flat trianna get behind me you too max ill try a shot at its widest the ledge was barely wide enough tnanna eased past johnnys back deliberately lascivious fun to watch but only the corner of maxs eye caught it he was dancing backward fending off eight darting horn clubs and spikes as the spider advanced he was pushed past the wide spot and now the ledge was too narrow to change places the spider with absurd and disturbing delicacy crawled around the turn of the ledge and attacked max swung at one of the legs and was partially relieved when his usik passed through it then he remembered how little difference that made this thing could chill him pretty damned quick and if he even thought to mock its insubstantiality the earth was likely to open up and swallow him whole the leg flashed red but the creature had an edgethree of its legs carried clubs one of them flagged up and down flashed out at him it crept forward a little further on the ledge johnny and max struggled there was just enough room for one of them to edge around the ledge and johnny had the gun there wasnt enough room for them to change places but they were determined to try they squeezed together max momentarily embarrassed by a quick attack of homophobia quashing it as johnnys breath warmed his chest we gotta stop meeting like this johnny said people will say were in love har har trianna screamed watch out johnny turned around in time to yipe and raise his rifle a club hammered down striking sparks from the barrel johnny moaned whether acting or serious max couldnt tell it did look a lonnnng way down johnny was past him now and max backpedaled as quickly as he could to give johnny the range and space that he needed johnny leveled the rifle and fired the creatures right eye flashed red like something in a pinball game then winked out unfortunately it didnt slow down one of the clubs lashed out in a semicircle and johnnys leg went red johnny hobbled backward and fired again and again the club lashed out johnny hopped back dodging as best he could on one good leg the entire spiderbeast was mostly red before it finally collapsed it pulsed on the ledge and then tumbled over the three returned to where the ledge was widest there they paused to check johnnys leg the red flashing was beginning to fade but hadnt died out better than a bite trianna breathed a sigh of relief the flashing probably would have gotten worse as the poison spread what should we do she thought for a minute well i guess we could bandage it and then you just be careful and maybe well get through all right johnny slipped his belt out of its hoops and bandaged his leg with it think thisll do it better max said lets get going the amartoqs were gathering in the forest of jagged slabcrystals eviane watched until she felt the huge slab beneath her feet begin to shift hippogryph lowered the point of his spear confused the creatures across the divide hissed and gibbered at him shaking their fists what in the hell is going on earthquake but eviane knew different it felt wrong it wasnt the random movement of tectonic plates nor the movement of a melting labyrinth of ice the motion was deliberate and dare she say it controlled behind them a gap had opened that was at least five yards across below it was darkness and slow sluggish coils of sound something was moving down there and she didnt like it even a little ollie hung back looked down jesus christ he screamed his face curdled with shock and he staggered back the headless amartoqs attacked there were six they moved with grim sureness their anns hung so low that their blackened claws raked the ground the faces sunken into those swollen bellies leered at them they were slow and that was all that saved the adventurers in the first moments of the attack eviane howled and thrted in her enchanted spear drawing first blood everything seemed to be happening in slow motionexcept that the amartoqs couldnt seem to keep up with the dervish adventurers ice and stone grew neonred with blood the monsters fell one after another and she found herself fighting side by side with hippogryph who wielded his spear well her spear was magic indeed she sliced effortlessly through monster flesh and with every stroke she slew another as the last of them went down she realized that something was wrong hippogryph was staring at the forest of slabs the six amartoqs they had fought were only the beginning dozens perhaps hundreds were emerging now their long heavy nails scratched along the slabs of ice and masonry like nails on a blackboard were dead she said almost matteroffactly the creatures emerged another foot and then the hideous sunken faces in the bellies looked out questioningly something that could only have been fear shone in their misshapen faces they froze where they stood in spite of herself eviane turned and looked back over her shoulder and the old recurring nightmare began again the slab had opened the misshapen octopusheaded thing the thing from the gulfs had begun to worm through it was hideous beyond imagining and ollie had time only to scream chthul before one of the fanged cilia had him had lifted him into the air and was carrying him down toward the awful gaping mouth ollie eviane had time to scream and ollies eyes met hers she thought she saw a message there i wont die like this the instant before that ghastly mouth would have swallowed him ollies hands ripped from his bandoleer the makeshift belt which held flare grenades and sticks of dynamite with an audible snick he pulled a brace of rings free from the incendiary flares there was a painfully brief scream of defiance and ollie disappeared in a flash of light and thunder that dimmed the auroras in that light she caught a glimpse of the thing hiding down in the darkness and wished she hadnt it hissed and spit in pain and indignation the damaged tentacle zipped back into the ground the slab slammed shut with a thunderous roar sour smoke hung in the air the ice was littered with corpses on the far side of the plateau lay something shattered and smoking she didnt want to go and look come on hippogryph said the others need us she stared at him she had foreseen death but not ollies now she saw death in hippogryphs face was it real was it for him he turned uncomfortable with the intensity of her gaze snow goose saw it but didnt really believe it orson protecting charlene was a totally different person backlit by the discharging satellite his bulky figure moved not with grace but with great energy she heard him mutter heres where orson the barbarian battles the bloody beast that blocks their path one swipe of the amartoqs claws and his left shoulder went red he gamely transferred his sword to his right hand stumbling out of the way as its subsequent slower swipe missed him by inches orson lunged in with the sword in a move that looked like something out of the prisoner of zenda it should have stayed there he lost his balance and stumbled the face in the middle of the beasts torso laughed an ugly laugh it swung its claws they came slowly but they came yarnall in a movement so swift and sure that it startled her spun orson back and attacked in that narrow space squeezing up from the rear and firing into the amartoqs rather oddly placed face its fighting snarl evaporated in a red mist orson was gasping for air holding his shoulder and ankle ow i think i twisted my anide that time charlene put a sympathetic arm around his shoulder ive got some more joint braces she whispered in his ear flickering nearly invisible she tried to prop him up it must have been like leaning on a ghost ill let you borrow one if we can get out of this she paused and snow goose heard the smack of an invisible kiss on orsons whiskered chin my hero orson glowed and straightened ready he growled yarnall led the way something was happening and max could feel it the ground shook here and everywhere fissures divided the giant slabs that defined the walls and canyons in the distance the bizarre geometry of the alien city was changing shape they couldnt move they had to wait for the others to arrive over there trianna pointed there were tiny dark figures in the sky max saw something familiar about those shapes and he shouted get down the cabal had taken wolfalcon form and were hunting the adventurers there was a greater brightness in the sky behind them maxs nerves were screaming at him to hide but his curiosity won he climbed to find a better view did the sun really look a little brighter did it really feel a little warmer max it was orsons voice and the brother himself came quickly after it leaning on charlene who was flickering in and out of reality we did it the satellite seems to be on the fritz for how long dont know by the sight of it i think its discharging everything the cabalists who were there were just wiped out by it we barely got out with our skins whole orson scanned the group wheres eviane dont know i hope theyre all right johnny welshs shoulder wound had faded to pink if they had as hard a time as we did they may not be back there was a rustling behind them and up through the rocks climbed eviane her hair was wild her face haggard weve got to get out of here she said the entire island is coming apart chapter thirtyfour star chamber there were five of them seated in a horseshoe configuration in harmonys office izumi and sandy khresla were at one side of the table harmony and alex were on the other millicent summers was there and that was it there was no need for anyone or anything else the office vidscreensplayed a multitude of images down on the floor of gaming a the delegates were inspecting various bits of equipment displays on the subject of martian exploration and terraforming from here from this perspective it looked like an army of ants alex found himself suffering from a peculiar emotional disconnection the game in gaming b was nearing its conclusion all nine of the adventurers who remained alive were fleeing across an unstable ice field marty bobbick helped charlene dula regain her feet ahon her other side a beefy guy named orson gave a hand helping her up even though marty clearly didnt need any help another complication ordinarily alex would have smiled but he just didnt have one in him on the last screen were images of kareem fekeshs offices images taken by a camera with no metal parts built into alexs briefcase clicking along at a steady five frames a minute every inch of the trip was there from the guard at the front door to the shape size and position of the elevator and its internal decor to the secretarial and executive offices to the positions of fire exits and security cameras to the office where fekesh received visitors izumi said weve seen everything but the inner office we can map the shape of it by elimination its not big weve got the air system and the private elevator mapped and magnetic fields gave us a sizable power lead and a sizable computer trunk which implies a computer the size of a lapcray and since theres only one that size were nowhere near needing that harmony snapped fekeshs face was very clear smiling taunting unrepentant millicent summers watched fekesh with a strange expression alex recognized it after a moment and added jealousy to his list of debits against the man harmony said so what is your conclusion millicent seemed to shake herself out of a stupor and returned to the business at hand based on what youve said and on what we know we can be fairly sure that fekesh had a major role in the death of a dream park employee the indirect death of another the maiming of several and the corruption of at least one employee who may still be ah employed here she stopped and looked around they all knew exactly what she meant do we have a legal case im afraid not not unless we can find the woman it seems to be just one who subverted the employee and recruited tony mcwhirter shes the link without her we have nothing sandy khresla spoke up dammit gruffeven if we find her we cant go to the cops were guilty of obstructing justice you dont mean he gets away with it we cant even be sure he did it millicent said grimly or if he did for how much hes actually culpable the term plausible deniability was invented to cover situations like this he may easily have made a bad call on which underlings to trust he may have already dealt out justice to them we dont know and right now hes helped to put together the barsoom project in a very real way we have to consider him an ally she paused for a moment on the other hand four years ago there was a major industrial accident at colorado steel during a safety inspection for christs sake fekesh picked up a controlling interest at a bargain hardly conclusive harmony offered aw thadeus but it does suggest a methodology alex in this room hes innocent until we prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt okay were prejudiced we know it it doesnt mean we cant protect ourselves griffin brooded staring at his fingers he picked up a pencil and rolled it slowly feeling its textures of wood and thin paint then he said slowly the way i see it what we have to do is first protect tony mcwhirter get him into protective custody now reopen his case anything i wont have him killed second find madeleine if it is at all possible shes the link third keep an eye on the barsoom project get welles on it as soon as this chubbyeskimo game is over something is going to happen there the pencil broke in his hand i can feel it anything else well maybe theres another link griffin touched a button and the tape vail had made in gaming b went on display it carried a sidebar of physiological data millicent looked sick griffin cleared his throat dr vail has already been reprimanded for this violation of privacy it wont alter his behavior much id guess and however distastefully this tape may have been obtained we cannot ignore its implications any disagreement there was no sound from around the table except for the moment when harmony softly muttered so i did right griffin looked at izumi are all of the effects ready are you sure that you can pull this off izumi nodded cautiously the prosthetics are excellent youre risking her sanity you know well take every precaution theres just something i have to know and after i do the half of a pencil splintered leaving nothing but fragments after i do maybe well have a few more options chapter thirtyfive sacred weapons the first of the wolfalcons swooped out of the sky the human face in its breast gibbered obscenity max whirled and swung the compositebird wheeled back out of range maxs usik cut a whistling haymaker he danced to keep his balance on the seaice the air was warming wavering the island behind them was shimmering with power the satellites manna its magical energy had been shortcircuited by the backpacks it was disappearing into random improbabilities the aurora had come out of the sky and settled over the island the light danced and crackled and cast a bizarre shifting radiance over the impossible angles an army of amartoqs and spiderthings were behind them dots on the ice now but catching up too quickly the wolfalcons acted as flying eyes for the monstrous horde keeping the adventurers in sight and urging their pursuers onward orson was panting in maxs ear those damned griffinthings are the leaders theyre the cabal transformed thats why theyre going to let the other beasties do their dirty work what in the hell do we do eviane looked across the ice field far in the distance there was a shimmering a roiling as of a snowstorm she pointed that way she said seelumkadchluk and if we get across will we be safe no she said but well be on home turf all of them were dead tired by now and more than a little frightened it didnt help to know that the deaths of the others were only simulated it hurt to watch it hurt to think that it could happen to max himself the point was to avoid dying what can we do johnny welsh was leaning on his spear panting my legs feel like fifty pounds of dead blubber snow goose looked back across the ice like a pack of hounds hunting runaway slaves the monsters were gaining implacably there was a cracking sound under their feet now what shit if i know max adjusted his furs it was getting warm orson slapped his shoulder were dummies its getting hotter the ice pack is melting the pressure shifts and the whole thing is cracking up i think youre right the sound of the approaching monsters was just audible now the ice in front of them burst open with a roar like lightning striking too close a tremendous blue and white torpedo surged into the air dropped onto the ice and slid a nastily familiar shape a killer whale blessed with stuntedlooking treetrunk arms slowed and turned and pushed itself toward them across the ice its mighty forepaws gouged furrows max heard hippogryphs wail of frustration hippogryph had spilled his pack across the ice and was reloading in frantic haste powder paper shot yarnall unshouldered and fired twice the monster kept coming yarnall was dancing trying to keep his balance and his aim but the ice rumbled and shuddered with every movement of the land whale yarnall paused a moment too long and it had him it was a death deferred a doom that should have overtaken him two days before that didnt make it any prettier he screamed and its teeth were in him for a moment there was an expression of almost humorous resignation on his face and then he was gone swallowed hippogryph fired his musket the creature shuddered with the shock then came on bleeding red light hippogryph poured powder and shot into his musket he was nibbling on his lower lip but there wasnt a wasted motion i was too tired just too tired hippogryph said snow goose screamed sacred weapons we need sacred weapons max looked at the curved usik in his hands well he ran forward pubic bone raised on high the killer whale tried to turn but max was faster on land he brought the usik down against a blueblack wall of monsterflesh well through it actually the usik passed through the huge head but where it passed a wide red swath was cut and the creature immense as it was began to redden it sank back through the ice the ice cracks were spreading and sheets of ice were sliding up at crazy angles the wind howled at them driving snow even as the sun burned brighter weve gotta make a stand trianna screamed against the wind max shouted i dont like that idea but i dont have a better one the garners scrambled up one of the inclines taking what could laughingly be referred to as the high ground orson said lets hope the landscape doesnt shift a whole lot more in the next few minutes the monsters were coming now fast and hard across the stretch of ice at the most they were a hundred meters away now the spiderthing was visible in the back in front were three of the blacktaloned horrors shambling headlessly heedlessly across the ice the wolfalcons wheeled in the sky max nudged orson hell of a place to make a last stand hey ive seen worse ever played zork its an old computer game trianna hissed at them keep your attention she had her sword at the ready and eviane beside max had her spear a wall of ribs there are too many of them i guess well just have to die well eviane looked up into the sky no something will happen the spiderthing reached them first it was slow it took too long to struggle up the slab of ice they cut the legs from under it the creatures came in waves max stood shoulder to shoulder with eviane repulsing them one and two and four at a time at the touch of the enchanted usik the monsters went down he heard the others grunting and gasping and triannas yell of triumph turn into strangled huffing the monsters came in an infinite stream they swarmed out from the distant shape of the dread island fought and died until the tide below them glowed red with monster blood the adventurers were gasping for breath but max slew on none of their companions yielded and as the sky rolled with fire and ice the implementors if implementors there be witnessed a battle to warm the blood johnny welsh lost his footing and slid down the embankment into a mass of ravening monsters things with arms and clubs and glistening fangs things which struggled up at them eyes glaring sulfurous hatred max saw johnny slide down into that vile cacophonous mass heard johnny yell hold the mayo before he disappeared he saw the monsters climbing over each other struggling and then the ice field began to break a crevasse opened monsters slid into it screaming and howling a score of the unholy beasts vanished in a few moments the wolfalcons overhead cawed and screamed in rage a third of their might had died the crevasse blocked another third one of the birdbeasts strayed too close and trianna speared it it flapped in the snow dying ungracefully come on orson grabbed charlenes hand and they retreated across the ice fissures were opening all around them theyd reached one they would have to jump below them was dark water and the ice chunks were shifting uneasily max crossed the gap like a great ungainly swan eviane leapt across landed unsteadily on crunchy ice she waved her arms for balance her rifle slipped from her grasp and slid toward the water as maxs big hand gripped her parka and pulled her against him she looked after the rifle as if considering a retrieval effort max retained his grip forget it im not losing you now orson held his breath and jumped and missed he hit the water with a mighty splash help max said oh drown it and dove in after him the water was oddly warmthose implementors were rascals indeed also there seemed to be another layer of iceberg beneath his feet or else it was rather improbably shallow ah well no time to think something was moving in the water he saw the tentacle out of the corner of his eye raised the sacred usik on high and bashed the thing backhand before it could come much closer hands reached down into the water hauled orson out then reached down for max blood slick spread around them if there were predators about well evianes eyes were glittering at him and she paused a moment to give him a quick kiss come on snow goose yelled its not far behind them the entire ice field was breaking up huge slabs rose and sank clashed amidst a monstrous spray in the distance the wolfalcons screamed their frustration and then the sun began to change it was warmer still and the air shimmered around them rather like a heat mirage nothing extreme but a sensation of chill ran the course of his body and he knew seelumkadchluk reality lay just ahead chapter thirtysix michelle the earth rumbled and then subsided there ahead of them was the village where they had crashlanded an eternity ago the burned and blasted wreckage of their plane was a reminder of happier times like the stripped carcass of last weeks thanksgiving turkey a dozen eskimos scattered around the edge of the bay pointed and cried out as the adventurers ran across the last of the seaice the steadily thinning sheet dissolved beneath their very feet one by one they plunged into the sea evianes legs burned with fatigue she hopped from perch to perch and finally ran out of ice chunks of ice bobbed and clashed about her head as she stroked for shore eviane noted how little the freezing water affected her her toughness might save her yet snow goose scrambled ashore to be met by martin her father my child he embraced her warmly you have saved us daddy weve still got trouble the cabal are coming the cabal cannot use their beasts or spirit forms in this world but they can attack as before with guns hurry he pulled her toward the trading post other adventurers followed while eviane struggled up the strand seven adventurers remained orson and max eviane snow goose charlene trianna and hippogryph they all looked like something the proverbial cat should have buried in the sand eskimos scrambled to get boxes from the trading post weapons martin the arctic fox bellowed sometimes the need is for spiritual weapons and sometimes for a smith and wesson eviane recoiled as an eskimo handed her one of the rifles it felt heavy in her hand and alien and a single gunshot set the tired adventurers to diving behind buildings eviane found herself below ground level in a web of splintered wood something sailed through the air grenade orson screamed all heads ducked as one of the sheds disintegrated in fire and sound a ragged eskimo form flew boneless through the air there was firing all around her eviane huddled covering her face charlene dropped behind the barrier with her eviane why arent you fighting she looked concerned eviane had no answer she heard the roar behind them it was not an explosion it was the roar of a great beast and eviane knew what she would see even as she turned she sucked air hyperventilating as she did whenever the nightmare returned the thing that rose from the ocean was a form of madness and nightmare larger than anything that they had seen yet it was a manysegmented wormshape with a yawning maw martin walked on stiff legs unconcerned by the gunfire and the explosions that had turned the village into a battlefield he stared up at the creature and screamed blasphemy how much power did you steal to manifest in this world you go too far ahklut i your father renounce you i your father a sound that could only have been a human laugh emerged from the titanic shape and the entire world shook with its evil mirth martins magical gestures were evidently inadequate the monster humped forward the shelf of ice supporting martin shattered filling the air with frigid mist and chips of broken ice martin disappeared into the ocean ahkluts terrible spirit form dove after him what was that max gasped a terichik snow goose said eyes wide id only heard about them never seen one its ahklut my brother hes going to kill us all like a raging mountain the terichik rose screaming from a frozen nightdark sea its manysectioned grotesquely wormlike body reared up tons of water and ice thundered into the ocean with a howl like the death of worlds the night sky swirled windwhipped snow through mist that tasted of salt the terichiks mouth gaped cavernously endless rows of serrated teeth gleamed as it shrieked its mindless wrath its breath was a cold and fetid wind the humans beneath it were warrior and wizard princess and commoner they were frail meat in the terichiks path brittle fleshly twigs tumbled in an angry storm they scrambled for safety away from the sea they fled past the wreckage of the shattered inuit village rows of crushed houses a great stone lodge with its roof stove in boat hulls splintered and scattered like insect husks max gaped up at the creature then looked down at the sacred usik in his hand magic against magic why not eviane screamed as she saw max face the terichik remembering another figure who had lost his life while wielding a magical usik max died well he was the greatest warrior among them but foolish to think that his enchanted usik the pubic bone of the sacred walrus could stand against the terichik even faced by a beast to dwarf ten killer whales max roared defiance and sprang forward his magic his courage his strength were not enough the terichik crushed him savaged his body with fanged cilia his screams echoed in their heads long after his body had vanished into its gaping maw no eviane screamed and ran out into the open behind her hippogryph yelled no she heard she turned breathing hard too hard hyperventilating she took a cabal bullet through the heart the electric jolt that meant the end warned her she saw the red stain spreading over her entire body and she realized im not dead then its a game and a series of images flooded through her mind colliding and crashing she screamed it im michelle im michelle she turned and began firing at the cabalists one of them flopped back out of her sight but directly into hippogryphs that was no red stain on the mans face the head had been blown half away the brain pan leaking onto the snow hippogryph jumped back screaming no oh no and turned around and saw michelle staring at him the gun in her hand her head cocked slightly to the side she stalked toward him you she said he was confused it was all happening so fast wait a minute now listen to me michelles rifle came up to the aim damn you youre the one who put that rifle in my hand i never forget a voice im rotten on faces but if i hadnt been so damned confused i would have known two days ago i would have known the other garners turned to watch listen hippogryph was licking his lips nervously staring at the bore of that rifle i didnt mean for it to happen like that she fired once twice three times she howled liar marty felt impacts he felt his parka twitch he looked down and saw dimpled cavities ripped through the parka he could hear the click click click as michelle sturgeon tried to shoot him again blood filled the holes in his parka and dribbled down marty dropped his rifle unbelieving and unwilling he ripped the velcro apart pulled open the quilted cloth over his chest and belly and saw red coils of intestine beginning to bulge through torn flaps of skin hippogryph screamed he pulled his jacket closed convulsively and ran stumbling into the white mist they heard his screams diminish then chop off sharply another explosion eviane cursed and covered her ringing ears with her hands then dropped them shed need her hands for fighting theyd been distracted a moment too long and the immense figure of the terichik loomed over them orson shouted and pointed the entire sky was blotted out by a shadow which had grown so gradually that none of them had noticed it suddenly with no more fanfare than that the raven was there it filled the sky its wingspan defined the horizon it was huge beyond any ordinary concept of size it swooped past the wind from the impossibly huge wings almost knocked them flat cawing it disappeared into the clouds were screeewed orson started i thought he came to help us why look charlene dula pointed to the horizon striding toward them on legs the size of redwood trees swathed in furs and carrying a huntingaxe the size of a skyscraper came torngarsoak lord of the hunt and sednas lover summoned by the raven and fueled by a terrible mission of vengeance torngarsoak came his round weathercreased face aflame with rage black eyes flashing lightning the aurora borealis writhing about his ears like a crown of glory the terichik squealed in terror and reared back hissing and swallowing air to increase its size inflating like an angry cobra ahklut and torngarsoak were matched for size but the lord of the hunt seemed unimpressed by the terichiks efforts in a blur of speed the terichik struck fanged cilia darting out to rend to tear and grasp torngarsoak sidestepped his booted feet smashing through the ice sending a tidal wave of freezing water thundering to shore suddenly the hunter was thighdeep it should have slowed him but the terichiks lunge carried it past torngarsoak and now sednas lover was behind the beast thundering through the ocean every step rending sheets of ice that might have locked a freighter dead ahklut turned to strike again and as he did torngarsoaks axe clove the air ahklut barely snaked his serpentine head out of the way in time the mass of torngarsoaks weapon carried considerable momentum the lord of the hunt spun a little past his target the terichik lunged in and tomgarsoak sprang back out of reach his awful weight thundering like the detonation of thousandpound bombs the two antagonists circled each other in the shallow sea probing for openings weaknesses as the garners watched ashore mouths open silent and awestruck torngarsoak swung back with the axe and let it fall lunged forward grasped the terichiks neck in both hands and locked his furred legs around the scaly thickness of its body it hissed it wiggled and writhed it coiled about him and sought his face and throat with its teeth torngarsoak held on and the two antagonists fell into the ocean together the terichik gouged torngarsoaks face fastened its teeth into his arm the lord of the hunt screamed in pain but never let go and although blood flowed from the wounds the adventurers saw the gods fingers sink into the terichiks flesh with greater and more frantic exertions the monster struggled but sednas lover hung on they rolled together onto the shore adventurers and eskimos alike fled from their path and the blackened skeleton of a hypersonic jet was smashed to ashes beneath them finally torngarsoak sat astride the terichik hands crushing out the monsters life the god threw his head back and laughed hugely a terrible primal laugh the blood running down his face down his anns and into the distorted face of the terichik the terichik spasmed and then unexpectedly began to shrink torngarsoak stood up shaking the blood from his face and walked out into the surf he recovered his axe and turned watched as the terichik continued to shrink then he lifted his bloody hand in salute to them turned and walked straight out into the ocean far beyond him a wet black mass burst up through the ice it was as big as the terichik too big to be bothered by bullets eviane was ready to fire anyway before she recognized the face beneath dripping black locks sedna smiled and submerged torngarsoak kept walking until the ice rose above his head the gamers walked toward the dead shrinking terichik it fluxed changing shape it was only the size of an elephant now and assuming the shape of a manthe shape of ahklut and finally they stood around the still naked corpse the ravaged body of the dead eskimo wizard just a man after all a dead defeated man for a moment there was stunned silence and then the eskimos men women and children emerged from hiding places around the battlefield and gaped and pointed and screamed in triumph the five survivors formed a group hug and looked at each other dirty grimy exhausted andand ecstatic then the lights came on and the game was over chapter thirtyseven confessions griffin felt sick he wanted nothing more than to smash or bury the sorry object in front of him but he had to deal with it had to question it he had no idea what he would do with it afterward all right hippogryph how much did they pay you with immense effort marty looked up for the first time in many hours his eyes focused for the first time there were tears griff i dont understand im dead she shot me she had the right marty waved it off griff where did she get the bullets griffin turned away vail said you got caught caught here vail set his tape going he was still brisk and it jarred martys wobbly eyes found the right screen he watched himself and charlene in the ice cave brow furrowed indignation trying to surface harmonys attitude seemed to vary vindication anger and apprehensive nausea sandy khresla and tom izumi showed barely suppressed rage dwight welles wore an air of almost academic speculation he doesnt care enough griffin thought vail was enjoying the vivisection enough for all of them watch the graphs you told charlene dula youd never seen eviane before here your blood pressure and pulse rate and skin conductivity all jumped see you didnt just lie you were nervous about lying so you killed me made magic marty looked around the interrogation room and knew that there was no hope he sat on the edge of his chair his arms hugging his belly holding himself in the muscle structure might have been poured into his skin with no concern for rigidity or function marty was a beaten man he hadnt slept or eaten in at least thirtysix hours and as far as griffin was concerned he might not for another thirtysix griffin wanted answers legality could be worked out in civil court later if marty survived to see a courtroom millicent touched his shoulder tried to calm him griff whatever there is to find out were not going to get it like this revenge has an undeserved bad name these last few centuries all right millie marty what would you like to tell us it wasnt money he said and stopped they all watched as marty weighed his options then a great shuddering sigh went out of him and he said i know what it must look like when it all started i didnt want to hurt the park nobody said anything you know what was happening cowless relatives were handling business in the park and in the company and everything was falling apart then the woman came to me tell us about her she called herself madeleine but i never believed that was her name she told me that she represented a group of investors interested in pumping some new blood into the company they needed information before they made an investment like that so i helped them out of the goodness of your heart no he was reddening now you dont have to talk to me like that im talking to you without a lawyer here i know what i did and what happened was wrong maybe ive waited eight years for it to come back and settle with me let me talk go on so i got money and other considerations she was very pretty marty flushed i suppose you thought that putting live ammunition into the game was just a practical joke no no no that came later but they had me then griff i was in too deep and besides what was supposed to happen was the stock would go through the floor and then someone would snap it up id be moved up to executive level meanwhile id get rich by selling cowles short griff it was a monstrous bribe and if i didnt take it madeleine said theyd publish my unauthorized biography he lowered his eyes i did what i thought i had to do to protect myself to protect the company from itself alex saw the tension hit izumis face and reacted just a halfsecond too late the chunky japanese moved with startling speed and his fist took marty in the face martys head snapped back and toms hand blurred formed into the deadly shuto position to strike into the exposed throat but by that time alex had responded snatched the smaller man by belt and elbow pivoted and threw him into the wall tom izumi bounced came down balanced on the balls of his feet eyes blazing no alex said voice crackling with authority it was an accident izumi said hoarsely hungrily marty and i were just sparring around it got a little heated i slipped training accidents happen all the time no alex said the single syllable hanging in the air between them like a shield marty was pawing at the blood on his face terrified i i think my nose is broken the words were mushy i think youd better talk anyway vail advised warmly otherwise alex and i may have to leave the room for a few minutes marty swallowed hard i didnt mean for anyone to be killed ithought ithought he buried his face in his hands and moaned i dont know what i thought they had me griff martys eyes peered over his fingertips they didnt lose i didnt lose i stuck with dream park and i did get moved up and i did make money by selling short and madeleines people they didnt get dream park but they must have made money from the stock they bought it went up heavy when cowles got the vacuum subway contract alex was pitiless he threw a womans picture on the table does this look familiar marty examined it a pretty oliveskinned woman with a sensuous mouth huh yes thats madeleine i should have wondered how you knew she was pretty turn it over he did on the opposite side was a picture of the same woman her throat slashed from ear to ear her real name was collia aziz she was found in altadena in a trash dumpster two days ago fekesh doesnt take chances harmony looked sick but managed to find words how did you communicate with this woman a telephone number he gave it to them and griffin noted it quickly to be used only in case of emergency marty said miserably she got in touch with me always i never heard the name fekesh until hannony tracked him down a year later but all of this time youve spied for her he nodded his head and every month an extra thousand finds its way into my bank i have no idea how it gets there its just there what happened with michelle aw hell poor michelle griff i recognized her scared the liver out of me i called the number i got a voice that told me id be called back in an hour in an hour madeleine called she listened to my story and told me that shed get back to me in twentyfour hours the next day they gave me a virus program disguised as a routine watch report it insinuated itself into the main computer matrix and found the right place to operate it was almost automatic griffin turned to welles is that possible absolutely not just possible its one of my recurring nightmares were not set up to defend ourselves from our own security personnel all right marty what then not much really you know all the rest of it how was i to know you cant kill someone out of a fat ripper marty what is fekesh planning now marty blinked now youre small fish why would he protect you i alex leaned close shut up ill tell you he didnt care about a mindless little rat turd like you youre a distraction hes got something in mind it probably involves the barsoom project marty went paler i dont know anything about that why would you all right he hit a button two guards entered take him away wait she shot me griff how could she have killed me andgriff we switched your parka and vest get him out marty was carried out unceremoniously alex sighed hugely and collapsed into a chair for over a minute he just sat there silent face dark and brooding vail spoke first this is a mess i better go and check out the gamers this whole thing has thrown the psychological balance off hope to god everyones all right griffin cleared his throat dr vail might i have a word with you norman vails bright blue eyes narrowed and the leathery brown skin around them crinkled tight yes you recognized her aim you had to you were here eight years ago in it to your teeth you must have recognized michelle sturgeon when you gave her the psychological tests as unlikely as it seems vail said evenly no i didnt sandy khresla snorted of course you wont admit it norman youre not the type let me tell you whatiappened griffin said im fascinated griffin paused a moment he gazed up at the ceiling putting his mental filing cards in order eight years ago you were just as pissed as harmony there was no way to touch fekesh you must have tried to help michelle and the doctors at brigham young told you to butt out ancient history she was and suddenly shes back in the fimbulwinter game you had two choices expose her and have her removed or let her go in and hope it would stir up a hornets nest she was the lure it worked better than you expected he met vails eyes squarely how am i doing alex id no idea you were so imaginative thats okay i had no idea youd risk your professional standing for dream park alex as long as were being the omniscient author why dont we say that she checked out she was fine sane she was a loon vail youre as coldblooded as anyone ive met but as you said where else but dream park would you find a home and just like me you were willing to risk michelles sanity to expose marty jesus you must have been hiding a grin when i tried to talk you into putting her back in the game you couldnt have dreamed it would turn out so well if youre quite through vail said politely i have business to attend to alexs temper flared and his voice thundered in the room the truth dammit but vail was already at the door alex wanted to pick him up and hurl him back his body was ready poised but vail had paused in the doorway we all do what we can alex he said at that moment he looked every one of his sixtyfour years you said it yourself where else where else but dream park then he was gone griffin watched vail leave mind racing there was silence in the room for a long long thirty seconds silence that griffin finally broke shit he said in a soft wondering voice he turned to face them all right business welles was still watching the doorway dwight i need you with seeming reluctance welles eased out of his reverie all right something is happening and its happening soon we dont know where but its probably gaming a we dont know what he thought a moment longer then added we dont know when lovely business as usual chapter thirtyeight score sheet gwen heard johnny welshs voice above the din strident and tired but happy hey robin youre looking pretty good for a dead guy bowles acknowledged the backhanded compliment with a suitably regal nod gwen had to admit he did look good bowles had probably gotten twenty hours sleep since the game ended he had assumed his formet throne in the phantom feast and was surrounded by lovely young things who were watching highlights from the fimbulwinter game on a bank of overhead monitors what do you think gwen asked dr vail she tightened her arm around ollies waist damn it was good to be back in civvies again no more gaming for six weeks four at least vail smiled thinly he seemed preoccupied and even a little worried of robin bowles all indications are that he will do well but id value your opinions regarding the others he took her arm gwen stood ollie stood too they strolled among the gamers their guests and other visitors culled from the barsoom project families vail seemed content to be relatively unknown gwen wondered how the roomful of guinea pigs would react if she revealed that the tall wellkept older man so quietly gliding among them was one of dream parks maddest scientists on the other hand vail said somewhat regretfully here he veered over to the far side of the room losing ollie at the bar johnny welsh was holding court an adoring trianna on his arm and well hey johnny said expansively when i saw that the monsters were getting ready to eat me whole i said hey and here his voice changed as he prepared to deliver his infamous tag line ive had dates like you on cue his audience roared vail grunted hes the tough nut ollie was back with three squeezebags of flavored club soda in his big hands he said johnny what makes you think mr mirth might be beyond the reach of your insidious mindbending skills his defenses are too strong vail said reasonably he can laugh damn near anything off with more time or if wed been able to push him without concern for holding up the others then maybe trianna kissed johnny on the cheek and crossed the room to join them she hugged gwen and ollie i love you both she said little tears glistening in her eyes i dont know how but i feel different somehow its magic ollie said solemnly trianna noticed vail i dont think ive met you norman vail the doctor said shaking her hand im with medical services im glad you had a good time he paused you did i hope the very best even more than that she took gwens arm do you fellas mind if i borrow the lady for a minute girl talk by all means trianna took gwen over to the side of the room and held both of her wrists i just wanted you to know that last night was the first time i havent had a nightmare for almost a year terrific and i wanted to say that i know that you were watching over us every step of the way i know i act kind of dippy but you never let it weird you out darling gwen said laughing in comparison to the bunch that i usually work with you guys have been downright normal and sane trianna laughed until she was crying gwens lips curled in a grudging smile well you had hebert and kevin and johnny all doing a dance around you even with the extra weight i think you better think about getting rid of that armorit aint working i guess not huh and forgive yourself for that abortion darling dont look so shocked you dropped enough clues so you were dropdead gorgeous and you got a lot of attention from guys who never saw you only the face and body triannas mouth was hanging open how did you know oh hush and one time you got pregnant and you werent ready for that trianna blushed worse the whole relationship went nasty and i got rid of the baby to spite him her beautiful face reddened with the effort to hold the tears back i paid for that she said in a hushed voice something went wrong and now i cant have babies at all gwen hugged her held her the hardest thing is forgiving yourself if you want to thank me will you do that ill try trianna snuffled and brushed a long strand of blond hair out of her face anyway charlene invited johnny and me up to falling angel and we accepted we vbл trianna looked back over at welsh his audience redfaced was bouncing on the couches and doubled up painfully holding their sides and begging for mercy suddenly it was difficult for gwen to remember him in the game spear in hand slaying the dreaded amartoqs unlike trianna johnny still needed his shield good luck to both of you gwen said ollies warm hand found hers and they joined vail he sat at the rim of a holo stage with eviane michelle and max and maxs brother orson charlene was there next to yarnall who wore a silly selfrighteous smile gwen tweaked him what are you so happy about welles that glorious bastard he liked the game i played so much that he kept that double bonus going both days told me i could play one of his scenarios anytime onstage was the island sequence with various gamers stalking and skulking about in the shadows rlyeh orson said its lovecrafts at the mountains of madness combined with his frigging floating island i never tumbled till i saw it up there on the screen max snorted so wonder boy blew it once at least you got out alive vail leaned into the conversation you know he offered i saw you both play and i would bet that both of you would play better if you were going for real points in a fat ripper siblings can reinforce each others habitual roles i think i saw that max confessed our act is hes brains im muscle max punched his brothers shoulder you know you did some powerful adventurin there they slapped hands yeah orson said contentedly it aint that i dont love youalthough i dontbut next time im winging it gwen chuckled then stopped as she watched michelle vail sat on the couch behind her too casually her face was intense with interest on the holo stage so vail said once again with extreme casualness how are you michelle fine she looked up at vail with a face devoid of guile or guilt or trauma you dont have to worry about me dr vail that nice alex griffin already talked to me about staying around for another week everybodys worried about me everybody can stop worrying i know the therapy i need and ive got him max grinned hugely taadah and the lifetime gold pass doesnt half help either i only love you for your pass max said and kissed her heartily just know vail said that if theres anything we can do ill call i promise vail moved around to charlene how are we feeling she was sprawled on the couch her feet up in heberts lap he was rubbing the tension out with strong practiced thumbs she said a little confused i guess nobody will tell me what really happened to marty i think that michelle knows michelles eyes were woeful as they met charlenes it was charlene who looked away it was a security matter vail said thats what mr griffin says and gwen and ollie say and michelle has this funny look in her eye charlene sighed and leaned back into her cushions oh darn my legs are so sore im considering amputation i guess i wont worry about marty still a wistful hurt look flitted across her then disappeared with vail gwen toured the room at his urging they made notes here compared opinions there only a quick prelim survey of course well spotcheck them for the next few months vail said what we really want to know is do we affect the actors more than the garners why would you gwen asked well in principle it could work like alcoholics anonymous get em to teach what you want them to learn harmony tells me we can put the actor option in the home game cassette but maybe it costs more than its worth theyd made a complete circuit of the room vail sighed i think thats about it trianna was dancing with johnny welsh even with her excess weight she was a woman of such sensuality that half the heads in the room turned to watch the weight would go when she visited the moon and then some of the mass would go too ones appetite decreased in low gravity maybe even johnny would lose some weight eight probable successes one cipher marty bobbick hippogryph had dropped out of the game most spectacularly where he was and what the conclusion of his story might be gwen wasnt sure she wanted to know if there were dungeons down below dream park what would the jailers look like and the rats it had been a good game some of the gamers had been outrageous enough that she would like them along on a real adventure others remained mysteries to her had never really revealed themselves to her that was the name of the game the war that it always was all things considered their successfailure ratio had been pretty good orson and johnny failures robin bowles francis hebert charlene yarnalltime would tell but both she and vail were confident that progress had been made max kevin titus trianna breakthrough city and of course michelle success beyond their dreams lastly gwen and ollie shed had fresh fruit for dessert and loved it and salad for a main course and loved it and a plain baked potato and strips of freshly wokked chicken and no fat or sugar at all she hadnt felt much of an urge to snack she had all the catchphrases memorized she could persuade herself of anything for minutes at a time but only time could measure how she would use what shed learned she didnt want to lose weight she didnt need to lose weight but what would ollie think of her in that yband monokini at the blue lagoon shop the scandalous one three sizes too small for her she could guess how he would react and if it didnt work out perfectly she had every confidence that she could gain the weight back yep she thought feeling the contentment expand within her like a warm tide it had been a very good game chapter thirtynine leviathan scratchyeyed and exhausted alex griffin stood in the security room overlooking the main floor of gaming a scanning watching for for what for three days after martys confession he had wrestled with the problem and it just wouldnt resolve they had scoured gaming b had doublechecked all of the identifications had increased security scanning at all checkpoints it was supposed to make him feel better it didnt he knew that something was terribly wrong his knuckles were white where his hands gripped the safety rail around the balcony he was hungry he was boneachingly tired and he continued to watch the crowd ambassador arbenz and his niece charlene were in thefront row enjoying the closing ceremonies everyone around them looked like dwarves somebody needed a swift kick for putting falling angels between the japan and china contingents as many security men as he had walking the floor surely arbenz was as safe as a man could be alex continued to scan verifying for the fourth time what a single glance at the computer printout could have told him fekesh wasnt here some of his representatives were there but pressing business had prevented kareem fekesh from personally attending the ceremonies extreme regrets all best wishes et cetera everything was going fine everyone was perfectly happy and alex griffin was terrified he forced his breathing to calm and his mind back to the job at hand cary mcgivvon stood next to him sipping a cup of coffee sure you wont have some caterers just brought it down good stuff no thank you he said it through gritted teeth the aroma was driving him crazy he had to escape im going down on the floor i cant just stand still okay chief ill stay on the holovision and treat dwight welles like one of the team were looking for something very subtle here and hes got a good overview alex walked down the spiral staircase of the twostory security building erected behind the rows of chairs the stages the demonstration areas which crowded the huge dome today was the finale and over twelve thousand guests were watching the final recap of the entire project all of you have children the narrator said many of you have grandchildren within the domes illusory black sky a pair of immense ungainly phoenix fl rockets rotated nose to nose around six hundred meters of tether for the coasting period between earth orbit and mars two truncated cones with rings of rocket nozzles around the bases aerospike configuration he had heard someone say whatever that meant now the sky was filled with rockets lightsail vehicles orbital tethers made of falling angel cable and more it was a carousel of possibilities a panoply of mankinds future greatness served up with soulstirring music and the finest effects cowles could create alex moved down one of the side rows walking lightly scanning faces examining badges nerves afire but still uncertain of the play what was fekesh up to and as always men will be needed to supervise the machines test the environment and reap the rewards the sky exploded as a comet impacted on the surface of mars bringing new life and possibilities red and blue light washed over alexs face over the room painting it luridly and the audience applauded the holographic display flinched from the stereophonic thunder alex barely noticed it his ears were deaf to the sound he scanned the faces in timelapse fantasy greenhouses and bubble cities sprang up across the surface atmosphere by now enough for airplanes bubble cities the question is and must always be how can we make money from this at every turn as alex finally reached the front of the room the narrator was deep into his pitch at every step of the way it seemed there was a fortune to be made from the mining of comets and the martian surface to the manufacture of fusion plants and lightsails from the design of life systems for the surface of phobos to the new fashion crazes it would all trigger on earth gaming spinoffs edible delicacies for the insanely rich it went on and on and they touched enough fiscal nerves to set the room sizzling they were ready after a week of delicate foreplay they were hot eager and ready to jump into the metaphorical sack with falling angel and cowles the floor rumbled and for a moment he was startled then he looked behind him at the byfoot stage where glowing mining machines surface transport vehicles and other wheeled craft were beginning their circular parade the music was john philip sousa christ all they needed was to whip out a united nations flag and half the room would jump up and salute mitch hasagawa was standing against a huge hanging curtain eyes glazed with the spectacle oh come on alex said to him its not all that great huh the stocky security man shook his head alex must not be the only one on short sleep the display mitch smiled tried to suppress a yawn and failed yeah right chief disturbed alex walked out of his earshot and touched his throat mike cary he asked how long has mitch been on duty there was a long pause cary another pause ah right here chief she sounded woozy ahabout nine hours i guess jesus have some more coffee will you you sound like hell send down somebody to relieve mitch sure boss cary signed off alex peered through the darkness where was the rest of his security force he spotted one uniformed figure over to the side of the stage and observed her for a minute before approaching she was partially slumped standing but numb in her right hand loosely held was a foam coffee cup the blood sang within him finally he triggered the throat mike again cary how many of our people have had coffee today the pause was even longer this time cary there was a thump behind him and sweating now alex turned to look the leviathan iv robot mining rig in some way that he couldnt quite define it seemed out of step with the other display models was it his imagination wasnt it supposed to move in that fashion the leviathan was huge the size of an armored tank a complete environment for the precomet days built for three men to roll from home base griffin suddenly had an awful ugly suspicion what was it that fekesh had done at colorado steel an industrial accident during a safety inspection and what had happened at dream park eight years before an accident in gaming b during a proxy fight for control of the company and what had happened three days ago he touched his throat mike cary ah yes dont let anyone else touch that coffee do you understand dreamily sure boss he didnt bother to curse alex tapped out millicents code on his watch and was relieved to hear her voice come in crisp and alert hello millie its alex no time get medical over here to gaming a fekesh has drugged securitys coffee what alex my god coffee supply and find me dwight welles alex kept an uneasy eye on that mining rig offering a silent thanks to his ulcer his earphone beeped welles here alex give me a break i havent had sleep in two days and youre not getting any now tie in to gaming a display autocircuits hurry jeeze welles sounded injured but did it in less than twenty seconds got it good now take manual control of the leviathan got you chief mmm nothing welles was talking to himself nothing nothing mmm zzzt listen chief the manual control is locked theres something crazy in here griffin was moving running in the dark the luminescent rigs were all that could be seen not the human being moving to intercept one of them he dodged robot jeeps running across a fantasy landscape welles is there any way into that thing wait ill get the specs on the screen okay the top is sealed but there is an emergency exit door on the belly theres just enough room to squeeze between the treads i think great it was rolling now let me know the instant it diverges from its programmed path got you chief nothing so fari just cant take control from here griffin whipped a pencillight from his jacket pocket panting now there was a trillion dollars worth of juice in that audience enough to ruin cowles industries to cripple plans for expansion to foreclose on outstanding loans to deny access to proprietary technology the future of cowles and of the barsoom project was in his hands can you cut power no chief power is selfcontained just great the thing was lumbering straight at him now and he had to calm his fears he lay down on his stomach and shone the pencillight directly between the treads therewelles had been correct there was just barely enough room and if it turned to left or right his world was filled with the sound of churning mechanicals as the tank began to pass over him and there will be dangers on the surface of the a blast of their damned ultrasonics passed through him and he blanched he was too close to the speakers and his body vibrated like a tuning fork he floated away on a sea of nausea overwhelmed mind lost in agony keep your mind on the job asshole alex made his hands take hold of the front bumper of the tank as it rolled past his head it was dragging him now and his back was already abraded hed only be able to stand a few seconds of this he climbed down the underside of the tank sucking air trying to calm himself as the subsonics roared through his blood and then he had the hatch with trembling fingers he worked at the latch lever and was insanely grateful that the dream park technos took their maintenance responsibilities seriously it was well oiled and opened immediately he wiggled up through the tight machinery what did they think barsooms miners would be midgets oh bloody hell it was a replica wasnt it it was going to break his hip he couldnt quite get through when griff problem something just took over the program what is it he pulled strained skin could give fat and muscle could give but not bone it must be a virus it hasnt shut me out yet i can still see what its doing theres a search program in action on the leviathans sensors search what is it searching oh shitits searching security badges its looking for someone goddamn it just locked on who alex lowered himself hed suddenly remembered a story something about a monkey who got his fist caught in a jar if he relaxed his fist and dropped the candy or if the dream park security man could back out again the martian surface savaged his lower body and there was no way to protect himself bump bump bump its locked on ambassador richard arbenz oh shit griff it broke out of the circle its heading off the platform griffin heaved himself up into the cabin there was enough room to move now but he was sore and there were muscles and tendons sprained where he hadnt even known he had muscles and tendons where is the computer link should be obvious leviathan was borrowed from rockwell they were using a manual system where wherewherewhere its just a box chipped into the cpu under the main screen there was a horrible bump as the entire mining rig left the platform with a crunching sound the barrier separating stage and audience gave way someone screamed too late too late angry sick terrified alex twisted sideways stretched still partially caught in the trapdoor but stretched far enough to grasp the box he yanked and tore and twisted cursed vilely and something gave chief got it then take control dammit charlene screamed and ambassador arbenz smiled thinly to himself even after three days of fantasy role playing his niece was unused to dream parks magic still as the mining rig came at him disconcertingly straight at him arbenz himself began to feel a bit of discomfort and when those glistening steel claws reached for himstraight for him the machine stopped hesitated and then continued reaching out he felt the claws touch him gently close on him and lift him into the air chair and all as gently as a mother lifts a baby it scooped him high into the air and held him there as triumphant music played from his vantage point he could see security men scurrying around the room and the uncertain faces of the other guests wondering how to feel about what they had just seen ambassador arbenz brushed himself off stood in the cup of the claws and smiled striking his hands together smartly in applause after a moments hesitation a confused charlene did the same and within a few seconds the rest of the audience followed chapter forty nightmares r us kareem fekesh was in a frenzy by remote camera he had watched the entire fiasco safe in his san diego tower arbenz should have been dead the barsoom project in chaos all of the cowles shares he had bought on margin all of the sell orders paying off wouldnt cripple him but he would feel the sting everything had gone wrong it wouldnt be long before the california police would want to question him let them wait he wouldnt be available freight flights and tanker ships sailed and flew under the aegis of his company nothing could keep him in the united states if he didnt want to be here but first there was a matter of personal business of honor he supervised the kismet program as it searched for the fool who had broken him who had it been dream park must have many computer technicians capable of the job how many would griffin trust with an assignment of such sensitivity kismetl had chosen twentytwo possibles through penetration of the dream park personnel files fekesh had access to each of their schedules for the past five days he should certainly need no more than that thus far he had found nothing very well outside contacts every phone call that griffin or his assistant had made he was still getting nowhere patience he who takes vengeance after forty years has acted in haste but circumstances change and haste was called for he considered calling a guard for coffee later he set the kismetl program to tracing griffins personal identification number as it moved through the park as it ambled through the park taking its own sweet there it intersected with the woman millicent summers she used to be his secretary would she know there griffin had made a call from her office to chino mens prison to an anthony mcwhirter mcwhirter was that name familiar fekeshs finger touched the return key about to start a search program instead he suddenly clapped his hands and laughed aloud delighted with the symmetry of life he had used mcwhirter against dream park and now griffin had returned the joke upon him it was almost worth leaving the little fool his life but no mcwhirters death would serve as an immediate message to griffin griffin himself could die later but first he must anticipate fekesh tapped return mcwhirter vanished collia aziz lay dead in a trash dumpster sprawled headdown in a bed of used printout paper her mouth gaped slackly and her eyes and her throat dried blood crusted her hair fekesh threw himself backward the chair tipped and he somersaulted and was on his feet before any enemy could have reached him it was her his fingers stabbed the keys and the screen cleared what could that have been why would he have put a record of the assassination of poor collia in his files he wiped his forehead his throat felt tight he set his chair in place and sat now then he could enter the command that would cause the computer store to pass a message for the special security branch and security would arrange for mcwhirter even safely ensconced in chino at the touch of his fingertip the screen flashed a picture of an oriental male sprawled against a featureless white background an eskimos fur headpiece lay halfshredded near his outfiung hand the ragged top of his head gaped against snow splashed with bright red izumi must have been freshly dead when this was taken fekesh didnt scream he pushed his chair back from the screen he reached forward to hit return and the image became a corpse torn almost in half by a fallen girder fekesh stared for some seconds but he didnt recognize the man at all irrelevant distracting fekesh stood snatched up his briefcase pushed his hand forcefully into one corner the plastic shell gave and now he was holding the pistol grip and trigger of a stillconcealed spitgun they had penetrated him had found him here in his private offices he was no longer safe what he had considered to be beyond consideration he must accept now dream park intended to assassinate him well on his home ground they couldnt reach him and they could not know how many ways he had of reaching home ground he pushed a button on the wall a panel slid back to expose an elevator door private safe he heard a shshsh the windsong of an elevator moving upward through its shaft and then the door slid open he halfexpected to see a crouching assassin too melodramatic too practical for dream park he lowered the briefcase spitgun he was about to take that step forward when a wave of fear hit him in hasty paranoia he tested the floor and his toe went right through there was nothing there beyond where he perceived patterned scarlet rug his foot turned murky nearly invisible then the top and bottom edges of the door began to extrude teeth fekesh yanked his foot back overbalanced and fell on his arse without ever taking his eyes off the elevator sharp teeth dripping dream park stuff dream parks signature and if they wanted his attention here then what was happening behind him fekesh gathered himself and abruptly rolled backward briefcase aimed wait nothing look again nothing an empty office a computer running quietly that gory photograph onscreen must be one of the men who died in the accident that gave him control of colorado steel he hit the escape key with savage force the screen printed escape in block letters across colorado steels torn work foreman fekesh was sweating now heart thundering in his chest and his fingers ripped at his tie he was struggling for breath and not finding it what was happening what was he staggered back to his desk and punched his phone line i am sorry an operators disconnected recorded voice said mockingly this line is temporarily out of service the special security number was dead the fire alarm circuits dead the elevator was alive and deadly but what about the fire stairs too damned predictably the lock was jammed everything was dead broken jammed and now he was gasping for breath he staggered to the wall vents sucking for air by allahs holy name the vent was working he could hear it but there was no air pressure against his palms in fact he screamed it was pumping air out of the room air air he tore off his jacket and held it against the vent air hissed through the cloth he aimed his briefcase at the picture window at the san diego skyline but he didnt fire there was a reason what was it a bullet fired into this glass would ricochet hed shoot himself he dropped the briefcase he heaved a chair up from beside the desk and hammered once gaping like a fish now twice against the shatterproof glass spots before his eyes and again and it cracked he swung again and it spiderwebbed and the crack ran all along the glass and down across the floor the floor was turning crystalline even as he watched andhen everything around him turned transparent all of the chairs the tables the desks turned to broken glass and vanished and on hands and knees he was suspended above san diego then then his clothing dissolved his skin his organs and flesh and then his bones he was gone he began to understand that there was no more kareem fekesh there was time for him to say goodby to himself a discorporate awareness suspended above san diego then san diego dropped away kareem fekesh rose with the speed of a rocket the earth dwindled to the size of a tennis ball and there wa no air no air something passed across the black starscape flapping vast golden wings griffin he whispered or thought of whispering his vision went black and red black and then nothing chapter fortyone epilogue a tragic accident is what the papers call it seated gingerly on a table near the window griffin turned to face millicent his back was still terribly sore and his left elbow was bandaged hows fekesh it was a quarter to nine in the morning as if sensing his black mood millicent had appeared at his doorway ten minutes earlier with a pot of the best damned decaffeinated coffee he had ever tasted she was seated at his desk now scanning his computer screen like the friend and helper she had always been she noted his discomfort but chose to distract him rather than call his attentiontoit well she said slowly there was considerable organic brain dysfunction due to oxygen deprivation in medical terms then hes a vegetable not quite massive motor dysfunction recurring nightmares memory impairment mental level of a tenyearold maybe alex tskd and the final notes on his computer at the time how did you know to ask that millicent said suspiciously scanning the newsfax it was a call to arms asking his followers to stand one hundred percent behind the barsoom project isnt that interesting fascinating theres no suggestion here that it might be fake if thats what you were wondering even more interesting is the fact that hes too sick to leave the country right now this clinic in la mesadoesnt vail work out of there a few hours a month alex smiled warmly the nagging pain had him feeling vicious im certain that fekesh will get the very best of care cowles owns a share of the clinic im not surprised at all and recently acquired an interest in fekeshs elevator repair company jesus alex i dont know who scares me more you or vail no need to see conspiracy in every little coincidence diversification is the wave of the future millicent joined griffin by the window sat so close that their knees were touching griff how much did you have to do with this absolutely nothing his face was all innocence until something slipped i only opened the box and all these things flew out he looked inside him for the guilt and found none even so i dont imagine ill ever open that box again he wondered if shed pursue it he was being judged alex wondered what verdict he would have rendered hed been on painkillers but hed been lucid enough when he went to the magicians when he turned izumi and khresla and welles and god help him vail loose she said and what were you doing on the night of june seventeenth the lobster dinner the same thing i was doing on the night of june twentyfifth she smiled thats tonight hope springs eternal he could see her shoulders relaxing what hope was that finishing dinner with my beautiful exsecretary who was much too good for you correction was much too good to be my secretary ahha her fingers touched a file folder on his desk and a fingernail flicked it open in it was a picture of marty poor marty alexs attempt at good humor faded nobody intended it vail swears he had nothing to do with it i swear it millie not a bite hasnt eaten for almost two weeks if they forcefeed him he vomits county put him on ivs and marty kept tearing them out of his ann legally we cant force him to eat she shook her head try the dream park diet she said lose a pound a day and never be hungry again jesus griffin said youve got a morbid streak dont you millicent shuddered listen maybe if one of the other garners talked to him the outer office door opened and a tall slender man entered he looked a little pale and wan but the smile was genuine griffin he said cautiously extending his hand you kept your promise tony mcwhirter you kept yours alex said youre on work furlough loaned to the municipality of dream park ahas the duly elected sheriff of dream park i tell you that you are restricted to within two kilometers of this office alexs voice softened the only other restriction is that you make up for lost time tony the two men faced each other looking uncomfortable tony looked around the room and through the external windows around the park the barsoom project was gone dream park was alight again ready for the public it wore its public face dream park was bright and beautiful and flashy i feel so strange tony said i cant believe that youre giving me a chance like this youve panned out griffin said lets start over again i want you here in security meantime until we know exactly what the situation is youll stay in cmc with full protection just in case appreciate that mcwhirter nodded to millicent his eyes lingered on her until he suddenly flushed with embarrassment he left the office hurriedly millicent watched him go could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship yeah alex sighed based on honesty and trust based on fantasy she said not the worst place to start he said his arm stole around her it wasnt his fault none of the death the deception the injury surrounding the barsoom project and the past of cowles industries had been his fault but his aching back and bruised ribs and the sight of tonys hollow face had reminded him that it was all his responsibility he had done the best he could and he had to believe vail vail just couldnt have reached into martys head somehow and twisted he thought of kareem fekesh in la mesa and of vails loving ministrations and shivered he had to let it go if he could just manage to live with himself for another week or so maybe he could go on and do his job he felt heavy and old and tired millicent kissed him gently on the cheek you know what lets do she said softly what lets sign up the two of us as partners in that shipwreck game next week she paused i wouldnt mind being your girl friday again a whole weeks game tropical sun digging for turtle eggs exploring semiextinct volcanoes for treasure i dont know im damned busy she punched him in the good side i happen to know that youve got three weeks accumulated vacation harmony would give you three more without a blink refuse me and ill have vail give you a psychiatric suspension on what grounds she turned his head with palms that were warm and soft her lips parted slightly as she pressed them against his youd be crazy to turn me down he laughed not a large laugh but it held promise the first glimpse of sunlight through storm clouds it was going to be all right as long as he had friends like millicent and harmony he could survive anything they held each other and watched the front gates open the crowds would marvel at the effects and immerse themselves in the adventures for a time they would lose their minds and most would be the better for it but if they knew what lay behind the magic that one question at least he could answer most people dont really want to see the strings dont want to see what lurks behind the mirrors they need dreams need magic always have alex couldnt hear the sounds of laughter of gaiety and excitement couldnt see the individual smiles of anticipation but he could see the flow the tide of life as it streamed once more into the streets of dream park we are the magicians griffin reminded himself proudly we bring the dream to we and were the only ones who can afterword this was an ambitious project dream park was fantasy wrapped in science fiction wrapped in mystery the barsoom project is cut from the same pattern our intent has been to blend dozens of individual threads of information into one seamless tapestry in the case of the fimbulwinter game it proved more difficult to trace down data on the spirit world of the northern peoples than we had anticipated thanks and acknowledgments are even more appropriate than usual the people whom we call eskimo orlnuit are not a single group but a scattering of tribes and small nations ranging down from the arctic circle and up from asia and the north american indian peoples there are many lifestyles and many languages some of the inuit are still hunters in the primitive fashion of their ancestors many are modern professional people as one might anticipate the traditional tribal structure is in danger of being destroyed by contact with the forces of western culture and technology myths are the first steps toward science an attempt to explain the unknown the inuit live in the most unforgiving environment on earth they have devised a vast and complex mythology encompassing everything from weather gods to the usual xenophobic tales of cannibalsbeyondthemountains there is no unified world view that one can truly call the inuit way we needed to find an entry into their world their way of seeing the universe enter richard dobson of the transformative arts institute in san geronimo california an expert in contemporary shamanism richard was of integral help in explaining the belief patterns common to all shamanic peoples worldwide many hours of lecturing and discussion yielded a framework within which the scattered pieces of data began to make sense harley swift deer reagan a master of the sweet medicine sundance teachings of the cherokee and athabascanspeaking peoples offered additional insight into the epistemological structures through which the north south and central native american peoples organize their lives world view and cosmology additional thanks must be given for specific data on the value and techniques of the pipe ceremony the medicine wheel and that most amazing tool for spiritual enlightenment and or masochistic semiimmolation not to mention native cuisine the sweat lodge steven was smart enough to choose his fatherinlaw carefully thomas young a texaco engineer who specializes in building ice roads in alaska provided books video photos and stories of the eskimo world special thanks of the books on the inuit peoples by far the most useful was inua spirit world of the bering sea eskimo by william w fitzhugh and susan a kaplan also valuable were the nelson island eskimo by ann fienupriordan and ancient men of the arctic by j louis giddings all of the games natural magics stem from inuit traditions of the people of the north though not from any single tribe likewise with the gods archetypes monsters and wildlife except in the single case of the wolfalcons here the authors took a general myth pattern establishing that inuit shamans can mutate themselves into bizarre bird animal and fish shapes and allowed the cabal to become creative shaping the barsoom project was much easier gary hudson has wanted to build spacecraft for some decades now over the years his phoenix designs have changed many times following changing technology always they have been small singlestage groundtoorbit craft truncated cones using the aerospike engine configuration schemes for terraforming mars generally involve using comet impacts and genetailored algae to shape a breathable atmosphere and or to free the air and water that once carved riverbeds on mars it would be cheap and easy compared to the terraforming of venus skyhook devices are pretty much as described every such device would be initially very expensive but very cheap to run each would open the solar system to mankind each could be terribly destructive if it failed and each would be more easily and safely built using mars as a test bed join any of todays space advocacy groups and you need not seek information on skyhooks it will seek you out dream park our first collaborative novel has achieved some notoriety and is considered by many to be something of a minor classic it has never been out of print has been under film option continuously and has even spawned a reallife version of the international fantasy gaming society in april of we were invited to the first convention held by the real ifgs in denver colorado these are bright energetic highly creative and infectiously enthusiastic folks who sponsor and coordinate elaborate costumed fantasy roleplaying events they are literally committed to bringing dream park into existence power to them and may their legions increase presently they have chapters all over the united states and are building a network overseas they can be reached at the following address ifgs po box boulder colorado they were understandably eager to know what we thought of them lets just say that although the faa would certainly have frowned upon it your humble authors could have flown back to la without a plane since the original publication of dream park countless readers have requested a sequel we have to confess a certain degree of reluctance at least partially because it would have been too darned easy so we waited until the right idea came along in the right context at the right time seven years have passed since the events of dream park but dream park technology hasnt changed much we assumed then as now that computer technology and hologram technology have become stunningly powerful by the midtwentyfirst century within dream park reality has become almost optional the authors find it fascinating to watch how human beings handle that dream park is a special place for both of us a playground in which the collaborative game of can you top this can be played on a dozen fields at the same moment if it has been half as entertaining to read as it was to write then it was indeed worth the wait and the effort larry niven and steven barnes los angeles may
