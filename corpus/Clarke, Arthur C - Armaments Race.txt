armaments race arthur c clarke popular publications inc as ive remarked on previous occasions noone has ever succeeded in pinningdown harry purvis prize raconteur of the white hart for any length of time of his scientific knowledge there can be no doubtbut where did he pick it up and what justification is there for the terms of familiarity with which he speaks of so many fellows of the royal society there are it must be admitted many who do not believe a single word he says that i feel is going a little too far as i recently remarked somewhat forcibly to bill temple youre always gunning for harry i said but you must admit that he provides entertainment and thats more than most of us can say if youre being personal retorted bill still rankling over the fact that some perfectly serious stories had just been returned by an american editor on the grounds that they hadnt made him laugh step outside and say that again he glanced through the window noticed that it was still snowing hard and hastily added not today then but maybe sometime in the summer if were both here on the wednesday that catches it have another of your favorite shots of straight pineapple juice thanks i said one day ill ask for a gin with it just to shake you i think i must be the only guy in the white hart who can take it or leave itand leaves it this was as far as the conversation got because the subject of the discussion then arrived normally this would merely have added fuel to the controversy but as harry had a stranger with him we decided to be polite little boys hello folks said harry meet my friend solly blumberg best special effects man in hollywood lets be accurate harry said mr blumberg sadly in a voice that should have belonged to a whipped spaniel not in hollywood out of hollywood harry waved the correction aside all the better for you sols come over here to apply his talents to the british film industry there is a british film industry said solly anxiously no one seemed very sure round the studio sure there is its in a very flourishing condition too the government piles on an entertainments tax that drives it to bankruptcy then keeps it alive with whacking big grants thats the way we do things in this country hey drew wheres the visitors book and a double for both of us sollys had a terrible timehe needs a bit of building up i cannot say that apart from his hangdog look mr blumberg had the appearance of a man who had suffered extreme hardships he was neatly dressed in a hart schaffner and marx suit and the points of his shirt collar buttoned down somewhere around the middle of his chest that was thoughtful of them as they thus concealed something but not enough of his tie i wondered what the trouble was not unamerican activities again i prayed that would trigger off our pet communist who at the moment was peaceably studying a chessboard in the corner we all made sympathetic noises and john said rather pointedly maybe itll help to get it off your chest it will be such a change to hear someone else talking around here dont be so modest john cut in harry promptly im not tired of hearing you yet but i doubt if solly feels much like going through it again do you old man no said mr blumberg you tell them where shall i begin asked harry the time lillian ross came to interview you anywhere but there shuddered solly it really started when we were making the first captain zoom serial captain zoom said someone ominously those are two very rude words in this place dont say you were responsible for that unspeakable rubbish now boys put in harry in his best oilontroubledwaters voice dont be too harsh we cant apply our own high standards of criticism to everything and people have got to earn a living besides millions of kids like captain zoom surely you wouldnt want to break their little heartsand so near xmas too if they really liked captain zoom id rather break their little necks such unseasonable sentiments i really must apologize for some of my compatriots solly lets see what was the name of the first serial captain zoom and the menace from mars ali yes thats right incidentally i wonder why we always are menaced by mars i suppose that man wells started it one day we may have a big interplanetary libel action on our handsunless we can prove that the martians have been equally rude about us im very glad to say that i never saw menace from mars but we are not concerned with the story such as it was that was written by three men in a bar on wilshire boulevard noone is sure whether the menace came out the way it did because the script writers were drunk or whether they had to keep drunk in order to face the menace if thats confusing dont bother all that solly was concerned with were the special effects that the director demanded first of all he had to build mars to do this he spent half an hour with the conquest of space and then emerged with a sketch which the carpenters turned into an overripe orange floating in nothingness with an improbable number of stars around it that was easy the martian cities werent so simple you try and think of completely alien architecture that still makes sense i doubt if its possibleif it will work at all someones already used it here on earth what the studio finally built was vaguely byzantine with touches of frank lloyd wright the fact that none of the doors led anywhere didnt really matter as long as there was enough room on the sets for the swordplay and general acrobatics that the script demanded yesswordplay here was a civilization which had atomic power deathrays spaceships television and suchlike modem conveniences but when it came to a fight between captain zoom and the evil emperor klugg the clock went back a couple of centuries a lot of soldiers stood round holding deadlylooking rayguns but they never did anything with them well hardly ever sometimes a shower of sparks would chase captain zoom and singe his pants but that was all i suppose that as the rays couldnt very well move faster than light he could always outrun them still those ornamental rayguns gave everyone quite a few headaches its funny how hollywood will spend endless trouble on some minute detail in a film which is complete rubbish the director of captain zoom had a thing about rayguns solly designed the mark that looked like a cross between a bazooka and a blunderbuss he was quite satisfied with it and so was the directorfor about a day and then the great man came raging into the studio carrying a revolting creation of purple plastic with knobs and lenses and levers lookit this solly he puffed junior got it down at the supermarkettheyre being given away with packets of crunch collect ten lids and you get one hell theyre better than ours and they work he pressed a lever and a thin stream of water shot across the set and disappeared behind captain zooms spaceship where it promptly extinguished a cigarette that had no right to be burning there an angry stagehand emerged through the airlock saw who it was had drenched him and swiftly retreated muttering things about his union solly examined the raygun with annoyance and yet with an experts discrimination yes it was certainly much more impressive than anything hed put out he retired into his office and promised to see what he could do about it the mark had everything built into it including a television screen if captain zoom was suddenly confronted by a charging hickoderm all he had to do was to switch on the set wait for the tubes to warm up check the channel selector adjust the fine tuning touch up the focus twiddle with the line and frame holdsand then press the trigger he was fortunately a man of unbelievably swift reactions the director was impressed and the mark went into production a slightly different model the mark ila was built for the emperor kluggs diabolical cohorts it would never do of course if both sides had the same weapon i told you that pandemic productions were sticklers for accuracy all went well until the first rushes and even beyond while the cast was acting if you can use that word they had to point the guns and press the triggers as if something was really happening the sparks and flashes however were put on the negative later by two little men in a darkroom about as well guarded as fort knox they did a good job but after a while the producer again felt twinges in his overdeveloped artistic conscience solly he said toying with the plastic horror which had reached junior by courtesy of crunch the succulent cerealnot a burp in a barrelsolly i still want a gun that does something solly ducked in time so the jet went over his head and baptized a photograph of louella parsons youre not going to start shooting all over again he wailed nooo replied the producer with obvious reluctance well have to use what weve got but it looks faked somehow he ruffled through the script on his desk then brightened up now next week we start on episode slaves of the slugmen well the slugmen gotta have guns so what id like you to do is this the mark iii gave solly a lot of trouble not only had it to be a completely new design but as youll have gathered it had to do something this was a challenge to sollys ingenuity however if i may borrow from professor toynbee it was a challenge that evoked the appropriate response some highpowered engineering went into the mark iii luckily solly knew an ingenious technician whod helped him out on similar occasions before and he was really the man behind it the principle was to use a jet of air produced by a small but extremely powerful electric fan and then to spray finely divided powder into it when the thing was adjusted correctly it shot out a most impressive beam and made a still more impressive noise the actors were so scared of it that their performances became most realistic the producer was delightedfor a full three days then a dreadful doubt assailed him solly he said those damn guns are too good the slugmen can beat the pants off captain zoom well have to give him something better i it was at this point that solly realized what had happened he had become involved in an armaments race lets see this brings us to the mark iv doesnt it how did that workoh yes i remember it was a glorified oxyacetylene burner with various chemicals injected into it to produce the most beautiful flames i should have mentioned that from episode doom on deimosthe studio had switched over from black and white to murkicolor and great possibilities were thus opened up by squirting copper or strontium or barium into the jet you could get any colour you wanted if you think that by this time the producer was satisfied you dont know hollywood some cynics may still laugh when the motto ars gratia artis flashes on the screen but this attitude i submit is not in accordance with the facts would such old fossils as michelangelo rembrandt or titian have spent so much time effort and money on the quest for perfection as did pandemic productions i think not i dont pretend to remember all the marks that solly and his ingenious engineer friend produced during the course of the serial there was one that shot out a stream of coloured smokerings there was the highfrequency generator that produced enormous but quite harmless sparks there was a particularly ingenious curved beam produced by a jet of water with light reflected along inside it which looked most spectacular in the dark and finally there was the mark mark said mr blumberg of coursehow stupid of me what other number could it have been the mark was not actually a portable weapon though some of the others were portable only by a considerable stretch of the imagination it was the diabolical device to be installed on phobos in order to subjugate earth though solly has explained them to me once the scientific principles involved escape my simple mind however who am i to match my brains against the intellects responsible for captain zoom i can only report what the ray was supposed to do not how it did it it was to start a chain reaction in the atmosphere of our unfortunate planet making the nitrogen and the oxygen in the air combine with highly deleterious effects to terrestrial life im not sure whether to be sorry or glad that solly left all the details of the fabulous mark to his talented assistant though ive questioned him at some length all he can tell me is that the thing was about six feet high and looked like a cross between the inch telescope and an antiaircraft gun thats not very helpful is it he also says that there were a lot of radio tubes in the brute as well as a thundering great magnet and it was definitely supposed to produce a harmless but impressive electric arc which could be distorted into all sorts of interesting shapes by the magnet that was what the inventor said and despite everything there is still no reason to disbelieve him by one of those mischances that later turns out to be providential solly wasnt at the studio when they tried out the mark to his great annoyance he had to be down in mexico that day and wasnt that lucky for you solly he was expecting a longdistance call from one of his friends in the afternoon but when it came through it wasnt the kind of message hed anticipated the mark had been to put it mildly a success noone knew exactly what had happened but by a miracle no lives had been lost and the fire department had been able to save the adjoining studios it was incredible yet the facts were beyond dispute the mark was supposed to be a phony deathrayand it had turned out to be a real one something had emerged from the projector and gone through the studio wall as if it wasnt there indeed a moment later it wasnt there was just a great big hole beginning to smolder round the edges and then the roof fell in unless solly could convince the fbi that it was all a mistake hed better stay the other side of the border even now the pentagon and the atomic energy commission were converging upon the wreckage what would you have done in sollys shoes he was innocent but how could he prove it perhaps he would have gone back to face the music if he hadnt remembered that hed once hired a man whod campaigned for henry wallace back in that might take some explaining away besides solly was a little tired of captain zoom so here he is anyone know of a british film company that might have an opening for him but historical films only please he wont touch anything more uptodate than crossbows
