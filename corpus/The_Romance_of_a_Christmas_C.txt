 the romance of a christmas card by kate douglas wiggin illustrated by alice ercle hunt boston and new york houghton mifflin company the riverside press cambridge copyright by the butterick publishing company copyright by kate douglas riggs illustration frontispiece the romance of a christmas card i it was christmas eve and a saturday night when mrs larrabee the beulah ministers wife opened the door of the study where her husband was deep in the revision of his next days sermon and thrust in her comely head framed in a knitted rigolette luther im going to run down to lettys we think the twins are going to have measles its the only thing they havent had and lettys spirits are not up to concert pitch you look like a blessed old prophet tonight my dear whats the text the minister pushed back his spectacles and ruffled his gray hair isaiah vi and i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send then said i here am i send me it doesnt sound a bit like christmas somehow it has the spirit if it hasnt the sound said the minister there is always so little spare money in the village that we get less and less accustomed to sharing what we have with others i want to remind the people that there are different ways of giving and that the bestowing of ones self in service and good deeds can be the best of all gifts letty boynton wont need the sermon dont be late reba of course not when was i ever late it has just struck seven and ill be back by eight to choose the hymns and oh luther i have some fresh ideas for christmas cards and i am going to try my luck with them in the marts of trade there are hundreds of thousands of such things sold nowadays and if the boston banner likes my verses well enough to send me the paper regularly why shouldnt the people who make cards like them too especially when i can draw and paint my own pictures ive no doubt theyll like them who wouldnt if the parish knew what a ready pen you have theyd suspect that you help me in my sermons the question is will the publishers send you a check or only a copy of your card i should relish a check i confess but oh i should like almost as well a beautifully colored card luther with a picture of my own inventing on it my own verse and r l in tiny letters somewhere in the corner it would make such a lovely christmas present and i should be so proud inside of course not outside i would cover my halo with my hat so that nobody in the congregation would ever notice it the minister laughed consult letty my dear david used to be in some sort of picture business in boston she will know perhaps where to offer your card at the introduction of a new theme into the conversation mrs larrabee slipped into a chair by the door her lantern swinging in her hand david cant be as near as boston or we should hear of him sometimes a pretty sort of brother to be meandering footloose over the earth and letty working her fingers to the bone to support his children twins at that it was just like david gilman to have twins doesnt it seem incredible that he can let christmas go by without a message i dare say he doesnt even remember that his babies were born on christmas eve to be sure he is only lettys halfbrother but after all they grew up together and are nearly the same age you always judged david a little severely reba dont despair of reforming any man till you see the grass growing over his bare bones i always have a soft spot in my heart for him when i remember his friendship for my dick but that was before your time oh these boys these boys the ministers voice quavered we give them our very lifeblood we love them cherish them pray over them do our best to guide them yet they take the path that leads from home in some way god knows how we fail to call out the return love or even the filial duty and respect well we wont talk about it reba my business is to breathe the breath of life into my text here am i lord send me letty certainly continues to say it heroically whatever her troubles yes letty is so ready for service that she will always be sent till the end of time but if david ever has an interview with his creator i can hear him say here am i lord send letty the minister laughed again he laughed freely and easily nowadays his first wife had been a sort of understudy for a saint and after a brief but depressing connubial experience she had died leaving him with a boy of six a boy who already at that tender age seemed to cherish a passionate aversion to virtue in any form the result perhaps of daily doses of the catechism administered by an abnormally pious mother the minister had struggled valiantly with his paternal and parochial cares for twelve lonely years when he met wooed and won very much to his astonishment and exaltation reba crosby there never was a better bargain driven she was fortyfive by the family bible but twentyfive in face heart and mind while he would have been printed as sixty in whos who in new hampshire although he was far older in patience and experience and wisdom the minister was spiritual frail and a trifle prone to selfdepreciation the ministers new wife was spirited vigorous courageous and clever she was also westernborn collegebred good as gold and invincibly incurably gay the minister grew younger every year for reba doubled his joys and halved his burdens tossing them from one of her fine shoulders to the other as if they were feathers she swept into the quiet village life of beulah like a salt sea breeze she infused a new spirit into the bleak church sociables and made them positively agreeable functions the choir ceased from wrangling the sunday school plucked up courage and flourished like a green bay tree she managed the deacons she braced up the missionary societies she captivated the parish she cheered the depressed and depressing old ladies and cracked jokes with the invalids aint she a little mite too jolly for a ministers wife questioned mrs ossian popham who was a professional pessimist if this world is a place of want woe wantonness an wickedness same as you claim maria i dont see how a ministers wife can be too jolly was her husbands cheerful reply look how shes melted up the ice in both congregations sot the other church is most willin we should prosper so long as mis larrabee stays here an we dont get too fur ahead of em in attendance me for the smiles maria and osh popham was right for reba larrabee convinced the members of the rival church the rivalry between the two being in rigidity of creed not in persistency in good works that there was room in heaven for at least two denominations and said that if they couldnt unite in this world perhaps theyd get round to it in the next finally she saved letitia boyntons soul alive by giving her a warm understanding friendship and she even contracted to win back the ministers absent son some time or other and convince him of the error of his ways let dick alone a little longer luther she would say dont hurry him for he wont come home so long as hes a failure it would please the village too much and dick hates the village he doesnt accept our point of view that we must love our enemies and bless them that despitefully use us the village did despitefully use dick and for that matter david gilman too they were criticized gossiped about judged without mercy nobody believed in them nobody ever praised them and what is that about praise being the fructifying sun in which our virtues ripen or something like that im not quoting it right but i wish id said it they were called wild when most of their wildness was exuberant vitality their mistakes were magnified their mad pranks exaggerated if id been married to you my dear while dick was growing up i wouldnt have let you keep him here in this little backwater of life he needed more room more movement they wouldnt have been so down on him in racine wisconsin mrs larrabee lighted her lantern closed the door behind her and walked briskly down the lonely road that led from the parsonage at beulah corner to letitia boyntons house it was bright moonlight and the ground was covered with lightfallen snow but the lantern habit was a fixed one among beulah ladies who even when they were not widows or spinsters made their evening calls mostly without escort the light of a lantern not only enabled one to pick the better side of a bad road but would illuminate the face of any male stranger who might be of a burglarious or murderous disposition reba larrabee was not a timid person indeed she was wont to say that men were so scarce in beulah that unless they were outandout ruffians it would be an inspiration to meet a few even if it were only to pass them in the middle of the road there was a light in the meetinghouse as she passed and then there was a long stretch of shining white silence unmarked by any human habitation till she came to the tumbledown black cottage inhabited by doorbutton davis as the little old man was called in the village in the distance she could see osh pophams twostory house brilliantly illuminated by kerosene lamps and as she drew nearer she even descried ossian himself seated at the cabinet organ in his shirtsleeves practicing the christmas anthem his daughter holding a candle to the page while she struggled to adjust a circuitous alto to her fathers tenor on the hither side of the popham house and quite obscured by it stood letitia boyntons onestory gray cottage it had a clump of tall cedar trees for background and the bare branches of the elms in front were hung lightly with snow garlands as mrs larrabee came closer she set down her lantern and looked fixedly at the familiar house as if something new arrested her gaze it looks like a little nightlight she thought and how queer of letty to be sitting at the open window nearer still she crept yet not so near as to startle her friend a tall brass candlestick with a lighted tallow candle in it stood on the table in the parlor window but the room in which letty sat was unlighted save by the fire on the hearth which gleamed brightly behind the quaint andirons hessian soldiers of iron painted in gay colors over the mantel hung the portrait of lettys mother a benign figure clad in black silk the handsome head topped by a snowy muslin cap with floating strings just round the corner of the fireplace was a halfopen door leading into a tiny bedroom and the flickering flame lighted the heads of two sleeping children arms interlocked bright tangled curls flowing over one pillow letty herself sat in a low chair by the open window wrapped in an old cape of ruddy brown homespun from the folds of which her delicate head rose like a flower in a bouquet of autumn leaves one elbow rested on the table her chin in the cup of her hand her head was turned away a little so that one could see only the knot of bronze hair the curve of a cheek and the sweep of an eyelash what a picture thought reba the very thing for my christmas card it would do almost without a change if only she is willing to let me use her wake up letty she called come and let me in why your front door isnt closed the fire smoked a little when i first lighted it said letty rising when her friend entered and then softly shutting the bedroom door that the children might not waken the night is so mild and the room so warm i couldnt help opening the window to look at the moon on the snow sit down reba how good of you to come when youve been rehearsing for the christmas tree exercises all the afternoon illustration ii its never good of me to come to talk with you letty and the ministers wife sank into a comfortable seat and took off her rigolette enough virtue has gone out of me today to christianize an entire heathen nation oh how i wish luther would go and preach to a tribe of cannibals somewhere and make me superintendent of the sabbathschool how i should like to deal just for a change with some simple problem like the undesirability and indigestibility involved in devouring your nextdoor neighbor now i pass my life in saying love your neighbor as yourself which is far more difficult than to say dont eat your neighbor its such a disgusting habit and wrong besides though i dare say they do it half the time because the market is bad the first thing id do would be to get my cannibals to raise sheep if they ate more mutton they wouldnt eat so many missionaries letty laughed youre so funny reba dear and i was so sad before you came in dont let the minister take you to the cannibals until after i die no danger letty do you remember i told you id been trying my hand on some verses for a christmas card yes have you sent them anywhere not yet i couldnt think of the right decoration and color scheme and was afraid to trust it all to the publishers now ive found just what i need for one of them and you gave it to me letty i yes you tonight as i came down the road the house looked so quaint backed by the dark cedars and the moon and the snow made everything dazzling i could see the firelight through the open window the hessian soldier andirons your mothers portrait the children asleep in the next room and you wrapped in your cape waiting or watching for something or somebody i wasnt watching or waiting i was dreaming said letty hurriedly you looked as if you were watching anyway and i thought if i were painting the picture i would call it expectancy or the vigil or sentry duty however when i make you into a card letty nobody will know what the figure at the window means till they read my verses ill give you the house the room the andirons and even mothers portrait but you dont mean that you want to put me on the card and letty turned like a startled deer as she rose and brushed a spark from the hearthrug no not the whole of you of course though im not clever enough to get a likeness even if i wished i merely want to make a color sketch of your redbrown cape your hair that matches it your ear an inch of cheek and the eyelashes of one eye if you please maam that doesnt sound quite so terrifying and letty looked more manageable nobodyll ever know that a real person sat at a real window and that i saw her there but when i send the card with a finished picture and my verses beautifully lettered on it the printing people will be more likely to accept it and if they do shall i have a dozen to give to my bibleclass asked letty in a wheedling voice you shall have more than that im willing to divide my magnificent profits with you you will have furnished the picture and i the verses its wonderful letty its providential you just are a christmas card tonight it seems so strange that you even put the lighted candle in the window when you never heard my verse the candle caught my eye first and i remembered the christmas customs we studied for the church festival the light to guide the christ child as he walks through the dark streets on the eve of mary yes i thought of that said letty flushing a little i put the candle there first so that the house shouldnt be all dark when the pophams went by to choirmeeting and just then i i remembered and was glad i did it these are my verses letty and rebas voice was soft as she turned her face away and looked at the flames mounting upward in the chimney my door is on the latch tonight the hearth fire is aglow i seem to hear swift passing feet the christ child in the snow my heart is open wide tonight for stranger kith or kin i would not bar a single door where love might enter in there was a moments silence and letty broke it it means the sort of love the christ child brings with peace and goodwill in it im glad to be a part of that card reba so long as nobody knows me and here she made an impetuous movement and covering her eyes with her hands burst into a despairing flood of confidence the words crowding each other and tumbling out of her mouth as if they feared to be stopped after i put the candle on the table i could not rest for thinking i wasnt ready in my soul to light the christ child on his way i was bitter and unresigned it is three years tonight since the children were born and each year i have hoped and waited and waited and hoped thinking that david might remember david my brother their father then the fire on the hearth the moon and the snow quieted me and i felt that i wanted to open the door just a little no one will notice that its ajar i thought but theres a touch of welcome in it anyway and after a few minutes i said to myself its no use david wont come but im glad the firelight shines on mothers picture for he loved mother and if she hadnt died when he was scarcely more than a boy things might have been different the reason i opened the bedroom door something i never do when the babies are asleep was because i needed a sight of their faces to reconcile me to my duty and take the resentment out of my heart and it did flow out reba out into the stillness it is so dazzling white outside i couldnt bear my heart to be shrouded in gloom poor letty and mrs larrabee furtively wiped away a tear how long since you have heard i didnt dare ask not a word not a line for nearly three months and for the halfyear before that it was nothing but a note sometimes with a fivedollar bill enclosed david seems to think it the natural thing for me to look after his children as if there could be no question of any life of my own you began wrong letty you were born a prop and youve been propping somebody ever since ive done nothing but my plain duty when my mother died there was my stepfather to nurse but i was young and strong i didnt mind and he wasnt a burden long poor father then after four years came the shock of davids reckless marriage when he asked if he might bring that girl here until her time of trial was over it seemed to me i could never endure it but there were only two of us left david and i i thought of mother and said yes i remember letty i had come to beulah then yes and you know what eva was how david how anybody could have loved her i cannot think well he brought her and you know how it turned out david never saw her alive again nor ever saw his babies after they were three days old still what can you expect of a father who is barely twentyone if hes old enough to have children hes old enough to notice them said mrs larrabee with her accustomed spirit somebody ought to jog his sense of responsibility its wrong for women to assume mens burdens beyond a certain point it only makes them more selfish if you only knew where david is you ought to bundle the children up and express them to his address not a word of explanation or apology simply tie a tag on them saying heres your twins but i love the babies said letty smiling through her tears and david may not be in a position to keep them then he shouldnt have had them retorted reba promptly especially not two of them theres such a thing as a mans being too lavish with babies when he has no intention of doing anything for them but bring them into the world if you had a living income it would be one thing but it makes me burn to have you stitching on coats to feed and clothe your halfbrothers children perhaps it doesnt make any difference now sighed letty pushing back her hair with an abstracted gesture i gave up a good deal for the darlings once but thats past and gone now after all theyre the only life i have and id rather make coats for them than for myself letty boynton had never said so much as this to mrs larrabee in the three years of their friendship and on her way back to the parsonage the ministers wife puzzled a little over the look in lettys face when she said david seemed to think there could be no question of any life of my own and again i gave up a good deal for the darlings once luther she said to the minister when the hymns had been chosen the sermon pronounced excellent and they were toasting their toes over the sittingroom fire luther do you suppose there ever was anything between letty boynton and your dick no he answered reflectively i dont think so dick always admired letty and went to the house a great deal but i imagine that was chiefly for davids sake for they were as like as peas in a pod in the matter of mischief if there had been more than friendship between dick and letty dick would never have gone away from beulah or if he had gone he surely would have come back to see how letty fared a fellow yearns for news of the girl he loves even when he is content to let silence reign between him and his old father what makes you think there was anything particular reba what makes anybody think anything i wonder why some people are born props and others leaners or twiners i believe the very nursingbottle leaned heavily against letty when she lay on her infant pillow i didnt know her when she was a child but i believe that when she was eight all the other children of three and five in the village looked to her for support and guidance its a great vocation that of being a prop smiled the minister as he peeled a red baldwin apple carefully preserving the spiral and eating it first i suppose the wobbly vine thinks its grand to be a stout trellis when it needs one to climb on but doesnt the trellis ever want to twine i wonder and rebas tone was doubtful even the trellis leans against the house reba well letty never gets a chance either to lean or to twine her family her friends her acquaintances even the stranger within her gates will pass trees barber poles telephone and telegraph poles convenient corners of buildings fence posts ladders and lightning rods for the sake of winding their weakness around her strength when she sits down from sheer exhaustion they come and prop themselves against her back if she goes to bed they climb up on the footboard hang a drooping head and look her wistfully in the eye for sympathy prop on prop ever seems to be the underlying law of the universe poor reba she is talking of letty and thinking of herself and the ministers eye twinkled well a little admitted his wife but im only a village prop not a family one where you are concerned and she administered an affectionate pat to his cheek as she rose from her chair im a trellis that leans against a rock illustration iii letitia boyntons life had been rather a drab one as seen through other peoples eyes but it had never seemed so to her till within the last few years her own father had been the village doctor but of him she had no memory her mothers second marriage to a venerable country lawyer john gilman had brought a kindly inefficient stepfather into the family a man who speedily became an invalid needing constant nursing the birth of david when letty was three years old brought a new interest into the household and the two children grew to be fast friends but when mrs gilman died and letty found herself at eighteen the mistress of the house the nurse of her aged stepfather and the only guardian of a boy of fifteen life became difficult more difficult still it became when the old lawyer died for he at least had been a sort of fictitious head of the family and his mere existence kept david within bounds david was a lively harumscarum handsome youth good at his lessons popular with his companions always in a scrape into which he was generally drawn by the ministers son so the neighbors thought at any rate dick larrabee as davids senior received the lions share of the blame when mischief was abroad if parson larrabees boy couldnt behave any better than an unbelieving blacksmiths a methodist farmers or a baptist storekeepers what was the use of claiming superior efficacy for the congregational form of belief dicks fathers never succeeded in bringing him into the church though hes worked on him from the time he was kneehigh to a toad said mrs popham praps his mother kind o vaccinated him with religion stid o leavin him to take it the natural way as the ol sayin is was her husbands response the first mis larrabee was as good as gold but she may have overdone the trick a little mite mebbe and whats more i kind o suspicion the parson thinks so himself he aint never been quite the same sence dick left home cept in preaching an i tell you maria his highwater mark there is higher n ever abel dunn o boston walked home from meetin with me thanksgivin an says he takin off his hat an moppin his forehead osh says he does your minister preach like that every sunday no says i he dont if he did we couldnt stan it he preaches like that about once a month an we dont care what he says the rest o the time well so far as boys are concerned preachin aint so reliable for behavin purposes as a good young alder switch was the opinion of mrs popham her children being of the comatose kind whose minds had never been illuminated by the dazzling idea of disobedience land sakes maria there aint alders enough on the riverbank to switch religion into a boy like dick larrabee its got to come like a thief in the night as the ol sayin is but i guess i dont mean thief i guess i mean star its got to come kind o like a star in a dark night if the whole village generate an onregenerate hadnt a kep on naggin an hectorin an criticizin them two boys dick an dave carryin tales an multiplyin of em by two ong root as the ol sayin is i dare say theyd a both been here yet stid o roamin roun the earth seekin whom they may devour there was considerable truth in ossian pophams remark as letty could have testified for the conduct of the boyntongilman household as well as that of the minister had been continually under inspection and discussion nothing could remain long hidden in beulah nobody spied nobody pried nobody listened at doors or windows nobody owned a microscope nobody took any particular notice of events or if they did they preserved an attitude of profound indifference while doing it yet everything was known sooner or later the amount of the fish and meat bill the precise extent of credit the number of letters in the post the amount of fuel burned the number of absences from church and prayermeeting the calls or visits made and received the hours of arrival or departure the source of all incomes these details were the common property of the village it even took cognizance of more subtle things for it observed and recorded the fluctuations of all love affairs and the fluctuations also in the religious experiences of various persons not always in spiritual equilibrium for the soul was an object of scrutiny in beulah as well as mind body and estate letty boynton used to feel that nothing was exclusively her own that she belonged to beulah part and parcel but dick larrabee was far more restive under the village espionage than were she and david it was natural that david should want to leave beulah and make his way in the world and his sister did not oppose it dicks circumstances were different he had inherited a small house and farm from his mother had enjoyed a college education and had been offered a share in a good business in a city twelve miles away he left beulah because he hated it he left because he could not endure his fathers gentle remonstrances or the bewilderment in his stepmothers eyes she was a newcomer in the household and her glance seemed to say why on earth do you behave so badly to your father when youre such a delightful chap he left because deacon todd had prayed for him publicly at a christian endeavor meeting because mrs popham had circulated a wholly baseless scandal about him and finally because in his young misery the only being who could have comforted him by joining her hapless fortunes to his had refused to do so he didnt know why he had always counted on letty when the time should come to speak the word he had shown his heart in everything but words what more did a girl want of course if any one preferred a purely fantastic duty to a mans love and allowed a scapegrace brother to foist two redfaced squalling babies on her there was nothing to be said so in this frame of mind he had had one flaming passionate wrongheaded scene with his father and strode out of beulah with dramatic gestures of shaking its dust off his feet his father roused for once from his lifelong patience had been rather terrible in that last scene so terrible that he had never forgiven himself or really believed himself fully forgiven by god though his son had alienated half the village and nearly rent the parish in twain by his conduct as for letty she held her peace she could only hope that the minister and his wife suspected nothing and she was sure of beulahs point of view that a girl would never give up a suitor if she had any hope of tying him to her for life was a popular form of belief in the community and strangely enough it was chiefly the women not the men who made it current now and then a softhearted and chivalrous male would observe indulgently of some village beauty i shouldnt wonder a mite if she could a had bill for the askin but this opinion would be met by such a chorus of feminine incredulity that its author generally withdrew it as unsound and untenable it was then when dick had gone away that the days had grown drab and long but the twins kept lettys inexperienced hands busy though in the first year she had the help of old miss clarissa perry a childless expert in the bringingup of babies the friendship of reba larrabee so bright and cheery and comprehending was a neverending solace there was nothing of the martyr about letty she was not wholly resigned to her lot and to tell the truth she did not intend to be for a good many years yet im not a minister but im the wife of a minister which is the next best thing mrs larrabee used to say i tell you letty theres no use in human creatures being resigned till their bodies are fairly worn out with fighting when you cant think of another mortal thing to do be resigned but im convinced that the lord is ashamed of us when we fold our hands too soon you were born courageous reba and letty would look admiringly at the rosy cheeks and bright eyes of her friend my blood circulates freely that helps me a lot everybodys blood circulates in racine wisconsin and the ministers wife laughed genially yours hereabouts freezes up in your six months of cold weather and when it begins to thaw out the snow is ready to fall again that sort of thing induces depression although no mere climate would account for mrs popham ossian said to luther the other day maria aint hardly to blame parson she come from a gloomy stock the ladds was all gloomy root and branch they say that the ladd babies was always discouraged two days after they was born the cause of lettys chief heartache the one that she could reveal to nobody was that her brother should leave her nowadays so completely to her own resources she recalled the time when he came home from boston pale haggard ashamed and told her of his marriage months before she could read in his lacklustre eyes and hear in his voice the absence of love the fear of the future that was bad enough but presently he said letty theres more to tell ive no money and no place to put my wife but theres a child coming can i bring her here till afterwards you wont like her but shes so ailing and despondent just now that i think shell behave herself and ill take her away as soon as shes able to travel she would never stay here in the country anyway you couldnt hire her to do it she came blackhaired sullenfaced eva with a vulgar beauty of her own much damaged by bad temper discontent and illness oh those terrible weeks for letty hiding her own misery putting on a brave face with the neighbors keeping the unwelcome sisterinlaw in the background it was bitterly cold and eva raged against the climate the house the lack of a servant the absence of gayety and above all at the prospect of motherhood her resentment against david for some reason unknown to letty was deep and profound and she made no secret of it until the outraged letty goaded into speech one day said listen eva david brought you here because his sisters house was the proper place for you just now i dont know why you married each other but you did and its evidently a failure im going to stand by david and see you through this trouble but while youre under my roof youll have to speak respectfully of my brother not so much because hes my brother but because hes your husband and the father of the child thats coming do you understand letty had a good deal of red in her bronze hair and her brown eyes were as capable of flashing fire as evas black ones so the girl not only refrained from venting her spleen upon the absent david but ceased to talk altogether and the gloom in the house was as black as if mrs popham and all her despondent ancestors were living under its roof the good doctor called often and did his best shrugging his shoulders and lifting his eyebrows as he said let her work out her own salvation i doubt if she can but well give her the chance if the problem can be solved the child will do it illustration iv well the problem never was solved never in this world at least and those who were in the sittingroom chamber when eva was shown her two babies lying side by side on a pillow never forgot the quick glance of horrified incredulity or the shriek of aversion with which she greeted them letty had a sense of humor and it must be confessed that when the scorned and discarded babies were returned to her and she sat by the kitchen stove trying to plan a second bottle a second cradle and see how far the expected baby could divide its modest outfit with the unexpected one she burst into a fit of hysterical laughter mingled with an outpour of tears the doctor came in from the sickroom puzzled and crestfallen from his interview with an entirely new specimen of womankind he had brought letty and david into the world and soothed the last days of all her family and now in this tragedy for tragedy it was he was her only confidant and adviser letty looked at him the tears streaming from her eyes oh doctor lee doctor lee if an overruling providence could smile wouldnt he smile now david and eva never wanted to marry each other im sure of it and the last thing they desired was a child now there are two of them their father is away their mother wont look at them what will become of me until eva gets well and behaves like a human being i never promised to be an aunt to twins i never did like twins i think theyre downright vulgar waly waly bairns are bonny ones enough and twas ower mony quoted the doctor its worse even than you think my poor letty for the girl cant get well because she wont she has gritted her teeth turned her face to the wall and refused her food its the beginning of the end you are far likelier to be a foster mother than an aunt lettys face changed and softened and her color rose she leaned over the two pink crumpled creatures still twitching nervously with the amazement and discomfort of being alive illustration come to your aunt letty then and be mothered she sobbed come to your aunt letty then and be mothered she sobbed lifting the pillow and taking it with its double burden into her arms you shant suffer poor innocent darlings even if those who brought you into the world turn away from you come to your aunt letty and be mothered thats right thats right said the doctor over a lump in his throat we mustnt let the babies pay the penalty of their parents sins and theres one thing that may soften your anger a little letty evas not right shes not quite responsible there are cases where motherhood that should be a joy brings nothing but mental torture and perversion of instinct try and remember that if it helps you any ill drop in every two or three hours and ill write david to come at once he must take his share of the burden well david came but eva was in her coffin he was grave and silent and it could not be said that he showed a trace of fatherly pride he was very young it is true thoroughly ashamed of himself very unhappy and anxious about his new cares but letty could not help thinking that he regarded the twins as a sort of personal insult perhaps not on their own part nor on evas but as an accident that might have been prevented by a competent providence at any rate he carried himself as a man with a grievance and when he looked at his offspring which was seldom it seemed to letty that he regarded the second one as an unnecessary intruder and cherished a secret resentment at its audacity in coming to this planet uninvited he went back to his work in boston without its having crossed his mind that anybody but his sister could take care of his children he didnt really regard them as children or human beings it takes a womans vision to make that sort of leap into the future until a newborn baby can show some personal beauty evince some intellect stop squirming and squealing and exhibit enough selfcontrol to let people sleep at night it is not as a rule persona grata to any one but its mother david did say vaguely to letty when he was leaving that he hoped they would be good the screams that rent the air at the precise moment of farewell rather giving the lie to his hopes letty was struggling to end the interview without breaking down for she was worn out nervously as well as physically and thought if she could only be alone with her problems and her cares she would rather write to david than tell him her mind face to face brother and sister held each other tightly for a moment kissed each other goodbye and then letty watched osh pophams sleigh slipping off with david into the snowy distance the merry tinkle of the bells adding to the sadness in her dreary heart dick gone yesterday dave today beulah without dick and dave the two joys of her life were missing and in their places two unknown babies whose digestive systems were going to need constant watching according to dr lee then she went about with set lips doing the last sordid things that death brings in its wake doing them as she had seen her mother do before her she threw away the husks in evas under mattress and put fresh ones in she emptied the feathers from the feather bed and pillows and aired them in the sun while she washed the ticking she scrubbed the paint in the sickroom and in between her tasks learned from clarissa perry the whole process of bringing up babies by hand that was three years ago at first david had sent ten dollars a month from his slender earnings never omitting it save for urgent reasons he evidently thought of the twins as company for his sister and their care a pleasant occupation since she had almost a living income taking in a few coats to make just to add an occasional luxury to the bare necessities of life provided by her mothers will his letters were brief dispirited and infrequent but they had not ceased altogether till within the last few months during which lettys to him had been returned from boston with not found scribbled on the envelopes the firm in whose care letty had latterly addressed him simply wrote in answer to her inquiries that mr gilman had not been in their employ for some time and they had no idea of his whereabouts the rest was silence illustration v a good deal of water had run under beulah bridge since letty boynton had sat at her window on a december evening unconsciously furnishing copy and illustration for a christmas card yet there had been very few outward changes in the village winter had melted into spring burst into summer faded into autumn lapsed into winter again the same old everrecurring pageant in the world of nature and the same procession of incidents in the neighborhood life the harvest moon and the hunters moon had come and gone the first frost the family dinners and reunions at thanksgiving the first snowfall and now as christmas approached the same holiday spirit was abroad in the air slightly modified as it passed by mrs pophams mournful visage one or two babies had swelled the census giving the minister hope of a larger sundayschool one or two of the very aged neighbors had passed into the beyond and a few romantic and enterprising young farmers had espoused wives among them osh pophams son the manner of their choice was not entirely to the liking of the village digby popham had married into the rival church and as his betrothed was a masterful young lady it was feared that digby would leave mr larrabees flock to worship with his wife another had married without visible means of support a proceeding always to be regretted by thoroughly prudent persons over fifty and the third deacon todds eldest son had somehow or other met a siren from vermont and insisted on wedding her when there were plenty of marriageable girls in beulah ive no patience with such actions grumbled mrs popham young folks are so full of notions nowadays that they look for change and excitement everywheres i spose james todd thinks its a decent respectable way of actin to turn his back on the girls hes been brought up an gone to school with and court somebody he never laid eyes on till a year ago its a free country but i must say i dont think its very refined for a man to go clear off somewheres and marry a perfect stranger births marriages and deaths however paled into insignificance compared with the spectacular dйbut of the ministers wife as a writer and embellisher of christmas cards two at least having been seen at the local milliners store how many she had composed and how many of them said mrs popham might have been rejected nobody knew though there was much speculation and more than one citizen remarked on the size of the daily package of mail matter handed out by the rural delivery man at the parsonage gate no one but mrs larrabee and letty boynton were in possession of all the thrilling details attending the public appearance of these works of art the words and letters of appreciation the commendation and the occasional blows to pride that attended their acceptance and publication mrs larrabees first attempt with the sketch of letty at the window on christmas eve her hearthfire aglow her heart and her door open that love might enter in if the christ child came down the snowy street this went to the excelsior card company in a large western city and the following correspondence ensued mrs luther larrabee beulah nh dear madam your letter bears a wellknown postmark for my father and my grandfather were born and lived in new hampshire up beulah way i accept your verses because of the beauty of the picture that accompanied them and because christmas means more than holly and plum pudding and giftladen trees to me for i am a religious man a ministerial father and three family deacons saw to that though it doesnt always work that way frankly i do not expect your card to have a wide appeal so i offer you only five dollars a christmas card my dear madam must have a greeting and yours has none if the pictured room were a real room and some one who had seen or lived in it should recognize it it would attract his eye but we cannot manufacture cards to meet such romantic improbabilities i am emboldened to ask you because you live in beulah if you will not paint the outside of some lonely little new hampshire cottage as humble as you like and make me some more verses something say about the folks back home sincerely yours reuben small beulah nh dear mr small i accept your offer of five dollars for my maiden effort in christmas cards with thanks and will try my hand at something more popular i am not above liking to make a wide appeal but the subject you propose is rather a staggering one because you accompany it with a phrase lacking rhythm and difficult to rhyme you will at once see by running through the alphabet that roam is the only serviceable rhyme for home but the union of the two suggests jingle or doggerel i defy any minor poet when furnished with such a phrase to refrain from bursting at once into no matter where you travel no matter where you roam youll never dumdidumdidee the folks back home sincerely yours reba larrabee ps on second thought i believe james whitcomb riley could do it and overcome the difficulties but alas i have not his touch dear mrs larrabee we never refuse verses because they are too good for the public nothing is too good for the public but the public must be the judge of what pleases it the folks back home is a phrase that will strike the eye and ear of thousands of wandering sons and daughters they will choose that card from the heapedup masses on the counters and send it to every state in the union if you will glance at your first card you will see that though people may read it they will always leave it on the counter i want my cards on counters by the thousand but i dont intend that they should be left there make an effort dear mrs larrabee i could get the folks back home done here in the office in half an hour but im giving you the chance because you live in beulah new hampshire and because you make beautiful pictures sincerely yours reuben small dear mr small i enclose a colored sketch of the outside of the cottage whose livingroom i used in my first card i chose it because i love the person who lives in it because it always looks beautiful in the snow and because the tree is so picturesque the fact that it is gray for lack of paint may remind a casual wanderer that there is something to do now and then for the folks back home the verse is just as bad as i thought it would be it seems incredible that any one should buy it but ours is a big country and there are many kinds of people living in it so who knows why dont you accept my picture and then you write the card i could not put my initials on this they are unknown to be sure and i should want them to be if you use it sincerely yours reba larrabee now heres a christmas greeting to the folks back home it comes to you across the space dear folks back home ive searched the wide world over but no matter where i roam no friends are like the old friends no folks like those back home dear mrs larrabee i gave you five dollars for the first picture and verses which you as a writer regard more highly than i who am merely a manufacturer please accept twenty dollars for the folks back home on which i hope to make up my loss on the first card i insist on signing the despised verse with your initials in case r l should later come to mean something you will be glad that a few thousand people have seen it sincerely reuben small the hessian soldier andirons the portrait over the boynton mantel and even letty boyntons cape were identified on the first card sooner or later but it was obvious that mrs larrabee had to have a picture for her verses and couldnt be supposed to make one up out of her head though osh popham declared it had been done again and again in other parts of the world also it was agreed that as lettys face was not distinguishable nobody outside of beulah could recognize her by her cape and that anyhow it couldnt make much difference for if anybody wanted to spend fifteen cents on a card he would certainly buy the one about the folks back home the popularity of this was established by the fact that it was selling not only in beulah and greentown but in boston and in racine wisconsin and it was rumored even in chicago the village milliner in beulah had disposed of twentyseven copies in thirteen days and the ministers wife was universally conceded to be the most celebrated person in the state of new hampshire letty boynton had an uncomfortable moment when she saw the first card but common sense assured her that outside of a handful of neighbors no one would identify her home surroundings meantime she was proud of rebas financial and artistic triumph in the folks back home and generously glad that she had no share in it twice during the autumn david had broken his silence but only to send her a postal from some western town telling her that he should have no regular address for a time that he was traveling for a publishing firm and felt illadapted to the business he hoped that she and the children were well for he himself was not etc etc the twins had been photographed by osh popham who was jack of all trades and master of many and a sight of their dimpled charms curly heads and straight little bodies would have gladdened any fathers heart letty thought however she scorned to win david back by any such specious means if he didnt care to know whether his children were humpbacked bowlegged crosseyed clubfooted or feebleminded why should she enlighten him this was her usual frame of mind but in these last days of the year how she longed to pop the bewitching photographs and rebas christmas cards into an envelope and send them to david but where no word at all for weeks and weeks and then only a postal from st joseph saying that he had given up his position on account of poor health nothing in all this to keep christmas on thought letty and she knitted and crocheted and sewed with extra ardor that the twins stockings might be filled with bright things of her own making illustration vi on the afternoon before christmas of that year the north station in boston was filled with hurrying throngs on the way home for the holidays everybody looked tired and excited but most of them had happy faces and men and women alike had as many bundles as they could carry bundles and boxes quite unlike the brown paper ones with which commuters are laden on ordinary days these were white packages beribboned and beflowered and behollied and bemistletoed to be gently carried and protected from crushing the train was filled to overflowing and many stood in the aisles until latham junction was reached and the overflow alighted to change cars for greentown and way stations among the crowd were two men with suitcases who hurried into the way train and entering the smoking car from opposite ends met in the middle of the aisle dropped their encumbrances stretched out a hand and ejaculated in the same breath dick larrabee upon my word dave gilman by all thats great here lets turn over a seat for our baggage and sit together going home i spose the men had not met for some years but each knew something of the others circumstances and hoped that the other didnt know too much they scanned each others faces dick thinking that david looked pinched and pale david halfheartedly registering the quick impression that dick was prosperous yes david answered im going home for a couple of days its such a confounded journey to that onehorse village that a business man cant get there but once in a generation awful hole confirmed dick simply awful hole i didnt get it out of my system for years married asked david no rather think im not the marrying kind though the fact is ive had no time for love affairs too busy lets see you have a child havent you yes letty has seen to all that business for me since my wife died wild horses couldnt have dragged the information from him that the child was twins and dick didnt need it anyway for he had heard the news the morning he left beulah wonder if there have been many changes in the village dont know there never used to be mrs popham has been ailing for years she couldnt die and deacon todd wouldnt dicks old animosities still lingered faintly in his memory though his laughing voice and the twinkle in his eyes showed plainly that no bitterness was left hows business with you david only soso ive had the devils own luck lately cant get anything that suits me or that pays a decent income i formed a new connection the other day but i cant say yet what there is in it im just out of hospital operation they cut out the wrong thing first i believe sewed me up absentmindedly then remembered it was the other thing and did it over again at any rate thats the only way i can account for their mewing me up there for two months well well that is hard luck im sorry old boy things didnt begin to go my way either till within the last few months ive always made a fair living and saved a little money but never gained any real headway now ive got a firstrate start and the future looks pretty favorable and best of all pretty safe no trouble at home calls you back to beulah i hope letty is all right dick cast an anxious side glance at david though he spoke carelessly oh no everythings serene so far as i know im a poor correspondent especially when ive no good news to tell and anyway the mere sight of a pen ties my tongue im just running down to surprise letty dick looked at david again he began to think he didnt like him he used to when they were boys but when he brought that unaccountable wife home and foisted her and her babies on letty he rather turned against him david was younger than himself four or five years younger but he looked as if he hadnt grown up surely his boyhood chum hadnt used to be so pale and thinchested or his mouth so ladylike and pretty a good face though straight and clean with honest eyes and a likable smile lack of will perhaps or a persistent run of ill luck letty had always kept him stiffened up in the old days dick recalled one of his fathers phrases to the effect that dave gilman would spin on a very small biscuit and wondered if it were still true and you dick your fathers still living you see i havent kept up with beulah lately keeping up with beulah it sounds like the title of a novel but the hero would have to be a snail or hed pass beulah in the first chapter yes fathers hale and hearty i believe you come home every christmas i spose inquired david no as a matter of fact this is my first visit since i left for good thats about my case and david hung his head a little unconsciously that so well i was a hotheaded fool when i said goodbye to beulah and its taken me all this time to cool off and make up my mind to apologize to the dad theres theres rather a queer coincidence about my visit just at this time speaking of coincidences said david i can beat yours whatever it is if the thought of your father brought you back my mother drew me this way and he took something from his inside coat pocket do you see that dick regarded the object blankly then with a quick gesture dived into his pocket and brought forth another of the same general character how about this he asked each had one of reba larrabees christmas cards but david had the first unsuccessful one and dick the popular one with the lonely little gray house and the verse about the folks back home the men looked at each other in astonishment and dick gave a low whistle then they bent over the cards together it was mothers picture that pulled me back to beulah i dont mind telling you said david his mouth twitching dont you see it oh is that your mother and dick scanned the card closely dont you remember her portrait that always hung there after she died yes of course and dicks tone was apologetic you see the face is so small i didnt notice it but i recognize it now and remember the portrait then the old sittingroom exclaimed david look at the rag carpet and the blessed old andirons gracious ive crawled round those hessian soldiers burned my fingers and cracked my skull on em often enough when i was a kid when id studied the card five minutes i bought a ticket and started for home davids eyes were suffused and his lip trembled i dont wonder said dick i recognize the dear old room right enough and of course i should know letty it didnt occur to me that it was letty for some time said her brother theres just the glimpse of a face shown and no real likeness perhaps not agreed dick a stranger wouldnt have known it for letty but if it had been only that cape i should have guessed its as familiar as mrs pophams bugle bonnet and much prettier she wore it every winter skating you know and its just the color of her hair letty has a goodshaped head said david judicially it shows even in the card and a remarkable ear added dick so small and so close to her head i never notice peoples ears confessed david dont you i do and eyelashes too mothers got lettys eyelashes down fine shes changed dave letty has that hurts me she was always so gay and chirpy in this picture she has a sad faraway listening look but mother may have put that in just to make it interesting or perhaps ive had something to do with the change of expression thought david what attracted me first he added was your mothers verses she always had a knack of being pious without cramming piety down your throat i liked that open door it meant welcome no matter how little youd deserved it whered you get your card dave asked dick its prettier than mine a nurse brought it to me in the hospital just because she took a fancy to it she didnt know it would mean anything to me but it did a relapse and david laughed shamedfacedly i guess shell confine herself to beef tea after this whered you get yours picked it up on a dentists mantelpiece when i was waiting for an appointment i was traveling round the room hands in my pockets when suddenly i saw this card standing up against an hourglass the color caught me i took it to the window and at first i was puzzled it certainly was lettys house the doors open you see and theres somebody in the window i knew it was letty but how could any card publisher have found the way to beulah then i discovered mothers initials snarled up in holly and remembered that she was always painting and illuminating queer job life is said david putting his card back in his pocket and wishing there were a little more time or that he had a little more courage so that he might confide in dick larrabee he felt a desire to tell him some of the wretchedness he had lived through it would be a comfort just to hint that his unhappiness had made him a coward so that the very responsibilities that serve as a spur to some men had left him until now cold unstirred unvitalized youre right dick answered life is a queer job and it doesnt do to shirk it and just as queer as anything in life is the way that mothers christmas cards brought us back to beulah they acted as a sort of magic didnt they jiminy i believe the next station is beulah i hope the depot team will be hitched up yes here we are seven oclock and the train only thirtyfive minutes late it always made a point of that on holidays never mind and dicks tone was as gay as davids was sober the beanpot will have gone back to the cellarway and the doughnuts to the crock but the folks back home ll get em out for us and a mince pie too and a cut of sage cheese there wont be any folks back home were so late im thinking theres always a christmas eve festival at the church you know they never change in beulah then by george they can have me for santa claus said dick as they stepped out on the platform why it doesnt seem cold at all yet look at the ice on the river what skating and what a moon my bloods up and if i find the parsonage closed ill follow on to the church and make my peace with the members theres a kind of spell on me for the first time in years i feel as though i could shake hands with deacon todd well merry christmas to you dick im going to walk good gracious have you come to spend the winter for various bags and parcels were being flung out on the platform with that indifference and irresponsibility that bespeak the touch of the seasoned baggagehandler you didnt suppose i was coming back to beulah emptyhanded on christmas eve did you if im in time for the tree im going to give those bluenosed frostbitten little youngsters something to remember jump in dave and ride as far as the turn of the road in a few minutes the tottering old signboard that marked the way to beulah center hove in sight and david jumped from the sleigh to take his homeward path merry christmas again dick he waved same to you dave ill come myself to say it to letty the first minute i see smoke coming from your chimney tomorrow morning tell her you met me will you and that my visit is partly for her only that father had to have his turn first shell know why tell her mothers card had christmas magic in it tell say tell her the rest yourself will you dick and dave broke into a run down the hill road that led to letty i will indeed breathed dick into his muffler illustration vii repeating history letty was again at her open window she had been halfashamed to reproduce the card as it were but something impelled her she was safe from scrutiny too for everybody had gone to the tree the pophams mr davis clarissa perry everybody for a quarter of a mile up and down the street and by now the company would be gathered and the tree lighted she could keep watch alone the only sound being that of the childrens soft breathing in the next room letty had longed to go to the festival herself but old clarissa perry who cared for the twins now and then in lettys few absences had a niece who was going to speak a piece and she yearned to be present and share in the glory so letty was kept at home as she had been numberless other times during the three years of her vicarious motherhood the night was mild again as in the year before the snow lay like white powder on the hard earth the moon was full and the street was a length of dazzling silence the lighted candle was in the parlor window shining toward the meetinghouse the fire burned brightly on the hearth the front door was ajar letty wrapped her old cape round her shoulders drew her hood over her head and seating herself at the window repeated under her breath my door is on the latch tonight the hearthfire is aglow i seem to hear swift passing feet the christ child in the snow my heart is open wide tonight for stranger kith or kin i would not bar a single door where love might enter in and then a footstep drawing ever nearer sounded crunch crunch in the snow letty pushed her chair back into the shadow the footstep halted at the gate came falteringly up the path turned aside and came nearer the window then a voice said dont be frightened letty its david can i come in i havent any right to except that its christmas eve that indeed was the magic the allcomprehending phrase that swept the past out of mind with one swift stroke the acknowledgment of unworthiness the childlike claim on the forgiving love that should be in every heart on such a night as this resentment melted away like mist before the sun her deep grievance where had it gone how could she speak anything but welcome for what was the window open the fire lighted the door ajar the guiding candleflame but that love and david might enter in there were few words at first nothing but closelocked hands and wet cheeks pressed together then letty sent david into the childrens room by himself if the twins were bewitching when awake they were nothing short of angelic when asleep illustration i never thought of them as my children before david came out a little later his eyes reddened with tears his hair rumpled his face flushed he seemed like a man awed by an entirely new experience he could not speak he could only stammer brokenly as god is my witness letty theres been something wrong with me up to this moment i never thought of them as my children before and i cant believe that such as they can belong to me they were never wanted and ive never had any interest in them i owe them to you letty youve made them what they are you and no one else if there hadnt been something there to build on my love and care wouldnt have counted for much theyre just like dear mothers people for good looks and brains and pretty manners theyre pure shirley all the way through the twinnies are its lucky for me that they are said david humbly you see letty i married eva to keep my promise if i was old enough to make it i was old enough to keep it so i thought she never loved me and when she found out that i didnt love her any longer she turned against me our life together was awful from beginning to end but shes in her grave and nobodyll ever hear my side now that she cant tell hers when i looked at those two babies the day i left you i thought of them only as retribution and the vision of them ugly wrinkled writhing little creatures has been in my mind ever since they were compensation not retribution david i ought to have told you how clever and beautiful they were but you never asked and my pride was up in arms a man should stand by his own flesh and blood even if it isnt attractive thats what i believe i know i know but ive had no feeling for three years ive been like a frozen man just drifting trying to make both ends meet my heart dead and my body full of pain im just out of a hospital two months in all david why didnt you let me know or send for me oh it was way out in missouri i was taken ill very suddenly at the hotel in st joseph and they moved me at once there were two operations first and last and i didnt know enough to feed myself most of the time poor poor buddy did you have good care the best i had more than care ruth bentley the nurse that brought me back to life made me see what a useless creature i was some womans instinct stirred in letty at a new note in her brothers voice and a new look in his face she braced herself for his next words sure that they would open a fresh chapter the door and the window were closed now the shades pulled down the fire low the hour was ripe for confidences you see letty and david cleared his throat nervously and looked at the coals gleaming behind the hessian soldiers its a time for a thorough housecleaning body mind and soul a long illness is and miss bentley knew well enough that all was wrong with me i mentioned my unhappy marriage and told her all about you but i said nothing about the children why should you asked letty although her mind had leaped to the reason already well i was a poor patient in one of the cheapest rooms broken in health without any present means of support i wanted to stand well with her she had been so good to me and i thought if she knew about the twins she wouldnt believe i could ever make a living for three still less for four put in letty with an irrepressible note of teasing in her tone she had broken the ice like a torrent set free david dashed into the story of the last two months and ruth bentleys wonderful influence how she had recreated him within as well as without how she was the best and noblest of women willing to take a pauper by the hand and brace him up for a new battle with life strength appeals to me confessed david perhaps its because i am weak for im afraid i am a little be careful davy eva was strong david shuddered he remembered a strength that lashed and buffeted and struck and overpowered ruth is different he said out of the strong came forth sweetness used to be one of parson larrabees texts thats ruths kind of strength can i will you let me bring her here to see you letty say for new years its all so different from the last time i asked you then i knew i was bringing you nothing but sorrow and pain but ruth carries her welcome in her face the prop inside of letty wavered unsteadily for a moment and then stood in its accustomed upright position why not she asked its the right thing to do but you must tell her about the children first oh i did that long ago after i found out that she cared it was only at first that i didnt dare i havent told you but she went out for her daily walk and brought me home a christmas card the prettiest one she could find she said i was propped up on pillows as weak as a kitten i looked at it and looked at it and when i saw that it was this room the old fireplace and mothers picture and the hessian soldier andirons when i realized there was a face at the window and that the door was ajar everything just swam before me and i fainted dead away i had a relapse and when i was better again i told her everything shes fond of children it didnt make any difference except for her to say that the more she had to do for me the more she wanted to do it well said letty with a break in her voice thats love so far as i can see and if youve been lucky enough to win it take it and be thankful and above all nurse and keep it so one of rebas cards the one the publisher thought would never sell found you and brought you back how wonderful we little thought of that reba and i rebas work didnt stop there letty there was so much that had to be said between you and me just now that i couldnt let another subject creep in till it was finished and we were friends but dick larrabee saw rebas card about the folks back home in chicago and he bought a ticket for beulah just as i did we met in the train and compared notes dick larrabee home the blood started in lettys heart and sped hither and thither warming her from head to foot yes looking as fit as a fiddle the way a man looks when things are coming his way but what did the card mean to him did he seem to like rebas verses yes but i guess the card just spelled home to him and he recognized this house in a minute of course i showed him my card and he said thats letty fast enough i know the cape he recognized you in a minute he said he knew the cape yes the old cape had been close to his shoulder many a time he liked it and said it matched her hair he was awfully funny about your ear too i told him i never noticed womens ears and he said he did when they were pretty and their eyelashes too anything remarkable about your eyelashes letty nothing that im aware of said letty laughingly although she was fibbing and she knew it and he said hed call and say merry christmas to you the first thing tomorrow that he would have been here tonight but youd know his father had to come first you dont mind being second to the parson do you no letty didnt mind her heart was unaccountably light and glad like a girls heart it was the eve of mary when all women are blest because of one the wise men brought gifts to the child letty had often brought hers timidly devoutly trustfully and perhaps tonight they were coming back to her illustration viii put the things down on the front steps said dick to the driver as he neared the parsonage if theres nobody at home ill go on up to the church after ive got this stuff inside got a key no dont need one ive picked all the locks with a penknife many a time besides the key is sure to be under the doormat yes here it is of all the unaccountable customs i ever knew thats the most laughable works all right for you yes and for all the other tramps and dick opened the door and lifted in his belongings goodnight he called to the driver ill walk up to the church after ive found out whether mother keeps the mince pie and cider apple sauce in the same old place a few minutes later his hunger partially stayed dick larrabee locked the parsonage door and took the welltrodden path across the church common it was his fathers feet he knew that had worn the shoveled path so smooth his kind faithful feet that had sped to and fro on errands of mercy never faltering in all the years it was nearly eight oclock the sound of the melodeon with childrens voices floated out from the whitepainted meetinghouse all ablaze with light or as much ablaze as a kerosene chandelier and six side lamps could make it the horse sheds were crowded with teams of various sorts the horses well blanketed and standing comfortably in straw and the last straggler was entering the righthand door of the church as dick neared the steps simultaneously the lefthand door opened and on the background of the light inside appeared the figure of mrs todd the wife of his ancient enemy the senior deacon dick could see that a sort of dressingroom had been curtained off in the little entry as it had often been in former times of tableaux and concerts and what not valor not discretion was the better policy and walking boldly up to the steps dick took off his fur cap and said goodevening mrs todd good gracious me where under the canopy did you hail from dick larrabee was your folks lookin for you they aint breathed a word to none of us no im a surprise mrs todd well i know youve given me one will you wait a spell till the recitations is over youd scare the children so if you go in now that theyd forget their pieces moren they genally do i can endure the loss of the pieces said dick with a twinkle in his eye at which mrs todd laughed comprehendingly and said isaacll get a stool or a box or something there aint a vacant seat in the church i wish we could say the same o sundays isaac isaac come out and see whos here she called under her breath he wont be long hes tendin john trimble in the dressinroom he was the only one in the village that was willin to be santa claus an he want overwillin now hes et something for supper that disagrees with him awfully and hes all doubled up with colic we cant have the tree till the exercises is over but that wont be morn fifteen minutes so i sent isaac home to make a mustard plaster hes puttin it on john now johns dreadful solemn and unamusin when hes well and i cant think how hell act when hes all crumpled up with stomachache an the mustard plaster drawin like fire dick threw back his head and laughed he had forgotten just how unexpected beulahs point of view always was deacon todd now came out cautiously ive got it on him mother tho hes terrible unresigned to it an ive given him a stiff dose o jamaica ginger we can tell pretty soon whether he can take his part heres dick larrabee come back isaac just when we thought he had given up beulah for good an all said mrs todd the deacon stood on the top step his gaunt grizzled face peering above the collar of his great coat not a man to eat his words very often deacon isaac todd well young man he said youve found your way home have you its about time if you want to see your father alive if it hadnt been for you and others like you men who had forgotten what it was to be young i should never have gone away said dick hotly what had i done worse than a dozen others only that i happened to be the ministers son thats just it you were bringin trouble on the parish makin talk that reflected on your father folks said if he couldnt control his own son he want fit to manage a church you played cards you danced you drove a fast horse i never did a thing im ashamed of but one and dicks voice was firm my misdeeds were nothing but boyish nonsense but the village never gave me credit for a single virtue i ought to have remembered fathers position but whatever i was or whatever i did you had no right to pray for me openly for full five minutes at a public meeting that galled me worse than anything now isaac interrupted mrs todd i hope youll believe me ive told you once a week on an average these last three years that you might have chastened dick some other way besides prayin for him in meetin the deacon smiled grimly you both talk as if prayin was one of the seven deadly sins he said im not objecting to your prayers agreed dick but there were plenty of closets in your house where you might have gone and told the lord your opinion of me only that wasnt good enough for you you must needs tell the whole village there father thats what i always said agreed mrs todd well i aint one that cant yield when the majoritys against me said the deacon particularly when im treatin john trimble for the colic if youll stop actin so you threaten to split the church dick larrabee ill stop prayin for you the lord knows how i feel about it now so i neednt keep on remindin him illustration ix thats a bargain and heres my hand on it cried dick now what do you say to letting me be santa claus come on in and lets look at john trimble hed make a splendid job or jeremiah but i wouldnt let him spoil a christmas festival do let dick take the part father and mrs todds tone was most ingratiating johns terrible dull and bashful anyway an mebbe hed have a pain he couldnt stan jest when hes givin out the presents an dick is always so amusin deacon todd led the way into the improvised dressingroom he had removed johns gala costume in order to apply the mustard faithfully and he lay in a crumpled heap in the corner the plaster itself adorned a stool near by now john john that plaster wont do you no good on the stool it aint the stool that needs drawin its your stomach argued mrs todd im drawed pretty nigh to death aready moaned john im rore thats what i am rore an i wont be santa claus neither i want to go home wrop him up and get him into your sleigh father and take him home then come right back beds the place for him keep that hot flatiron on his stomach if hed rather have it than the mustard menfolks are such cowards ill dress dick while youre gone mebbe its a providence on the whole dick agreed with mrs todd as he stood ready to make his entrance the school committee was in the church and he had had much to do with its members in former days the selectmen of the village were present and he had made their acquaintance once in an executive session the deacons were all there and the pillars of the church and the choir and the organist a spinster who had actively disapproved when he had put beans in the melodeon one sunday yes it was best to meet them in a body on a festive occasion like this when the rigors of the village point of view were relaxed it would relieve him of several dozen private visits of apology and altogether he felt that his courage would have wavered had he not been disguised as another person altogether a popular favorite a fat jolly rollicking dispenser of bounties to the general public when he finally discarded his costume would it not be easier too to meet his father first before the church full of people and have the solemn hour with him alone later at night yes as mrs todd said mebbe twas a providence there was never such a merry christmas festival in the orthodox church of beulah everybody was of one mind as to that there was a momentary fear that john trimble a pillar of prohibition might have imbibed hard cider so gay so nimble so mirthprovoking was santa claus when was john trimble ever known to unbend sufficiently to romp up the side aisle jingling his sleigh bells and leap over a front pew stuffed with presents to gain the vantageground he needed for the distribution of his pack the wing pews on one side of the pulpit had been floored over and the christmas tree stood there triumphant in beauty while the gifts strewed the greencovered platform at its feet how gay how audacious how witty was santa claus how the village had always misjudged john trimble and how completely had john trimble hitherto obscured his light under a bushel in his own proper person children avoided him but they crowded about this santa claus encircling his legs gurgling with joy when they were lifted to his shoulder their laughter ringing through the church at his droll antics a sense of mystery grew when he opened a pack on the pulpit stairs a pack unfamiliar in its outward aspect to the committee on entertainment every girl had a little doll dressed in fashionable attire and every boy a brilliantly colored splendidly noisy tin trumpet but hanging to every toy by a red ribbon was mrs larrabees christmas card her despised one about the folks back home illustration hands that trembled as everybody could see the publishers check to the ministers wife had been accompanied by a dozen complimentary copies but these had been sent to rebas western friends and relations and although the card was on many a marbletopped table in beulah it had not been bought by all the inhabitants by any means fifteen cents would purchase something useful and beulah did not contain many croesuses still here the cards were enough of them for everybody with a linen handkerchief for every woman and every man in the meetinghouse and a dozen more sticking out of the pack as the people in the front pews could plainly see modest gifts but plenty of them and nobody knew from whence they came there was a buzzing in the church a buzzing that grew louder and more persistent when santa claus threw a lace scarf around mrs larrabees shoulders and approached her husband with a fine beaver collar in his hands hands that trembled as everybody could see when he buttoned the piece of fur around the old ministers neck and the minister he had been half in and half out of a puzzling dream for ten minutes and when those hands of santa claus touched him his flesh quivered they reminded him of baby fingers that had crept around his neck years ago when he patiently walked the parsonage floor at night with his ailing child in his arms every drop of blood in his veins called out for answer he looked above the white cotton beard and mustache to a pair of dark eyes merry mischievous yet tender and soft at a brown wavy lock escaping from the homemade wig then those who were near heard a weak voice say my son and those who were far away observed santa claus tear off his wig and beard heard him cry father and as mrs todd said afterwards saw him fall on to the ministers neck right there before the whole caboodle an cling to him for all the world like an engaged couple only they wouldnt a made so free in public no ice but would have thawed in such an atmosphere grownup beulah forgot how much trouble dick larrabee had caused in other days and the children had found a friend for all time the extraordinary number of dolls trumpets handkerchiefs and christmas cards circulating in the meetinghouse raised the temperature considerably and induced a general feeling that if dick larrabee had really ever been a bit wild and reckless he had evidently reformed and prospered besides yes no one but a kind and omniscient providence could have so beautifully arranged dick larrabees homecoming and so wisely superintended his complete reinstatement in the good graces of beulah village a few maiden ladies felt that he had been a trifle immodest in embracing and especially in kissing his father in front of the congregation venturing the conviction that kissing an indecorous custom in any event was especially lamentable in public pity letty boynton missed this evenin said mrs todd her an dick allers had a fancy for each other so ive heard though i dont know how true clarissa perry might jest as well have stayed with the twins as not for her niece that spoke a piece forgot bout half of it an clarissa was in a cold sweat every minute then the niece had a fit o cryin she was so ashamed at failin an clarissa had to take her home so they

he had it for nobody ever seen sech a santa claus as dick larrabee made an there never was an never will be sech a lively an amusin an freeaneasy evenin in the orthodox church illustration x bless the card sighed david thankfully as he sat down to smoke a goodnight pipe and propped his feet contentedly against the little hessian soldiers the blaze of the logs on his own family hearthstone after many months of steam heaters in the hall bedrooms of cheap hotels how it soothed his tired heart and gave it visions of happiness to come the card was on his knee where he could look from its pictured scene to the real one of which he was again a glad and grateful part bless the card whispered letty boynton to herself as she went to her moonlit bedroom her eyes searched the snowy landscape and found the parsonage over the hills and far away then her heart flew like a bird across the distance and beat its wings in gladness for a faint light streamed from the parsons study windows and she knew that father and son were together that in itself was enough with david sleeping under the home roof but tomorrow was coming and tomorrow might be hers her very own bless the card said reba larrabee the tears shining in her eyes as she left the minister alone with his son bless everybody and everything above all bless god from whom all blessings flow bless the card said dick larrabee when he went up the narrow parsonage stairs to the room of his boyhood and found everything as it had been years ago he leaned the little piece of paper magic against the mantel clock threw it a kiss and then opening his pocketbook he went nearer to the lamp and took out the faded tintype of a brownhaired girl in a brown cape bless the card he said again with a new note in his voice bless the girl and bless tomorrow if it brings me what i want most in all the world illustration
