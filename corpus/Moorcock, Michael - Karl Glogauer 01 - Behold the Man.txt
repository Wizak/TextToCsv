 anybody who has read the passover plot will see what is going on here quickly enough this story won the nebula award in its category it deals with a man who travels through time in search of the christ he is in a very strange way successful in his quest on first reading if youre of the christian persuasion this story may seem blasphemous and irreverent well maybe it is maybe the author is an icono clast say that then again maybe youre an atheist and a sophisticated one and you might say that the author is kick ing a dead dog say that christian or atheist though if these be your initial reactions consider the story a bit more closely it may just be that both reactions are wrong michael moorcock is a wondrous man twice the size of any of us with a beard like father time and the ability to practically kill himself for that which he loves and believes in he edits the british periodical new worlds which has been the vehicle for some very fine tellings since he took it over he is a good editor and a man who would literally give you his shirt if you were to stop him on the street and demonstrate that you really needed it he is a professional human being what more can i say plenty ive met michael moorcock a couple times and because of this i know what i am saying when i say that there are very few people who could spend an afternoon with him and not come away liking him read his story very carefully please behold the man michael moorcock he has no material power as the godemperors had he has only a following of desert people and fishermen they tell him he is a god he believes them the followers of alex rs nebula award best novella ander said he is unconquerable therefore he is a god the followers of this man do not think at all he was theil act of spontaneous creation now he leads them this mad man called jesus of nazareth and he spoke saying unto them yeah verily i was kari glogauer and now i am jesus the messiah the christ and it was so the time machine was a sphere full of milky fluid in which the traveler floated enclosed in a rubber suit breathing through a mask attached to a hose leading to the wall of the machine the sphere cracked as it landed and the fluid spilled into the dust and was soaked up instinctively glogauer curled himself into a ball as the level of the liquid fell and he sank to the yielding plastic of the spheres inner lining the instruments cryptographic unconventional were still and silent the sphere shifted and rolled as the last of the liquid dripped from the great gash in its side momentarily glogauers eyes opened and closed then his mouth stretched in a kind of yawn and his tongue fluttered and he uttered a groan that turned into a ululation he heard himself the voice of tongues he thought the language of the unconscious but he could not guess what he was saying his body became numb and he shivered his passage through time had not been easy and even the thick fluid had not wholly protected him though it had doubtless saved his life some ribs were certainly broken painfully he straight ened his arms and legs and began to crawl over the slippery plastic towards the crack in the machine he could see harsh sunlight a sky like shimmering steel he pulled himself half way through the crack closing his eyes as the full strength of the sunlight struck then he lost consciousness christmas term he was nine years old born two years after his father had reached england from austria the other children were screaming with laughter in the gravel of the playground the game had begun earnestly enough and somewhat nervously karl had joined in in the same spirit now he was crying let me down please mervyn stop it they had tied him with his arms spreadeagled against the wirenetting of the playground fence it bulged outwards under his weight and one of the posts threatened to come loose mervyn williams the boy who had proposed the game began to shake the post so that karl was swung heavily back and forth on the netting stop it he saw that his cries only encouraged them and he clenched his teeth becoming silent he slumped pretending unconsciousness the school ties they had used as bonds cut into his wrists he heard the childrens voices drop is he all right molly turner was whispering hes only kidding williams replied uncertainly he felt them untying him their fingers fumbling with the knots deliberately he sagged then fell to his knees grazing them on the gravel and dropped face down to the ground distantly for he was halfconvinced by his own deception he heard their worried voices williams shook him wake up karl stop mucking about he stayed where he was losing his sense of time until he heard mr matsons voice over the general babble what on earth were you doing williams it was a play sir about jesus karl was being jesus we tied him to the fence it was his idea sir it was only a game sir karls body was stiff but he managed to stay still breath ing shallowly hes not a strong boy like you williams you should have known better im sorry sir im really sorry williams sounded as if he were crying karl felt himself lifted felt the triumph he was being carried along his head and side were so painful that he felt sick he had had no chance to discover where exactly the time machine had brought him but turn ing his head now he could see by the way the man on his right was dressed that he was at least m the middle east he had meant to land in the year ad in the wilderness beyond jerusalem near bethlehem were they taking him to jerusalem now he was on a stretcher that was apparently made of animal skins this indicated that he was probably in the past at any rate two men were carrying the stretcher on their shoulders others walked on both sides there was a smell of sweat and animal fat and a musty smell he could not identify they were walking towards a line of hills in the distance he winced as the stretcher lurched and the pain in his side increased for the second time he passed out he woke up briefly hearing voices they were speaking what was evidently some form of aramaic it was night per haps for it seemed very dark they were no longer moving there was straw beneath him he was relieved he slept in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea and saying repent ye for the king dom of heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey then went out to him jerusalem and all ludaea and all the region round about jordan and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins they were washing him he felt the cold water running over his naked body they had managed to strip off his protective suit there were now thick layers of cloth against his ribs on the right and bands of leather bound them to him he felt very weak now and hot but there was less pain he was in a buildingor perhaps a cave it was too gloomy to telllying on a heap of straw that was saturated by the water above him two men continued to sluice water down on him from their earthenware pots they were stern faced heavilybearded men in cotton robes he wondered if he could form a sentence they might understand his knowledge of written aramaic was good but he was not sure of certain pronunciations he cleared his throat wherebethisplace they frowned shaking their heads and lowering their water jars iseekanazarenejesus nazarene jesus one of the men repeated the words but they did not seem to mean anything to him he shrugged the other however only repeated the word nazarene speaking it slowly as if it had some special significance for him he muttered a few words to the other man and went towards the entrance of the room karl glogauer continued to try to say something the re maining man would understand whatyeardoththe roman emperorsitin rome it was a confusing question to ask he realized he knew christ had been crucified in the fifteenth year of tiberius reign and that was why he had asked the question he tried to phrase it better how manyyeardoth tiberius rule tiberius the man frowned glogauers ear was adjusting to the accent now and he tried to simulate it better tiberius the emperor of the romans how many years has he ruled how many the man shook his head i know not at least glogauer had managed to make himself under stood where is this place he asked it is the wilderness beyond machaerus the man replied know you not that machaerus lay to the southeast of jerusalem on the other side of the dead sea there was no doubt that he was in the past and that the period was sometime in the reign of tiberius for the man had recognized the name easily enough his companion was now returning bringing with him a huge fellow with heavily muscled hairy arms and a great barrel chest he carried a big staff in one hand he was dressed in animal skins and was well over six feet tall his black curly hair was long and he had a black bushy beard that covered the upper half of his chest he moved like an animal and his large piercing brown eyes looked reflectively at glogauer when he spoke it was in a deep voice but too rapidly for glogauer to follow it was glogauers turn to shake his head the big man squatted down beside him who art thou glogauer paused he had not planned to be found in this way he had intended to disguise himself as a traveler from syria hoping that the local accents would be different enough to explain his own unfamiliarity with the language he decided that it was best to stick to this story and hope for the best i am from the north he said not from egypt the big man asked it was as if he had expected glogauer to be from there glogauer decided that if this was what the big man thought he might just as well agree to it i came out of egypt two years since he said the big man nodded apparently satisfied so you are a magus from egypt that is what we thought and your name is jesus and you are the nazarene i seek jesus the nazarene glogauer said then what is your name the man seemed disappointed glogauer could not give his own name it would sound too strange to them on impulse he gave his fathers first name emmanuel he said the man nodded again satisfied emmanuel glogauer realized belatedly that the choice of name had been an unfortunate one in the circumstances for emmanuel meant in hebrew god with us and doubtless had a mystic significance for his questioner and what is your name he asked the man straightened up looking broodingly down on glogauer you do not know me you have not heard of john called the baptist glogauer tried to hide his surprise but evidently john the baptistsaw that his name was familiar he nodded his shaggy bead you do know of me i see well magus now i must decide eh what must you decide glogauer asked nervously if you be the friend of the prophecies or the false one we have been warned against by adonai the romans would deliver me into the hands of mine enemies the children of herod why is that you must know why for i speak against the romans who enslave judaea and i speak against the unlawful things that herod does and i prophesy the time when all those who are not righteous shall be destroyed and adonais kingdom will be restored on earth as the old prophets said it would be i say to the people be ready for that day when ye shall take up the sword to do adonais will the unrighteous know that they will perish on this day and they would destroy me despite the intensity of his words johns tone was matter of fact there was no hint of insanity or fanaticism in his face or bearing he sounded most of all like an anglican vicar reading a sermon whose meaning for him had lost its edge the essence of what he said karl glogauer realized was that he was arousing the people to throw out the romans and their puppet herod and establish a more righteous regime the attributing of this plan to adonai one of the spoken names of jahweh and meaning the lord seemed as many scholars had guessed in the th century a means of giving the plan extra weight in a world where politics and religion even in the west were inextricably bound to gether it was necessary to ascribe a supernatural origin to the plan indeed glogauer thought it was more than likely that john believed his idea had been inspired by god for the greeks on the other side of the mediterranean had not yet stopped arguing about the origins of inspirationwhether it originated in a mans head or was placed there by the gods that john accepted him as an egyptian magician of some kind did not surprise glogauer particularly either the cir cumstances of his arrival must have seemed extraordinarily miraculous and at the same time acceptable particularly to a sect like the essenes who practiced selfmortification and starvation and must be quite used to seeing visions in this hot wilderness there was no doubt now that these people were the neurotic essenes whose ritual washingbaptismand selfdeprivation coupled with the almost paranoiac mysticism that led them to invent secret languages and the like was a sure indication of their mentally unbalanced condition all this occurred to glogauer the psychiatrist manque but glo gauer the man was torn between the poles of extreme ra tionalism and the desire to be convinced by the mysticism itself i must meditate john said turning towards the cave entrance i must pray you will remain here until guidance is sent to me he left the cave striding rapidly away glogauer sank back on the wet straw he was without doubt in a limestone cave and the atmosphere in the cave was surprisingly humid it must be very hot outside he felt drowsy ii five years in the past nearly two thousand in the future lying in the hot sweaty bed with monica once again an other attempt to make normal love had metamorphosed into the performance of minor aberrations which seemed to satisfy her better than anything else their real courtship and fulfillment was yet to come as usual it would be verbal as usual it would find its climax in argumentative anger i suppose youre going to tell me youre not satisfied again she accepted the lighted cigarette he handed to her in the darkness im all right he said there was silence for a while as they smoked eventually and in spite of knowing what the result would be if he did so he found himself talking its ironic isnt it he began he waited for her reply she would delay for a little while yet what is she said at last all this you spend all day trying to help sexual neurotics to become normal you spend your nights doing what they do not to the same extent you know its all a matter of degree so you say he turned his head and looked at her face in the starlight from the window she was a gauntfeatured redhead with the calm professional seducers voice of the psychiatric social worker that she was it was a voice that was soft reasonable and insincere only occasionally when she became particu larly agitated did her voice begin to indicate her real charac ter her features never seemed to be in repose even when she slept her eyes were forever wary her movements rarely spontaneous every inch of her was protected which was probably why she got so little pleasure from ordinary love niaking you just cant let yourself go can you he said oh shut up karl have a look at yourself if youre looking for a neurotic mess both were amateur psychiatristsshe a psychiatric social worker he merely a reader a dabbler though he had done a years study some time ago when he had planned to be come a psychiatrist they used the terminology of psychia try freely they felt happier if they could name something he rolled away from her groping for the ashtray on the bedside table catching a glance of himself in the dressing table mirror he was a sallow intense moody jewish book seller with a head full of images and unresolved obsessions a body full of emotions he always lost these arguments with monica verbally she was the dominant one this kind of exchange often seemed to him more perverse than their lovemaking where usually at least his role was masculine essentially he realized he was passive masochistic in decisive even his anger which came frequently was im potent monica was ten years older than he was ten years more bitter as an individual of course she had far more dynamism than he had but as a psychiatric social worker she had had just as many failures she plugged on becoming increasingly cynical on the surface but still perhaps hoping for a few spectacular successes with patients they tried to do too much that was the trouble he thought the priests in the confessional supplied a panacea the psychiatrists tried to cure and most of the time they failed but at least they tried he thought and then wondered if that was after all a virtue i did look at myself he said was she sleeping he turned her wary eyes were still open looking out of the window i did look at myself he repeated the way jung did how can i help those persons if i am myself a fugitive and perhaps also suffer from the morbus sacer of a neurosis thats what jung asked himself that old sensationalist that old rationalizer of his own mysticism no wonder you never became a psychiatrist i wouldnt have been any good it was nothing to do with jung dont take it out on me youve told me yourself that you feel the sameyou think its useless after a hard weeks work i might say that give me an other fag he opened the packet on the bedside table and put two cigarettes in his mouth lighting them and handing one to her almost abstractedly he noticed that the tension was in creasing the argument was as ever pointless but it was not the argument that was the important thing it was simply the expression of the essential relationship he wondered if that was in any way important either youre not telling the truth he realized that there was no stopping now that the ritual was in full swing im telling the practical truth ive no compulsion to give up my work ive no wish to be a failure failure youre more melodramatic than i am youre too earnest karl you want to get out of yourself a bit he sneered if i were you id give up my work monica youre no more suited for it than i was she shrugged youre a petty bastard im not jealous of you if thats what you think youll never understand what im looking for her laugh was artificial brittle modem man in search of a soul eh modern man in search of a crutch id say and you can take that any way you like were destroying the myths that make the world go round now you say and what are we putting in their place youre stale and stupid karl youve never looked rationally at anythingincluding yourself what of it you say the myth is unimportant the reality that creates it is important jung knew that the myth can also create the reality which shows what a muddled old fool he was he stretched his legs in doing so he touched hers and he recoiled he scratched his head she still lay there smok ing but she was smiling now come on she said lets have some stuff about christ he said nothing she handed him the stub of her cigarette and he put it in the ashtray he looked at his watch it was two oclock in the morning why do we do it he said because we must she put her hand to the back of his head and pulled it towards her breast what else can we do we protestants must sooner or later face this question are we to understand the imitation of christ in the sense that we should copy his life and if i may use the expression ape his stigmata or in the deeper sense that we are to live our own proper lives as truly as he lived his in all its im plications it is no easy matter to live a life that is modeled on christs but it is unspeakably harder to live ones own life as truly as christ lived his anyone who did this would be misjudged derided tortured and crucified a neurosis is a dissociation of personality for a month john the baptist was away and glogauer lived with the essenes finding it surprisingly easy as his ribs mended to join in their daily life the essenes town ship consisted of a mixture of singlestory houses built of limestone and clay brick and the caves that were to be found on both sides of the shallow valley the essenes shared their goods in common and this particular sect had wives though many essenes led completely monastic lives the essenes were also pacifists refusing to own or to make weapons yet this sect plainly tolerated the warlike baptist perhaps their hatred of the romans overcame their principles per haps they were not sure of johns entire intention whatever the reason for their toleration there was little doubt that john the baptist was virtually their leader the life of the essenes consisted of ritual bathing three times a day of prayer and of work the work was not dif ficult sometimes glogauer guided a plough pulled by two other members of the sect sometimes he looked after the goats that were allowed to graze on the hillsides it was a peaceful ordered life and even the unhealthy aspects were so much a matter of routine that glogauer hardly noticed them for anything else after a while tending the goats he would lie on a hilltop looking out over the wilderness which was not a desert but rocky scrub land sufficient to feed animals like goats or sheep the scrub land was broken by lowlying bushes and a few small trees growing along the banks of the river that doubtless ran into the dead sea it was uneven ground in outline it had the appearance of a stormy lake frozen and turned yellow and brown beyond the dead sea lay jerusalem obviously christ had not entered the city for the last time yet john the baptist would have to die before that happened the essenes way of life was comfortable enough for all its simplicity they had given him a goatskin loinclothand a staff and except for the fact that he was watched by day and night he appeared to be accepted as a kind of lay member of the sect sometimes they questioned him casually about his chariot the time machine they intended soon to bring in from the desertand he told them that it had borne him from egypt to syria and then to here they accepted the miracle calmly as he had suspected they were used to miracles the essenes had seen stranger things than his time ma chine they had seen men walk on water and angels descend to and from heaven they had heard the voice of god and his archangels as well as the tempting voice of satan and his minions they wrote all these things down in their vel lum scrolls they were merely a record of the supernatural as their other scrolls were records of their daily lives and of the news that traveling members of their sect brought to them they lived constantly in the presence of god and spoke to god and were answered by god when they had sufficiently mortified their flesh and starved themselves and chanted their prayers beneath the blazing sun of judaea karl glogauer grew his hair long and let his beard come unchecked he mortified his flesh and starved himself and chanted his prayers beneath the sun as they did but he rarely heard god and only once thought he saw an arch angel with wings of fire in spite of his willingness to experience the essenes hal lucinations glogauer was disappointed but he was surprised that he felt so well considering all the selfinflicted hardships he had to undergo and he also felt relaxed in the company of these men and women who were undoubtedly insane perhaps it was because their insanity was not so very dif ferent from his own that after a while he stopped wondering about it john the baptist returned one evening striding over the hills followed by twenty or so of his closest disciples glo gauer saw him as he prepared to drive the goats into their cave for the night he waited for john to get closer the baptists face was grim but his expression softened as he saw glogauer he smiled and grasped him by the upper arm in the roman fashion well emmanuel you are our friend as i thought you were sent by adonai to help us accomplish his will you shall baptize me on the morrow to show all the people that he is with us glogauer was tired he had eaten very little and had spent most of the day in the sun tending the goats he yawned finding it hard to reply however he was relieved john had plainly been in jerusalem trying to discover if the romans had sent him as a spy john now seemed reassured and trusted him he was worried however by the baptists faith ill his powers john he began jm no seer the baptists face clouded for a moment then he laughed awkwardly say nothing eat with me tonight i have wild honey and locusts glogauer had not yet eaten this food which was the staple of travelers who did not carry provisions but lived off the food they could find on the journey some regarded it as a delicacy he tried it later as he sat in johns house there were only two rooms in the house one was for eating in the other for sleeping in the honey and locusts was too sweet for his taste butit was a welcome change from barley or goatmeat he sat crosslegged opposite john the baptist who ate with relish night had fallen from outside came low mur murs and the moans and cries of those at prayer glogauer dipped another locust into the bowl of honey that rested between them do you plan to lead the people of judaea in revolt against the romans he asked the baptist seemed disturbed by the direct question it was the first of its nature that glogauer had put to him if it be adonais will he said not looking up as he leant towards the bowl of honey the romans know this i do not know emmanuel but herod the incestuous has doubtless told them i speak against the unrighteous yet the romans do not arrest you pilate dare notnot since the petition was sent to the emperor tiberius petition aye the one that herod and the pharisees signed when pilate the procurator did place votive shields in the palace at jerusalem and seek to violate the temple tiberius re buked pilate and since then though he still hates the jews the procurator is more careful in his treatment of us tell me john do you know how long tiberius has ruled in rome he had not had the chance to ask that question again until now fourteen years it was adsomething less than a year before the crucifixion would take place and his time machine was smashed now john the baptist planned armed rebellion against the occupying romans but if the gospels were to be believed would soon be decapitated by herod certainly no large scale rebellion had taken place at this time even those who claimed that the entry of jesus and his disciples into jeru salem and the invasion of the temple were plainly the ac tions of armed rebels had found no records to suggest that john had led a similar revolt glogauer had come to like the baptist very much the man was plainly a hardened revolutionary who had been planning revolt against the romans for years and had slowly been building up enough followers to make the attempt suc cessful he reminded glogauer strongly of the resistance leaders of the second world war he had a similar tough ness and understanding of the realities of his position he knew that he would only have one chance to smash the cohorts garrisoned in the country if the revolt became pro tracted rome would have ample time to send more troops to jerusalem when do you think adonai intends to destroy the un righteous through your agency glogauer said tactfully john glanced at him with some amusement he smiled the passover is a time when the people are restless and resent the strangers most he said when is the next passover not for many months how can i help you you are a magus i can work no miracles john wiped the honey from his beard i cannot believe that emmanuel the manner of your coming was miracu lous the essenes did not know if you were a devil or a messenger from adonai i am neither why do you confuse me emmanuel i know that you are adonais messenger you are the sign that the essenes sought the time is almost ready the kingdom of heaven shall soon be established on earth come with me tell the people that you speak with adonais voice work mighty miracles your power is waning is that it glogauer looked sharply at john you need me to renew your rebels hopes you speaklike a roman with such lack of subtlety john got up angrily evidently like the essenes he lived with he preferred less direct conversation there was a practical reason for this glogauer realized in that john and his men feared betrayal all the time even the essenes records were partially written in cipher with one innocent seeming word or phrase meaning something else entirely i am sorry john but tell me if i am right glogauer spoke softly are you not a magus coming in that chariot from no where the baptist waved his hands and shrugged his shoulders my men saw you they saw the shining thing take shape in air crack and let you enter out of it is that not magical the clothing you worewas that earthly rai ment the talismans within the chariotdid they not speak of powerful magic the prophet said that a magus would come from egypt and be called emmanuel so it is written in the book of micah are none of these things true most of them but there are explanations he broke off unable to think of the nearest word to rational i am an ordinary man like you i have no power to work mira cles i am just a man john glowered you mean you refuse to help us im grateful to you and the essenes you saved my life almost certainly if i can repay that john nodded his head deliberately you can repay it emmanuel how be the great magus i need let me present you to all those who become impatient and would turn away from adonais will let me tell them the manner of your coming to us then you can say that all is adonais will and that they must prepare to accomplish it john stared at him intensely will you emmanuel for your sake john and in turn will you send men to bring my chariot here as soon as possible i wish to see if it may be mended i will glogauer felt exhilarated he began to laugh the bap tist looked at him with slight bewilderment then he began to join in glogauer laughed on history would not mention it but he with john the baptist would prepare the way for christ christ was not born yet perhaps glogauer knew it one year before the crucifixion and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me even when he had first met monica they had had long arguments his father had not then died and left him the money to buy the occult bookshop in great russell street opposite the british museum he was doing all sorts of temporary work and his spirits were very low at that time monica had seemed a great help a great guide through the mental darkness engulfing him they had both lived close to holland park and went there for walks almost every sunday of the summer of at twentytwo he was already ob sessed with jungs strange brand of christian mysticism she who despised jung had soon begun to denigrate all his ideas she never really convinced him but after a while she oq had succeeded in confusing him it would be another six months before they went to bed together it was uncomfortably hot they sat in the shade of the cafeteria watching a distant i cricket match nearer to them two girls and a boy sat on the grass drinking orange squash from plastic cups one of the girls had a guitar across her lap and she set the cup down and began to play singing a folksong in a high gentle voice glogauer tried to listen to the words as a student he had always liked traditional folk music christianity is dead monica sipped her tea religion is dying god was killed in there may yet be a resurrection he said let us hope not religion was the creation of fear knowledge destroys fear without fear religion cant sur vive you think theres no fear about these days not the same kind karl havent you ever considered the idea of christ he asked her changing his tack what that means to chris tians the idea of the tractor means as much to a marxist she replied but what came first the idea or the actuality of christ she shrugged the actuality if it matters jesus was a jewish troublemaker organizing a revolt against the romans he was crucified for his pains thats all we know and all we need to know a great religion couldnt have begun so simply when people need one theyll make a great religion out of the most unlikely beginnings thats my point monica he gesticulated at her and she drew away slightly the idea preceded the actuality of christ oh karl dont go on the actuality of jesus preceded the idea of christ a couple walked past glancing at them as they argued monica noticed them and fell silent she got up and he rose as well but she shook her head im going home karl you stay here ill see you in a few days he watched her walk down the wide path towards the park gates the next day when he got home from work he found a letter she must have written it after she had left him and posted it the same day dear karl conversation doesnt seem to have much effect on you you know its as if you listen to the tone of the voice the rhythm of the words without ever hearing what is trying to be communicated youre a bit like a sensitive animal who cant understand whafs being said to it but can tell if the person talking is pleased or angry and so on thafs why im writing to youto try to get my idea across you respond too emotionally when were together you make the mistake of considering christianity as some thing that developed over the course of a few years from the death of jesus to the time the gospels were written but christianity wasnt new only the name was new chris tianity was merely a stage in the meeting crossfertilization metamorphosis of western logic and eastern mysticism look how the religion itself changed over the centuries rein terpreting itself to meet changing times christianity is just a new name for a conglomeration of old myths and philoso phies all the gospels do is retell the sun myth and garble some of the ideas from the greeks and romans even in the second century jewish scholars were showing it up for the mishmash it was they pointed out the strong similarities between the various sun myths and the christ myth the miracles didnt happenthey were invented later borrowed from here and there remember the old victorians who used to say that plato was really a christian because he anticipated christian thought christian thought christianity was a vehicle for ideas in circulation for centuries before christ was marcus aurelius a christian he was writing in the direct tradition of western philosophy thats why christianity caught on in europe and not in the east you should have been a theo logian with your bias not a psychiatrist the same goes for your friend jung try to clear your head of all this morbid nonsense and youll be a lot better at your job yours monica he screwed the letter up and threw it away later that evening he was tempted to look at it again but he resisted the temptation iu john stood up to his waist in the river most of the essenes stood on the banks watching him glogauer looked down at him i cannot john it is not for me to do it the baptist muttered you must glogauer shivered as he lowered himself into the river beside the baptist he felt lightheaded he stood there trembling unable to move his foot slipped on the rocks of the river and john reached out and gripped his arm steadying him in the clear sky the sun was at zenith beating down on his unprotected head emmanuel john cried suddenly the spirit of adonai is within you glogauer still found it hard to speak he shook his head slightly it was aching and he could hardly see today he was having his first migraine attack since he had come here he wanted to vtfmit johns voice sounded distant he swayed in the water as he began to fall toward the baptist the whole scene around him shimmered he felt john catch him and heard himself say desperately john baptize me and then there was water in his mouth and throat and he was coughing johns voice was crying something whatever the words were they drew a response from the people on both banks the roaring in his ears increased its quality changing he thrashed in the water then felt himself lifted to his feet the essenes were swaying in unison every face lifted up wards towards the glaring sun glogauer began to vomit into the water stumbling as i johns hands gripped his arms painfully and guided him up the bank a peculiar rhythmic humming came from the mouths of the essenes as they swayed it rose as they swayed to one side fell as they swayed to the other glogauer covered his ears as john released him he was still retching but it was dry now and worse than before he began to stagger away barely keeping his balance running with his ears still covered running over the rocky scrubland running as the sun throbbed in the sky and its heat pounded at his head running away but john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and earnest thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased he had been fifteen doing well at the grammar school he had read in the newspapers about the teddy boy gangs that roamed south london but the odd youth he had seen in pseudoedwardian clothes had seemed harmless and stupid enough he had gone to the pictures in brixton hill and decided to walk home to streatham because he had spent most of the bus money on an ice cream they came out of the cinema at the same time he hardly noticed them as they followed him down the hill then quite suddenly they had surrounded him pale meanfaced boys most of them a year or two older than he was he realized that he knew two of them vaguely they were at the big council school in the same street as the gram mar school they used the same football ground hello he said weakly hello son said the oldest teddy boy he was chewing gum standing with one knee bent grinning at him where you going then home heouwm said the biggest one imitating his accent what are you going to do when you get there go to bed karl tried to get through the ring but they wouldnt let him they pressed him back into a shop door way beyond them cars droned by on the main road the street was brightly lit with street lamps and neon from the shops several people passed but none of them stopped karl began to feel panic got no homework to do son said the boy next to the leader he was redheaded and freckled and his eyes were a hard gray want to fight one of us another boy asked it was one of the boys he knew no i dont fight let me go you scared son said the leader grinning ostenta tiously he pulled a streamer of gum from his mouth and then replaced it he began chewing again no why should i want to fight you you reckon youre better than us is that it son no he was beginning to tremble tears were coming into his eyes course not course not son he moved forward again but they pushed him back into the doorway youre the bloke with the kraut name aint you said the other boy he knew glowworm or somethink glogauer let me go wont your mummy like it if youre back late more a yid name than a kraut name you a yid son he looks like a yid you a yid son you a jewish boy son you a yid son shut up karl screamed he pushed into them one of them punched him in the stomach he grunted with pain another pushed him and he staggered people were still hurrying by on the pavement they glanced at the group as they went past one man stopped but his wife pulled him on just some kids larking about she said get his trousers down one of the boys suggested with a laugh thatll prove it karl pushed through them and this time they didnt resist he began to run down the hill give him a start he heard one of the boys say he ran on they began to follow him laughing they did not catch up with him by the time he turned into the avenue where he lived he reached the house and ran along the dark passage beside it he opened the back door his stepmother was in the kitchen whats the matter with you she said she was a tall thin woman nervous and hysterical her dark hair was untidy he went past her into the breakfastroom whats the matter karl she called her voice was highpitched nothing he said he didilt want a scene it was cold when he woke up the false dawn was gray and he could see nothing but barren country in all directions he could not remember a great deal about the previous day except that he had run a long way dew had gathered on his loincloth he wet his lips and rubbed the skin over his face as he always did after a migraine attack he felt weak and completely drained look ing down at his naked body he noticed how skinny he had become life with the essenes had caused that of course he wondered why he had panicked so much when john had asked him to baptize him was it simply honesty something in him which resisted deceiving the essenes into thinking he was a prophet of some kind it was hard to know he wrapped the goatskin about his hips and tied it tightly just above his left thigh he supposed he had better try to get back to the camp and find john and apologize see if he could make amends the time machine was there now too they had dragged it there using only rawhide ropes if a good blacksmith could be found or some other metal worker there was just a chance that it could be repaired the journey back would be dangerous he wondered if he ought to go back right away or try to shift to a time nearer to the actual crucifixion he had not gone back specifically to witness the crucifixion but to get the mood of jerusalem during the feast of the passover when jesus was supposed to have entered the city monica had thought jesus had stormed the city with an armed band she had said that all the evidence pointed to that all the evidence of one sort did point to it but he could not accept the evidence there was more to it he was sure if only he could meet jesus john had apparently never heard of him though he had told glogauer that there was a prophecy that the messiah would be a nazarene there were many prophe cies and many of them conflicted he began to walk back in the general direction of the essdhe camp he could not have come so far he would soon recognize the hills where they had their caves soon it was very hot and the ground more barren the air wavered before his eyes the feeling of exhaustion with which he had awakened increased his mouth was dry and his legs were weak he was hungry and there was nothing to eat there was no sign of the range of hills where the essenes had their camp there was one hill about two miles away to the south he decided to make for it from there he would probably be able to get his bearings perhaps even see a township where they would give him food the sandy soil turned to floating dust around him as his feet disturbed it a few primitive shrubs clung to the ground and jutting rocks tripped him he was bleeding and bruised by the time he began pain fully to clamber up the hillside the journey to the summit which was much farther away than he had originally judged was difficult he would slide on the loose stones of the hillside falling on his face bracing his torn hands and feet to stop himself from slid ing down to the bottom clinging to tufts of grass and lichen that grew here and there embracing larger projections of rock when he could resting frequently his mind and body both numb with pain and weariness he sweated beneath the sun the dust stuck to the mois ture on his halfnaked body caking him from head to foot the goatskin was in shreds the barren world reeled around him sky somehow merg ing with land yellow rock with white clouds nothing seemed still he reached the summit and lay there gasping everything had become unreal he heard monicas voice thought he glanced at her for a moment from the corner of his eye dont be melodramatic karl she had said that many times his own voice replied now im born out of my time monica this age of reason has no place for me it will kill me in the end her voice replied guilt and fear and your own masochism you could be a brilliant psychiatrist but youve given in to all your own neuroses so completely shut up he rolled over on his back the sun blazed down on his tattered body shut up the whole christian syndrome karl youll become a catholic convert next i shouldnt doubt wheres your strength of mind shut up go away monica fear shapes your thoughts youre not searching for a soul or even a meaning for life youre searching for com forts leave me alone monica his grimy hands covered his ears his hair and beard were matted with dust blood had congealed on the minor wounds that were now on every part of his body above the sun seemed to pound in unison with his heartbeats youre going downhill karl dont you realize that downhill pull yourself together youre not entirely inca pable of rational thought oh monica shut up his voice was harsh and cracked a few ravens circled the sky above him now he heard themcalling back at him in a voice not unlike his own god died in it isnt its ad god is alive how you can bother to wonder about an obvious syn cretistic religion like christianityrabbinic judaism stoic ethics greek mystery cults oriental ritual it doesnt matter not to you in your present state of mind i need god thats what it boils down to doesnt it okay karl carve your own crutches lust think what you could have been if youd have come to terms with yourself glogauer pulled his mined body to its feet and stood on the summit of the hill and screamed the ravens were startled they wheeled in the sky and flew away the sky was darkening now then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted forty days and forty night he was afterward anhungered iv the madman came stumbling into the town his feet stirred the dust and made it dance and dogs barked around him as he walked mechanically his head turned upwards to face the sun his arms limp at his sides his lips moving to the townspeople the words they heard were in no familiar language yet they were uttered with such intensity and conviction that god himself might be using this ema ciated naked creature as his spokesman they wondered where the madman had come from the white town consisted primarily of double and single storied houses of stone and claybrick built around a market place that was fronted by an ancient simple synagogue outside which old men sat and talked dressed in dark robes the town was prosperous and clean thriving on roman commerce only one or two beggars were in the streets and these were wellfed the streets followed the rise and fall of the hillside on which they were built they were winding streets shady and peaceful country streets there was a smell of newlycut timber everywhere in the air and the sound of carpentry for the town was chiefly famous for its skilled carpenters it lay on the edge of the plain of jezreel close to the trade route between damascus and egypt and wagons were always leaving it laden with the work of the towns craftsmen the town was called nazareth the madman had found it by asking every traveler he saw where it was he had passed through other towns philadelphia gerasa pella and scythopolis following the roman roadsasking the same question in his outlandish accent where lies nazareth some had given him food on the way some had asked for his blessing and he had laid hands on them speaking in that strange tongue some had pelted him with stones and driven him away he had crossed the jordan by the roman viaduct and continued northwards towards nazareth there had been no difficulty in finding the town but it had been difficult for him to force himself towards it he had lost a great deal of blood and had eaten very little on the journey he would walk until he collapsed and lie there until he could go on or as had happened increasingly until someone found him and had given him a little sour wine or bread to revive him once some roman legionaries had stopped and with brusque kindness asked him if he had any relatives they could take him to they had addressed him in pidginara maic and had been surprised when he replied in a strangely accented latin that was purer than the language they spoke themselves they asked him if he was a rabbi or a scholar he told them he was neither the officer of the legionaries had offered him some dried meat and wine the men were part of a patrol that passed this way once a month they were stocky brownfaced men with hard cleanshaven faces they were dressed in stained leather kilts and breastplates and sandals and had iron helmets on their heads scab barded short swords at their hips even as they stood around him in the evening sunlight they did not seem relaxed the officer softervoiced than his men but otherwise much like them save that he wore a metal breastplate and a long cloak asked the madman what his name was for a moment the madman had paused his mouth opening and closing as if he could not remember what he was called karl he said at length doubtfully it was more a sug gestion than a statement sounds almost like a roman name said one of the le gionaries are you a citizen the officer asked but the madmans mind was wandering evidently he looked away from them muttering to himself all at once he looked back at them and said nazareth that way the officer pointed down the road that cut between the hills are you a jew this seemed to startle the madman he sprang to his feet and tried to push through the soldiers they let him through laughing he was a harmless madman they watched hiin ran down the road one of their prophets perhaps said the officer walk ing towards his horse the country was full of them every other man you met claimed to be spreading the message of their god they didnt make much trouble and religion seemed to keep their minds off rebellion we should be grateful thought the officer his men were still laughing they began to march down the road in the opposite direction to the one the madman had taken now the madman was in nazareth and the townspeople looked at him with curiosity and more than a little suspicion as he staggered into the market square he could be a wandering prophet or he could be possessed by devils it was often hard to tell the rabbis would know as he passed the knots of people standing by the mer chants stallsthey fell silent until he had gone by women pulled their heavy woolen shawls about their wellfed bodies and men tucked in their cotton robes so that he would not touch them normally their instinct would have been to have taxed him with his business in the town but there was an intensity about his gaze a quickness and vitality about his face in spite of his emaciated appearance that made them treat him with some respect and they kept their sistance when he reached the center of the market place he stopped and looked around him he seemed slow to notice the people he biinked and licked his lips a woman passed eyeing him warily he spoke to her his voice soft the words carefully formed is this nazareth it is she nodded and increased her pace a man was crossing the square he was dressed in a woolen robe of red and brown stripes there was a red skull cap on his curly black hair his face was plump and cheerful the madman walked across the mans path and stopped him i seek a carpenter there are many carpenters in nazareth the town is famous for its carpenters i am a carpenter myself can i help you the mans voice was goodhumored patronizing do you know a carpenter called joseph a descendant of david he has a wife called mary and several children one is named jesus the cheerful man screwed his face into a mock frown and scratched the back of his neck i know more than one joseph there is one poor fellow in yonder street he pointed he has a wife called mary try there you should soon find him look for a man who never laughs the madman looked in the direction in which the man pointed as soon as he saw the street he seemed to forget everything else and strode towards it in the narrow street he entered the smell of cut timber was even stronger he walked ankledeep in woodshavings from every building came the thud of hammers the scrape of saws there were planks of all sizes resting against the pale shaded walls of the houses and there was hardly room to pass between them many of the carpenters had their benches just outside their doors they were carving bowls operating simple lathes shaping wood into everything imag inable they looked up as the madman entered the street and approached one old carpenter in a leather apron who sat at his bench carving a figurine the man had gray hair and seemed shortsighted he peered up at the madman what do you want i seeka carpenter called joseph he has a wifemary the old man gestured with his hand that held the half completed figurine two houses along on the other side of the street the house the madman came to had very few planks leaning against it and the quality of the timber seemed poorer than the other wood he had seen the bench near the entrance was warped on one side and the man who sat hunched over it repairing a stool seemed misshapen also he straightened up as the madman touched his shoulder his face was lined and pouched with misery his eyes were tired and his thin beard had premature streaks of gray he coughed slightly perhaps in surprise at being disturbed are you joseph asked the madman ive no money i want nothingjust to ask a few questions im joseph why do you want to know have you a son several and daughters too your wife is called mary you are of davids line the man waved his hand impatiently yes for what good either have done me i wish to meet one of your sons jesus can you tell me where he is that goodfornothing what has he done now where is he josephs eyes became more calculating as he stared at the madman are you a seer of some kind have you come to cure my son i am a prophet of sorts i can foretell the future joseph got up with a sigh you can see him come he led the madman through the gateway into the cramped courtyard of the house it was crowded with pieces of wood broken furniture and implements rotting sacks of shavings they entered the darkened house in the first roomevi dently a kitchena woman stood by a large clay stove she was tall and bulging with fat her long black hair was unbound and greasy falling over large lustrous eyes that still had the heat of sensuality she looked the madman over theres no food for beggars she grunted he eats enough as it is she gestured with a wooden spoon at a small figure sitting in the shadow of a corner the figure shifted as she spoke he seeks our jesus said joseph to the woman per haps he comes to ease our burden the woman gave the madman a sidelong look and shrugged she licked her red lips with a fat tongue jesus the figure in the comer stood up thats him said the woman with a certain satisfaction the madman frowned shaking his head rapidly no the figure was misshappen it had a pronounced hunched back and a cast in its left eye the face was vacant and foolish there was a little spittle on the lips it giggled as its name was repeated it took a crooked step forward je sus it said the word was slurred and thick jesus thats all he can say the woman sneered hes always been like that gods judgment said joseph bitterly what is wrong with him there was a pathetic des perate note in the madmans voice hes always been like that the woman turned back to the stove you can have him if you want him addled inside and outside i was carrying him when my parents married me off to that halfman you shameless joseph stopped as his wife glared at him he turned to the madman whats your business with our son i wished to talk to him i hes no oracleno seerwe used to think he might be there are still people in nazareth who come to him to cure them or tell their fortunes but he only giggles at them and speaks his name over and over again areyou surethere is notsomething about himyou have not noticed sure mary snorted sardonically we need money badly enough if he had any magical powers wed know jesus giggled again and limped away into another room it is impossible the madman murmured could history itself have changed could he be in some other dimension of time where christ had never been joseph appeared to notice the look of agony in the mad mans eyes what is it he said what do you see you said you foretold the future tell us how we will fare not now said the prophet turning away not now he ran from the house and down the street with its smell of planed oak cedar and cypress he ran back to the market place and stopped looking wildly about him he saw the synagogue directly ahead of him he began to walk towards it the man he had spoken to earlier was stillin the market place buying cooking pots to give to his daughter as a wedding gift he nodded towards the strange man as he entered the synagogue hes a relative of joseph the carpenter he told the man beside him a prophet i shouldnt wonder the madman the prophet karl glogauer the timetrav eler the neurotic psychiatrist manque the searcher for meaning the masochist the man with a deathwish and the messiahcomplex the anachronism made his way into the synagogue gasping for breath he had seen the man he had sought he had seen jesus the son of joseph and mary he had seen a man he recognized without any doubt as a congenital imbecile all men have a messiahcomplex karl monica had said the memories were less complete now his sense of time and identity was becoming confused there were dozens of messiahs in galilee at the time that jesus should have been the one to carry the myth and the philosophy was a coincidence of history there must have been more to it than that monica every tuesday in the room above the occult bookshop the jungian discussion group would meet for purposes of group analysis and therapy glogauer had not organized the group but he had willingly lent his premises to it and had joined it eagerly it was a great relief to talk with likeminded people once a week one of his reasons for buying the occult bookshop was so that he would meet interesting people like those who attended the jungian discussion group an obsession with jung brought them together but every one had special obsessions of his own mrs rita blen charted the courses of flying saucers though it was not clear if she believed in them or not hugh joyce believed that all jungian archetypes derived from the original race of atlantides who bad perished millennia before alan cheddar the youngest of the group was interested in indian mysticism and sandra peterson the organizer was a great witchcraft specialist james headington was interested in time he was the groups pride he was sir james headington wartime inventor very rich and with all sorts of decorations for his contribution to the allied victory he had had the reputation of being a great improviser during the war but after it he had become something of an embarrassment to the war office he was a crank they thought and what was worse he aired his crankiness in public every so often sir james would tell the other members of the group about his time machine they humored him most of them were liable to exaggerate their own experi ences connected with their different interests one tuesday evening after everyone else had left head ington told glogauer that his machine was ready i cant believe it glogauer said truthfully youre the first person ive told why me i dont know i like youand the shop you havent told the government headington had chuckled why should i not until ive tested it fully anyway serves them right for putting me out to pasture you dont know it works im sure it does would you like to see it a time machine glogauer smiled weakly come and see it why me i thought you might be interested i know you dont hold with the orthodox view of science glogauer felt sorry for him come and see said headington he went down to banbury the next day the same day he left j and arrived in ad the synagogue was cool and quiet with a subtle scent of incense the rabbis guided him into the courtyard they like the townspeople did not know what to make of him but they were sure it was not a devil that possessed him it was their custom to give shelter to the roaming prophets who were now everywhere in galilee though this one was stranger than the rest his face was immobile and his body was stiff and there were tears running down his dirty cheeks they had never seen such agony in a mans eyes before science can say how but it never asks why he had told monica it cant answer who wants to know shed replied i do well youll never find out will you sit down my son said the rabbi what do you wish to ask of us where is christ he said where is christ they did not understand the language is it greek asked one but another shook his head kyrios the lord adonai the lord where was the lord he frowned looking vaguely about him i must rest he said in their language where are you from he could not think what to answer where are you from a rabbi repeated haolam habbah he murmured at length they looked at one another haolam habbah they said haolam habbah haolam hazzeh the world to come and the world that is do you bring us a message said one of the rabbis they were used to prophets certainly but none like this one a message i do not know said the prophet hoarsely i must rest i am hungry come we will give you food and a place to sleep he could only eat a little of the rich food and the bed with its strawstuffed mattress was too soft for him he was not used to it he slept badly shouting as he dreamed and outside the room the rabbis listened but could understand little of what he said karl glogauer stayed in the synagogue for several weeks he would spend most of his time reading in the library searching through the long scrolls for some answer to his dilemma the words of the testaments in many cases ca pable of a dozen interpretations only confused him further there was nothing to grasp nothing to tell him what had gone wrong the rabbis kept their distance for the most part they had accepted him as a holy man they were proud to have him in their synagogue they were sure that he was one of the special chosen of god and they waited patiently for him to speak to them but the prophet said little muttering only to himself in snatches of their own language and snatches of the incom prehensible language he often used even when he addressed them directly in nazareth the townsfolk talked of little else but the mysterious prophet in the synagogue but the rabbis would not answer their questions they would tell the people to go about their business that there were things they were not yet meant to know in this way as priests had always done they avoided questions they could not answer while at the same time appearing to have much more knowledge than they actually possessed then one sabbath he appeared in the public part of the synagogue and took his place with the others who had come to worship the man who was reading from the scroll on his left stumbled over the words glancing at the prophet from the corner of his eye the prophet sat and listened his expression remote the chief rabbi looked uncertainly at him then signed that the scroll should be passed to the prophet this was done hesitantly by a boy who placed the scroll into the prophets hands the prophet looked at the words for a long time and then began to read the prophet read without comprehend ing at first what he read it was the book of esaias the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him v they followed him now as he walked away from nazareth towards the lake of galilee he was dressed in the white linen robe they had given him and though they thought he led them they in fact drove him before them he is our messiah they said to those that inquired and there were already rumors of miracles when he saw the sick he pitied them and tried to do what he could because they expected something of him many he could do nothing for but others obviously in psychosomatic conditions he could help they believed in his power more strongly than they believed in their sickness so he cured them when he came to capernaum some fifty people followed him into the streets of the city it was already known that he was in some way associated with john the baptist who enjoyed huge prestige in galilee and had been declared a true prophet by many pharisees yet this man had a power greater in some ways than johns he was not the orator that the baptist was but he had worked miracles capernaum was a sprawling town beside the crystal lake of galilee its houses separated by large market gardens fishing boats were moored at the white quayside as well as trading ships that plied the lakeside towns though the green hills came down from all sides to the lake capernaum itself was built on flat ground sheltered by the hills it was a quiet town and like most others in galilee had a large population of gentiles greek roman and egyptian traders walked its streets and many had made permanent homes there there was a prosperous middleclass of merchants artisans and shipowners as well as doctors lawyers and scholars for capernaum was on the borders of the provinces of galilee trachonitis and syria and though a comparatively small town was a useful junction for trade and travel the strange mad prophet in his swirling linen robes followed by the heterogeneous crowd that was primarily com posed of poor folk but also could be seen to contain men of some distinction swept into capernaum the news spread that this man really could foretell the future that he had already predicted the arrest of john by herod antipas and soon after herod had imprisoned the baptist at peraea he did not make the predictions in general terms using vague words the way other prophets did he spoke of things that were to happen in the near future and he spoke of them in detail none knew his name he was simply the prophet from nazareth or the nazarene some said he was a relative perhaps the son ofa carpenter in nazareth but this could be because the written words for son of a carpenter and magus were almost the same and the confusion had come about in that way there was even a very faint rumor that his name was jesus the name had been used once or twice but when they asked him if that was indeed his name he denied it or else in his abstracted way refused to answer at all his actual preaching tended to lack the fire of johns this man spoke gently rather vaguely and smiled often he spoke of god in a strange way too and he appeared to be connected as john was with the essenes for he preached against the accumulation of personal wealth and spoke of mankind as a brotherhood as they did but it was the miracles that they watched for as he was guided to the graceful synagogue of capernaum no prophet before him had healed the sick and seemed to un derstand the troubles that people rarely spoke of it was his sympathy that they responded to rather than the words he spoke for the first time in his life karl glogauer had forgotten about karl glogauer for the first time in his life he was doing what he had always sought to do as a psychiatrist but it was not his life he was bringing a myth to life a generation before that myth would be born he was com pleting a certain kind of psychic circuit he was not chang ing history but he was giving history more substance he could not bear to think that jesus had been nothing more than a myth it was in his power to make jesus a physical reality rather than the creation of a process of mythogenesis so he spoke in the synagogues and he spoke of a gentler god than most of them had heard of and where he could remember them he told them parables and gradually the need to justify what he was doing faded and his sense of identity grew increasingly more ten uous and was replaced by a different sense of identity where he gave greater and greater substance to the role he had chosen it was an archetypal role it was a role to appeal to a disciple of jung it was a re that went beyond a mere imitation it was a role that he must now play out to the very last grand detail karl glogauer had dis covered the reality he had been seeking and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about mass hallucination miracles flying saucers ghosts its all the same monica had said very likely he had replied but why did they see them because they wanted to why did they want to because they were afraid you think thats all there is to it isnt it enough when he left capernaum for the first time many more people accompanied him it had become impractical to stay in the town for the business of the town had been brought almost to a standstill by the crowds that sought to see him work his simple miracles he spoke to them in the spaces beyond the towns he talked with intelligent literate men who appeared to have something in common with him some of them were the owners of fishing fleetssimon james and john among them another was a doctor another a civil servant who bad first heard him speak in capernaum there must be twelve he said to them one day there must be a zodiac he was not careful in what he said many of his ideas were strange many of the things he talked about were un familiar to them some pharisees thought he blasphemed one day he met a man he recognized as an essene from the colony near machaerus john would speak with you said the essene is john not dead yet he asked the man he is confined at peraea i would think herod is too frightened to kill him he lets john walk about within the walls and gardens of the palace lets him speak with his men but john fears that herod will find the courage soon to have him stoned or decapitated he needs your help how can i help him he is to die there is no hope for him the essene looked uncomprehendingly into the mad eyes of the prophet but master there is no one else who can help him i have done all that he wished me to do said the prophet i have healed the sick and preached to the poor i did not know he wished this now he needs help master you could save his life the prophet had drawn the essene away from the crowd his life cannot be saved but if it is not the unrighteous will prosper and the kingdom of heaven will not be restored his life cannot be saved is it gods will if i am god then it is gods will hopelessly the essene turned and began to walk away from the crowd john the baptist would have to die glogauer had no wish to change history only to strengthen it he moved on with his following through galilee he had selected his twelve educated men and the rest who followed him were still primarily poor people to them he offered their only hope of fortune many were those who had been ready to follow john against the romans but now john was imprisoned perhaps this man would lead them in revolt to loot the riches of jerusalem and jericho and caesarea tired and hungry their eyes glazed by the burning sun they followed the man in the white robe they needed to hope and they found reasons for their hope they saw him work greater miracles once he preached to them from a boat as was often his custom and as he walked back to the shore through the shallows it seemed to them that he walked over the water all through galilee in the autumn they wandered hear ing from everyone the news of johns beheading despair at the baptists death turned to renewed hope in this new prophet who had known him in caesarea they were driven from the city by roman guards used to the wildmen with their prophecies who roamed the country they were banned from other cities as the prophets fame grew not only the roman authorities but the jewish ones as well seemed unwilling to tolerate the new prophet as they had tolerated john the political climate was chang ing it became hard to find food they lived on what they could find hiingerfng like starved animals he taught them how to pretend to eat and take their minds off their hunger karl glogauer witchdoctor psychiatrist hypnotist mes siah sometimes his conviction in his chosen re wavered and those that followed him would be disturbed when he con tradicted himself often now they called him the name they had heard jesus the nazarene most of the time he did not stop them from using the name but at others he became angry and cried a peculiar guttural name karl glogaueri karl glogauer and they said behold he speaks with the voice of adonai call me not by that name he would shout and they would become disturbed and leave him by himself until his anger had subsided when the weather changed and the winter came they went back to capernaum which had become a stronghold of his followers in capernaum he waited the winter through making prophecies many of these prophecies concerned himself and the fate of those that followed him then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day they were watching television at her flat monica was eating an apple it was between six and seven on a warm sunday evening monica gestured at the screen with her halfeaten apple look at that nonsense she said you cant honestly tell me it means anything to you the program was a religious one about a popopera in a hampstead church the opera told the story of the cruci fixion popgroups in the pulpit she said what a comedown he didnt reply the program seemed obscene to him in an obscure way he couldnt argue with her gods corpse is really beginning to rot now she jeered whew the stinki turn it off then he said quietly whats the popgroup called the maggots very funny ill turn it off shall i no i want to watch its funny oh turn it off imitation of christ she snorted its a bloody carica ture a negro singer who was playing christ and singing flat to a banal accompaniment began to drone out lifeless lyrics about the brotherhood of man if he sounded like that no wonder they nailed him up said monica he reached forward and switched the picture off i was enjoying it she spoke with mock disappointment it was a lovely swansong later she said with a trace of affection that worried him you old fogey what a pity you could have been john wesley or calvin or someone you cant be a messiah these days not in your terms theres nobody to listen vi the prophet was living in the house of a man called simon though the prophet preferred to call him peter simon was grateful to the prophet because he had cured his wife of a complaint which she had suffered from for some time it had been a mysterious complaint but the prophet had cured her almost effortlessly there were a great many strangers in capernaum at that time many of them coming to see the prophet simon warned the prophet that some were known agents of the romans or the pharisees the pharisees had not on the whole been antipathetic towards the prophet though they distrusted the talk of miracles that they heard however the whole political atmosphere was disturbed and the roman oc cupation troops from pilate through his officers down to the troops were tease expecting an outbreak but unable to see any tangible signs that one was coming pilate himself hoped for trouble on a large scale it would prove to tiberius that the emperor had been too lenient with the jews over the matter of the votive shields pilate would be vindicated and his power over the jews increased at present he was on bad terms with all the tetrarchs of the provincesparticularly the unstable herod antipas who had seemed at one time his only supporter aside from the political situation his own domestic situation was upset in that his neurotic wife was having her nightmares again and was demanding far more attention from him than he could afford to give her there might be a possibility he thought of provoking an incident but he would have to be careful that tiberius never learnt of it this new prophet might provide a focus but so far the man had done nothing against the laws of either the jews or the romans there was no law that forbade a man to claim he was a messiah as some said this one had done and he was hardly inciting the people to revoltrather the contrary looking through the window of his chamber with a view of the minarets and spires of jerusalem pilate considered the information his spies had brought him soon after the festival that the romans called saturnalia the prophet and his followers left capernaum again and be gan to travel through the country there were fewer miracles now that the hot weather had passed but his prophecies were eagerly asked he warned them of all the mistakes that would be made in the future and of all the crimes that would be committed in his name through galilee he wandered and through samaria fol lowing the good roman roads towards jerusalem the time of the passover was coming close now in jerusalem the roman officials discussed the coming festival it was always a time of the worst disturbances there had been riots before during the feast of the pass over and doubtless there would be trouble of some kind this year too pilate spoke to the pharisees asking for their cooperation the pharisees said they would do what they could but they could not help it if the people acted foolishly scowling pilate dismissed them his agents brought him reports from all over the territory some of the reports mentioned the new prophet but said that he was harmless pilate thought privately that he might be harmless now but if he reached jerusalem during the passover he might not be so harmless two weeks before the feast of the passover the prophet reached the town of bethany near jerusalem some of his galilean followers had friends in bethany and these friends were more than willing to shelter the man they bad heard of from other pilgrims on their way to jerusalem and the great temple the reason they had come to bethany was that the prophet had become disturbed at the number of the people following him there are too many he had said to simon too many peter glogauers face was haggard now his eyes were set deeper into their sockets and he said little sometimes he would look around him vaguely as if unsure where he was news came to the house in bethany that roman agents had been making inquiries about him it did not seem to disturb him on the contrary he nodded thoughtfully as if satisfied once he walked with two of his followers across country to look at jerusalem the bright yellow walls of the city looked splendid in the afternoon light the towers and tall buildings many of them decorated in mosaic reds blues and yellows could be seen from several miles away the prophet turned back towards bethany when shall we go into jerusalem one of his followers asked him not yet said glogauer his shoulders were hunched and he grasped his chest with his arms and hands as if cold two days before the feast of the passover in jerusalem the prophet took his men towards the mount of olives and a suburb of jerusalem that was built on its side and called bethphage get me a donkey he told them a colt i must fulfill the prophecy now then all will know you are the messiah said andrew yes glogauer sighed he felt afraid again but this time it was not physical fear it was the fear of anactor who was about to make his final most dramatic scene and who was not sure he could do it well there was cold sweat on glogauers upper lip he wiped it off in the poor light he peered at the men around him he was still uncertain of some of their names he was not in terested in their names particularly only in their number there were ten here the other two were looldng for the donkey they stood on the grassy slope of the mount of olives looking towards jerusalem and the great temple which lay below there was a light warm breeze blowing judas said glogauer inquiringly there was one called judas yes master he said he was tall and good looking with curly red hair and neurotic intelligent eyes glogauer be lieved he was an epileptic glogauer looked thoughtfully at judas iscariot i will want you to help me later be said when we have entered jerusalem how master you must take a message to the romans the romans iscariot looked troubled why it must be the romans it cant be the jewsthey would use a stake or an axe ill tell you more when the time comes the sky was dark now and the stars were out over the mount of olives it had become cold glogauer shivered rejoice greatly daughter of zion shout daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass oshana oshana oshcna as glogauer rode the donkey into the city his followers ran ahead throwing down palm branches on both sides of the street were crowds forewarned by the followers of his coming now the new prophet could be seen to be fulfilling the prophecies of the ancient prophets and many believed that he had come to lead them against the romans even now possibly he was on his way to pilates house to confront the procurator oshana oshana glogauer looked around distractedly the back of the don key though softened by the coats of his followers was un comfortable he swayed and clung to the beasts mane he heard the words but could not make them out clearly oshana oshana it sounded like hosanna at first before he realized that they were shouting the aramaic for free us free us free usi john had planned to rise in arms against the romans this passover many had expected to take part in the rebellion they believed that he was taking johns place as a rebel leader no he muttered at them as he looked around at their expectant faces no i am the messiah i cannot free you i cant they did not hear him above their own shouts karl glogauer entered christ christ entered jerusalem the story was approaching its climax oshanal it was not in the story he could not help them verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly judas iscariot frowned with some uncertainty as he left the room and went out into the crowded street making his way towards the governors palace doubtless he was to per form a part in a plan to deceive the romans and have the people rise up in jesus defense but he thought the scheme foolhardy the mood amongst the jostling men women and children in the streets was tense many more roman soldiers than usual patrolled the city pilate was a stout man his face was selfindulgent and his eyes were hard and shallow he looked disdainfully at the jew we do not pay informers whose information is proved to be false be warned i do not seek money lord said judas feigning the ingratiating manner that the romans seemed to expect of the jews i am a loyal subject of the emperor who is this rebel jesus of nazareth lord he entered the city today i know i saw him but i heard he preached of peace and obeying the law to deceive you lord pilate frowned it was likely it smacked of the kind of deceit he had grown to anticipate in these softspoken people have you proof i am one of his lieutenants lord i will testify to his guilt pilate pursed his heavy lips he could not afford to offend the pharisees at this moment they had given him enough trouble caiaphas in particular would be quick to cry in justice if he arrested the man he claims to be the rightful king of the jews the descen dant of david said judas repeating what his master had told him to say does he pilate looked thoughtfully out of the window as for the pharisees lord what of them the pharisees distrust him they would see him dead he speaks against them pilate nodded his eyes were hooded as he considered this information the pharisees might hate the madman but they would be quick to make political capital out of his arrest the pharisees want him arrested judas continued the people flock to listen to the prophet and today many of them rioted in the temple in his name is this true it is true lord it was true some halfadozen people had attacked the moneychangers in the temple and tried to rob them when they had been arrested they had said they had been carrying out the will of the nazarene i cannot make the arrest pilate said musingly the sit uation in jerusalem was already dangerous but if they were to arrest this king they might find that they precipitated a revolt tiberius would blame him not the jews the pharisees must be won over they must make the arrest wait here he said to judas i will send a message to caiaphas and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray and he taketh with him peter and james and john and be gan to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch glogauer could see the mob approaching now for the firsttime since nazareth he felt physically weak and ex hausted tfiev were going to kill him he had to die he ac cepted that buil he was afraid of the pain that was to come he sat down oothe ground of the hillside watching the torches as they came closer the ideal of martyrdom only ever existed in the minds of a few ascetics monica had said otherwise it was morbid masochism an easy way to forgo ordinary responsibility a method of keeping repressed people under control it isnt as simple as that it is kari he could show monica now his regret was that she was unlikely ever to know he had meant to write everything down and put it into the time machine and hope that it would be recovered it was strange he was not a religious man in the usual sense he was an agnostic it was not con viction that had led him to defend religion against monicas cynical contempt for it it was rather lack of conviction in the ideal in which she had set her own faith the ideal of science as a solver of all problems he could not share her faith and there was nothing else but religion though he could not believe in the kind of god of christianity the god seen as a mystical force of the mysteries of christianity and other great religions had not been personal enough for him his rational mind had told him that god did not exist in any personal form his unconscious had told him that faith in science was not enough science is basically opposed to religion monica had once said harshly no matter how many jesuits get together and rationalize their views of science the fact remains that religion cannot accept the fundamental attitudes of science and it is implicit to science to attack the fundamental princi ples of religion the only area in which there is no difference and need be no war is in the ultimate assumption one may or may not assume there is a supernatural being called god but as soon as one begins to defend ones assumption there must be strife youre talking about organized religion im talking about religion as opposed to a belief who needs the ritual of religion when we have the far superior ritual of science to replace it religion is a reasonable sub stitute for knowledge but there is no longer any need for substitutes karl science offers a sounder basis on whjchto formulate systems of thought and ethics we dont need the carrot of heaven and the big stick of hell any more when science can show the consequences of actions and men can judge easily for themselves whether those actions are right or wrong i cant accept it thats because youre sick im sick too but at least i can see the promise of health i can only see the threat of death as they had agreed judas kissed him on the cheek and the mixed force of temple guards and roman soldiers sur rounded him to the romans he said with some difficulty i am the king of the jews to the pharisees servants be said i am the messiah who has come to destroy your masters now he was committed and the final ritual was to begin it was an untidy trial an arbitrary mixture of roman and jewish law which did not altogether satisfy anyone the ob ject was accomplished after several conferences between pontius pilate and caiaphas and three attempts to bend and merge their separate legal systems in order to fit the ex pediencies of the situation both needed a scapegoat for their different purposes and so at last the result was achieved and the madman convicted on the one hand of rebellion against rome and on the other of heresy a peculiar feature of the trial was that the witnesses were all followers of the man and yet had seemed eager to see him convicted the pharisees agreed that the roman method of execu tion would fit the time and the situation best in this case and it was decided to crucify him the man had prestige however so that it would be necessary to use some of the tried roman methods of humiliation in order to make him into a pathetic and ludicrous figure in the eyes of the pil grims pilate assured the pharisees that he would see to it but he made sure that they signed documents that gave their approval to his actions and the soldiers led him away into the hall called prae torium analheycall together the whole band and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head and began to salute him hail king of the jews and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him his brain was clouded now by pain and by the ritual of humiliation by his having completely given himself up to his re he was too weak to bear the heavy wooden cross and he walked behind it as it was dragged towards golgotha by a cyrenian whom the romans had pressgauged for the pur pose as he staggered through the crowded silent streets watched by those who had thought he would lead them against the roman overlords his eyes filled with tears so that his sight was blurred and he occasionally staggered off the road and was nudged back onto it by one of the roman guards you are too emotional karl why dont you use that brain of yours and pull yourself together he remembered the words but it was difficult to remem ber who had said them or who karl was the road that led up the side of the hill was stony and he slipped sometimes remembering another hill he had climbed long ago it seemed to him that he had been a child but the memory merged with others and it was impossible to tell he was breathing heavily and with some difficulty the pain of the thorns in his head was barely felt but his whole body seemed to throb in unison with his heartbeat it was like a drum it was evening the sun was setting he fell on his face cutting his head on a sharp stone just as he reached the top of the hill he fainted and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull and they gave him to drinkwine mingled with myrrh but he received it not he knocked the cup aside the soldier shrugged and reached out for one of his arms another soldier already held the other arm as he recovered consciousness glogauer began to tremble violently he felt the pain intensely as the ropes bit into the flesh of his wrists and anides he struggled he felt something cold placed against his palm although it only covered a small area in the center of his hand it seemed very heavy he heard a sound that also was in rhythm with his heartbeats he turned his head to look at the hand the large iron peg was being driven into his hand by a soldier swinging a mallet as he lay on the cross which was at this moment horizontal on the ground he watched wonder ing why there was no pain the soldier swung the mallet higher as the peg met the resistance of the wood twice he missed the peg and struck glogauers fingers glogauer looked to the other side and saw that the second soldier was also hammering in a peg evidently he missed the peg a great many times because the fingers of the hand were bloody and crushed the first soldier finished hammering in his peg and tamed his attention to the feet glogauer felt the iron slide through his flesh heard it hammered home using a pulley they began to haul the cross into a verti cal position glogauer noticed that he was alone there were no others being crucified that day he got a clear view of the lights of jerusalem below him there was still a little light in the sky but not much soon it would be completely dark there was a small crowd look ing on one of the women reminded him of monica he called to her monica but his voice was cracked and the word was a whisper the woman did not look up he felt his body dragging at the nails which supported it he thought he felt a twinge of pain in his left hand he seemed to be bleeding very heavily it was odd he reflected that it should be him hanging here he supposed that it was the event he had originally to witness there was little doubt really everything had gone perfectly the pain in his left hand increased he glanced down at the roman guards who were playing dice at the foot of his cross they seemed absorbed in their game he could not see the markings of the dice from this distance he sighed the movement of his chest seemed to throw extra strain on his hands the pain was quite bad now he winced and tried somehow to ease himself back against the wood the pain began to spread through his body he gritted his teeth it was dreadful he gasped and shouted he writhed there was no longer any light in the sky heavy clouds obscured stars and moon from below came whispered voices let me down he called oh please let me down the pain filled him he slumped forward but nobody released him a little while later he raised his head the movement caused a return of the agony and again he began to writhe on the cross let me down please please stop it every part of his flesh every muscle and tendon and bone of him was filled with an almost impossible degree of pain he knew he would not survive until the next day as he had thought he might he had not realized the extent of his pain and at the ninth hour lesus cried with a loud voice say ing eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being inter preted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me glogauer coughed it was a dry barely heard sound the soldiers below the cross heard it because the night was now so quiet its funny one said yesterday they were worshiping him today they seemed to want us to kill himeven the ones who were closest to him ill be glad when we get out of this country said an other he heard monicas voice again its weakness and fear karl thats driven you to this martyrdom is a conceit cant you see that weakness and fear he coughed once more and the pain returned but it was duller now just before he died he began to talk again muttering the words until his breath was gotie its a lie its a lie its a lie later after his body was stolen by the servants of some doctors who believed it to have special properties there were rumors that he had not died but the corpse was already rotting in the doctors dissecting rooms and would soon be destroyed
