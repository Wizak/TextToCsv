 summoned late at night to the bureau quiller attends a secret conference with the foreign secretary and a surprise defector the chinese ambassador to britain minutes later the ambassador is dead so begins bamboo a mission that takes quiller from london to calcutta to hong kong and finally to the roof of the world to tibet where he must take on the chinese secret police and the peoples army in an effort to save the notorious dissident dr xingyu for the first time in his career quiller feels himself personally engaged in a mission for the aim of bamboo is to avenge the tragic bloodshed of tiananmen square and help the people of china to achieve the freedom and democracy they crave adam hall quiller bamboo hyde it was am when the telephone woke me and i rolled over and answered it and tilson said they wanted me there right away and i told him no it was too soon the line went silent and then tilson came back on again i suppose hed turned away to talk to someone fully urgent he said the raw chill of a november fog came drifting through the open window and i could hear a taxi throttling up along knightsbridge in the distance ive only been back ten days i said tilsons not often starchy but he said i think you know what fully urgent means and rang off so i got up and spent five minutes in the bathroom and went down to the car with my teeth clean but the stubble still there and brought the aston up to a steady fifty along piccadilly and went through the red when there was nothing coming and picked up a panda near the ritz he closed in and got his lights flashing but i didnt take any notice and he dropped back as he got the call from the dispatcher tilson had covered me as i knew he would because fully urgent means that everyones got to move the panda took up escort station behind me as far as whitehall and then peeled off when i got to the building and saw holmes manning the door mr hydes office he said and got me into the lift whats it about not absolutely sure he wants you at the foreign office so what am i doing here briefing clearance ive only just got back i told tilson now you can tell mr hyde we got out of the lift and went along the corridor with holmes looking quiet and nervy so i didnt ask him anything else there were a lot of phones ringing behind the closed doors and diane came out of signals and darted into codes and cyphers with some papers in her hand dropping a sheet and picking it up and not even seeing us as she went in there someone else came out of the signals room and i heard a lot of beeping going on more than usual at this time of night holmes turned his head how much sleep have you had few hours look in on me later if you want to ive got to put a fire out in here he went into signals and i kept on going not strictly a fire someone had come unstuck in the field beirut sri lanka bogota you name it and he was lighting up his mission board for help tilson was alone in hydes office talking on one of the phones by the look of him theyd dragged him out of bed too i felt the adrenaline flushing the skin because i hadnt seen this kind of panic at the bureau for months but i was not going out again after only ten days and they couldnt insist tilson nodded for me to have a chair but i stayed on my feet and went across to the window and looked at the street three stories below deserted in the lamplight i dont know tilson said on the phone its only just come up quillers here now you should know better tell mr shepley i looked up at the reflection of tilsons bland lopsided face in the window in this place shepley was another name for god do you want him briefed and cleared first or is he to go along to the fo right away i didnt really mind what the answer was since i was going back to bed in any case i was technically at rest which meant id got another twentyone days before they could sign me up again and send me out and i was going to spend at least a week at norfolk wallowing in the luxury of sauna baths and swedish massage and meditation to bring the nerves down to their normal pitch plus a bit of refresher training with kimurasensei in the dojo and some close combat work to get the reflexes back in tune theyre holding a board open tilson said on the phone and theyve brought dawson in from paris he knows the kind of signals were liable to get from hong kong no way not hong kong norfolk there was a drunk down there in the street tottering with tremendous care along the pavement holding on to the railings for a bit and then shoving off again tilson cupped the phone and said are you still under any kind of treatment yes what for shark bite whats your condition look i said weve got to talk tilson took his hand away from the mouthpiece yes but ill tell him the situation or leave it to mr hyde the drunk was on a course fortyfive degrees in error and when his foot slipped off the curb he went down like a felled tree and lay with his head in the gutter no tilson said it began as a simple request for asylum i went across to the desk and picked up one of the other phones and pressed and got the dial tone and pressed and told them someone looked in at the door and tilson shook his head and they went out again i dont frankly know we got it from mi they said they dont want to touch it its too far away i said into the phone to see if hes bleeding but hes going to get his head run over if he stays where he is another phone started ringing and tilson picked it up hes not here fifty yards north of the cenotaph i said well let me deal with whats going on at this end and then ill get back to you or someone will tilson put the phone down a minute ago i said my pleasure whos that tilson asked me drunk down there just reporting it his eyes took on a stare down where the thing is i told him i got back precisely ten days ago and my nerves feel like barbed wire and the dressings are still being changed every day shall i spell that tilson leaned back in the chair and leveled his eyes i quite understand but you dont even want to know the score and he waited in a minute i said you really are a bastard we could hear a siren cut in and die away again as a police car came around parliament square into whitehall heading for the cenotaph i cant tell you much tilson said because they slapped a yourearsonly on this thing the minute it started coming in but youre not the only one they got out of bed and mr shepley himself has been alerted so its just conceivable that if theyre going to pick you as the shadow executive you wont let the odd shark bite get in the way its the nerves i said more than that in an ideal world you could come off a mission and get a few nights sleep and drink lots of sanatogen and see deirdre or someone and report back for work but the caribbean thing had been very busy and the whole organism still felt tender its hong kong is it that area whos available for the dip if they could give me a really firstclass director in the field it could make a difference id have to check on that but if you he broke off as the door opened again and hyde came in did they alert mr shepley yes sir is he on his way he just said hed monitor his phone all right hyde gave me a nod and stood for a minute looking around him at nothing at all his large head tilted back and his tongue poking at his cheek his big hands hanging by his sides and his feet splayed a little to support his weight he didnt react when a phone rang and tilson took it and told them he wanted priority calls only from now on and put the receiver back hyde was in a dinner jacket i suppose theyd beeped him at a nightclub or somewhere he went on looking around him while he thought things over then he brought his head down and told tilson this is where the focus is until we can open up the board in there can you handle it tilson said yes and hyde turned to look at me youre resting they said technically technically what kind of shape are you in not bad not good it depends on what id have to do he left a dead stare on me miles away and then his eyes focused again all i know he said slowly or all i can tell you at this stage because theres a blackout on is that its far east and im running it and i want you in the field there were beads of sweat on his forehead where the hair had thinned back they always turned up the heating in this bloody place in the wintertime but it wasnt that this thing had obviously been dropped into hydes lap without any warning and he was trying to size it up as far as i know he said you wouldnt be going into anything terribly active in the opening phase but his huge shoulders in a shrug nothings ever predictable i want you for this one very much but i do not want you to go into the field if you dont feel ready for it i thought about it because if i made a mistake at this stage it could be disastrous ill have to know a bit more then i can made a decision isnt there anyone else available its not quite that you see theres no one else in my opinion who could do this one better than you and you know the territory i believe some of it ive been to tilson hyde said for gods sake tell them to turn the thermostats down to something reasonable say seventy he swung his head back to me sorry youve been to bangkok singapore hong kong thailand but thats all not beijing no seventy tilson was saying on the phone do you have any chinese no his head tilted back again like a wellbalanced boulder and he stared at the ceiling for a bit mr hydes personal request hed never run me hyde but i knew that people liked him as a control hed run fielding in malaya and parkes in hungary and they both said he was good knew his signals and support sources better than anyone and knew how to keep things going when there didnt seem to be a hope in hell of completing the mission and hed brought that bloody idiot bates back alive across the border near chernovtsy into romania after hed botched his signals and blown his escape route we tend to appreciate a control like that you are still the one i want he said as his head came down again to look at me whether you have chinese or not it wont i think be crucial to tilson are they going to do it yes sir like a turkish bath in here get holmes on the line for me will you hes in signals i said get him in signals for me then and ask him where the hell they are and why they havent kept me informed those people those people yourearsonly there are only two others available for this one hyde told me and i dont much care for either of them i want someone i can rely on when it comes to the crunch not he said with his stare fixing me that you yourself are all that angelic to deal with by repute i dont suffer fools gladly you have a tendency to bitch about accepting a new mission so they say but you seem to be in a fairly reasonable state of mind at the moment considering youre meant to be at rest i suppose that was true and it surprised me a bit because theyd dragged me out of bed and they didnt think a shark bite was any more interesting than a chilblain and here was a top control trying to con me into the field theres no one else in my opinion who could do this one better than you so forth and the whole thing was a wonderful excuse for me to kick the door down and bite the rug and threaten all manner of mayhem but i wasnt doing that i suppose it was the mothandtheflame thing im meant to be at rest yes but on the other hand tilson said it was fully urgent and the signals room sounded like an electric organ when i passed it just now and its got me interested i was the moth in a moment he said slowly this mission has shall we say potentially major dimensions and that was the flame sticks out a mile i said i was unaware of the pulse in the carotid sinus and that was normal at a time like this but the psyche is more subtle than the cardiovascular system and i didnt know whether the elevated pulse was because of excitement or fear holmes tilson said has asked the switchboard to put their call through to his own office to yours and to mr croder in signals hyde prodded his tongue into his cheek and in a moment said and mr shepley is monitoring yes sir very well i think he said turning to me again im going to do something rather nasty i cant you see tell you anything useful about this one until and unless you have agreed to do it watching me carefully oh for christs sake you want me to go in blind dipping his head not quite to go in under whatever conditions you care to name provided of course i can meet them the pulse went up again by a few more beats and the bloodstream became palpable like a quiet fire coursing through the veins not unpleasant not much more than an hour ago id been asleep in bed the sores and the specters of the last mission still lingering but not offering any threat id been safe and now i was standing in this room with the choice of going or being safe for a little time longer at least a few weeks or letting these people pitch me headlong into the field again of signing that form the nextofkin thing without even knowing what i was taking on i could tell the difference now between excitement and fear i was afraid but there burned the flame bright and beckoning there are various forms as im sure you know of madness but there was still a chance conditions hyde had said you would be my control at the board yes his bright stare rested on me no support in the field unless i ask for it we can do that in terms of my being expendable i said and stopped right there id tried this once with shepley and hed refused its something you dont have to sign your name to but its implicit in your general terms of service if youre out there in a red sector and youre blown and theres nothing you can do london will try to get you out but if it hasnt got the manpower or the firepower or it cant raise support or send specialists in or if theres a risk to the bureau to the mission then theyll leave you there crouched against a wall or sprawled on a rooftop right in the line of fire or trapped in a building with every door covered wherever you are they will leave you there and all you owe them if theres time to pay is to pop the capsule and protect the sacred bull the bureau and go in silence and in peace in terms of our being expendable there is nothing we can ask so i told hyde ignore that ignored conditions i pick my own dip there arent very many he said available ferris we sent him out to tehran hyde said straight from your debriefing on barracuda something major we wouldnt send ferris out to wash the dishes perhaps he thought it sounded discourteous so he said we reserve people like ferris for people like you fane a flash of surprise came into the stare fane had betrayed me once but id had the edge and id survived and he was no longer a danger youre perfectly safe with someone you know you cant trust fane is down with the flu hyde said pepperidge is available yes i looked at tilson is he in london then ill take him if hes willing hes fluent in chinese and the dialects very well do we need to get him here tonight no we needed you here because you are the key if you so choose if we cant get pepperidge who else is available no one tilson said from across the desk at your level hyde if necessary mr croder would direct you in the field croder he was chief of signals i was beginning to feel the size of this thing one of the phones rang and tilson took it and said all right and rang off and looked up at hyde theyre on their way over there now hyde angled his watch to the light very well he turned to me again have you any further conditions silence in the room we can always refuse a mission it can be in a locale too far away for our liking or too hot too cold too hostile too dangerous or we can simply be too tired too exhausted after the last time out or we can feel the tug of intuition not to take it this one not to risk it we grow old in this trade before our time we grow canny cunning cynical steeped in subterfuge versed in stealth we grow obstinate difficult we grow intractable and we grow afraid their eyes on me tilsons hydes in the lamplight in the silence of the room no i said there are no further conditions hyde broke his stare you accept the mission yes then we must be going he said were to meet these people at the foreign office as soon as we can get there did you come in your car yes will you take me there of course taxis are so laggardly tilson will you set everything up ill brief quiller as soon as were back then you can put him through clearance on our way down whitehall in the car hyde sat with his bulk hunched against the passenger door watching the road and sometimes watching me as he talked go right here i turned into victoria street keep going he said not the foreign office we just said the foreign office but actually no too many moles this matter you see is rather important and we dont want people listening since you are now committed i can give you the whole thing in a nutshell if all goes to plan we should be able to overthrow the communist regime in beijing and establish a democratic government within a matter of days underground there was the smell of burned metal from the high voltage contacts and the black mouth of the tunnel was lit intermittently by the flash of a welders torch i suppose there was a night crew along there working on the rails here on the platform the scene was more formal most of the people were in dark overcoats and two of them had rolled umbrellas i was in a polo sweater and padded bomber jacket since theyd got me out of my flat in such a hurry there were some men hanging around the mouth of the tunnel and the archway to the escalators on our way down here hyde had told me the scene was protected by plainclothes police we mustnt be disturbed you see i suppose its odd hed said that in order to avoid any moles were going underground it looked as if we were the last to arrive and someone came forward to meet us this is mr jones hyde told him and the other man shook hands with me and said im barstow private secretary come and meet people another flash lit the tunnel and there was the crackle of the welding flame barstow took us over to the group and made the introductions his excellency qiao dejian ambassador from the peoples republic of china the right honourable james jarrow secretary of state for the united kingdom mr william glover mi mr hou jing chinese embassy counselor this is mr hyde and mr jones shall we go and sit down there was a holdup because the secretary of state wanted the chinese ambassador to go into the coach first and little qiao couldnt possibly allow it so barstow managed to shepherd them discreetly side by side through the sliding doors and the rest of us shuffled after them with hyde and me in the rear hydes official capacity hadnt been mentioned and mr jones is generally understood among the diplomatic crowd to be a cover name for some kind of agent there was another holdup inside the coach because ambassador qiao wouldnt sit down until the secretary had but jarrow finally took his seat halfway along the coach and everyone else followed suit and someone pulled the sliding doors together manually and took up guard duty on the platform outside i noticed that qiao was looking deathly tired and the secretary of state wasnt looking particularly tired but certainly tense the chinese counselor sat with a heavy black briefcase on his knees clutching it with gloved hands barstow our private secretary looked at his boss and jarrow nodded but then there was another holdup while ambassador qiao got a handkerchief out and blew his nose and asked us to excuse him because hed caught a cold his english was perfect i would have said cambridge the scene was a degree surrealistic and i think it put the chinese off being in a train underground instead of a nice formal office the hand straps hung down above our heads like tiny gibbets in a row and we could see our faces on his side reflected behind the people opposite under the dim ceiling lights the doors had been shut on us with a definitive thump and we looked as if wed been thrown together in purgatory without knowing where the train was going to take us to heaven or hell jarrow pulled out a gold cigarette case and asked if anybody minded and no one spoke so he lit up and barstow started talking so that we all know whats going on ill recap the main points for you he sat forward on the seat hands on his knees and feet together looking from one face to the next and giving each of us a precisely allotted share of his cool blue eyes ambassador qiao came to us two days ago and told us that after the democratic uprising in beijing of last week he feels he no longer wishes to represent the communist regime at present in power there his intention was to defect and he asked us for asylum his counselor mr hou jing has identical feelings we conferred with mi who agreed it would be far more useful for all concerned if the ambassador remained at his post and made himself available to us as a source of information qiao sat slumped on the seat but i didnt think he was going to doze off a lot of his fatigue must have been due to stress a couple of days ago hed been a bona fide ambassador and now he was in effect an intelligence agent working for the west he didnt look the type whod commit an act of betrayal too easily he and his counselor declared themselves willing to do this barstow said his eyes resting on mine and passing on to hydes the ambassador would probably like me to point out that in the present circumstances he regards his action as simply a shift of loyalties from the chinese government to the chinese people no one spoke though i thought we should have clapped or something jarrow flicked ash from his cigarette looking at nobody ambassador qiao the private secretary went on has conferred with the prime minister who is therefore acquainted with the situation and who has pledged her assistance in any way possible with the ambassadors proposals mr hyde and mr jones were called upon and have declared themselves ready to implement those proposals by whatever means are open to them i need hardly say gentlemen that the most extreme discretion must be used by all those present when we are no longer protected by the security measures we enjoy at the present time if those measures of course were adequate maybe i was paranoid but the fact remained that if this meeting had taken place a few years ago the foreign office could have been represented here by kim philby before ambassador qiao presents his ideas are there any questions whats going to be our timing hyde asked him how quickly have we got to move almost immediately as far as i can gather but well have a more precise idea from ambassador qiao it was getting stuffy in here and i took off my bomber jacket there was also a certain amount of heat generating from the nerves barstow had said wed have to move almost immediately and by tonight the bureau could have catapulted me straight into beijing and i didnt feel ready for that if there are no questions ill ask ambassador qiao to take over the chinese got out his handkerchief again and when hed finished he said with a note of apology i hope that the proposals im about to give you will offer a chance for my country to free itself of its present onerous regime and at the same time break down the barriers between china and the rest of the world but there are risks there are very grave risks he shifted to the edge of the seat and leaned his elbows on his knees his small pale hands hanging loose the light glinted across his glasses as he turned his head sometimes to look at us though mostly he looked down he didnt have the air of a renegade storming the barricades but that was obviously what he was going to do and as i watched his face hollowed by fatigue i felt something that doesnt often get through the scaly carapace of suspicion and distrust that forms around us in this dirty trade it was compassion in one sense qiao said the recent uprising is already causing more anguish than the one in june when the reaction by the government was confused and at first indecisive and when the ensuing bloodshed evoked at least the attention and the sympathy of the rest of the world his head was lowered now and there was an edge to his tone that cut through the silence when he spoke again this time there was immediate reaction by the government there was almost no media coverage of the event there was almost no bloodshed since the security forces were quick to move in and very little news has leaked out from beijing let me tell you gentlemen that this new uprising has in effect proved an infinitely greater tragedy than the last one since most of the participants were intellectuals of high standing with more chance and more hope than before of combating and ousting the government only to see that hope shattered within days and instead of visible bloodshed in the streets we have a secret and most sinister operation under way that is bringing the intellectual elite from their homes in the thick of the night torn from their families and thrown into the torture chambers and finally to the execution squads of this merciless regime and if you feel gentlemen that i am resorting to the idiom of cheap journalism his head swung up to look at us in order to get your sympathy it is not the case these people the most enlightened intellects behind science and industry and education are indeed being taken from their homes and tortured and finally shot to death as we sit here now my brother is one of them the silence hit us in the face and then i heard someone say oh jesus under his breath im sorry jarrow secretary of state but what is more important qiao said quickly is that whereas the uprising of slammed the door on our hopes of democracy in the peoples republic of china the recent flareup of dissension has locked and barred it and drawn chains across it that we shall not i think see broken in our lifetime he took his glasses off and wiped them and i noticed the edge of his eyelids glistening unless of course we can succeed in what i shall propose i had questions but couldnt ask them were these tears for his brother or for china how much had his personal tragedy pushed him into betrayal and defection into bringing us down here tonight to listen to him hyde would know he knew the whole thing hed probably been at the conference at no with qiao because the bureau is responsible directly to the prime minister hed known enough at least to set up the mission and select me for the field and get me down here tonight privy to information that would rock beijing if it got out i need hardly say gentlemen that the most extreme discretion must be used by all those present yes indeed qiao was using his handkerchief again i didnt think it was really a cold it was because of the cable hed had the signal to the embassy in portland place regret to inform your excellency that your brother has been arrested and his whereabouts are not at present known or words to that effect it could have been only hours ago when hed heard it perhaps even less there is one man he said who has so far escaped the firing squad his name is dr xingyu baibing our most renowned astrophysicist and the most popular intellectual in the country since his outspoken criticism of the present regime has brought it home to the people and especially to his fellow intellectuals that oppression by the ruling clique and corruption within it do not necessarily have to be endured for all time this man became a popular figure in when he was ousted from the communist party for making speeches on behalf of democracy and inciting student rebellion his standing with both the chinese intellectuals and the people in the street is comparable with that of lech walesa in poland today dr xingyu has been branded by the communists as a traitor and i quote among the scum of the nation he is accused of committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation and his immediate arrest has been ordered the young counselor sitting next to him unzipped the heavy briefcase and brought out some papers but qiao motioned them away the night before last dr xingyu sought refuge inside the british embassy in beijing and he is there now as a guest of the british government and under its protection reflected in the windows opposite i saw hyde turn his head to look at me i didnt look back i watched qiao in his last few words hed focused the whole thing for us like a zoom lens moving in we should not of course expect that the communists in beijing will necessarily respect international laws designed to protect foreign embassies we should remember the sacking of the us embassy in tehran and the torching of the british embassy in beijing itself by maos red guards the safety of dr xingyu cannot be guaranteed since it is in inverse proportion to his importance to the democracy movement he endangers the regime by his very existence and the british government is under great pressure by the chinese as you can imagine to turn its guest out of the embassy into the hands of the militia now waiting outside the gates he glanced across at jarrow the secretary of state that yes is the position jarrow said her majestys government is of course resisting the belligerent demands of the chinese and will continue to do so he looked as weary as qiao and his counselor or maybe it was the dim yellowish lighting but for the last two nights he would have been in late and exhaustive sessions with thatcher and her advisers i should tell you however that we are working out a plan on the highest diplomatic levels to obtain an undertaking from the chinese that if we were to release dr xingyu from our embassy thats not quite the word of course since hes a guest and not a prisoner if dr xingyu were to leave the embassy at his own request he would be allowed free passage to the airport he passed a hand over his eyes squeezing them shut for a moment the exchange has been going on pretty intensely of course and the good ambassador and i have not had too much sleep nor indeed has the prime minister on the one hand my government is trying to persuade the chinese that since we intend to continue our hospitality to dr xingyu for as long as he wishes for years if it comes to that it might be better for them to throw him out of the country and into exile where he couldnt do much harm on the other hand theyre very keen to get him under their control and brainwash him and push him in front of the television cameras to confess his sins and declare himself reformed putting him through politically speaking a frontal lobotomy and rendering him harmless to the regime from our side we are of course offering certain trade concessions to give our argument a little weight look he said to barstow do you think those chaps outside could rustle up some tea that was am it had got smoky in here by now and the mi man had gone along the coach pulling the little windows open most of us had got through our first cup of tea and were on the second one the police outside had brought a whole urn piping hot with a boxful of plastic cups the chinese ambassador was talking about the peoples liberation army there is a schism in the military that reflects the political scheme in beijing there are bones of contention among the commanders and their troops as you know some of the armies surrounding the capital in showed sympathy for the students in tiananmen square and many officers were shot for refusing to fire on the people at least fifteen generals are still in prison awaiting courtmartial in the uprising of last week there was as you know no military action called upon though a readiness alert went out to all commanders in the vicinity of beijing while the old guard is still loyal to the communist party the young and educated officers now rising from the ranks are impatient for reforms that would turn the pla into a modern more professional military machine with new weapons and new technologies that the united states and other western countries would be prepared to offer them once a democratic government was in power light flashed from the tunnel as the welder used his jets the plainclothes police on the platform stood at ease with their hands behind them not moving about very much smoke curled from jarrows cigarette fanning out under the ceiling lamps the mi man got himself another cup of tea from the urn and went back to his seat i didnt think it was likely that anything that could be said in the stale confines of this railway coach buried deep underground in london could have the power to change the lives of a billion people on the far side of the planet dead wrong i will put it simply for you ambassador qiao said despite the present unrest among the peoples liberation army and despite the growing sympathy of many of its generals for the intellectuals in their underground fight for democracy i do not believe that any spontaneous military action could be expected in defiance of the government in beijing we cannot hope for armed support for any future uprising based solely on the sympathy of certain generals but i do believe that given new inspiration given a leader who could offer himself to the people and lend them his power as a figurehead we could indeed incite the armed counterrevolution that is needed to bring down the communist regime he paused i think to make sure he was getting our attention dr xingyu baibing could give us that power if he could leave your embassy unmolested by the security forces i saw hyde turn his head slightly toward me again reflected in the window objective for the mission yes xingyu i should tell you gentlemen qiao said that my decision to defect was not an impulse i became disgusted in june when the ghost of mao rose and brought brutality and bloodshed back into the streets since then i have made it my business to establish contacts and relationships in beijing that would be called treasonable and for which i should be shot among those contacts is a certain general of the peoples liberation army he is now prepared and waiting with his armored division to support the armed rebellion that could be effected under the leadership of dr xingyu who is also waiting for the freedom in which to act he got out his handkerchief again this time to wipe his face he was talking about inciting a coup that could bring his country out of stagnation and despair and into the light of freedom and its fruits world acceptance world trade and an honorable place in the community of nations and on a personal level perhaps he was talking of the hope that there would be time to save his brother after all he said in mock innocence we shall only be following the wisdom of the late chairman mao himself who said that power lies in the mouth of a gun if you gentlemen can vouchsafe the freedom of dr xingyu baibing we shall have that gun in our hands qiao left ahead of us his counselor with him clutching his big briefcase hyde and i stopped for a few minutes to talk to the mi man then we took the elevator to street level and walked into the open air and the wail of police sirens and stood there with the flash of the colored lights in our eyes and our breath clouding in the chill of the morning as we looked down at the little chinese ambassador spreadeagled on the pavement with his glasses smashed and his blood trickling across the edge of the curb pepperidge she was very thin and fadedlooking still pretty though perhaps had been stunning once with her large eyes and her cheekbones she sat decoratively on the worn settee her thin legs trying i believed to cover the patch of cretonne where the cat had sharpened its claws where perhaps it always did she looked a catlover a quiet woman half in hiding would you like some tea no i said thank you i havent much time half in hiding from life or from death hoping it wouldnt find her theyd told me it was cancer he wont be long now she said supposing i go and meet him you could try but i dont know whether hes gone to the grocers or the post office and theyre in different directions she smiled ruefully at the contrariness of life i see the cat was on a windowsill by a pot of geraniums its fur mangy their leaves yellowed it spreads everywhere if you let it through the body and into the house through the house its so cold she said in her pretty voice so early this year isnt it yes we could get a white christmas though there must be a kind of terrible relief i thought in actually knowing you didnt have long in knowing that it wasnt worth the effort of trying to fight it off in having time to get ready and tidy all the drawers instead of taking your fear with you to a rendezvous with potential death as i did time after time carrying it for years like putrefying baggage last year didnt we i said we had a little snow last year didnt we for christmas yes thats right i said i remember what would her brother give her for christmas a posy for her grave we tend as im sure youve noticed to be a trifle morbid when were waiting to go out whats she called your cat smoky its actually a he another little smile hes very handsome i said i like cats myself i always think of them as female i suppose because of their grace and their mysteriousness if you havent got long she said you could go and stand outside to watch for him then you could go and meet him all right but he was coming down the narrow little path between the patches of brownish grass when i went out there hello he said you were quicker than id bargained for id phoned him from the bureau i had to get some things for gladys thats all right i took one of the brown paper bags and we went back into the house pepperidge had only directed me once in the field in singapore hed conned me into it at the brass lamp making me think he was a burnedoutspook too far gone to take it on himself hed been very good before that as a shadow firstclass at covert infiltration knew how to kill with discretion when it was necessary then hed come in and managed the asian desk for a while hed been a good dip retting me through the singapore thing without any fuss and doing most of it from london through the signals mast at cheltenham before hed come out to the field and brought that bastard loman with him but loman had done well too handled me well give him his dine how are things going i asked pepperidge oh he said cheerfully we soldier on you know did they tell you about her then yes he nodded picking up a spanner looking at it we were out in the little toolshed at the back where she couldnt hear us not that shed pass anything on i was sore it was just bur natural habit to drift somewhere but of earshot wherever we were she hasnt got anyone due you see poor old george went oh it must be five or six years ago now im all shes got left he gave a dry laugh watching me with his yellow eyes in the halflight of the shed the shadow of his rather ragged mustache hiding most of his mouth been mending the lawn mower he said putting the spanner down though the grass is pretty well dead the word dropped into the silence like a stone into a pood irretrievably and i saw the slight tightening of the skin across his sharp cheekbones then it was over know anything about lawn mowers you have to push them along dont you only if you cant wheedle out of it they got the fidgets again have they yes anything to do with the chinese ambassador it had been on the nineoclock news i cant really tell you anything i said because theyve thrown a blackout across it all i really came for was to find out if youd be interested in taking it on directing you yes in a moment he said it was nice of you to bring her flowers shed put them straight into a vase and shown them to him when hed come back shes a pretty woman i said i suppose she is he was thinking about what id been saying about the mission she ought to get married again i told him why not why not he brushed some dry grass cuttings off the edge of the worn bench no one phoned me i suppose you know that hyde was going to but i said i wanted to come here on my own see how things were sound you out that was kind he stared through the little cracked window where there was a piece of paper sticking get blades ground hydes going to run it yes he pick me no he asked me who i wanted you couldnt get ferris the gray october light touched his face at an angle from the window he wasnt allthat old perhaps forty but the skin had shriveled into fine lines across his cheeks like a balloon almost deflated hed been out east a lot ferris hasnt got chinese i said but he knew that i must have tried for ferris and couldnt get him its very big this one very big indeed or they wouldnt have asked for you i was available it wouldnt keep us out there too long so hyde said a matter of days all going well days he turned his head to look at me sounds pretty concentrated thats why mi wouldnt touch it they were approached first yes the thing is were talking about looking after someone out there and hes going to be right in the spotlight we might have to do things they cant the bureau doesnt officially exist but the other services are expected to keep their house clean not get into anything wet theyre specifically public servants whereas you could call us i suppose a maverick force answerable only to the pm looking after someone pepperidge said puckering his thin mouth theres already one down isnt there yes he meant the chinese ambassador theyd come in very early the opposition though not early enough the meeting wed had would provide the blueprint for the whole mission my guess was that qiao hadnt been discreet since the uprising of when hed become disgusted it couldnt have been easy for him to hide a in the confines of his embassy in london or perhaps hed talked to his brother and his brother had been put under the screws out there and beijing intelligence had signalled their agents here in london get qiao the other chap came through though pepperidge said didnt he hou jing the little counselor they said his briefcase saved him there was a lot of stuff in it close shot he was still watching me passing car there was some policemen killed it said on the there it was an assault rifle those bloody things i suppose there wasnt anything like a bit of kevlar in that briefcase was there i thought of that too in this trade we are steeped as i told you in subterfuge hou jing could have worked as a spotter pepperidge looked through the window again and got a piece of rag and wiped some of the grime off but most of it was outside in the air fog pressing down form a steelgray sky lets go in he said and talk to gladys she was in the kitchen scraping at the bottom of a burned saucepan her thin body leaning against the sink i would imagine she got tired easily you go she said when pepperidge put it to her we were in the sitting room now where the cat was arched like a drawn bow with its claws on the settee and its haunches flat on the carpet ill be perfectly all right here she said dont smoky ive got friends who come in doris and marjorie she didnt ask how long he was talking about i think in case it was a long tune and shed feel scared and wed see it its only for a few days her brother said quickly oh relieved then whats all the fuss a pretty smile radiating life if you go out glad i dont want you walking any farther than tesco all right and dont carry anything too heavy doris has got her car ive never heard such a fuss now off you go for goodness sake she picked up the cat and held it while she came to the front door with us it was so nice of you to bring the flowers the smile of a young girl shy and vulnerable i couldnt take her hand because of the cat so i kissed her cheek and we went out pepperidge and i and got into the lamborghini nice hot cuppa love please she looked at me from under the heavy false lashes do you good she mopped the plastic table top and limped off to the tea urn with her arthritic hip you think your nerves arent showing but daisy will catch the vibrations pepperidge had been put on a plane for hong kong an hour ago and id been cleared and briefed and there was nothing to do now nowhere to go while i waited as the light lowered in the basement window the winter seeping into the room like a cold shadow dimming the light bulbs bringing a chill to the air theyd overdone the thermostat thing when hyde had sent his instructions and now this bloody place was as cold as the grave there you are love thank you daisy what about a nice buttered bun all right for something to do i sat with my hands around the cup of tea to warm them anyone forming the actual intention of putting this stuff into his body would be clean off his rocker its jetblack and theres enough caffeine in it to blast the back end off a bulldog what we really come down here for is to escape the madhouse going quietly on upstairs along those bleak and dimly lighted corridors and behind the doors of those unnamed and unnumbered rooms with signals coming in from the mast at cheltenham and traffic going out from codes and cyphers the whole giddy circus engaged in the sinister task of dealing with lies and secrets subversion and betrayal in the name of the need to know there you are duck margarine not butter but what can you do what they budget for in this place is to buy loyalty to put a price on trust to replace a car full of bullet holes at some far frontier post to arrange when things go wrong for funerals to fork out a widows pension i put it in the microwave for you standing over me with her bright ginger wig like a fire in the gloom and her rouged cheeks burning with the warmth of motherly love good old daise we come here for escape and the comfort of this womans saintly presence as she limps from table to table and back to her huge steaming urn our very own blowsy and overblown mother teresa garbed in her stained and sluttish apron and dispensing not only her black undrinkable tea and her stale uneatable buns but also the sweet anodyne of compassion that we need so badly when we crawl back from a mission with the rattle of shot or the scream of a dying man still echoing in the far reaches of the mind or when we sit here with our hands around a cup while our fate hangs in the balance like a rope in the wind as those bastards upstairs turn the signals around and peck at the computers and shuffle softly from room to room in their worn suede shoes and finally decide which one of us should be picked for the mission thats come onto the board which one of us shall be sent out to worm our way through the serpentine shafts of the labyrinth to seek the enemy and overcome torn premission nerves i trust you will understand and perhaps even excuse this is just a touch of the willies youll need to get that dressing changed every three days until they say you can leave it off clearance medical section id said yes i understood and you need to take a gram of c and two hundred and fifty milligrams of calcium in this form the citrate every day why youre just back arent you and going out again yes thats putting a strain on the adrenals she gave me the small plastic box dont forget id got a map of hong kong and a plan of the airport from travel but i hadnt studied them yet and didnt want to nothing was certain they might not be able to con the chinese into giving dr xingyu free passage out of the embassy or any one of a dozen scenarios could come up and wed have to abort this one while the shadow executive was still trying to get his teeth into this bloody bun i kicked the chair back and went out of the caff and op the stairs along the corridor to the room at the end and found a slackbodied woman in a drooping twinset peering into a filing cabinet through a pair of steelrimmed glasses that were surely thick enough to be bulletproof the buns i said this was what they grandly called adminstration services those bloody buns down there she looked around and stared buns a girl came through the doorway and took a look at my face and scuttled for cover behind a pile of papers those buns down there in the caff i said are nothing more than resuscitated crud left over from oliver twists workhouse have you ever if you wish to make a complaint youll have to fill in the appropriate form in triplicate we cant you expect us to go out there and shove our heads right into the cannons mouth and when were lucky enough to come back the best you can give us is crud i looked at the mousyfaced girl whats your name gertrude sir little gertrude do something for me fill out the appropriate form in triplicate with my complaint which you can put down as attempted food poisoning and drop it into my message box for me to sign i went along to see holmes and blow his head off for nothing at all which is what friends are for but he wasnt in so i looked in at signals and saw a very sticky endgame going with croder himself manning the board for flamingo and holmes watching the score as the stuff came in from nigeria two other boards were open the fourth was dark and the last one was lit up but blank except for the word bamboo chalked at the top code name for the mission that would be mine and i stood for a moment looking at it with a feeling of time warp going through me as if i could already see the future the board filling with status reports as pepperidge sent them in from the field with routine information or requests for help and i wondered how far down the board wed manage to go before something flew at me from the dark or a wheel came off or i ran into a dead end with nowhere else to run and pepperidge would have to send the last signal shadow down the adrenals yes a strain on the adrenals so let us quietly close the door of the signals room and go back to the caff and drink some tea and pop some calcium and inform daisy that one fine day she might well achieve a certain tawdry stardom in this bloody place for being able to offer its hardpressed denizens some eatable buns ten minutes later my beeper went and i used a phone and they told me hyde wanted to see me for one final briefing and i knew they werent going to abort this one the mission had started running pepperidge hyde told me will be in hong kong by the morning that was a good choice you made swinging his large head to watch me obliquely with pepperidge hes very fine indeed with his signals and of course hes got a great deal of regard for the way you work i didnt know he said it was an honor im sending you out tonight is that all right whenever youll stop over in bombay to meet someone the situation is this the foreign office together with the pm has managed to complete a workable deal with premier li peng assuring him that we are willing to keep dr xingyu baibing in our care at the embassy out there for as long as he wishes which could of course be years during which time our relations with china would remain distinctly cool we have made it clear that a guarantee from beijing that dr xingyu could move safely from the uk embassy to the airport would in turn bring our guarantee that normal trade could be resumed between the two countries xingyus going straight to hong kong straight there when within a few days theyll give a specific date and time when theyre ready theyre making the concession not us that part actually was comparatively easy the difficult part was to persuade them that were not aware that the moment dr xingyu lands in hong kong hes to be snatched by chinese agents and sent straight back to beijing for brainwashing he poked his tongue into his cheek and waited why cant xingyu be met by a platoon of hong kong police and taken into hiding im not sure hyde said whether anyones made an estimate of the hong kong police force who are active agents for beijing but i would put it rather high xingyu would be walking right into the tigers mouth we can trust you see his large flat hand hitting the desk no one no one at all we also have to relax their agents at the very critical time when dr xingyu lands at the airport by letting it seem that we have not the slightest idea that hes up for snatching we shall be sending only one man to meet him a junior clerk in the british high commission as a formal courtesy the major requirement is to play this operation hi very low key what happens to the clerk hell melt away at the right time ill go into that for you then you must tell me how you think youre going to get dr xingyu clear tew questions first of course it was after seven in the evening and the sounds of the traffic outside had changed coming off the rushhour high with not so many buses now more taxis honking as people started out for the evening it calmed i think a little to hear the steady beating of the citys pulse something for me to remember a touchstone when i was out there in the cold what are we going to do i asked hyde about the media theyll be jamming the airport and theyll get in my way no we thought about that so the fo made the kind suggestion to beijing that dr xingyu should be smuggled in plain van from the embassy to the airport and put onto the last night flight strictly incognito and with a briefed cabin crew this would avoid we suggested unwanted publicity that would make it seem that in allowing dr xingyu his freedom beijing had lost the game it was meant to look like another concession and they went for it thered been some good thinking and it reassured me a little where do you want me to take him out of hong kong one of the phones rang and he pressed the off switch theres no way you could safely keep him there even if he wanted to stay the place is infested with mainland agents beijing has grabbed at this deal because its pretty well their only chance of getting their hands on dr xingyu again and when he lands in hong kong theyll have their own people there in force and when you take him over theyre going to ransack the island and at the same time theyre going to put every point of exit under close and immediate observation that he said with his hand dropping onto the desk again is the objective for the mission not just to take this man into your safekeeping at the airport but to get him out of hong kong where to that bloody shark bite had started itching wherever he wants to go subject to our good counsel it was on the left forearm and the smell of the antiseptic was getting on my nerves are you sending pictures of me to the uk embassy for xingyu to look at we faxed them out there as soon as you accepted the mission dr xingyus instructions will be that once he recognizes you at hong kong airport hell do exactly as you tell him his life he realizes will be in your hands because if they cant snatch him back theyll go for a kill he poked his cheek again that was getting on my nerves too like the shark bite everything was getting on my nerves and it was going to be like this until i reached the field part of it was because of the kill theyd already made early this morning ambassador qiao i said whats the analysis hyde got up and went to a window shoving his huge hands into his pockets his voice bounced off the glass its too early for a complete analysis of course its been impossible to ask any questions hi his embassy here even by phone the diplomatic card is that her majestys government deeply regrets the affair but the language was couched to make it perfectly clear that the assassination was none of our doing and theyd better not try to accuse us its fairly obvious that qiao hadnt been able to hide what he called his disgust with his government and when his brother surfaced as a resurgent last week they added things together and ordered a wet affair before qiao could try defecting they were of course too late he could have been followed i said to the tube station last night despite the precautions yes he halfturned his head the foreign office set up that rendezvous together with the yard wed have done it differently all those police i got out of my chair too feeling restless all those police yes but what could we do the fo had called us in it was their field hou jing i said the little embassy counselor with the briefcase wheres he now in the country he seems terribly cut up but hes bang rather carefully questioned of course there was a black rectangular clock on the desk with a disk you could turn through the international time zones here in london it was was hou jings briefcase actually hit i asked hyde at an angle it was in fact shot out of his hands in a moment i said i dont want to be blown before im even clear of london hyde moved his head tilting it upward his eyes remaining on my face we shall make it our business he said to ensure that nobody gets at hou jing until you complete your mission he will remain under protective house arrest i left it at that because most of it was paranoia and i didnt want it to show i felt drawn to the clock again because time was running down my time in london at we sat down again and i told him how i was going to take over dr xingyu at the airport and put him in a safe house until we could get him out of hong kong the safe house was for pepperidge to set up when the time came it took me twenty minutes and hyde said he liked it and told me id get the people i wanted at the scene youll be flying to bombay he said via cairo where you wont leave the aircraft weve made a rendezvous for you with a man named sojourner hes bureau no hes been around the uk embassies for quite a few years and hes been a first secretary in beijing for the past eighteen months hes made contacts there some of them underground its the way he likes to work one of his contacts is the peoples liberation army general whos pledged to support dr xingyu he didnt tell me the generals name he wasnt telling me a lot of things all he wanted me to have in my head when i went out there were the absolute essentials the less i knew the less anyone could get out of me if i ran into a trap and couldnt reach the capsule in tune what is sojourners job hes the coordinator hell put everything together at ground zero as youll hear when you meet him let me say that hes extremely capable and we have every confidence in him whats his intelligence background i would have been happier if sojourner had been bureau not an itinerant diplomat he has no actual intelligence background but in point of fact it was he who suggested this whole scenario to the late ambassador qiao in essence following clandestine approaches to the army general you may trust sojourner you may trust him completely there wasnt anything i could say i had to trust all of them completely the head of bureau chief of signals london control my director in the field and whoever was manning the signals board if bamboo began running hot on the black clock and i looked away how many people have you got lined up to replace me if i go down in a moment hyde said heavily i dont understand oh for gods sake showing my nerves too late to sake it back i would certainly have told you hyde said earlier in your briefing if i intended to put anyone else into the field we look im just one man and youre talking about winging down a government its you dont feel confident of course i feel confident but why not put ten people mo the field a protective cadre with xingyu in the saddle as they did with guzhenko it stopped me dead in my tracks as it was meant to do five years ago the bureau had tried to bring guzhenko cross to the west an invaluable double agent with his head stuffed with ultrasensitive information and it had to be done extremely fast because hed been blown and our people had picked him up from the halfsubmerged wreck of a dredger on the volga where hed run for cover portland had been london control for the mission and hed sent out six men and a support group backing them up and one of the six had been aught and took a capsule in time and the next one had run out on the operation when the kgb had closed in and two others were shot in a rearguard action and the support group had scattered because guzhenko was exposed and targeted and there was nothing they could do nothing and the trap was shut and guzhenko was taken back to moscow and thrown into a psychiatric ward and came out five weeks later with his head as empty as a coconut husk and half the files in our moscow desk blown through the ceiling i said point taken good i run things differently yes no more questions hyde came to the door with me theres an enormous weight of responsibility he said on all of us the destiny of a billion people if one were to put it vulgarly is at stake but dont let that discountenance you this is a case of softlee softlee catchee monkee in other words we play this very lowkey i saw holmes for a minute and picked up my briefing and the prepacked suitcase on my way out of the building and the time on the round oakframed clock in the hall showed and that was the time they would note on the signals boards for bamboo after the date and the chalked entry executive dispatched incense they circled continuously over the dead and how is london cold here in bombay the evening was mild a little humid i miss london we were on a veranda overlooking a courtyard full of frescoes and eroded statuettes and frangipanis with only a boy in sight whiterobed watching not everything of course sojourner said happens in london one has to peregrinate they were black against the sky images cut from black crepe and thrown to the azure heights above the parsee towers of silence on malabar hill where they dived and rose and circled in the lowering light they worried me one can hardly stay all ones life in one place sojourner said even london i was becoming interested in seeing how long he could keep talking without actually saying anything but he wasnt just trying to make small talk at our first meeting he was i thought assessing me very carefully watching for gestures alert to the tone of voice i didnt answer and he listened to that too you flew straight out he asked me yes and shall you be flying straight to hong kong i dont know it was the first time hed looked at me directly up to now hed been like a headmaster questioning a schoolboy studying his nails eyes averted stripping the boy of his identity listening as if to a liar but now sojourner looked up but couldnt make contact i was watching the boy down there slender in the white robe his eyes jeweled in the shadows as he stared up at the veranda he hadnt been in the courtyard when id arrived but had come through the crumbling stone archway soon afterward sojourner looked away from me and down at the boy door wo jao patil chalah jao the boy slipped through the shadows not glancing back you dont know sojourner asked me about flying straight to hong kong no i looked upward again they worried me those bloody birds in the five towers the dead would be lying on stone slabs in three concentric circles the men on the outside then the women with the children in the middle they would be picked clean before dark i see sojourner said and left it at that the implication was that he would certainly find out and i wished him luck you may trust sojourner you may trust him completely hyde but i make my own rules in the field there wasnt anything to dislike particularly about sojourner except perhaps for the rather cloying cologne he used or the slender grace of the boy in the robe to look at he was unremarkable a smooth wellshaven face heavy thicklensed glasses decent enough suit a lawyer to look at or a scientist one of the brilliant younger men searching cleverly through the subatomic particles for the nobel prize and i disliked of course his arrogance because arrogance is a dangerous trait in the netherworld of subterfuge where an inflated ego can prove fatal but i suppose it was understandable in this man because hyde had said the whole operation was his idea in the beginning and hed naturally feel he was running the show baaira he called and our server came moving quietly through the gap in the shutters smelling faintly of body oils hum kuche order kerna chahathi hy sahib what do you think sojourner asked me they do curries well here of course or do you prefer something european i said id have whatever he was having and we watched the last of the sated vultures drift away from the hill to the trees below as the light lowered later the server touched the wicks in the brass openwork lamps with the flame of a bic lighter and as the darkness was pressed back sojourner began talking wanting to show me i think how well versed he was in the worlds affairs perhaps even trying to make me see that i could trust him because of his openness the idea is not actually to save china he said but to save hong kong as you have probably realized china is very resilient and if all those people are content to live with a bowl of rice and a bicycle all their lives then its their right to choose and theyve chosen the form of government they want in the broader sense we are committed nevertheless you and i and certain others to bringing about a form of government that only a few thousand of them want and with the grace of god we shall see that they get it but thats not the real focus the real focus is hong kong below the veranda people moved through the courtyard mostly in white tunics and saris their sandals scuffing across the cobblestones i wasnt worried about the people in the courtyard id checked the environment with the strictest attention on my way here from the airport and the only danger was if sojourner hadnt also covered his tracks i assumed he would have there are of course great opportunities for trade between china and the west ten years ago the trade figures were in the region of two billion us dollars and its now five times bigger but what these brighteyed and bushytailed captains of industry dont realize is that a trade boom fifty times that big would come into being given a democratic government in china but no one had time to squeeze the present government out of beijing with a quick and effective stranglehold of sanctions and embargoes in it would have been easy enough the top people had already begun transferring massive amounts of cash into swiss and hong kong bank accounts as soon as the uprising started and they had a chinese air force transport plane standing by in beijing with an escort of mig fighters to get them out of the country success for the democracy movement was that close but big business had its nose stuck fast in the bookkeeping is the patatchi all right i said it was very nice some kind of argument had started down there on the far side of the archway a man in a rumpled white suit was apparently trying to get into the hotel sojourner watched for a moment and then lost interest but in hong kong it was different he said it couldnt apply sanctions as the west could have done moreover it was told by beijing that any real signs of support for the democratic movement would deny it the continuance of a capitalist economy after the takeover in but there were things it could do by virtue of its unique political and economic position politically it can do pretty well what it likes since its responsible to no one it is not for instance a world leader required to set a shining example in everything it does economically it has great power and many friends among the giant corporations as the twilight bled from the sky the lamps along the veranda held back the dark but shadows came close and i could no longer see sojourners eyes his thick hornrimmed glasses had become a mask showing only reflections hong kong also has enough cold cash he said quietly to buy up the peoples republic of china and that is why we are here now he looked down into the courtyard again someone had called a policeman but the man in the rumpled white suit was still protesting pointing up at the twostory hotel i had thoughts again about security i was also having new thoughts of course about sojourner he was a great deal more than just a coordinator whats happening i asked him the man says his wife is in the hotel and he wants her to come home presumably he means with the money though he doesnt understand that she has to finish what shes doing before she can be paid when i say to buy up the peoples republic of china turning his masked face to watch me again i mean of course to pay for the ousting of the doddering octogenarian clique at present in power and for the installation of a young and enlightened intellectual administration eager to embrace the capitalist way of life he was leaning toward me a little now i believed though in the shifting shadows it could have been an illusion but what i was quite certain about as i went on listening was that he wasnt talking so freely to me in order to give me information but in order to celebrate his own ingenuity in ten years from now he said softly beijing will still be the capital of china and hong kong will be its flourishing commercial center closely comparable if you will with washington and new york he waited until the server had taken away the plates some fruit some preserves not for me i said main kuche phal pasen karta hoo he told the man shaaid ek aam a bell had begun tolling from a temple some way off its brightedged sound cutting through the softness of the voices in the street beyond the archway and the scuffing of sandals and shoes it amuses me sojourner said to think that the remarkable changes about to take place in china if youll forgive the understatement will have been initiated by the aforementioned doddering clique of octogenarians at present in power it was they after all who announced m the peoples daily in that not engaging in activities to overthrow the chinese government was a precondition for allowing hong kong to retain its capitalist system following its adoption warning enough dont you think mr szeto wah put it rather well when he said the force of the wind tests the strength of the grass that was when it happened that was when hong kong realized that in a few years from now it could become either an impoverished little island with the rubble of abandoned commerce littering the streets or the economic hub of a new world power you must have realized this yourself you saw the papers like everyone else and read between the lines it was there for all to see but no one did anything now we are to do something and within a few days you must surely feel excited to be playing a part in all this i do my job i said he dipped a glance across the courtyard you do your job well thats all we ask of you then he was watching me again in the gloom and what have you been told specifically to do ive been told specifically to do what you require of me he let it go but it worried me if hed had any experience in intelligence he would have known he shouldnt ask me questions like that the only confidence i had in this man was based on hydes telling me i could trust him it wasnt enough in a moment sojourner said when the time is right you will be put into contact with a certain general of the peoples liberation army through his aides this general was one of those who refused to have his troops fire on the civilian population one of the few in fact who recognize that they are members of the peoples army others of like mind were shot for refusing to attack the students in and three to my certain knowledge preempted retribution by taking their own lives when they refused orders to use arms against unarmed civilians it was my good fortune he said carefully to have been in personal touch with our particular general a little time before the uprising of last week sensing the color of his inclinations i made one or two trips to hong kong where some of my friends have access to the top executive officers of the big american japanese and hong kong corporations then i went back to the general have you ever played chess by any chance do it all the time then youll understand my gratification that i was fortuitously in the right place on the board at the right time with the right people and were offered the right money the light flashed across his glasses as he looked down quickly interlacing his fingers and putting his hands palm down onto the tablecoth it had sounded rude i suppose but i wanted to know where this mans loyalties lay it was important because if money were his only incentive it could be dangerous and id have to signal london and tell them i was dropping the mission if they couldnt find another coordinator i didnt expect sojourner to be an altruist but hed have to show at least a degree of personal commitment to the bureau and to me mercenaries can change sides at the drop of a doubloon in a moment he raised his head are you looking for a cut not really you dont imagine im sticking my neck out for the sake of a few million chinese peasants i hope i noticed hed forgotten his studied manner of speech and knew it was his guard coming down this too was worrying i hadnt said much to provoke him how would he stand up to chinese intelligence if they asked any questions the price you put on your services i told him doesnt concern me though i imagine its in the region of ten or twenty million us dollars which is very nice what concerns me is whether you might at some time sell yourself to the opposite camp for a higher figure and leave me swinging in the wind they couldnt possibly afford it he said i think it was meant to be a joke but surely your desk officer told you i could be trusted he may have he turned his head and i saw that the boy patil had come back into the courtyard he was leaning against the wall under a lamp watching the veranda so what are you going to do about it sojourner asked me take a few precautions in a moment precautions dont worry you wont notice them ive often considered leaning back now needing more distance that you people think rather oh i dont know rather boyishly cloaks and daggers and so on have you now but id expected you to be like this it doesnt disturb me jolly good show but it disturbs me a bit that you might have been followed here tonight and sitting in your company i might be at risk and that patil down there might be working as an informer boyish i know but it happens i can show you the scars he didnt answer for a while and as i sat there among the restless shadows and the oil lamps flickered to the movement of the moist night air i felt a sense of foreboding beyond the courtyard the night pressed down across the city the few visible stars half lost in the haze voices out there in the street sounded hushed now and i thought i heard the fluting of a snake charmer near the marketplace the smell of incense came from the dining room through the doors behind us sweet and heavy and oppressive it wasnt a case of nerves this i was out of london and halfway to the field and the jitters had gone i was reacting on a level of the psyche infinitely more sophisticated than the nerves to vibrations in the moist and perfumed night a trembling of the spirits gossamer web i think sojourner said at last that you exaggerate the circumstances for someone as experienced as im told you are this isnt a very dangerous operation clasping his hands spreading the fingers no one is likely to get killed ambassador qiao probably thought the same he looked down again not knowing he didnt have to not knowing i couldnt see his eyes behind the glasses in all probability he said the poor chap was marked down by beijing looking up at me suddenly he had a brother you know mixed up in the event of last week and they arrested him talked too much wouldnt you say about qiao instant chill the poor chap had been totally false totally out of character and hed looked up like that so suddenly almost jerking his head as he realized hed have to face me if it were to ring true this thing about qiao and when he threw in the placatory wouldnt you say i didnt have any doubts left none at all ive lied myself so often in the field lied to save my life and i know how difficult it is to do well and there was the other thing when wed first met this evening how is london i miss london not everything happens of course in london one has to peregrinate im sure youre right i said signal to control i believe sojourner was in london and either killed ambassador qiao or arranged it and after all he was saying it suits our purpose rather well dont you feel one grieves of course but what if qiao had been got at by the people on his staff at the embassy and grilled we wouldnt have had any operation left i said thats true he seemed satisfied and looked away again down into the courtyard and gave a slight nod the boy in the white robe came away from the wall and into the hotel the purpose of our meeting sojourner said in a moment was to become acquainted he was back to his mannered speech patterns feeling relieved reassured that his lies about qiaos death had appeared to stand up and i think weve accomplished that he pulled a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and straightened it out youve had your instructions from your desk officer and ive told you that youll be in contact eventually with our general through his aides theyll tell you precisely when we need dr xingyu flown back into beijing and that will be your responsibility it might help you to know that we dont anticipate any major problem once the generals task force has moved into the great hall of the people and placed the chinese leader under restraint that will be arranged to take place at a time when he is due to appear on nationwide television in order to vilify the intellectuals for their insurrection last week instead of doing that he will be obliged to make the following brief announcement at gunpoint though the viewers will not of course see the gun he tilted the sheet of paper to catch the light a military detachment has this evening moved into tiananmen square to establish control there while certain negotiations proceed between my government and a spokesmen for those intellectuals seeking reform i ask the people to remain calm there must be no demonstrations and no disorder in the streets that might cause bloodshed you will be informed as the situation becomes clarified meanwhile i will repeat there must be no provocation offered the security forces calm must prevail he folded the paper and put it away do you have any questions its going to need careful timing very careful timing yes we need senior leader deng xiaoping premier li peng and communist party chief jiang zemin together in the great hall of the people at the same time as our general moves his tanks into the square and dr xingyu baibing is brought forward under close protective escort to take over from deng xiaoping in front of the tv cameras but i envision no difficulty its a matter of efficient coordination do i fly xingyu into beijing id been briefed on this but i wanted sojourner to think i didnt know i wanted him to think i knew as little as possible no youll hand him over to a special military escort that will land at whatever location you designate to pick him up hell be met at beijing by a stronger contingent which will escort him to the great hall of the people understood i asked him a few more questions and then he put some notes on the bill the server had left and we got up and went through the main dining room to the hall just a word sojourner said and lowered his voice youll only make things difficult for yourself if you dont decide to trust me your people have checked me out quite thoroughly as you must know i wish you a pleasant night it was not quite eleven and i took a turn in the courtyard for a while and then went upstairs to my room i had the key in the door when the screams came and i took the passage at a run and heard where they were coming from and found the door locked and broke it open and saw sojourner writhing on the floor half erect and the naked and terrified boy flattened against the wall and on the bed the cobra with its black hood spread messiah the rain was hitting the deck in a deluge as i dropped onto the flooded boards from the jetty and went below and saw pepperidge sitting there watching me traffic solid hong kong for you i shook water off my raincoat it took forty minutes so ill want an hour and a half when i leave here xingyu was landing at tonight from beijing and it was now has anything changed no pepperidge got up and helped me off with my coat theres no rush he said it to relax me part of his job hows gladys fine spot of tea i said no i wanted an empty bladder by the time i was back at the airport to meet the objective are they lined up yes that was one of the things i liked about him as a director in the field others cone fane that bastard loman would have said of course meaning that i shouldnt have asked should have trusted them to line up the people get everything ready but i didnt trust anyone it can be fatal if anything goes wrong or the mission starts running hot you can have a pew he touched my arm its a piece of cake showing my nerves the thing was id spent the time on the flight from bombay going over the whole thing and id worked it out that when the action started at kaitak airport i was going to take exactly nine seconds to do what i had to do nine seconds i had to go through rangoon i told pepperidge nothing but bloody delays thought you were cutting it fine but here you are and youve lots of time bit of shuteye no i had seven hours slept in i hadnt planned to sleep on the plane you dont hit the same delta waves food im okay calcium i forgot he got a glass of milk from the fridge while i opened my flight bag and found the stuff feel like debriefing go ahead did you get my cable yes he went to the end of the cabin and sat down by the phone and i joined him there all id put in the cable from bombay was contact down it couldnt mean anything else i suppose it must have shaken him sojourner had been pivotal to the mission and if we couldnt find another coordinator the mission was dead in the water i watched him at the telephone his yellow eyes shadowed by the cowl of the lamp its light etching the mass of fine lines on his face making it look like crumpled tissue paper the scrambler was as big as the telephone itself and hed switched that on first and then dialed i didnt know how he was sending this stuff but there were plenty of ways he could go through government house in hong kong to the secret services communications mast in cheltenham and on to london or direct to the mast or direct to london it would depend on the degree of urgency when hed got my cable today he would have hit london direct hes in very good shape he was saying and well debrief on bombay before he leaves for the rendezvous everything is in order he filled in the weather conditions and the state of the roads locally and put the phone down it hadnt been a conversation just a oneway report for the signals room in london and holmes or someone else would pick up a piece of chalk from the ledge at the bottom of the board for bamboo and fill in the spaces exec arr base hk rdv dip action ready pepperidge got his pad and looked across the little teakwood table at me and i told him what had happened at the hotel he used the fastest shorthand id seen not noting everything just the main points most difs use tapes but theres always a risk of their getting wiped out by interference in transit and pepperidge doesnt like that the boy didnt put the snake into the bed no he was terrified was he a trap he could have been how long did you stay there i got out straightaway because i was obviously at risk other people came along theyd heard the screaming too i got my bag and kept clear and then followed the ambulance to the hospital then peeled off and phoned the emergency room i think it was a king cobra the bloody thing was huge no tags anywhere i checked believe me id spent the evening with a man whod been already targeted and id watched him dying sojourner didnt seem worried anxious beforehand no perfectly confident but i wasnt certain i was ready to stay in the mission unless london would agree to replace him i was picking my words carefully this would go down on record at the bureau i wasnt with him very long but he came across to me as a mercenary and therefore unreliable possibly dangerous i gave him the details of the conversation in fact i think he might have either killed ambassador qiao outside the tube station or had him killed pepperidge held his pencil still for an instant and then went on why to keep him quiet he was a risk to us i grant that yes he made some more notes and then we began going over the action for tonight it took half an hour and i began checking the time i would leave here for the airport at in twenty minutes from now the adrenaline had started and the mouth was drying a little i felt all right about things felt perfectly sure i could do what had to be done it was just that very narrow gap in the timing just nine seconds to go in and get out and take xingyu with me youll bring him here pepperidge said recapping unless for some reason youre prevented well keep him here until he decides where he wants to go then well get him put of hong kong therell be a makeup artist coming here as soon as i signal for him hes standing by now names koichi he works for the tokyo film corporation and lends his services to the tokyo police now and then for their undercover people i hes not bureau he was one of our sleepers in tokyo until he got too successful it seems hes a genius he caught my expression he is vouched for by bureau one himself and i shall be here to look after things youre staying i asked him in a moment if youve no objections i had to think once id got xingyu under my wing wed be in a red sector and wherever we moved wed take it with us bring it to this boat beijing has grabbed at this deal hyde in final briefing because its pretty well their only chance of getting their hands on dr xingyu again and when he lands in hong kong theyll have their own people in force and when you take him over theyre going to ransack the island and at the same time theyre going to put every point of exit under close and immediate observation youll be a bit close to things i told pepperidge on this boat in any mission the dip is there to nurture the shadow executive get his signals out and bring him londons instructions support and liaise and comfort him if necessary feed him if necessary get him out of action when a wheel comes off but he works from his own secure base usually a hotel not hidden but simply unrecognized for what he is and the executive is to make contact only when its safe when hes clear of the opposition and not in other words a danger a contaminant for every director who goes home there can be a dozen shadows out there hanging on the wire because the nature of their work entails risk and the directors does not if it worries you pepperidge said and waited his eyes on me i gave it some more thought and said stay on the boat then but when xingyu and i leave here well be on our own of course he put his notepad away and got up rummaging in a zipped bag its going to help me you see if i can meet xingyu and get to know him a little i shall be better informed more useful to you later i brought this for you holding out a kevlar vest instructions no he said i wont insist on it those things worry me i believe that if you think youll be bitten by a dog youll be bitten by a dog though theres more to it than that theres logic too youll behave differently when the heats on take unnecessary risks because you think youre protected and besides any professional is going to shoot for the head if he means to kill im sure you wont need it pepperidge said and stuffed it into the bag there was a whistling in the air threading its sound through the pelting of the rain on the roof of the cabin a big jet lowering overhead on its approach path to kaitak we were southeast of there across the water in chai wan bay i looked at my watch again i would be leaving in nine minutes synchronize pepperidge said yes the mouth still dry everything settling now becoming quiet in the mind as the ego accepted the inevitability of things the understanding that it was too late to turn back the feeling of being carried slowly by the force of ones own decision to the eye of the storm this degree of gooseflesh surprised me a bit but i suppose it was partly because thered been two dead before id even reached the field i gave pepperidge the cable that london had sent to my hotel in bombay mary and children arrive pm on th very much hope you can meet them doris he put it away anything else bombay hotel bill air tickets from london to hong kong a postcard id bought in rangoon to look like a tourist he put those away too everything in my wallet now identified me as a resident of hong kong banks credit cards driving license and london had given me shoes made in kowloon and hong kong labels in my clothes thats all i said then i wont keep you he picked up the phone and dialed and i got my soaked raincoat and put it on youre in place he said into the phone and listened for a moment and then put the receiver down and followed me as far as the deck and the pouring rain piece of cake he said i said thats right and went over the side onto the jetty i counted twenty of them flight was running late with its arrival on the screen showing a twelveminute delay i had asked about it at the checkin and theyd said thered been head winds at least twenty of them possibly more you cant always be sure they were professionals all of them not just standing around in the gate area but keeping themselves busy buying postcards sitting with a paper and a cup of coffee talking to children ruffling their heads i recognized them by their physique compact muscled athletic and by the way they glanced across peoples faces their eyes never resting never showing interest never glancing at one another i recognized them by their shoes which were rubbersoled like mine not leather and by the way they sat and stood and walked not because the difference between their way of doing it and the way ordinary people did it was very great but because there was in fact a difference a slight one and because id watched people like these in a hundred airports in a thousand streets and knew them for my own kind twenty then at least and thered be more of them in the main hall and at the baggage claim and outside the terminal professionals too but with less training or less natural aptitude mobsters if you like dispersed throughout the environment to make a rush at any time if they were needed piling themselves like fire ants on the flames if something went wrong id been on the move since id come into the gate area pacing from one end to the other in my soft grey cap and glasses to establish the image checking my watch now and then because the flight was late and i was getting impatient i walked with a soldierly pace shoulders back and hands behind me an umbrella tucked under one arm a copy of the hong kong times folded into a pocket and one end sticking out hong kong airlines flight to macao will depart from gate in six minutes from now at will passengers please go to gate no immediately i could also see the two chinese agents who would personally greet and escort dr xingyu baibing on arrival they were the only men in the contingent standing together and talking to each other they were also immaculate in blue serge suits with lots of linen showing their smart shoes polished right down to the rubber soles i didnt know what their cover story was they might say they were plainclothesmen from the hong kong police department sent here to escort dr xingyu through the terminal in case he were recognized in case the press might pester him they would show him their official identity or they might say they were representatives of the hong kong democracy for china association who would be honored to entertain him during his stay whatever they said he would accept it those were his instructions hyde had done a great deal of work as id realized in final briefing liaising by telephone with the british embassy in beijing and four of the bureaus sleepers who had gone into the embassy on routine errands xingyu had been shown photographs of me and given a detailed description hed listened to a tape of my voice hed been told precisely what he should do at every stage from his arrival at gate to taking his seat in the car outside the car that i would be driving hed been put through an exhaustive rehearsal using a plan of hong kong airport and photographs of the outside of the terminal alongside the baggage claim area hed been told what he must do if anything went wrong if i or any of my three support people made a mistake that musnt happen because if it happened dr xingyu baibing would be kept overnight as a guest of the kuo chi ching pao chu the chinese intelligence service and given a shot of diazepam or one of the other benzodiazepene derivatives and taken back on the first morning flight to beijing and put into a psychiatric ward for a few weeks and then propped up in front of the television cameras i was wrong declares hero of chinese democratic movement in dramatic appearance on tv i now realize that only through our resolute faith in the principles of communism can we construct the future this we must circumvent japan airlines flight to tokyo will depart from gate in ten minutes from now at i took another stroll the length of the gate area and heard the faint roar of reversed engines from the main runway and tucked my umbrella more firmly under my arm and walked back as far as the telephones standing within a few feet of a group of women in black silk with coloured beads in their hair and a travel agent holding a board marked criterion and a pretty girl with calm eyes and wavy hair and a blue plaid rug over her legs in the wheelchair no one was moving about anymore the flashing red lamp on the top of the s cabin lit the windows as the jet slowed to the passenger tunnel its thin whistle cutting through the walls the timing was accurate it had touched down at exactly as scheduled by its adjusted eta on the screen it was a good portent now that wed got the head winds thing over the rest of the evening would go smoothly i suppose pepperidge had watched this flight a few minutes ago lowering across chai wan bay and his little boat and now he would possibly be praying does pepperidge pray we didnt move any of us we had friends to greet wives husbands children business associates and dr xingyu baibing accord him hyde had told me in london appropriate honours while he is in your care to the brave and desperate chinese he is the anointed one the messiah he was to be the last one off the plane as agreed between london and beijing when the deal had been struck this was in case there were any photographers in the gate area who might recognize him the passengers began coming through certain amount of sweat on the skin and the mouth drying again i slowed my breathing brought it under conscious control people laughing as they went by some of them stopping to hug a little bunch of flowers falling for a moment unnoticed pepperidge waiting on his boat piece of cake a flutter of chinese schoolgirls in blue uniforms and prim velour hats their laughter reminding one of bird calls a thin beaknosed englishman in a crumpled tweed hat just off the grouse moors hello bessie old thing pepperidge waiting on his boat and in the signal room in whitehall the kind of silence that always falls at a time like this when the executive out there in the field has reached the phase when he will do it right or blow the mission off the board theyd seen the flowers now the little bunch of flowers and someone was picking it up oh darling thank you how terrible of me but i was so excited to see you then the line of people began thinning and there were gaps and a young chinese came through carrying some kind of stringed instrument made of bamboo then a lostlooking woman with tired eyes and too much lipstick and no one to meet her and then a short man in an overcoat and dark glasses the messiah flashpoint the baggage claim area was crowded flight had been at least threequarters full and the kccpc contingent had moved down here and taken up stations around the walls watching the carousel but not looking terribly like passengers though it didnt matter no one would notice as soon as id seen the two chinese escorts go up to xingyu baibing and show him their identity cards id gone into the toilet and left my coat and cap and umbrella and newspaper in one of the cubicles and then joined the passengers the bags hadnt started coming through yet i stood well back from the carousel six or seven feet away from xingyu baibing he hadnt seen me yet hadnt looked around for me those were his instructions one of my support people was in place near the exit doors to the pavement outside the terminal he was a signaler that was all the two chinese escorts were keeping close to dr xingyu though not crowding him they werent expecting him to make a run for it hed convinced them that he believed they were friends he didnt look like a messiah he was short and wore an overcoat that sagged at the bottom his shoes no one would call serviceable the only thing about him you might notice was that his hands were big for such a short man they hung at his sides he talked to the two men nodding sometimes giving a little bow as they presumably paid him a compliment they hadnt told him they were police officers they were behaving much more like representatives from the hong kong democracy for china association courteous to him deferential i found it refreshing to watch intelligence agents so sophisticated the first bag came through the chute and flopped onto the carousel i felt very good now there wasnt one of the kccpc people in the place who wouldnt have shot me dead with a silenced gun if theyd known who i was why i was here the odds against me were massive in terms of numbers but i liked that it honed the edge of things for me brought me to the state of mind where i could work at my best going into that strange mental zone where action becomes automatic unimpeded by conscious thought youll need more than nine seconds not really you must have timed it wrong youll need much shuddup but these people are professionals trained to kill i said shuddup bloody little organism always snivelling when it thinks it can smell trouble i get that for you an american helping someone a cardboard box with string around it came out of the chute one side split open i watched for my bag xingyu had been asked to pack two bags one of his own containing junk supplied by the british embassy and one for me also containing junk with a distinctive multicoloured stripe running lengthwise so that i could recognise it easily on the carousel it hadnt come around yet nor had xingyus i move a little closer to him both bags should come onto the carousel at about the same time since he would have checked them in together they were speaking in mandarin he and his escorts and he gave another little bow then i saw the bag with the stripes drop out of the chute and onto the carousel and i moved forward passing xingyu watching the bag checking the handle swinging the bag across the side of the carousel and turning to face xingyu as i made my way past him giving him some time to study me while i looked past and beyond him edging my way through the crowd his instructions had been to the effect that the man who picked up that particular bag would be the agent from london and that agent would take care of him from that point onward the man over there by the exit door hadnt moved he was waiting for xingyu to get his own bag off the carousel it hadnt come around yet and i held back letting a woman go past me one of those with the pretty beads in her hair then i saw xingyu move nodding and one of the escort people got a bag off the carousel and i turned my head and saw the man at the exit doors go outside and signal for the jaguar the timing was rather critical now we were moving toward the flashpoint toward the start of the ninesecond phase with a crowd this size it was easier in a way because of all the movement and the confusion on the other hand i would have preferred a clearer path because i had to stay close to xingyu now and keep up the same pace toward the doors i was into the zone by this time the light seemed a degree brighter and images edges outlines were sharper they were talking to my ear more loudly now xingyu and his two escorts they went through the doors ahead of me i had the bag in my hand it was still raining outside and people came across the roadway with umbrellas open some of them with folded newspapers over their heads there was a dog yelping with excitement soaked shaking itself and i heard a woman saying froufrou to it its name i suppose you remember the little things as the time telescopes moving you forward perhaps because only the little things are unexpected whereas the major components of the action are already familiar from the exhaustive mental rehearsal thats been going on for hours days froufrou she said laughing because the dog was so excited about the rain it was a mercedes sl it was standing immediately outside the curb a chinese in chauffeurs uniform was waiting with the rear passengers door held open for dr xingyu baibing another mercedes was standing immediately behind with two men sitting inside behind the second mercedes was the black jaguar xj the car id brought here the one the man inside the doors of the terminal had signalled for a minute ago a minute and a half a man was at the wheel he was bureau these jags are lively in hong kong you can hire cars like that from exclusive rental you can even get a rolls if you give them enough time i put my bag down next to some others and stood waiting stood waiting for a few seconds for the few seconds that were left before flashpoint looking to my left for whoever it was that was meant to pick me up though no one was meant to pick me up we werent going to do it like that there were two greenuniformed policemen one of them fifty feet away the other closer but at the far end of the pedestrian crossing that had been expected we had foreseen in final briefing that the permutations were countless chinese intelligence could have sent only one escort to meet dr xingyu or three or four there could have been two men waiting with the mercedes or three and more than two men sitting in the one parked behind it there could have been fifty kccpc people in the background instead of the twenty or so that id counted so forth but the reality was containable we could manage this dr xingyu was getting into the rear of the mercedes the chauffeur still holding the door open for him one of the escorts was taking the bag across the pavement to wait by the boot of the car the chauffeur slammed the door and came to the rear and opened the lid of the boot the escort started to swing the bag inside we had also decided in london that if the kccpc contingent were to fire weapons they wouldnt do it during the flashpoint period because there would be policemen here and other people innocent people some of them children and from the negotiations between prime minister thatcher the foreign office and the chinese government it had been made clear that both sides wanted to proceed in very low profile with dr xingyus arrival in hong kong and gunfire in a public place under the eye of the police could bring disastrous repercussions politically if there were to be weapons fired it would happen later when perhaps there might seem a chance for the kccpc agents to keep dr xingyu under their control or failing that to kill him but the hairs were lifted a little on my arms i could feel the gooseflesh and my scalp was shrinking i brought this for you holding out the kevlar vest instructions no i wont insist on it those things worry me but the nerves were still touchy because my body was exposed and vulnerable and it sometimes happens that when action starts suddenly someone panics but dont imagine i had any regrets i didnt have any conscious fear of a shot exploding in the flesh at this point the nerves were just reacting to the primitive brainstem awareness of danger of potential death the man was swinging the bag into the boot of the mercedes and i watched him the scene was still frozen because flashpoint was very close now the brass locks of the bag glinted in the light and i saw that a thread was hanging loose at one corner where the leather had started to split i dont think i could have seen a detail as small as that from this distance in the ordinary way but my vision was brilliantly clear as i watched the bag making its arc across the edge of the boot for all of us time is variable it expands and contracts according to what we are doing nine seconds in one sense isnt long when one has to do what i was here to do in another sense it could seem seemed now to me very long indeed dangerously fatally long because i was exposed and alone here against these considerable forces alone except for the man sitting along there at the wheel of the black jaguar but his instructions were to do nothing at all to help me only to wait one of the policemen blew his whistle as a hotel shuttle bus slowed and tried to move into a gap too short for it the driver throttled up again the rain was steady a gray steel curtain with diamonds sprinkled in it i was standing next to one of dr xingyus escorts turned away from him not looking at him looking through the rain now as if waiting to cross the roadway he didnt have any interest in me there were other people around other passengers i would see to him first then the man who was swinging the bag into the trunk then the chauffeur who had gone back to sit at the wheel of the mercedes the rain had the sound of steel brushes stroking a snare drum softly in the night flashpoint as the bag dropped onto the floor of the boot and i used the right arm from the elbow to keep the strike short and visually discreet and felt the softness of the flesh covering the escorts vagus nerve against my wristbone and saw his hands coming up too late to protect himself i didnt worry about his hands because his pulse would have begun slowing now and venous dilation would be drawing blood from his brain his legs were buckling as the second man straightened up from dropping the bag into the boot and i used a knee against his sacral plexus hard enough to incapacitate and pulled him out of the way and slammed the boot shut and went to the side of the car and opened the driving door and worked on the chauffeurs thyroid cartilage taking my time because he was surprised and hadnt even moved his hands and couldnt move them now because of the numbing effect of the squeeze i used my other hand to drag him off the seat and onto the streaming roadway and started up and checked the nearside mirror and used a light foot but even then got wheelspin as i took the mercedes away and saw the black jaguar pull out immediately and then swing back to block off the mercedes behind me as it started up and tried to follow the police whistles were blowing and id expected that but i didnt know why the woman over there was screaming and holding her face perhaps just because there were three people lying on the roadway in the pouring rain and they surely must be ill or something i turned my head and told dr xingyu to get down low on the backseat in case there was any shooting and he did that id reached the airport road by the time a dark green volvo flashed me from behind and came past and slowed and pulled into the curb ahead of me the driver got out and took over the mercedes and i put xingyu into the front of the volvo with me and when i was sure we were clean and clear i used the car phone and told pepperidge wed got him pace headlights i pushed the needle into his hip and aspirated and didnt get any blood started squeezing the plunger all right pepperidge said what about the next one the man who was putting the bag into the boot he was making notes shorthand sitting at the end of the bench that ran the length of the cabin still i told xingyu keep perfectly still he hadnt got a lot of patience wed found knee to the coccyx i told pepperidge the sacral plexus would have been affected where most of the major nerves go from the spine to the hips and the legs he went down straight away i pulled the needle out of xingyus muscle and rubbed it for a bit pepperidge whats his future its a new thing theyve started to ask in london when were debriefed after any kind of action were expected to give details its all in the book in norfolk but its meant to inspire the rookies when theyre told exactly what was done in a real situation his lifes not in danger i said hell need some spinal surgery thats all hell walk again dr xingyu pulled up his black woollen slacks and did the buttons thank you dont mention it saliva in my mouth im queasy about needles but it had been no good asking pepperidge to do it because i was going to be tied to xingyu right through the mission and he needed it twice a day insuno intramuscular just my luck i took the syringe over to the little copper sink and filled it with water the chauffeur i used a chin na grip on the thyroid cartilage to give him enough pain to stop him thinking of anything else and then pulled him out of the car and dropped him on the roadway i took the syringe out to the flooded afterdeck and dropped it over the side and came back just to give him enough pain though thats important because you can kill like that if you do it too hard they should understand that i didnt need to kill anyone xingyu was putting the bottle of insulin away in the pocket of his sheepskin coat pepperidge finished writing and didnt look up as he said they ran over his head not your fault in a minute i said oh christ dont have it on your mind but i had to tell you they were in too much of a hurry trying to follow you explained then why that woman had screamed when i drove away id wondered three down already and we were learning fast bamboo was hungry i took trouble i said of course you did youre always fastidious i sat down on the opposite bench feeling cold and dr xingyu looked at me and then at pepperidge and said so what will you do with me now tone of total cynicism almost hostility he was sitting very upright his big hands on his lap his feet together and his head lifted sitting very still like something to be shot at pepperidge came around the end of the teakwood table and sat facing the chinese resting his hands in front of him with the fingers spread open a symbolic posture i suppose to mean he wasnt hiding anything dr xingyu you were told at our embassy in beijing as politely as possible that you were becoming an embarrassment to the united kingdom in our efforts to reestablish normal relationships with your government and we therefore offered to ensure your freedom if you choose to leave the embassy you were i can take care of my own freedom now this is hong kong his eyes narrowed his tone sharp youre at liberty dr xingyu to leave this boat on your own and go wherever you wish but before morning youd find yourself back in beijing and no longer free if youll i do not think that and i do not like all this this subterfuge it is not necessary and a man has been killed you say that is terrible terrible he is known for his extreme openness hyde in final briefing and his compassion you may find him difficult therefore to control thered certainly been no subterfuge i knew from the papers in his opposition to the communist party in beijing hed told them exactly what he thought of their failure to protect the welfare of the people dr xingyu pepperidge his yellow eyes holding the other mans steadily across the table you have a brilliant mind you must use it now as youve never used it before because the future of the chinese people depends on it xingyu stood up so quickly that he knocked his head against a beam but didnt flinch i can only help my people if i am with them in beijing i should not have come here i since youre here doctor i would ask you to do me the courtesy of hearing what i have to tell you xingyu stared him back for a moment and then dropped his head and sat down excuse me it was his wife i think who was most on his mind hed talked about her in the car on our way from the airport shed been meant to join him at the uk embassy as soon as she could get there i would not have gone there myself you see if i had thought she could not come it was a terrible mistake his wife and his friends most of them fellow professors at the university most of them now under arrest and inside bambu qiao prison many of the cells have no doors or windows hed told me there is only a trapdoor in the ceiling and you cannot stand upright the ceiling is too low you are more than excused dr xingyu pepperidge was looking down not wanting the chinese to find his eyes on him when he raised his head again youve got a lot to worry about i know that now i cant tell you as much as id like to because if the kccpc find you and take you back to beijing by force we dont want you to have any information about us that they might try to extract from you but if all goes well we might be able to send you back to beijing to greet the leaders of a new and democratic government this it would take years years if you were ready to cooperate with us dr xingyu it might take only a few days that is out of the question you do not realize dr xingyu you must be prepared to listen to me it took another ten minutes for him to get the message across and he didnt tell xingyu any more about the setup for bamboo than he had to know which was simply that when he went back to beijing it could be to help his people work out the structuring of a new china what he did tell him in great detail was more to the point you mustnt think then doctor that youre in any way our captive or under any kind of duress you can part company with us at any time you like but i want you to understand that my government has put a very great deal of work into this operation at the highest level and we dont feel that a person of your intelligence would allow an impulse to destroy our efforts on your behalf and incidentally on the behalf of the peoples republic of china pepperidge has a quiet voice and when hes talking about something important he measures his tone to catch your thoughts up in its rhythm this is why xingyu baibing was listening carefully now and not interrupting as hed done before i watched him as he listened because it was necessary to get an idea of his character the cut of his jib later it would help me and help him and perhaps save his life or mine we cannot expect from you pepperidge went on any assurance at this stage that you wont decide to leave the protection we offer you and go it alone a beat while he considered whether xingyus grasp of idiom was adequate to leave our protection and rely on your own resources headlights but id like your assurance at least that youll give us warning if at any time you feel you must go back to beijing which will always be a temptation for you he waited watching xingyu his eyes a degree more open alerted hed seen the headlights too through the cabin windows i tried twice to leave the embassy xingyu said hunched forward a little now his hands clasped and the fingers working the whispering of their dry skin audible below the beat of the rain on the cabin roof i tried twice thats what im talking about pepperidge said youre worried about your wife but i want you to understand you see that if you put your trust in us you may hope to be back with your wife much sooner perhaps in a matter of days silence for a moment then the big dry hands flew apart you talk of a few days but they have a stranglehold now the party a stranglehold on the people through the army the headlights werent moving now theyd swept their beam through the rain silvering the images out there on the quay and now the beam rested and only the rain moved slanting through it i looked at pepperidge did you order anyone in i meant support no i watched the headlights again you must put your trust you see in whatever we tell you pepperidge waited for it to sink in that isnt easy but its got to be done we know much much more than you do dr xingyu about this operation he leaned forward across the table and his voice was quieter still you remember what they did to the berlin wall were going to do something like that in china i looked at xingyu it had got his attention behind him on the varnished timbers the gloss darkened as the headlights went out dont worry pepperidge told me it practically amounted to instructions the executive in the field had brought the objective under protection but the mission was only two days old and thered been three people killed and we still had to get this man out of hong kong and into deep shelter and the risk was extremely high and the abovementioned executive was ready to get his nerve endings into an uproar at the sight of a pair of headlights point taken dont worry just as you say there are fifty boats tied up here and their owners come down to the quay by car and at night of course they have to switch their headlights on im not worrying thats good but hed noticed them the headlights id seen the reaction in his eyes i do not think you realize xingyu was saying the power of the people you have to deal with we realize it very well pepperidge leaned back again away from the good doctor and told him that we have our powers too told him that the planning of this operation had been made by some of the most brilliant men in british intelligence laid it on a bit thick i thought but wed got to convince the little bugger somehow to listen to pepperidge i listened to pepperidge while the blood from the ambassador crept its way to the curb and the snake spread its hood and the wheel went across the skull with the sound i suppose of a cracking coconut a coconut splitting open listened to pepperidge and watched another car come down to the quay and the ghostwhite shape of a jet go sloping down to kaitak with the strobes making white hazy explosions through the rain while he went on talking pepperidge and at last got an undertaking from xingyu for what it was worth then i will give you warning if i decide to go back to beijing i will give you warning pepperidge slid his rump along the bench to the far end and stood up calls for a spot of tea id say what about you chaps filling the kettle plugging it in it had been a lot of work getting even that much out of the chinese so well be leaving hong kong some time tomorrow cant say exactly when but the thing is wed rather like to put you on a plane for london naturally and look after you there while events develop in beijing would that suit london he seemed surprised xingyu though i couldnt think why it was the obvious place to keep him holed up a nice long way from the peoples republic of china and the merry boys of the kuo chi ching pao chu with their little trapdoors in the ceiling a safe haven i would have thought london placed under honorable house arrest in one of the discreet mayfair flats where even one young bobby would be enough to keep people away thats right pepperidge said and dropped two earl grey teabags into the pot just for a few days no the feet planted together the hands resting squarely on the blacktrousered knees i want to go to tibet the rain drummed on the cabin roof like a light rattle of shots tibet this bodes ill my friend this bodes ill indeed a car door slammed somewhere along the quay a few sardines no xingyu said pepperidge held the tin aslant under the small reproduction binnacle lamp peering at the trademark crown prince rich in natural fish oil no salt added theyre very good i wish to eat nothing i dont think xingyu was sulking although he was just sitting there hunched up with his forearms on the table now the big hands open empty empty of hope for the wife and the friends he believed hed deserted and that was it not sulking but despairing because pepperidge hadnt sounded too charmed by the idea of putting this man back into china which getting him to tibet would mean we couldnt take you through kathmandu pepperidge had told him because there wouldnt be time to make the trip by road from there to lhasa that is where you meant isnt it when you said tibet you meant lhasa yes i have friends there the thing is wed have to fly you in because thats all wed have time for and that means wed have to go hong kong to beijing to chengdu to gonggar as far as i know theres no air china flight direct from hong kong to chengdu without going through beijing which is out of the question sorry youve asked for the impossible i wish to go to lhasa i will be safe there that was an hour ago and pepperidge had compromised and signaled london through the scrambler and told them the situation they said theyd confer with bureau one and send his instructions we were still waiting i hadnt heard any footsteps after the car door had slammed out there on the quay i would have liked to hear footsteps going from the car to one of the boats i didnt want to think that a car had arrived and doused its lights and was just standing there with people inside people watching id come away clean from the airport thing and switched to the volvo and the chances that anyone had seen the switch and followed me were strictly slight but you cant you know you cant entirely ignore the nerves because its not always paranoia its sometimes a warning of danger culled from the observations of the subconscious and if you dont give it at least a bit of attention you can shorten your life without even trying pepperidge had told me the procedure if anyone came near this boat xingyu would be bundled quietly into the head and i would go to the sleeping quarters behind the curtains and pepperidge would stay where he was with his magnum on his knees under the table but it shouldnt come to that this thing about tibet had caught me unawares that was all xingyu had turned out so unpredictable and we couldnt trust him he must know we couldnt fly him to lhasa without going through beijing and that might be what hed got on his mind trying to jolly us into getting him back to beijing so that he could give us the slip there and leave the plane and rush off to join his friends in bambu qiao what you must realize pepperidge stirred his tea and watched xingyu watched him with no great affection is that we have to consider the timing of this operation our deadline as i have told you is in three days from now in three days we expect to be able to fly you into beijing with impunity a very different beijing from the one you have just left we you have not told me why it is to be in three days why it is not ten or twenty you tell me little that is essential for your own safety i have told you that also patience on a monument hyde had briefed me about the deadline three days would bring us to the th and that was when premier li peng was going to make a party address and launch a ferocious attack against the intellectuals it was on that day that we had to get dr xingyu baibing readied for the tv cameras instead it was information that id had to be given as the executive for the mission but it couldnt be given to xingyu because those three days were going to expose us to the entire force of chinese intelligence and security and i had a capsule to pop if i had to and xingyu didnt i have also told you pepperidge said that if we the phone was ringing and he answered it london you will on no account take the subject into tibet so forth good old bureau one but pepperidge was speaking in japanese and in less than half a minute he rang off i have also told you dr xingyu that if we are prepared to expose ourselves to very great danger on your behalf we expect you to give us as little trouble as possible he gave it time to get through that was the man who is coming to design the mask youll be wearing when you leave this boat his name is koichi and hell be here later tonight to take the matrix i shall wear a mask you see a wistful smile i tell you as much as i can i shall wear no mask without one pepperidge said gently you will never leave hong kong a free man i can assure you the telephone began ringing again and he picked it up yes he reached for his signals pad and i slid it along the table to him this yes was london headlights swung through the rain again their beams glancing across the long narrow ports and sparking on the polished binnacle lamp very much so pepperidge he argues that the last place the chinese will expect him to go is back into china a point which i concede and that he would only be fifteen hundred miles from beijing when were ready to fly him there he has very reliable friends in a monastery in lhasa with as tibetan monks a deep hatred of the chinese he listened again a point which i concede i think he threw that in to let london know that if they finally instructed us to take the subject into tibet then we would do that however dangerous we have our pride my good friend we have our principles a car door slamming outside on the quay two most of the boats tied up here were cruisers and i suppose the owners were coming back from the town after dinner there that would be natural while pepperidge was on the phone i watched xingyu again ready to glance away if he looked up hed put his hands into his coat pockets now and his face looked cold pinched id have put him at no more than forty fortytwo and the lines in his face were of strain i believed the long strain of living in a country that he called his own but a country where his worst enemies were the people who governed it ruled would be a better word ruled with the unanswerable power of the gun and the strain more recently of becoming separated from his wife i would have felt compassion for him as i had before except that he was now trying to drive us straight into a trap if he insisted on going to tibet and london approved check out the possibilities pepperidge was saying hed been on the phone ten minutes now listening more than talking and i hadnt been able to tell which way things were going i wished quite honestly that hed get it over so that i could know the worst or preferably not the worst understood he said and rang off and went straight to the telephone directory and began riffling through the pages not looking at me carefully not looking around as he sat perched on the end of the bench with his thin legs drawn up and his shoulders hunched a little as if against the rain outside or against the cloud no bigger than a mans hand that had been gathering in here while hed talked to london he picked up the phone and started talking again this time in mandarin to a woman i think his tone gentle even more gentle than usual giving her names hong kong and chengdu and gonggar which was the airport for lhasa i didnt understand the rest xingyu was listening attentively his head turned i watched pepperidge too his hunched shoulders head bent over the telephone and had the eerie feeling that i was watching him from the future looking back on him from some other time and some other place and remembering how it was when everything had become fixed in our affairs locking us in with our karma and this feeling persisted when he put the phone down and turned around and said to xingyu it would be out of the question as i told you to take you on any flight that would go via beijing but ive found that air china has a new charter service through chengdu direct and according to my instructions we shall be taking you into tibet mask koichi opened one end of the big plastic bag and lowered it over xingyu baibings shoulders with his head sticking out of the hole please excuse not polite to put gentleman in garbage bag you have had cast taken before no xingyu was sitting upright in a deck chair under one of the binnacle lamps koichi had tried talking to him in chinese when hed come aboard but either he wasnt fluent or the good doctor wished us all in hell and wasnt ready to exchange any courtesies i shall wear no mask hed told pepperidge you have sometimes claustrophobia no good sit still please he pulled a bald cap over xingyus head and drew the hairline across it with a felt pen and used the glue and began mixing the alginate in a bowl id seen this done before at norfolk as a demonstration not by this man but by the master himself robert schiffer i was now watching the operation again and very carefully because i might have to put this thing on xingyu myself when he flew into beijing pepperidge was on the telephone again talking in chinese presumably booking our seats on the charter flights he would leave before us on an earlier flight to set up the safe house and a base for himself in lhasa when xingyu had been using the head before the japanese had come aboard pepperidge had told me i spoke to bureau one personally and we agreed that the subject would be psychologically more manageable in tibet closer to his wife and friends than if we took him to london the point was made that we should let him feel endangered just as they are with the kccpc hunting him down what do you think i think youre right he wont feel quite so much that hes left his people in the lurch but it took some saying i didnt quite frankly fancy tibet exactly i dont believe actually that we would have stood much chance of getting him on a plane for london i think he wouldve slipped us and tried to get back to beijing i didnt expect him to be so bloody tricky now we know how he feels about his wife im surprised he ever agreed to coming out here to hong kong in the first place pepperidge had touched my arm it was the only way he could get out of the embassy and he wanted to get out of there to be with his wife hong kong was the only place the chinese would agree to for obvious reasons the only place outside china that was saturated with their security agents weve got to consider the man he is and make allowances hes always been ready to defy his government openly and in public and here we are trying to smuggle him through a security tunnel and he doesnt like that doesnt like subterfuge anonymity it had been an apology in a way pepperidge and bureau one had agreed to push me through the mission right under the nose of the kccpc and i hadnt got a choice these were instructions still please keep still xingyu baibing had started jerking his head around trying to say something the alginate was covering the whole of his face now and i suppose he was feeling stifled you say you do not have claustrophobia now i do this for you and you breathe better the timer went off and koichi reached around to the table and reset it from what ive seen at norfolk its not much of a joke the stuff has got to be pushed right into the corners of the eyes and under the lashes it wouldnt have made xingyu feel any better to know what the japanese was actually doing he was making a death mask as soon as you possibly can pepperidge was on the phone to someone else now in english i want to leave here in the morning not later than oh eight hundred my flights at nineohfive visas passports and visas there must have been a hitch somewhere because the bureau forgers in hong kong who serviced our far east sector would have got their instructions direct from london days ago ill pick mine up on my way to the airport youll bring theirs when you bring the car dont worry hed told me but he wasnt trusting the volvo out there there was almost no chance that anyone had seen us switch cars on our way here from the airport but if there was a chance in a thousand he wasnt taking it are all the bags ready one for xingyu one for me the clothes secondhand and worn a little hong kong labels on them the luggage tags already fixed the initials on the bags matching our cover names the only thing xingyu would take from here would be the insulin and the needles at whatever time pepperidge said and rang off must wait now koichi told us and his smile was a fraction weary to do that job really well is exacting ten minutes maybe fifteen when he left here hed be working most of the night to produce a positive from the negative and have it ready by morning what about a drink pepperidge asked him not yet when finished then some sake he touched the alginate here and there his fingers as sensitive as a blind mans will make you look older you understand maybe ten years older depressing but then he picked at the mask dropping a fleck of the stuff into the bowl but then when you take off young again very cheerful then it was nearly midnight when he peeled off the negative and studied the inside holding it to the light turning it nodding and frowning then the big grin came again it is good will be good mask finally pepperidge switched off the cabin lamps for a moment and koichi slipped through the door and vanished into the rain xingyu went into the galley and washed his face snorting and making a lot of fuss you are taking a great deal of trouble he said as he used a towel to protect me from the security forces and you say you are in favour of a democracy in my country but what possible interest could the british have in the fate of china were traders pepperidge told him and chinas a huge country with a lot of potential profit for the west i see you have no actual sympathy for the chinese people and their predicament but of course i would happily go to beijing and lead your people to freedom but my government believes that you can do it rather more effectively koichi was back before seven in the morning and fitted the mask and brought out his mirror for xingyu and i had a feeling of slipped focus putting myself in the place of the chinese and getting a sense of what was going through his mind because that wasnt his face in the mirror nothing like it an older mans unrecognizable all i could see of dr xingyu baibing were his eyes and they were frightened i suppose hed already begun to feel a certain loss of identity since hed run through the doors of the british embassy a week ago and asked for asylum to be sequestered among aliens and cut off from his wife and his friends and now he was on foreign soil and staring into a mirror at a face hed never seen before he wasnt after all an intelligence agent he was an astrophysicist its good pepperidge said its good koichi yes am satisfied sake now huge grin no is joke i go home now to xingyu when you leave here eight tomorrow pepperidge said eight in the morning i will come here half past seven to fit mask again he peeled it off and i noticed xingyu grab at the mirror again and stare into it and the fright go out of his eyes koichi laid the mask gently into a white cardboard box and went to the door of the cabin go home now a formal bow to xingyu thank you and one for us thank you and he was gone the rain had stopped and through the doorway i could see white mist clouding across the water of the bay and the bristling masts of the marina half lost in the haze their pennants hanging limp in the stillness of the morning a voice sounded a long way off and the slam of a hatch cover pepperidge briefed us a little before eight oclock this is the way it goes i shall take the nineohfive charter flight this morning to chengdu and change planes there for lhasa he was sitting at the table with two manila envelopes in front of him a courier had come to the boat in the night leaving some papers with pepperidge and three worn leather suitcases near the door in lhasa i shall go to the monastery youve indicated and tell them youre coming ill then go to my hotel you will take the same flight the next day keeping your distance from each other as strangers if the flights are on schedule theres a twentyfiveminute stop in chengdu and youll change planes but remember that flights are often overbooked unavailable or canceled because of bad weather the airport for lhasa gonggar ninetyfive kilometers from the city is notorious for strong winds and the caac will only allow flights when conditions are perfect he briefed us on customs immigration boarding requirements and slid one envelope across the table to xingyu and the other to me everything you need is there he was making less eye contact than usual this morning and was i thought a little reserved distant and it occurred to me that while i felt that he and bureau one had agreed to push me through the mission under the nose of the kccpc and had left me with no choice it couldnt have been easy for them if a wheel came off and we crashed pepperidge would have to answer to shepley and shepley to the head of state and just incidentally a nation of one billion people would have to go on living under the boot of a decadent clique until they were ready to risk more bloodshed in the streets you should also know pepperidge said that the charter flights out of hong kong were of course fully booked and we had to buy three cancellations and if any of the airline computers get things mixed up the passengers youre replacing are a mr brian outhwaite and a mr yan hanwu everything was done correctly so you have to insist that those are indeed your seats its standard bureau practice when a flights booked solid you send in a contact who picks the shabbiestlooking passenger in the waiting area and makes him an offer hes not liable to refuse for cancelling his flight and leaving a seat available thats all pepperidge said questions any support he looked at me briefly none on the first flight one at the airport in chengdu thats all a shrug well need because if the chinese secret police got on to us for any reason wed just have to argue things out in the interrogation cell pepperidge could send in a dozen people in support and there wouldnt be anything they could do because the kccpc wasnt just a private opposition unit in the field it controlled the field sharpeyed and gun at the hip we were going through the bamboo curtain and the only reason for putting a man into chengdu airport was to have him report to london if he saw us being hustled into a van signals through cheltenham his yellow eyes on me again but all youll have is a telephone booth have you made many calls in china no signals line then no contacts no couriers nothing just that one man in chengdu with a watching brief xingyu baibing was the most wanted man in china and that was where i was taking him and we couldnt risk anyone else getting near him because theyd know where he was and if they were picked up and put under the light they could break and speak and wed crash it was the way id always wanted to work no support in the field no contacts no cutouts no one who could get in my way id argued the toss about it time and again with loman croder shepley trying to make them see that i could work best when i worked solo this time id got what i wanted and felt lonely i lock up yes pepperidge said drop the key into the letterbox on the jetty no more questions he looked at xingyu who was sitting at the table with his head in his hands dr xingyu he looked up what no i have no questions perhaps it was partly the diabetes that was making him so depressed did diabetes make people depressed i didnt know didnt think so all i knew was that it was going to be a long day and a long night pepperidge looked at his watch and got up and let his eyes rest on me for a moment and then got the attache case with his name tag on it and opened the door of the cabin going out and looking around him smells nice he said after the rain its going to be a fine day she is very attractive this was at noon wed got through four hours together mostly in silence with the tension in xingyu filling the cabin you have seen photographs of her i said i had she is very attractive yes very and she is quite a little younger than i am as you know if you have seen her photograph i am a lucky man i didnt say anything he wanted to think aloud not talk to anyone but it was true the press photographs id seen of his wife showed that she was very attractive with a brilliant smile in some of the shots and younger than xingyu but from her description as brave marching with him in the streets sharing the contempt hurled at him in the government controlled media nationwide an intellectual xingyu chen a professor in economics i wish to telephone beijing this was soon after three in the afternoon hed lapsed silent for hours doing something with papers foolscap sheets hed found in a drawer of the small writing desk near the galley filling them with chinese script and mathematical hieroglyphs and formulae but now he wished to telephone to beijing i told him no i must know how she is he said and his eyes behind his heavy hornrimmed glasses were hard obstinate i must know that she is not being victimized victimized because of me because of me told him he couldnt telephone he knew that already pepperidge had told him enough times perhaps he thought id be softer to work on couldnt read faces very well i wish to telephone a friend a very close friend the dean of my department at the university he will know what is happening to my wife they will not trace the call you must realize that water slapped the beam of the boat as another vessel left the quay spreading a wake light dappled the bulkhead from the ports on the other side from the sunlit sea no i said they wouldnt trace the call but your friend would be excited to hear from you and would be very quick to tell your other friends and when one of the plainclothes armed peoples police on the campus picked it up your friends would be arrested is that what you want it took another hour to get him to see what his situation was really like to think more like an intelligence agent than a philosopher more like the most wanted man in china to understand that just by picking up the telephone over there he could send his best friends into the interrogation rooms in bambu qiao prison perhaps he managed to get a different perspective on himself i dont know i hoped so because he could let us take him through this mission as an exercise in clandestine intelligence work or he could drag us through the labyrinth with death and destruction grinning from the dark at every turn have you a wife back to that to his pretty chen no if you had a wife he reached for his worn black wallet and began opening it then shut it again and put it away remembering there was no photograph of her there anymore because pepperidge had cleared out the whole contents and sent them to london through our courier line for safekeeping if you had a wife like mine you would know what i mean said i was sure i would the next thing he wanted was a newspaper and i was surprised he hadnt asked for one before perhaps in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat he was forgetting the facilities of the outside world i didnt refuse him this time pepperidge had briefed me privately that within the stifling confines of the mission i was to allow xingyu as much freedom and as much information as i could to build his trust in me and keep him from going crazy i used the phone and told the contact what i wanted and fifteen minutes later a car stopped and there were footsteps and a knock on the cabin door three long two short three long and i opened it and took the copy of the south china morning post and gave it to xingyu he went through the first two pages and passed them to me not saying anything just prodding a finger at a halfcolumn report on the second page xingyu baibing sent into exile as the result of an agreement reached between the peoples republic of china and great britain dr xingyu baibing formerly professor of astrophysics at beijing university and a notorious agitator has been released from the british embassy here where he fled to evade arrest after fomenting dissension among his colleagues in the faculty this concession on the part of the peoples republic was granted in order to preserve the positive relationship between the two nations should dr xingyu choose to return to beijing of his own free will his present status as an exile in disgrace would be reviewed a source close to premier li peng has revealed but he would face a rigorous inquiry as to his actions before fleeing to the british embassy certain other intellectuals several of them friends of the exiled scientist havebeen placed under arrest and will be invited to explain their part in the unrest of the past two weeks and to volunteer information on the role played particularly by dr xingyu baibing so that the truth may be brought to light in the interests of the people the rest of the report was a summary of xingyus repeated attempts to interrupt the steady progress of socialism in the peoples republic and ended with praise for premier li pengs magnanimous gesture to great britain in relieving her of the embarrassment that inevitably followed her misguided decision to offer sanctuary to a notorious troublemaker whose continuing presence in her embassy could only have exacerbated her predicament photograph of xingyu carefully chosen from hundreds of others that had caught him with an expression on his face that could be seen as fearful hunted id asked for the englishlanguage morning post because it would give xingyu an indication of beijings attitude toward him and his present position the hong kong times would have slanted the report in sympathy with xingyu and would have used a different picture what worried me was that the post hadnt mentioned xingyus wife hadnt reported her feelings about losing her husband to the west a traitor to his people so forth i would have expected it to do that to turn the screw lying in my bunk hours later my eyes open and watching the play of light on the overhead from boats moving in the bay i went on worrying about it about the obviously deliberate omission of any reference to xingyus wife certain that it was designed to set him up in some way designed as a trap went on worrying instead of sleeping as the boat moved gently to the waves coming in from the bay and the lights played on the varnished timbers and the sound came of xingyus quiet sobbing in the dark chengdu have you been there before where to lhasa yes i said why did you go to meditate ah i saw the dalai lama once i didnt say anything he is beatific beatific the wheels went down with a thump and the cabin shuddered he radiates good you can see it like an aura i think the hong kong chinese chew more gum than the americans everyone im sure youve noticed does more american things than the americans do he personifies the second coming of christ i truly believe or he would i suppose if he werent a buddhist i saw xingyu scratching at his face again he was sitting five rows back from the flight deck i was in a rear seat from which i could watch everyone you dont talk much ive got toothache i said ah you should suck cloves the aircraft settled into the approach buildings below us now a waste ground of buildings block after block of apartment houses factories their smoke clouding like stirred mud across the bare winter trees of the apple orchards to the west chengdu i had expected trouble going through hong kong airport because that had been where the objective for bamboo was to have been completed to get dr xingyu baibing out of hong kong there was a new objective now to get him into tibet and under cover and protect him until he was needed in beijing but id still expected trouble going through the airport because the mask might not have been good enough or my own blue woollen cap and glasses might not have been enough to change my image that image hadnt been in view for more than a minute outside the terminal where id made the snatch on xingyu but someone might have remembered it but there had been no trouble in hong kong the chinese stewardess came down the aisle checking seat belts her face lit with a chinadoll smile the trouble came in chengdu you may find itching koichi had said koichi the japanese sometimes find itching under mask but do not scratch must think of something else huge grin think of very fine chinese dinner very good sizzling rice and everything there was no grass down there below us no trees nothing but stones asphalt bricks rooftops with a tangled web of electric cables spread across the streets to power the trams i would have liked to go forward and tell xingyu not to scratch to think of very good sizzling rice in a few minutes wed be going through immigration and customs checks and the mask had to go on looking perfect but i couldnt leave my seat now it was going to be more difficult of course to get through chengdu than out of hong kong in hong kong thered been a strong cadre of kccpc agents on the watch in chengdu there would be more simply because this was a major chinese airport and passengers from hong kong would be coming in effect from the west do you speak chinese not very much then i will try to buy some cloves for you scratching again xingyu he must be mad the cabin leveled off and we bumped three times and then the brakes came on and there was some chinese coming from the speakers and then some english all passengers must remain in their seats with their seat belts fastened until the aircraft comes to a stop for your information caac flight will depart from chengdu at pm in thirtyfive minutes from now your guide will escort you to the gate i got into the aisle without wasting any time and reached the queue at the immigration desk with xingyu ahead of me in plain sight the terminal was huge bleak echoing built on soviet lines and there were upward of a hundred people here in uniform with peaked caps most of them standing at the line of desks and farther out near the walls and the exit doors they formed what amounted to a living barricade a potential trap and it was now that i looked at xingyu standing there under the immigration sign and thought for the first time that there wasnt a hope in hell of getting him through this massive array of police and onto the flight for tibet not a hope in hell hed blow it the whole thing he wasnt an experienced agent not even an agent at all he might know the chemical composition of jupiter but he wouldnt know what to say when they asked him what his reason was for going to tibet hed remember what wed told him to say of course that he wanted to study the language but it wouldnt be the truth and hed been used to shouting the truth from the rooftops all his life it was in his character in his bones and he was going to tell these peakcapped robots his precise reasons for going to tibet he was going there to implement the overthrow of the communist party in beijing and let freedom ring throughout the land so forth while i stood here listening to the orders for the police to close in and take him away milling around him like a pack of starving dogs that had found a bone nothing you can do now its too late just stand here and wait for it stand here and wait sound of bedlam like bloody bedlam in this place because there was no carpeting no acoustic ceiling only the peeling paint of the walls and the scarred concrete floor and the vast dirtfilmed windows throwing the echoes across and across the hall with somewhere the tinny sound of music from the loudspeaker system or someones radio a chinese singing a bing crosby song im in the mood for love a hilarious thought a hilarious thought my good friend in a place where any kind of love had long since fled or died like a butterfly caught in a machine george are you going on with the rest of us look for gods sake dont give them any lip youll drop us all in the shit wheres jimmy then he said hed be here the united kingdom contingent not from hong kong doing the tibet trip a change of pace from majorca show them everything mate dont try any tricks everything all right a face close to mine suddenly the voice very quiet the eyes looking nowhere tell him i said to stop scratching his face he turned away and wandered about again passing close to xingyu ahead of me in the queue and then moving away standing at a distance looking around him for some lost sheep according to his cover aurora travel on the red plastic disk pinned to his lapel the man from the bureau sent here to signal london that hed seen the shadow executive and the subject land safely at chengdu and present themselves to immigration or of course to report that the subject had in point of fact been smothered suddenly in a scrum of policemen and hustled into a van outside it would depend wouldnt it on what the most wanted man in the peoples republic of china said to the smartly uniformed officer behind the desk on how he said it and on whether he was going to stop scratching his face until he tore a hole in the mask and finis all fall down he must be out of his mind marjories not coming scared blue eyes but she was on the plane shes not coming with us she wants to go back to hong kong the queue shuffled forward again dr xingyu baibing was the next in line at the desk not perhaps out of his mind no in the sense that he didnt realize the danger just being driven out of his mind by the itching under the mask itching can do that yes what on earth for she says she cant get her mind off what they did that time in tianen tia you know that square god that was ages ago tell her she says shes frightened of them shes never been in china before tell her shes all right with us i cant leave shes being sick in the lavatory then for gods sake go and help her tell her the plane goes in ten minutes shuffled forward again and xingyu got his papers out clumsily dropping one of them picking it up would they notice the blood hadnt gone to his face after hed bent down like that showing them the papers now while the man over there with the aurora travel badge swept his eyes across the crowd and didnt let them stop at xingyu one of the policemen took a step forward a step toward the desk stretching his legs perhaps but his eyes were watching the desk watching the little man there from the shadow under the peak of his cap the shadow thrown by the bleak neon lights that hung from the iron rods under the ceiling while the noise went on the din of so many voices of so many people trapped in here like cattle in a slaughterhouse but we must not must we let our imagination get out of hand we must not be sick in the lavatory joyce whos going to take her back to hong kong then if we cant stop her going could ask harry god not harry shes not in the mood for anything like that harry wouldnt care presenting his papers our little messiah the only hope for a billion people out there in the rice fields and the factories and the universities living their daily lives in the shadow of the tanks the only hope shepley must have had a brainstorm when hed set this thing up instructing us to take a man like xingyu through three airports hong kong and chengdu and gonggar under the eyes of the kuo chi ching pao chu gone clean out of his mind and not much better ourselves pepperidge and i we should have rehearsed this poor little bugger told him what it was going to be like when he landed back inside his beloved country what they would ask him at the immigration desk what he should tell them rehearsed him until he could have gone through this checkpoint wordperfect but in fact we couldnt i suppose have done that to him he would have told us we were playing spies being melodramatic knew his galaxies didnt know his codes no go my good friend its going to be no go because the officer at the desk is beckoning the man over there the plainclothes supervisor and he is going over to the desk his steps measured whats holding us up i dont know look go and help kate with majorie ill keep your place you cant do that here you wait a minute excuse me but do you mind if my friend just went to the toilet shen me shi my friend here oh god he doesnt let me help zheiwei nushi xiang qu cheshud ramhou huldao queue xing oh im much obliged go on doris get her back here so i can talk to her for gods sake were going to miss that plane the air cold in in here with the harsh reek of the factory smoke creeping in under the doors the lights clouded some of the tubes flickering some of them dark they dont run a good ship here my friend they do not run a good ship their methods are crude and their thinking is proscribed conditioned and they will throw him into the van like a common criminal while i go on shuffling forward like a puppet not daring to leave the queue and follow him follow them hoping to do something miraculous and get him away get him to ground not daring to do anything except shuffle forward and go through the charade and get out of here because this was no place for miracles get out of here and signal london let the hand pick up the piece of chalk and change the board executive reports subject lost to kccpc chengdu airport lt the man from the bureau was watching the desk his dead stare fixed now i couldnt see much of xingyu because he was shorter than the three girls in front of me and they were moving around anxious for marjorie i watched the man over there instead we had in this instant established signals he would swing his head and look at me when anything important happened there under the immigration board under the flickering lights would let a smile touch his mouth if all were well or leave his stare on me and move his head to and fro by the smallest degree if all were not well if the trap slammed shut finito shes got no need to be frightened of them for gods sake theyre only people its just the air trip getting to her stomach thats all this is all we needed its what weve got well muddle through somehow were british the stink of the smoke in here was enough to make anyone sick it wasnt the air trip but youre wrong my little love youre wrong you know there is every need to be frightened of these people there is every need they are the people with the tanks movement suddenly at the desk as the officer got to his feet and another one came up and the plainclothes supervisor nodded and turned away and the man from the bureau swung his head and looked at me with his mouth relaxed and i saw dr xingyu baibing leave the desk and pick up his bag and walk slowly away folding his papers and putting them into the pocket of his sheepskin coat i went forward and passed through the checkpoint and then customs and joined our charter group how is your toothache much better but he was reading a newspaper caac charter flight no to gonggar will depart from gate at all passengers must report to gate for embarkation they were already lined up windbreakers and sheepskin jackets and woolen hats and skiing gloves or red hands rubbing together heavy boots combat boots a whole line of boots with the people tethered by them to the littered concrete swaying in the stream of cold filthy air from the ventilators all of them except xingyu baibing he was reading a newspaper standing near the poster on the wall mitsubishi holding the paper quite still and concentrating on a certain page a certain column and as i walked over to him i knew id blown bamboo i shouldnt have let him buy a paper they hadnt set a trap for him here in chengdu specifically theyd set a trap for him everywhere wherever he might go once hed got out of hong kong theyd been prepared even for the impossible that somehow despite their agents there hed get clear of hong kong and theyd set a supertrap that couldnt fail he was in it now and it had sprung were boarding i said as if nothing had changed as if by one chance in a thousand i was wrong he looked at me his eyes smoldering the newspaper trembling between his hands passengers for flight no for gonggar are now boarding all passengers for gonggar must report immediately to gate for departure xingyu pushed the newspaper towards me dead top of page two wife of dissident in prison dr xingyu chen wife of the exiled scientist xingyu baibing who left the peoples republic yesterday in disgrace was arrested late last night in their apartment in beijing and taken to bambu qiao prison where she is now undergoing intensive interrogation in the hope that she can be persuaded to inform the authorities on the whereabouts of certain friends and colleagues also wanted for questioning and to offer information particularly on her husbands subversive activities at the university though nothing official has been announced a source requesting anonymity has declared that if the exiled dissident xingyu baibing were to return voluntarily to beijing for interrogation his wife would in all likelihood be released immediately i folded the paper hey come on youre with our lot arent you xingyu stood facing me i must go to beijing no i said you cant do that you cannot stop me sumay she came floating toward me big eyes in a small pinched face her body swathed in the folds of a hooded fur jacket too big for her the hide torn and patched and stained floating toward me looking rather like an eskimo child though she wasnt a child more like a grownup china doll they have asked me to assist them she said i tried to relax and she stopped floating on our way from gonggar to the city the tour guide had told us that at eleven thousand feet we might hallucinate sometimes there was oxygen he said at most of the hotels assist them i didnt know why it was anything to do with me that theyd asked her to assist them the people in uniform behind the long cluttered counter chinese public security officers one of them watching me steadily would have worried me if it werent for the fact that hed never seen me before hadnt been outside the airport in hong kong when wed done the xingyu thing on the other hand i wasnt totally at ease theyd picked me up in a military jeep and brought me here for questioning and my passport and visa and alien travel permit were spread all over the counter and the psb officer would certainly recognize me again if we crossed paths with your case she said i hadnt got a case id left it in my cell at the monastery with xingyu looking after it i see i said she meant my case of course criminal charges so forth i suppose if the bureau knew id got arrested within an hour of entering lhasa on a strictly zerozero clandestine operation theyd call me in straight away wouldnt blame them but that wasnt all id done since wed flown out of chengdu it was not all my good friend that i had done but i dont want to think about that now i want to listen to this little china doll and find out if i can rescue anything from the wreckage xingyu is safe yes concentrate on that he is safe and among friends at the monastery and you can say if you want to be charitable that ive completed the mission the objective of which was to get dr xingyu baibing out of hong kong but we remember dont we that bamboo has a new objective now i have to get him back into beijing when the time is right and im not sure how i can do that if these people throw me into jail i think she was waiting for me to say something what exactly is my case you were out of bounds ah i didnt know in fact when the military jeep had pulled up and the soldier had shouted something to me above the noise of the engine id thought he was offering me a lift i told her this the throttle had got stuck i suppose with the engine roaring like that or he was having to keep it running somehow with the windchill at minus forty degrees she was telling them what id said in very fast mandarin her tiny porcelain teeth flashing their way through the syllables mandarin has got something like four hundred syllables and theyve all got several tones and if you dont get them exactly right you might as well speak dutch its a real bitch they say there are signs posted i dont read chinese there are signs in english military road out of bounds i didnt see anything in the kind of english anyone would recognize i must not tell them that i know id said it to find out which side she was on though it already seemed fairly clear she was one of a dozen or so people in here lined up along the counter with their papers or arguing with their hands chinese tibetans nepalis muslims kashmiris a couple of roundeyes tourists traders yak herders women with braided hair men with high boots and sashes and daggers all of them wrapped in shawls and hides and furs against the cold outside in here it was close to eighty with two enormous yakdung stoves burning smoking the place out i assumed theyd all been hauled in on some kind of charge this was a psb office where the people on the other side of the counter in beijing and shanghai and chengdu had got their clubs out on that june night and gone to work there would be a basement under this place underground cells what will you tell them then i asked the girl it is difficult you were on a military road but i think perhaps that if you made profuse apologies they might listen especially if you behave contritely one of the officers pushed a flap open at the end of the counter and beckoned a man through and took him to one of the doors at the back with two other officers closing in everyone stopped talking while this happened then the noise started up again then of course i apologize began using my hands i apologize profusely shooting the officer looks of penitence and i shall certainly make sure i read the signs in the future he didnt turn to look at the girl as she translated but went on looking at me hed been seventeen once seventeen eighteen top of his class and fond of sports taken his mum and dad out sometimes given them a treat told them he wanted to go into something he could be proud of something thatd make them proud of him say the police force and this afternoon he was standing here with the gun and the truncheon on his belt and hoping for the chance of pushing the flap open at the end there and throwing me into a cell and beating me up if i wouldnt answer questions this wasnt beijing this was the holy city but last year thered been troops brought in by the thousand to quell the uprising and more monasteries burned and more corpses dumped into military trucks and taken away for mass burial in the gaping earth with the bulldozers standing by he says it is not enough i hadnt thought it would be then id be happy to pay a fine i meant it to sound naive to let them know i didnt really understand the gravity of the charge the least i was going to get away with was a night in the cells and that was no big deal in itself but it meant that i would become more familiar to them over the hours more recognizable that could be fatal later for me or for xingyu baibing or both the girl turned back to me and went on speaking in chinese and corrected herself yes you must pay a fine of fifty yen and write a confession thats very generous you have money to pay i got my wallet and put down a y note and she pushed it across the worn paintchipped counter the young officer looked at it as if it were a piece of yak dung but in a moment pushed my passport and the other stuff over to me and i put them away you will receive fifty yen change the girl said now we will go over there rickety desk one of the dozen in here with a cheap ballpoint tied to a nail with a bit of dirty string some kind of stool to sit on though i didnt trust it write please she pointed to the block of schoolroom paper and took her hand away quickly when she noticed it was trembling in transgressing the laws of this city i have shamed my ancestors the ballpoint ripped a gash in the gray thin paper and she tore off the sheet and i started again certain roads here are strictly out of bounds and they are adequately provided with signs to this effect in chinese english and french in failing to take notice of the signs i am guilty of a grave lack of attention the door banged open and someone came in with a chicken underneath each arm and one of them let out a piercing squawk and flew into the air and sent a streak of white droppings across the counter and one of the psb men shouted and someone else caught the poor bloody bird by one wing and bashed it against the wall my ancestors are disturbed in their honorable sleep by my fall from grace on this sorry occasion and my esteem in their eyes has grievously diminished the pen dried up and she got me another one from the next desk pulling the looped string carefully off the nail in a show of deep respect for psb property in case she was being watched finally i wish are you cold her eyes widened as she looked up at me it is not cold in here then it was fear making her hands shake it was also in her eyes fear of committing even the tiniest breach of protocol damaging their bit of string interrupting the written confessional by normal conversation she looked down at the pad write please and do not interrupt finally i wish to apologize sincerely for the trouble i have caused the officers of the public service bureau and vow that such a transgression will not occur again they were pushing the man with the chickens out of the door and a gust of freezing air blew in again a wind had got up soon after wed landed in gonggar today do you wish to add anything the girl asked me my late aunt ermyntrude would also be shocked clean out of her celestial corsets by my lamentable fall from grace but wed better not put that we had better my good friend not put anything like that i am simply feeling a touch lighthearted youll understand because theyre going to settle for fifty yen and this bit of bullshit and i could well have got their goat in some trivial way and finished up in the basement chained to the wall far better to take all possible notice of my little eskimo here and walk on eggshells id like to thank them for their leniency i told her no they might decide to double the fine one must understand please sign what you have written she tore it carefully off the pad and took it over to the counter and we had to wait until theyd dealt with a youth in a smart leather jacket and sunglasses chewing gum as if he were starving while he showed his papers and they told him to take off his sunglasses and he didnt want to and they snatched them off for him and flung them across the floor then the girl went forward and read my confession in chinese while the psb man watched me the whole time and i looked penitent and hoped to god wed got it right because id got quite enough worries already with xingyu baibing sitting up there in his cell on the top floor of the monastery sitting there like a time bomb because thered been nothing else i could have done thered been nothing the psb man put out his hand and the girl gave him the sheet of paper and he scanned it for long enough to make it look as if he could read a bit of english and then tore it in half and jerked his head toward the door we can go she told me do you know this place well this restaurant lhasa yes i have been here often i am an air stewardess with caac she looked down quickly perhaps because in the torn patched coat that was too big for her she knew she looked more like a vagrant when are you flying out i didnt imagine she was flying anywhere but i wanted to keep her talking the minute wed left the psb office shed told me shed show me a cheap place to eat and when wed got here shed asked if we could sit together and i realized she was starving and hadnt any money i wont be flying out for a time she said theyd brought up some bowls of noodles and meat dumplings and she was using her chopsticks busily youve got friends in lhasa yes she looked up at me then down again i cannot impose upon friends i began listening between the lines because that was the way she communicated id seen she was starving and i knew that when we left here id be paying the bill and when she told me shed got friends here id wondered why they werent looking after her and shed told me she couldnt impose but shed helped me with the confession thing and i was in her debt and here we were in this place with smoke creeping out of the seams in the pipe above the stove in the corner and condensation trickling down the windows and the dogs under the table snarling and scuffling in competition for any scraps that might fall whats your name sumay wang she said putting it the western way round what is yours victor locke im just here for a few days are you on holdover or what i didnt like asking direct questions but there wasnt much time i had to find the barkhor hotel and report to pepperidge and then get back to the monastery before ten oclock because of the curfew and i needed to know exactly how useful this girl could be exactly how well she knew the town because id found that the local laws and restrictions were like booby traps and i couldnt afford to be run into another psb office theyd throw me into the cells for a week next time just to make me pay attention no sumay said im not on holdover she stopped eating and for the first time looked at me steadily in the eyes and her question was clear enough could she trust me then she bent her head again over the bowl of food things are bad she said in china you are a tourist yes what do you think of things in china i think theyre tragic the bloodshed that time in tiananmen and the crackdown thats been going on ever since she finished her bowl would you like some more tukpa very much i got the man over and she ordered in slow careful tibetan then turned back to me the british are on our side on the side of the people you dont imagine wed support the primitive thugs youve got in your government i hope trade went on she said evenly between the british and those primitive thugs nothing has changed i realize that it was disgusting were like any other people we dont always agree with what our government does whats he asking for there was a young boy waving his hand in front of my face a pen dont give him one she said a sharp word or two in tibetan and he moved on my father is missing she said in a moment a man in an ancient fur hat was watching me from the next table but i didnt think there was any problem roundeyes get watched quite a bit in the backwaters of the orient there wasnt any question of checking the environment in this place it was like a flypaper with as many people in here for warmth as for the food id done a lot of routine checking on the flight into gonggar and on the caac bus into lhasa and wed been absolutely clean xingyu and i and no one would have got on to me here in the city no one clandestine but i began looking around me now for anyone who looked as if he could understand english because shed started saying things that were potentially dangerous missing from home yes and from his university that is why i am worried as you have noticed that is why i am here youre missing too yes she was looking me in the eyes again losing her unwillingness to trust me he disappeared a week ago when the wave of arrests began he left a note for me saying i must not worry they are hunting for him now he is quite an important man an important dissident a shrug of course there are many there are thousands we stopped talking when the man brought the food shed ordered and waited until hed gone i asked her why shed come to tibet it was the next flight on my schedule they use relatives you see as hostages it is a wellestablished practice they want my father in prison or perhaps executed and they would have me arrested on some pretext anything will suffice one must understand suspicion is enough and then they would have reported it in the media to bring my father out of hiding to take my place i must go to beijing xingyu staring at me in the bleak light of the airport at chengdu you cannot stop me you simply got off the plane here i said and didnt go back yes others have done this many of us have brothers sisters who are students or parents who teach some of my friends have gone to hong kong and stayed there but if they are picked up and sent back they will be accused of fleeing the country of evading their responsibilities as citizens i am perhaps safer here i have not fled my country then what she was saying what she was feeling bore down on her suddenly and her eyes took the weight of it the life going out of them its difficult to tell the age of an oriental she had looked until this moment no more than twenty with her clear luminous eyes and her flawless skin though she was probably more than that now she had grown suddenly old though her skin hadnt changed the only expression was in her eyes and they looked out on a frightening world with the despair of middle age when for so many things for so many people it has become too late my father is missing they would have arrested me i have not fled my country not the burden of the years but of being a young woman in china in this year of such little grace your mother she looked down and began eating but from habit they do not agree my mother is against his activities his protests if they arrested her mother then hed be unlikely to come out of hiding where are you from sumay beijing that is where the worst happens the worst of it all for me i am worried now because my father will find out i am missing too and he may believe i have been arrested they might even lie and report it in the media that i have been arrested but from here from lhasa it is difficult for me to get a message to him saying i am safe there are people i could write to but it is dangerous to send letters many are opened telephones are monitored they catch many that way she looked up as a beggar came and crouched by the table an empty tin bowl cupped in his hands his eyes hollowed and demanding not imploring as he attacked our indifference give him nothing she told me or we shall have dozens here she waved him away they have come from remote places to the holy city and have no money left she shrugged i am the same but they have come here to pray i have come here on a rueful breath maybe it is the same thing dark was coming slowly against the windows and more people were arriving packing against the bar counter shoulder to shoulder two psb officers came in their guns silhouetted on their hips their eyes hidden by the shadow of their caps and i caught a look on the face of sumay as she saw them not fright something like disgust as if shed seen something obscene they moved between the tables and the people pressed back to give them room again it seemed to me not from fear or in deference but as if wanting to distance themselves from lepers beijing shed said was where the worst had happened but the people of lhasa would disagree seeing as they had the sky black with the smoke of burning monasteries hearing as they had the crackle of bullets and the cries of grief i waited until the two officers had left if you like sumay i can get a message to your father in beijing telling him youre safe she almost dismissed it you are a tourist i can do it i said if you like she brought her hands to her face suddenly knocking her bowl and spilling some food how with great discretion but how she held her face staring at me from over her spread fingers by word of mouth in a moment you are not a tourist then a tone of suspicion tourists were harmless a gaggle of gawpers pointing at things strange to them finding most of them funny i was not one of them if i could get a message to her father i must be something else not what i seemed and therefore suspect yes i said im a tourist but ive got friends in beijing close friends think about it and let me know if you want me to help but how would you tell them her hands came away from her face and she leaned across the stained barewood table you must not use the telephone or theres someone leaving here for beijing tomorrow by the morning flight from gonggar i would tell him she closed her eyes slowly compressing her mouth praying for patience i think in a moment her eyes coming open with nothing in them but fright you do not understand how dangerous this is you are just a tourist people speak people betray sometimes without intention one must understand my country is full of spies informers one does not any longer know ones friends trust ones friends it is like in nazi germany a child will give away his parents to the police because he has been indoctrinated my country is full of fear she didnt look away but she hesitated do you know what they asked me to do the psb men they asked me to follow you when you left there and see where you went and go back and report i said my mother was very sick so i had no time to help them this is how it is in my why are they interested in me simply because you are from the west and might be a journalist they are most afraid of foreign journalists because lhasa is always on the point of rebellion like most cities now in china and they dont want the news to get out all they can do is expel the journalists in time and that is almost as bad an admission that something will happen that must not be seen hesitation again and then your friend what does he do another man came with a tin bowl already with scraps of food in it to show how generous others had been his hands thinned to the bone under the skin his face whittled by want zdukai she said zdukai he went off his bowl clanging against the corner of the table i think she was afraid of being overheard more than anything she couldnt leave it alone this thing about getting word to her father i said my friend is chinese a lawyer he knows as much as you do about the danger of indiscretion in point of fact the message would go to her father through the mast at cheltenham and the signals board in london to the british embassy at beijing and then to one of our sleepers or agentsinplace why should you help me her hands had gone to her face again as if she wanted to hide as best she could from whatever treachery there might be in me in the west i said we hear the news from china and we feel great sympathy for the people its not often we can really do something to help and its a chance for me ill be envied when i go home not untrue harry the man who looks after things at my flat had gone out and got drunk after hed watched the tiananmen square thing on the screen that night in june he cant stand seeing things in cages told me hed screamed his head off the first time his mum took him to a zoo you will be envied i dont think she believed it but wanted to because her eyes were suddenly wet it is difficult for us to understand that we have friends outside our country we feel alone and isolated so when you say you will help me like this it then she couldnt stop the tears and tugged the edges of her mangy fur hood across her face and sat there with her long eyes squeezed shut and her body rocking backward and forward in its shapeless coat while one of those bloody dogs under the table bit my ankle and i gave it a smart kick and got a yelp the boy came around again with the teapot and i showed him some money and he peeled off a couple of notes and went away not even glancing at the girl i suppose because it wasnt unusual for women to weep in this ravaged city i do not feel well one must understand sumay said at last it is the highaltitude sickness have you felt any symptoms bit lightheaded sometimes our tour guide had warned us on the bus ride from the airport the best thing was to rest up for the first two or three days take it easy and if anyone had any bloodpressure or chest problems he shouldnt have come here at all this place was a killer so forth he wasnt joking one must take it seriously sumay said refusing to talk any more about the other thing lost her pride crying like that lost face one must be very careful so they tell me i said now write down the name and address of your fathers friend the one we have to contact and give it to me for a moment she pretended not to know what i was talking about and then found a bit of paper and went over to the counter for a pen and came back and wrote looking up at me only once with her eyes deep and with an expression in them that clearly said if you betray me i shall lose my trust at last in all humankind then bent her head again and finished writing and gave me the scrap of paper professor hu zhibo the faculty department of economics beijing university and can he get the message to your father yes and the message is that you are safe and well nothing else in a moment and that i love him all right you can perhaps i should put the name of the place where i am staying in lhasa no we want nothing in your heads the executives in training are told at norfolk that we wouldnt want anyone to get out i am grateful she said with quiet formality little enough to do shed have a bad time tonight not getting to sleep because of the thoughts flying at her in the dark that i wasnt what i seemed that shed been out of her mind to trust me but there wasnt anything i could do about that the most fervent protestations of good faith are the most suspect we drank the rest of our tea and went out into the freezing wind and through the streets to her brokendown guesthouse near the market and i left her there and found a streetlight and got out the caac map pepperidge had left the name of his hotel in code for me at the monastery with a crossstreet bearing and i walked on again with my head down against the wind not looking forward to seeing him not looking forward to it at all because i was going to tell him what id had to do at chengdu airport to stop xingyu from going back to beijing and pepperidge would realize what it was going to do to the mission if london didnt abort it straight away and call us in tea i left him in charge of a monk will that be all right pepperidge asked he meant was i certain that xingyu baibing would still be there when i went back that he wouldnt be got at that he wouldnt decide to leave the monastery of his own free will yes i said securitys the best we can hope for and weve reached an agreement slight understatement well done spot of tea not just now if you havent got a hot shower where you are come along here he was squatting in a cowhide chair with his long legs drawn up and his heels on the edge of the seat watching me with his pale yellow eyes and taking everything in this was the barkhor hotel chinese not tibetan no sign of luxury but he didnt want that all he wanted was a telephone and there was one here feel all right he asked me firstclass altitudes not a problem ive hallucinated a couple of times thats all wouldnt want to do much running yet wont have to he wanted to sound reassuring in our language running doesnt mean just around the park youll need your pad i told him debriefing call it that i went across to the narrow bed and sat with my back against the wall mind of course not rest all you can i wasnt quite sure where i should start so i looked around the room while he got his pad cracks in the wallplaster the cantonese rug worn to a hole in the middle some kind of bleached burlap for the curtains not totally opaque i could see a streetlight in the distance picture of premier li peng over the bamboo chest of drawers shot of three pretty chinese girls being photographed against the gates of the forbidden city cockroach moving in fits and starts along the bottom of the wall telephone on the bed table with its plastic chipped and the cable in knots was that our lifeline to london he was waiting pepperidge all right i said but you wont like it much just before we got on the plane in chengdu this morning xingyu bought a newspaper and there was a trap in it i saw it pepperidge said did you for some odd reason it made me feel a bit better well he read that part and told me he was going straight back to beijing and you told him he couldnt your director in the field doesnt normally jolly you along like this youre meant to give it to him straight and he just shorthands it or puts it on tape and then he starts asking the questions but pepperidge is a kind man and he knew i was going to tell him something quite appalling but you wont like it much and he was just helping me along more than youd get from that bastard loman yes i said i told him he couldnt you cannot stop me facing me under the bleak tube lights the blast of cold air from the ventilators sending a corner of the newspaper fluttering between his hands that is a trap id told him dont you know that he went on staring at me hadnt heard of traps in newspapers thought i must mean something else your wifes not in danger they just want you to think she is to get you back there try and understand how do you know that its an old trick thats all theyre just working on your emotions if you you cannot say that you cannot give me any guarantee that my wife is safe he shook the paper pushing it against me it could be true dont you understand no one is safe in beijing i heard the girl at the gate talking to the tour guide raising her sharp thin voice we were going to be late so forth i got the paper out of xingyus hands and folded it bunching the bloody thing up and throwing it into the big oil drum against the pillar and standing close to him talking quietly holding his arm looking into his masked face and moving into his mind with my own just as theyd done the people in beijing dr xingyu youre playing into their hands and if you go back now your wife wont see you again not the man you are now not when theyve finished with you all were asking of you is three days and in three days you can go back to beijing do you understand youve got look if youre coming with us tour guide its now or never come on i am not going with you xingyu said and turned away and began walking and i caught him up when we land in gonggar you can phone your wife then youll you say three days why three days its all the time we need you to do what i know nothing of what you are trying to do nothing i am going back to beijing tour guide shouting now youd better phone my office okay tell them what happened the need to make a decision came right up against my face and i stopped walking and thought about it thought about everything all the options all their permutations and finally faced the stark fact that if dr xingyu baibing got as far as the checkin counter across there and booked to beijing we were finished and there was only one way i could try stopping him caught up with him again and said if you knew our plans for you you wouldnt want to go back to beijing that is possible if i knew but i do not know standing together in the unearthly light of this place attracting god knew what attention from the police and the plainclothes psb agents among the crowd with bamboo ticking to doomsday on the big round clock so i told him pepperidge didnt react how much most of it when did you tell him there wasnt time at the airport i just gave him my word that if he caught our plane id answer any questions he wanted to ask he sat very still pepperidge the pad on his knee and the ballpoint sticking out from his thin wrinkled fingers his eyes looking down and in a moment he said gently well theres always something that can be done he should have blown my head off i felt very tired suddenly as if id been climbing a real bitch of a mountain and got to the top felt i could let go at last flop out because id told him now id got it over very tired indeed suddenly or perhaps it was the ams the tour guide had warned us about acute mountain sickness exactly the one id just been climbing im sure you see my little joke what else could i have done sounded angry didnt have the gentleness of this bloody saint didnt have the kind of philosophy that was going to get us through this one if anything could not much he said well yes i could have gone on arguing the toss with xingyu until the plane had left taken him to a hotel and called london not having pepperidges number in lhasa yet called london and told them the situation and asked for instructions let them take this one on their back or i could have told xingyu to phone his wife or a trusted friend anyone in beijing who could have told him there was nothing in fact to worry about his wife was only under house arrest with no interrogation going on but it might not have worked all that well because the pretty xingyu chen could indeed be in bambu qiao under a fivehundredwatt lamp bulb and it would have been someone else whod answered the telephone a colonel of the kccpc whod been stationed in their apartment to wait for this very call or i could have simply tried to muscle him onto the plane for gonggar a center knuckle on the nerves here and there to get his attention to show him i was serious but of course he could well have reacted started an uproar and they would have closed in rather smartly the chaps in their peaked caps and finis my good friend finite the alternative i said would have been to try keeping the man hanging around chengdu scratching his mask off while i tried phoning london or tried getting some news from beijing and you dont have to explain so i shut up hed thought out all the alternatives for himself in five seconds flat but i hadnt been trying to tell my director in the field how to suck eggs id wanted him to know that id seen what the alternatives were and seen that they werent worth using but he would know that too i closed my eyes and let the whole thing ride because i was going to need my strength someone my gentle dip or my control in london or bureau one himself would have to work out what to do next and their instructions could be frightening it had seemed so easy almost a model exercise the shadow executive was to take charge of a distinguished dissenter from beijing at hong kong airport and keep him discreetly sequestered for a day or two and then send him back to the capital when all was ready the distinguished dissenter would not of course be informed of the main operation would know nothing of the peoples liberation army general who would contain tiananmen square with his tanks while dr xingyu baibing the hero of the hour went before the television cameras in the great hall of the people and offered to lead his country out of the shadow of communism and into the light of democracy things were different now hed picked up the paper plopping sound like a silenced shot i let my lids open a degree and saw pepperidge had pulled the cork out of his big thermos flask a drop now i said do you good rest a lot drink a lot yes rest drink but do not be merry my masters tis not the hour if he hadnt done that xingyu if he hadnt picked up the paper there would have been no missionbreaker no ultimate risk of something happening that could blow the whole enterprise even if xingyu was killed in some kind of unexpected action he could be replaced by someone in front of the television cameras a disciple of the messiah who could still do the job at a pinch even if they blew us the kccpc blew pepperidge or me or both we would pop our capsules to protect security and london could replace us and the operation could still proceed if xingyu was captured and sent back to beijing and brainwashed it could still proceed because the army general would still make his move and xingyus replacement would still do his job at a pinch but now we had a missionbreaker we would have to go on from here in the face of the ultimate risk cheers pepperidge gave me a mug of tea cheers i said and the ultimate risk was buried like a bomb inside the head of dr xingyu baibing himself he knew everything now because id had to tell him and if they got at him tomorrow or the next day and put him under implemented interrogation hed blow every phase of bamboo like a firecracker and within the hour the pla general in beijing would be arrested and shot and his division ordered out of the capital and when xingyu was finally propped in front of the cameras like a ventriloquists doll theyd wind him up at the back and hed say hed been wrong after all hed say that the people had mistaken their way along the road to socialist salvation tempted by foreign blandishments hed say they must hold high the torch and keep the faith while all over the city and across the nation a hush would fall and hope for the future would limp away like the beggar at my table in the cafe his tin bowl empty pepperidge sipped his tea i shant inform london i sat up straighter youve got to i see no reason this is major you cant just go it alone i dont see he said slowly that london could have instructed you to do anything else at chengdu other than what you did i think you took the only way out and it must have shaken you to do it i can only commend your decision he was going right out of his way this time but it wasnt just charity we were going to have to keep the mission on track if we could and the director in the field didnt want to run a shadow executive who was living on the edge of his nerves because hed made an ultrasensitive move without asking londons permission few things you should know he said before we make up our minds what were going to do ive been in signals with london quite a bit since i got here picked up some of the gossip the bombay police found a body in a canal last night been garotted head half off but with the face still there and papers intact in his wallet five snake bites on him it was sojourner i thought about it and then asked him are they certain oh yes two of our people were flown out from london to dig up the facts apparently sojourner was released from the intensivecare unit twentyfour hours after he went in there and a friend of his fetched him from the hospital he was reported as being still weak but ambulatory and his friend hindu declared he would look after sojourner with great care how old was the friend i asked that too because of what youd told me he was an adult not the boy of course it wasnt necessarily that man who killed him though it looks like it theyre trying to put everything together he brought the thermos over and sat on the edge of the bed top you up the only thing that worries us of course is that he might have been interrogated during the time when he was escorted from the hospital and the time he was killed for the moment london is assuming that sojourners assassin didnt get it right the first time and simply had to finish him off snake venoms uncertain in its effect depends on body weight and general constitution whatever they find ill let you know if he was interrogated i said and they got everything out of him lets not think about it on the more positive side getting up and fetching a news clipping from his briefcase when dr xingyu was at our embassy in beijing they asked him if hed got any photographs of himself taken abroad and he came up with this one among others headandshoulders shot saying cheese against the background of big ben unmistakable caption dr xingyu bribing released yesterday from the british embassy in beijing in london for talks with the foreign office any chance theyll swallow it not much the first place beijing would expect him to go is of course london and of course they would have posted a very large contingent of their people at heathrow to watch for him but who knows they might fall for the snapshot he took another sip of tea and sat looking down into the mug perhaps waiting for me to say something though i didnt think so hed been going over the chengdu thing while he was talking and had now reached i believed a decision i had an idea of what it was going to be and i hoped i was wrong hoped to god i was wrong sand hit the windows as the gusts came whipping into the streets from the plateau i found i was watching the telephone with its chipped plastic and its tangled cord and either pepperidge noticed this or there was one of those little flashes of telepathy that we become used to when the mission begins to take shape and our nerves follow the same rhythm and our minds touch and drift away again but not far i would phone london of course if you wanted me to in a moment i said have you got the answer swinging his head to look at me i think so and youre ready to go ahead with it not really the question he looked down again its whether you will be ready to go ahead with it sand on the window coming in waves across the rock desert out there in the night eroding the town by infinitesimal degrees reminding me how impermanent life was how fragile i said try me he got off the bed taking his mug and putting it down carefully on top of the chest of drawers with its patchy varnish one brass handle missing the only added risk he said that we now face is dr xingyu himself for as long as he stays uncompromised we shall have no trouble its one of the precious euphemisms those sniveling scribes at the bureau think up to soften reality in this case for the opposition to compromise dr xingyu baibing they would throw him into an interrogation room and squeeze out every bit of information hed got in his head while the radio was turned up to full volume to cover the noise if he were found and seized and interrogated pepperidge went on all would of course be lost and there wouldnt be anything we could do about it after all sojourner possessed the same information that you tiniest hesitation that dr xingyu has now become privy to the only difference is that we believed sojourner was safe from any attention whereas dr xingyu is being actively sought throughout the world we should have protected sojourner and didnt but at least we know we must protect dr xingyu if necessary to the point of death i sat with my hands around my mug of tea to warm them the ancient electric heater set into the wall was keeping the room just this side of freezing he didnt mean mine my death the shadow executive doesnt necessarily expect to return from a mission that much is a given its in our contract and it is understood by all parties concerned that in inclement circumstances the life of the undersigned may become forfeit despite any or all efforts that will if possible be made to protect him weve lived with that one from the beginning and never pay it much attention people get killed in bullfights in marital strife on the road what frightened me was that pepperidge meant xingyus death not mine i dont want i told him to make guesses no quite if you think i was giving him a hard time my good friend you are in error i wanted to be absolutely sure of what my director in the field would give me for instructions because in the heat of action i might forget what was said or what was meant pepperidge took a step or two his thin body stockylooking in his padded windbreaker his raw knuckly hands tucked under his arms his eyes resting nowhere quite well let me ask you this do you think theres any chance of persuading dr xingyu to carry a capsule if you explained the need i didnt even have to think about it no understandable quite devoted to his wife and all that just thought id ask because youve been with him longer than i have he turned away taking another step so that his voice reached me indirectly echoing softly off the walls above the moaning of the wind outside so what it comes down to is this i need to know whether in order to protect the mission you yourself would be prepared to take his life cockroach he looked like a buddha sitting there i didnt know if hed seen me he didnt give any sign there was a threequarter moon outside it had lit my way no more than a patch of light through the haze of the flying sand but enough to show me the road rutted by carts up the long hill to the monastery it shone through the oblong gaps in the walls here that once may have been windows and through the broken timbers bracing the roof its light leaning between the pillars some of them rearing at an angle the whole top floor had shifted by the look of it during the fire there were ladders everywhere most of them broken hanging from their top rungs from the floor beams the one id just climbed was the only one still usable id checked for that earlier when wed come here he sat very still the moonlight touching on his scalp turning his red robes to black conjuring a spark of luminosity in the shadow of his face a tiny jewel from this distance his eye so he was watching me this place was a catacomb its spaces tunneling through massive timbers its perspectives broken by frozen cascades of plaster blackened in the fire by doors hanging from a single hinge with cells making hollows darker than the walls and galleries running as far as the light allowed the eye to follow the smell of the fire was still here acrid in the mouth the wind shrieked rising to a gust and dying again keening and sand drifted through the beams of moonlight as if through the timbers of a wrecked galleon id made no sound coming here climbing from the main hall of the monastery i wanted to know how good this monk would be as xingyus guard but there was enough noise going on already from falling debris and the shifting of joists and roof beams as the wind shook the building perhaps hed seen me in any case from the distance as id climbed the ladder he hadnt moved but since his eyes were open i knew he wasnt meditating or in prayer but i gave a bow to make sure i wasnt disturbing him and he returned it getting to his feet when i neared him a gold tooth gleaming as he greeted me with his palms touching lightly together he was agelong fully ordained he sleeps he whispered to me i wont disturb him did he ask for anything for paper to write and must buy drug what drug he couldnt mean insulin for the sickness that he has for his diabetes he needs more insulin yes you mean theres none left must buy tomorrow he say he could have warned me xingyu for gods sake that he was getting low all right i said peace be with you the monk whispered we exchanged bows and he moved along the gallery a rufous shadow in his robes picking his way across the gapped timbers to the ladder hed been upset xingyu by the fuss in hong kong the airport snatch and the mask and having to go back through the terminal for the flight to chengdu it could have made him forget he was running low on insulin but that might be his way to forget things and id have to watch it he could be living half his life on the edge of the galaxies the absentmindedprofessor syndrome it could be dangerous could be dangerous now how easy would it be to get hold of insulin in a place like lhasa i opened the door of the cell as carefully as i could but the wooden hinge still creaked it wasnt a cell exactly though jiang the abbot had called it that it had once been three or four cells but the shifting of the building during the fire had brought down some of the flimsy plaster walls and we had the luxury of space here you could call it a guest room almost a royal suite with glass in every window and straw on the floorboards a pipe from a cistern on the roof bringing water to the metal trough in the corner where the midday sun thawed the ice and you turned the tap on with a wrench it had been used jiang had told me to accommodate a visiting dignitary on a secret mission for his holiness during the rebellion hence the glass in the windows and the water basin and of course the unlikelihood of our ever being found here on the fifth floor of a ruined hulk i couldnt tell if xingyu was awake as i opened my sleeping bag he didnt speak or even stir as far as i could tell with the noise the wind was making and i found myself worrying as i believe young mothers do whether my precious charge was sleeping quietly or lying there in the silence of untimely death the insulin thing was on my mind and i didnt know how fast a coma could set in with a change of diet i lay on my side with dust sometimes settling on my face and making the skin itch as the wind fretted at the cracks in the ceiling worrying also that i had crept in here to lie in the dark beside this man his watchful guardian and defender of his faith but if things went terribly wrong his executioner so what it comes down to is this pepperidge i need to know whether in order to protect the mission you yourself would be prepared to take this life i hadnt said anything sand blowing across the window took another step pepperidge head down looking at the floor let me spell out the situation for you memory is fallible the situation im talking about is one in which for some reason dr xingyu were found and seized and you were unable to save him but were able to take his life before it was too late before there was any time for the kccpc to put him under interrogation i hope thats clear yes it wasnt likely that a situation like that would come up it was more liable to be one thing or another either id succeed in protecting xingyu and bringing him home safely to the plane for beijing or something would go wrong and the kccpc would infiltrate our operation and catch xingyu and break him and send him to beijing for the puppet show but i could think of a hundred situations a thousand where i could be right in the middle of a lastditch action to save the protege and indeed have the option of seeing him taken away or protecting the mission by taking his life the most obvious scenario would be that we were both found and seized and taken for interrogation giving me the chance of seeing to xingyu somewhere along the way and then popping my capsule we were both replaceable and bamboo could survive seeing to xingyu oh for christs sake whos been bitching about the use of precious euphemisms killing him yes killing xingyu i take your point you didnt draw a gun pepperidge asked me this time out i never do were given one or two options on our way through clearance draw a weapon if we feel like it draw a capsule but i dont like guns the hands are quieter and i prefer going in close i know pepperidge said but i just wondered you know this time in the kind of situation were talking about you might not get a chance of staying near him near enough question of distance timing chance of pulling off a shot my hands had gone cold around the mug the tea was cold my spirit was cold and i got off the bed and put the thing down on the chest of drawers and told him you cant insist you cannot insist touching my arm of course not ive just got to sound you out you see find some sort of compromise got to remember though havent we that theres rather more at stake than the disinclination of one single executive to take a life theres the future isnt there of china and hong kong beginning to feel lightheaded youve got to avoid stress the guide had told us or youll make things worse the altitude sickness take it easy walking i was walking about now pepperidge moving over the wall to give me room that bloody cockroach crawling across the wainscoting looking for a way out felt like i felt like putting my foot on the thing ferris would have done that hes always looking for beetles to tread on makes me sick because where do you stop putting my foot on a cockroach on xingyu said i said they must have provided for an accident in their original planning in london an accident to xingyu i mean they oh yes his voice gentle reasonable he knew i was looking for a way out and he wasnt going to let me have one he couldnt there are several known dissidents in beijing available top intellectuals much admired by the people london would certainly have gone to one of them through the embassy and put things to him you think someones been briefed to take xingyus place if he gets killed we can be certain most of the planning was made by bureau one with sojourner as his adviser but we dont want to see dr xingyu as in any way expendable we would hope if anything happened to him that his replacement could rally the people under the protection of the tanks but we are certain that dr xingyu could do it he is our highest priority but if there were any risk of his exposing the mission walking about i walked about cold all over now deathly cold logical thought not coming easily but it didnt take a lot of working out xingyu baibing was the messiah with the future of all those people in his hands but also with a bomb in his head they were asking me to detonate if he became a danger to them pepperidge watching me the naked bulb in the ceiling reflected in his yellow eyes waiting for me to understand that i hadnt got a chance the objective for bamboo was to protect xingyu baibing but that objective would automatically be overidden if something went wrong by the highest priority of all to protect the mission itself this hadnt been part of the planning specifically it had been built into the very bones of the bureau in its conception a commandment carved in stone protect the mission in the end i said no gun very well he had to accept that much and he knew it ive got my commandments too but you accept the need to avoid any risk to the mission said yes i had said yes lying here in the padded sleeping bag with the dust settling onto my face making it itch lying not far from him from the messiah watchful guardian and defender of his fate but if things went wrong the means implement of his crucifixion blood on the floor i was sitting against the wall on a slatted bench head down chin on my hands looking across at the counter some times and then looking down ill depressed abandoned to my fate appropriate cover for a place like this streaks of blood across the floor hed been brought in a minute ago a young khampa horseman i would have said in his brigands garb they ride as if into the teeth of hell and sometimes come a cropper a woman in a stained white smock came with a mop and bucket shaking her motherly head there were a dozen people in here most of them at the counter some with an arm in a sling one carrying an infant with his face red with rage its cries piercing the monk was at the other end at his dispensary his name was bian the abbot had assigned him to me telling him that he would do what i wanted better than anyone more discreetly id been surprised at first how ready the abbot had been to help me but xingyu had explained things the monastery like a hundred others had been half destroyed by the chinese forces in and the monks were still painstakingly restoring it their hate for the chinese had burned on when the fire was put out and they would help anyone who could free tibet and leave them in peace yelling the place down the infant as the mother shuffled forward in the queue bian the monk was talking to someone now across the counter a man in a white coat the dispenser giving him the prescription it had become grubby in xingyus wallet and had been much handled and id improved on that making a smudge across his name that had left it unreadable this was simply an exercise in caution quite apart from the worldmedia photograph of dr xingyu baibing in london the chinese werent likely to suspect that he was already back on the mainland its the last place theyd expect me to go hed told me on the boat in hong kong and that was why pepperidge and london had agreed to let him come to lhasa but id asked bian to buy the insulin for me to cover the thousandth chance that we were wrong or that one of the kccpc agents whod seen me making the snatch at hong kong airport was now here in lhasa and that they suspected i was still looking after him so this was just routine straight out of the book i shall require another injection xingyu had told me by noon he hadnt apologized for the trouble involved hadnt realized there was a risk however slight hed been squatting on the floor when id left him writing busily some kind of diary perhaps that hed have to leave behind him when we made our final move if so the abbot would look after it for him the monk bian was nodding putting money on the counter hitching the red robe higher on his shoulder taking a packet from the dispenser coming away i left the clinic five minutes after him and cut him off in a cobbled street behind one of the temples deserted except for a huddle of mendicants sheltering from the wind i did not bring it bian told me the insulin this is aspirin i bought it in case i was watched the dispenser said he would give me insulin but warned me saying he had orders to report it mother of god to report any sale of insulin yes he looked along the street then back to me the stubble on his face catching the light from the flat gray sky where the sun made a hazy disk his eyes watering in the freezing wind he was a tibetan and was sorry but said he would lose his license perhaps be arrested for disobedience perhaps i was just paranoid losing my grip there could be other explanations bian i said how many places are there in lhasa where you can get insulin very few very few places so they wouldnt have to put a standing watch all over the town the kccpc though of course if they had to they would do that theyd got limitless manpower put a final question to see if it was just paranoia let mm tell me bian can you think why they would watch for anyone asking for insulin he seemed a little surprised i would think because they know our guest has need had need and was somewhere in lhasa he stood there bian holding the small brownpaper packet of aspirin and some money the change he watched me with pain in his eyes it was perhaps his guests karma to be found and taken away the wind whipped at his worn soiled robes where else i asked him could i find insulin not the hospital or the clinics would an apothecary stock it perhaps ill try no it was too dangerous now it needed professional handling i asked him for the prescription and told him to offer the money at one of the altars at the monastery and add the aspirin to their medical supplies then i walked with my back to the wind and sat on a broken bench in a little park and worked on things and came up with the essentials that unless there was another diabetic on the run the kccpc either knew or suspected that xingyu baibing was here in lhasa and were closing in that it would take time to signal pepperidge because the telephones here werent very good and you had to go through an operator and i didnt know mandarin or tibetan and that xingyu had got to have insulin before noon and there was only one way i could get it for him and the risk was appalling apothecary the snakes were alive i think it doesnt need saying surely that in any mission whatever the objective whatever the target the one primordial requirement is to stay clear of the opposition particularly if the opposition is not a private cell but the entire security network of the host country police secret police civil and military intelligence the one primordial requirement is to stay clear of them and get back across the frontier with a whole skin and the documents or the tapes or the defector or the blown spook whos going to die out there if you dont die out there or finish up under the fivehundredwatt bulb without a capsule and blowing the roof off london they werent moving they were just a lot of coloured spirals curving around the inside of the big glass jar their little black eyes open but that didnt mean anything we go on watching life after death dont we until someone closes the lids but in any case i was disgusted i cant stand those bloody things the apothecary peered at the grubby bit of paper the light was bad of course there are times when we cant for some reason stay clear of the opposition and then all we can do is to pop it and protect the mission or get clear again bloodied but unbowed so forth then theres third situation that comes up sometimes but thank god not very often its where the only way to keep the mission going and hope to survive and reach the objective is to set yourself up as a target and wait for them to shoot and that was what i was doing now one of them was moving its small head dropping and swinging around inside the jar with the black forked tongue flickering and i looked away the flesh creeping theyve got no bloody feet anywhere those things all they can do is writhe insulin the old man nodded peering at the bit of paper yes i said the decorated canopy cracked above the shopfront in the wind and the man behind me fell prone again onto the flat of his hands facing toward the temple farther along a dog sniffed at his rags id tried two other apothecaries but at the first one the girl had just looked at the prescription for a long time and finally shaken her head and flashed all her gold teeth and at the second one the man said in quite good english that he was disappointed at not being able to oblige me but that i should try the one around the corner toward the barkhor plaza i was there now there were other things apart from the snakes rows of bottles and bowls of herbs and a huge dried starfish and an armadillo but there was a shelf of phials and flagons with typed labels and a small poster with bayer at the top id been trying apothecaries in the hope of making a deal they owned their own places and could break the rules if they wanted to and i put the price of their wanting to at about one hundred yen the old man was raising his head slowly looking up from the prescription and bringing his eyes to focus directly on mine with his face close and in his eye there was a warning then their focus shifted and it was quite clear that he was looking behind me through me at something else i said softly police he nodded pleased that id understood if sell you this must tell them it is order below his bald pate his brows made furrows as many as the armadillos perhaps it better you leave now i heard the man outside fall flat on his hands again in obeisance to the gods of the temple hed moved another few yards i could hear other sounds mostly voices from the people at the vegetable stalls opposite and the rumbling of ironbound wheels and the dragging of harness the dog that had sniffed at the pilgrims rags now sniffed at my combat boots farther along the street there were prayer bells ringing tuneless but with a steady rhythm i listened carefully analyzing the environment because in a moment i was going to cross the line and present myself to the opposition because i had no choice i must have the insulin i told the apothecary its urgent he watched me steadily his eyes bright with intelligence but it was obviously beyond him to understand me it doesnt matter i told him about the police there was no point in pushing money at him as a bribe in the last few minutes id come to know him well enough he was an apothecary a man of high standing in his community a man by his art of great responsibility and if he decided to report me to the police he would do it as a point of honor the police being his enemy here his goodwill would not be for sale you understand he asked me his eyes grave you understand what is the truth of this thing yes but the police are not looking for me i shall have no trouble he lifted his hands their skin like crumpled silk and let them fall gracefully ah then it is good it was a long time minutes before hed filled in the form peering again at the prescription and the name the name is not clear xiao dejian i said and spelled it for him he wrote it down using a pen with ink the colour of blood then i gave him some money and he gave me change and i took the flat packet of ampoules and returned his bow and walked through the strange leaden light of the morning hearing the sudden shout and ignoring it because it was only in my mind the nerves shimmering in the system with a feeling of cold light and the scalp drawn tight because i had staked the whole of the mission on one throw on the logical assumption that if the kccpc were watching the clinics and the apothecaries for anyone buying insulin they wouldnt make an arrest but would simply follow they were not clods in the kuo chi ching pao chu a cloddish intelligence service would have given orders to have me arrested and thrown into a cell and interrogated but these people knew how long the odds are against getting information out of a trained agent its not an exact science and you can beat a man into a kind of stupor where he himself wouldnt know the truth from a lie or you can push him beyond the point when he can tell you anything at all they thought or they knew that dr xingyu baibing was in lhasa and the odds were better that i could lead them to him now why did they think or how did they know i must find out perhaps he would tell me the short squatbodied chinese who was walking behind me on the bright curved surface of the copper samovar fifty paces i would have said behind me allowing for the reduction in size of everything reflected there a cup of tea how nice but i havent the time just now warming their hands the little group around the stall warming their hands on the cups as the tea came gushing from the spout hanging back a little now he was hanging back because here the street was clearer and if i looked around hed stand out and i might notice him he was good at the rudiments of urban tracking and that made things safer by a degree because a trained tag is predictable and his movements would be unsurprising i could do with that i could do with anything in point of fact that i could get in the way of advantages because he would carry what those americans so delightfully call a piece and it would be heavycaliber big enough to drop me from a distance if i looked like getting away it was probable too that hed been here on the roof of the world a bit longer than i had and had got used to the atmospheric pressure and would be able to run more effectively to outrun me if i had to through the leaden light of the forenoon theres a case to be made for calling us cocky you must understand we the brave soldiery of the thriceaccursed sacred bull that runs us across the board like pawns until at last the paint wears thin and the glue cracks and the head comes off and they throw us away for calling us cocky yes as we work our way through the labyrinth meeting so often face to face with our grinning fate that we lose much of our fear and become irrational in the heat of crisis and this my good friend was a crisis because the executive had moved deliberately into the surveillance field of the opposition and attracted its attention and the opposition was not some maverick terrorist cell with no claim to expertise or efficiency but the multifaceted and highly competent intelligence service of the peoples republic of china and as i walked across the packed dirt of the next street to my right my feet felt sticky on the web he was keeping pace moving across the window of a bathhouse neat in his parka his head turned to the side a little in case i looked back cocky yes in a crisis and this had often been our undoing the head comes off you understand and they throw us away but this was a twoedged thing because if we couldnt allow ourselves the choice of deadly options and face the matter headon wed never get anywhere would we all wed do is sit there in the park with a drip on our nose and a plaid rug on our knees feeding the bloody pigeons turned again i turned again working my way to the edge of town through the leaden light of the forenoon thered been no other choice lets face it that improvident diabetic up there in the monastery that crass idiot the messiah my precious protege needed the stuff in my pocket before he slipped into a coma and i couldnt have asked pepperidge for help because the director in the field can have no part of the action his job is to hole up in his ivory tower and liaise with london report to the signals board on the progress of the mission and request instructions to protect nurture and advise his executive certainly but not on the streets in harms way because if a wheel comes off he provides a kind of black box for the bureau slipping away from the field and leaving the blood and the smoke behind him and taking a plane for londinium and a debriefing room there to explain what happened why we crashed so that our little mistakes can go down in the records and those poor little buggers in training at norfolk can be duly warned here is a case you see where the executive began believing himself to be invulnerable and overestimated his talents got cocky yes yet it was logic that drove me through these streets and i wont have it otherwise that man had to have his medication and there was no one else who could get it for him id already put that monk in hazard without meaning to and thered been no way i could have bought it in time without walking straight into the trap wont have it otherwise i tell you i dont care what you think things were not though going to be pretty i was walking a bit faster now giving him the picture glancing around sometimes to see if anyone was watching my steps more purposeful man with a mission yea verily huge black yak coming the other way pulling a cartload of dried dung whites of his eyes breath clouding on the air one hoof split and bound with a metal ring the driver chanting head lifted to the sky lost in his own world i could have run now using the yak and the cart for cover and taking whatever doorway or alley i could find running flat out and gaining enough ground to get me clear before he could catch up but thered be no future in that he could have dropped me with a shot or cut across the terrain and intercepted me his lungs better than mine more used to the altitude and in any case it would only have confirmed to his agency that they were right xingyu baibing was indeed in lhasa and must now be hunted down also i had a rendezvous walls of a temple garden huge cracks in it weeds growing a pair of timbered gates one hanging from a rusty hinge the other decorated with dried leaves in an intricate design embodying prayer presumably or homage to the lord buddha so i went in there it seemed appropriate went in there to keep the rendezvous it was mostly a ruin the main doors had been chained at some time but one of the hasps had been jimmied away from the woodwork and now the doors hung open human excrement on the worn stone steps pages torn from a pulp magazine a cracked boot lying on its side in a corner and the white bones of a skeleton glowing in the halflight inside the doorway a dogs with one leg missing smell of stale incense or perhaps a fire a torching of aromatic timber this could be one of a hundred temples ransacked and ravaged by the angels of chairman mao it was cold in here silent smelling of a grave with feeble light from the aureoles along the gallery pooling on the floor playing on dead leaves and the carcass of a rat suddenly a face in front of mine as i moved into the shadows the shock hitting the nerves and the adrenaline hot in the blood a face with the gold leaf peeling away from the dry cracked wood underneath the eye sockets brooding in meditation the hands folded across the gross belly two inches below the navel i didnt stop didnt hesitate because the scenario required confidence here i was meant to know my way i was bringing the insulin to dr xingyu baibing for it was here that he was hidden scream of a bird and the echoes played it back from the domed ceiling a flurry of wings and a spattering and then silence again until i moved forward my boots grating across the chipped tiles there was a door here i pushed it open and it swung back hitting the wall before i could stop it darkness now blindness across the eyes and a silence so deep that even my breath echoed until i controlled it and went forward again swinging the door shut but not with a bang because any noise in this place could attract attention and we wouldnt want that dr xingyu baibing and i ive got it i said we must not ham it must not actually say insulin you were late at the back of the throat i need it now then i waited against the wall behind the door i was relying on his pride this was a kind of inner chamber i suppose but it might have another door to the outside either locked or chained or able to be opened there could be fixtures in here lamps candle sconces buddhas perhaps unless theyd been saved from the torching by the acoustics it was a small place with a flat ceiling not domed there was not a photon of light here it smelled of damp rot with a mortuary sharpness that caught at the throat there might be a cadaver here neither rats nor dogs this time and not bared to the bone the flesh still stirring to the feast of maggots but we are being morbid perhaps the nerves producing a little video show for the imagination to work on worried now i was worried because i was relying on his pride and that could be a mistake from far away the tolling of a bell perhaps in requiem we are not are we feeling too cheerful just now less than sanguine because he might not lacking pride decide to push the door open and come in with his gun to catch us unawares dr xingyu baibing and i and make the arrest and herd us to the nearest public service bureau promotion assured the man who caught the infamous dissident subject of a worldwide search he might decide instead to play it safe and leave us here sure of our staying at least long enough for him to fetch help in case we were armed i didnt want that to happen id pushed the mission into a new phase by making contact with the opposition with the intelligence service of the host country and i wanted it to stay like that and control the outcome if i could there were no he hadnt gone the door had a metal lever and he was pushing it down and with great care by infinite degrees and sweat came on my skin immediately and the pulse went up and i steadied the breathing we are engaged my good friend we shall have our reckoning he and i they would have been interested in this the people sitting there at the signals board in far londinium it would have broken the ennui for them thered been a flurry of excitement i suppose when pepperidge had put it through the mast at cheltenham executive undertakes to ensure silence of subject if protection of mission necessitates but since then theyd been sitting on their hands that was last night mr shepley bureau one nothing since no sir then where the hell is he hyde my control less patient than the king of kings less able to control his nerves the lever on the door was still moving it would have got them going wouldnt it if theyd known the score holmes would pick up the chalk and look at the big digital clock and punch the international timezone button and note tibetan local and fill in the rest of the line red one dip on open circuit and theyd start walking about not looking at one another because red one is perhaps rather theatrical shorthand for a situation in which either the executives life or the security of the entire mission is in extreme hazard which can simply mean that the poor bastard out there is stuck on a frozen roof two hundred feet above the street with the lights of the chopper fingering the buildings one by one or spreadeagled facedown with a boot on his neck and a gun in his spine and the stink of exhaust gas from the unmarked van in his lungs or reeling in the chair under the light and praying for the illjudged blow that will bring him what he cant bring himself because they found the capsule on him and hes got promises to keep before he sleeps and he cant take much more before he breaks them not much more of this there was light on the wall now a thin pale sliver of light that ran like a vertical crack on the plaster and across it was his shadow there was nothing to be done yet things would take their course i dont like guns and i never use one as you know but thats not to say that i dont respect them for they can summon the deathbringer dip on open circuit is more technical and simply means that the director in the field can put his signal straight through to the speaker system at the board taking automatic priority over all other traffic it can make things tricky if there are two red ones in operation from two different missions but its the best they can do the crack of light was widening shall we raise him sir the dip yes not yet its pepperidge dont call us well call you despite his gentle manners pepperidge has more nervous stamina than most and doesnt shoot till he sees the whites of their eyes what i didnt like was that the hinges of the door were on the left looking from the other side from the side where he was standing now and i was righthanded and the choice was unaccommodating either id have to use my left hand or move my whole body into his vision field before i could use my right either decision could be lethal as id thought this place wasnt very big the light coming through the doorway was faint but i could see the opposite wall now and it was close there wasnt anything to see on the floor so far except chips of plaster and broken tiles no cadaver despite this smell of decay no remains of some starving pilgrim whod crawled in here to sleep and dream no more nothing either like a fallen joist or a broken pane of glass that would do for a weapon i could hear him breathing he wasnt going to rush it i didnt expect him to hed be well trained a professional we could have a whole armory in here dr xingyu baibing and i the hinges of the door hadnt made any sound when id opened it and later closed it but that could have been because id swung it fairly fast he was moving it much more slowly now and that could make it creak and if it did that i would expect him to use his shoulder and smash the door back before we could find our guns my insubstantial companion and i because we might be somewhere off this chamber where we couldnt see the light but could hear the door this would be in his mind as it was in my own our heads at this stage were probably eighteen inches apart with the door between them each the vessel of a quiet blaze of consciousness as the synapses fired in their billions and the nerves at the extremities of our bodies recorded the pressure of the floor underfoot and the tactile impression of the air at my fingertip and the trigger under his and our cortices processed the data and reacted accordingly i had been as close as this before to a fellow creature whose presence could bring my death but its not something you get used to because every time can be the last and you know that the strip of faint light widened on the wall and his shadow took on bulk his head was defined now and i could see his right elbow but not the gun that would be held in front of him i could smell him now danger came close he could smell me nothing there was nothing to do but wait and it wasnt easy but it had got to be done because i couldnt leave him alive and id have to see more of his body before i could take him down i was badly positioned because of the lefthandrighthand thing it wouldnt be long now you cant stand as close as this to someone and not become aware of him and this mans senses would have started picking up the signals by this time the almost soundless exchange of air by the lungs the barely discernible rise in temperature as the heat radiated from the skin and above all else the vibration of the aura itself beyond the reach of the senses but within the field of the subconscious where the alarm would be raised the nerves galvanized and he fired the gun and the shock smashed at the walls trotter qingkuang yang yanzhong ma bu hen yanzhong tou zhudng le yi xia water splashing he says its nothing serious bit of concussion i think i said thats good or something the chinese went on squeezing the sponge over the side of my scalp water splashing into the bowl it didnt hurt couldnt feel anything water very cold that was all are there any snakes what was that snakes then i said no dont worry feel all right my dear fellow he was a big man bright teeth in a black beard very good sheepskin coat jeep full of rocks rocks and picks and a spade rope things like that told me hed been getting samples from the high plateau told me his name was trotter taught oriental languages at oxford feel fine i said hed brought me to a street clinic chinese scrolls hanging all over the place pictures of roots leaves herbs the front part where hed brought me inside trotter front part rather like the apothecarys place that was why id asked about the snakes cant stand those bloody things coming through next week overland from kathmandu although i dont think she was terribly keen another quick laugh from deep in the chest talking now i thought back a bit about his wife she doesnt trust the caac even though i told her its the safest airline in the world never flies in bad weather this mans extremely good dont worry best in lhasa none of your western medicine here tuned him out had to think but not easy kept seeing the flash i would say hed fired so as to light up the little chamber and see where i was id got a glimpse of him his eyes very wide not afraid very alert needing to know things just as i did then hed brought the gun up and id gone for him dark again totally dark after the flash place stinking of cordite i found his right arm by feeling for it you can say feeling for it but i mean we were spinning together trying to find the killing point or at least i was he seemed more interested in breaking clear so that he could threaten me from a distance with the gun and of course ididnt want that strong smell of sweat from both of us the adrenaline was pouring into our systems and the muscles were charged i found his gun hand and extended ki and tried for a kotegaeshi but he was very strong and i felt the gun turning toward me into me and that was frightening because hed be selective shooting to maim to incapacitate to put me out but keep me alive and get me to an interrogation cell and ask me where xingyu baibing was i didnt want that either we draw the capsule but were not going to use it if we can make a killing first its not just a gesture you know were not a league of bloody gentlemen fired again and the sound crashed and wasnt certain if hed made a hit you dont always feel a bullet going in when the organisms functioning at this pitch because the endorphins move in immediately on the pain fired again and i couldnt afford this so i used the flash and saw his throat exposed and made a halffist and drove deep and he fell and dragged me down with him and my head hit the edge of the open door he didnt move again i got his parka off and put mine on him and took his papers shut the door after me hit the wall once or twice before i found the steps and went down them the sky reeling overhead thered been a horse and cart and i was trying to get the driver to take me on board when the jeep had come past and trotter had seen the blood on my head and put his brakes on the stuff was stinging whatever he was putting on the wound all right my dear fellow he was watching me attentively i said fine yes the stuff smelled like alcohol suppose it was some kind of anesthetic ta shuo ta fuede tinghao li zhun me renwei ta buhui you da wenti haiba zheme gao tou shou shang douhui yunde ta shibushi shuaile yi xia if you feel trotter said cheerfully sort of gaga dont worry about it the altitude makes things worse than they really are what happened did you fall yes fell on my head time is it im sorry what time is it my watch had got smashed the man the doctor man helped me sit up and the whole place spun the scrolls whirling around steady as you go trotter was saying steady as you go my dear fellow their hands on me felt grateful good of them time what trotter took out a heavy gold pocket watch its twenty past eleven i need a taxi i stood up and trotters huge hands were supporting me again he was like an amiable blackbearded bear look you mustnt taxi i said and managed to find my wallet ask him how much i owe will you my head was clearing now by necessity i had to reach xingyu baibing by noon and we were running it close because i couldnt take the taxi all the way id have to get him to drop me off half a mile short at a different monastery the hills were full of them some where tourists could go i got out a y note is this enough look you cant go anywhere on your own like this you need appointment i said extremely important ive got an appointment he studied me worried he doesnt need money hes a friend of mine now let me take you to your hotel which one the lhasa several places i said ive got several places to go i cant keep you hanging about i put the y note away will you thank him for me then im most grateful to you he followed me out and said hop on board then theres a taxi up by the post office it was a brokendown austin smothered in dust and trotter helped me into it i dont know whether youre intrepid he said or foolhardy laugh booming gave me his card if ever you need a friend in the meantime for gods sake look after yourself thanked him for everything and slammed the door and slumped back against the torn vinyl seat where go telephone he twisted around to look at me a wizened face wrapped in scarves number one guest house no i want to make a telephone call rei telephone at number one guest house not far good the light kept flashing so i shut my eyes but it went on doing it he drove on the horn this man and one of the rear tires kept hitting the crumpled wing what shall i say how shall i tell it the light fluttering on and off it wasnt probably so much the actual concussion but the stress of things in the temple you dont imagine i hope that we operate like bloody robots do you with no feelings he answered on the second ring yes i spoke in french its less understood here than english theres a body i said in one of the abandoned temples at the edge of the town one of the opposition but i put my coat on him and took his papers if you can get someone to go along there and bury it there wont be so much of a fuss i gave him the directions how long will it take you to make the call some people came into the guest house dropping baggage sixty seconds ill call you back i leaned with one finger on the contact there were three hikers roundeyes crowding me one with dark glasses on and his face peeled raw by the ultraviolet then i got the operator again and asked for the barkhor hotel at first they said there was no one of that name there and i told them id just been talking to him and they wanted me to spell it and we were running it so very close to the noon deadline yes can they do it i asked pepperidge theyll try all right and then ill need an rdv say about fourteen hundred where you tell me the only place i knew was the one id been to with sumay wang so i told him where it was i didnt want to go to his hotel more often than i had to its always dangerous to establish patterns ill be there he said he sounded relaxed quietly cheerful though he must be working out the signal to london any kind of major action had to go on the board and this involved a death the fourth of bamboo for now i told him you need this they were watching every source of insulin in lhasa and this man tagged me so it looks as if they either suspect or know that the subject is here in the town short silence it had rocked him of course how did that happen i think i know but well talk about it later ive got to go now fourteen hundred he said and rang off and i went out to the taxi where go told him north id show him the way got out some money quite a lot go very quick understand the apothecary had given me a dozen new needles gauge oneinch becton dickinsons and i pulled one off the strip and fitted it to the syringe you feel all right yes xingyu said but i was worried i got delayed drew five cubic centimeters out of the ampoule pressed out the air i didnt tell him he could save saved his worries if hed just let me know he was out of insulin a bit sooner you do not look well he said touch of indigestion pulled the plunger got no blood put pressure on it everything had become very clear sensitive head was throbbing and i was still out of breath from climbing the ladder but even in the light from the dirty windows things had a sharp outline and i could hear one of the monks chanting three floors below and could feel the plunger hit bottom before i pulled the needle out mental clarity was back too heightened the dance of conscious thought quick and colored put the plastic sheath back on the needle and dropped it into the waste box pressed the cap on the syringe everything orderly the blood singing quietly through the veins the beat of the heart strong and steady vital signs the vital signs that had come so close to getting cut off down there in the temple and this was it what it meant this feeling of heightened awareness ive had it before it comes as a revelation when you realize that life is going on and not without you as you thought it must were certain it would the reek of cordite in the lungs and the crash of the last shot still roaring in the brain the certainty of oblivion in the next breath and then the reprieve it leaves you exalted for a little time touched with grace i put the box in the corner of the cell underneath the pile of hides that jiang had given us for extra warmth at night you know where it is i told xingyu if im absent at any time remember where the stuff is and do it yourself exalted touched with grace but touched also with the guilt when the struggle has been to the death though we mustnt put it too dramatically must we but that was what it had been today and the loser loses all lying there in the dark with a rats carcass his fellow traveler to the shades of lethe i can never take a life without adding it to the little wooden crosses in the shadows of the mind of the memory im never free of them never shall be what is that smell xingyu baibing asked me antiseptic where did you put your mask he finished buckling his belt and went across to a part of the wall where the plaster had broken away and left a hole that hed covered with a bit of loose timber in here he stood with his arms hanging by his sides head turned to look at me something in his eyes asking for my approval and i was moved and it caught me unawares because nothing much can ever get through the scaly carapace of this mans soul moved by his attempt to play the espion hiding things away making my life easier a good place i said id never think to look there i washed it and dried it completely yes the japanese gave instructions i went and sat down my back against the wall we need to talk dr xingyu very well he squatted on the floor with his legs drawn up the light catching his glasses as he looked at me the chanting rose from below many voices now surrealistic m this great shadowed ruin the voicing of lost souls in the town i said i found out that the kccpc suspect that youre here in lhasa i didnt tell him that when the body was found in the temple theyd know for certain but it might not happen before we flew this man beijing can you think why he went on watching me for a time and then looked down i mentioned it he said i didnt say anything for a moment my tone would have to be perfectly normal when i spoke again with no anger in it no frustration he was an astrophysicist not an intelligence agent he was also a man by reputation to say what was on his mind even to the chiefs of government when did you mention it when i was in the british embassy in beijing it had been the only answer i could think of when id known they were watching the sources for insulin the kccpc i was certain wed reached the airport at gonggar clean and that we hadnt been followed xingyu and i into the town id checked thoroughly for surveillance id even thought that one of the chinese agents whod seen the snatch outside the terminal in hong kong might have recognized me when we went through there later on our way out to chengdu but if that had happened theyd have seized xingyu on the spot they hadnt known wed pulled it off pepperidge and i wed got xingyu baibing through a whole regiment of the kccpc and into lhasa clean but hed brought his own seed of destruction with him like a bacillus in the blood you told someone you might come here if the chinese allowed you to leave the embassy it was easier for him if i gave him questions easier than having to tell me direct he knew now what hed done yes who was it who did you tell one of the embassy staff i think his name was fellows a first secretary theyd given me a list of people at the embassy when id gone through clearance fellows was down as totally reliable they all were except for two counselors murray and sleight whose backgrounds were less well documented fellows i said didnt give you away was there anyone else there at the time he took a little while yes we were in the cafeteria spreading his hands i was just talking that was all and hadnt known that when youre talking about something sensitive youve got to make bloody sure you know who youre talking to and that theres nobody else around he wasnt an espion that was the trouble with this man he wasnt one of us he was just a normal human being with a brilliant reputation in science instead of secret intelligence and that was why hed walked straight into the trap in chengdu and id had to get him out again by giving him bamboo chapter and verse filling his head with stuff that was going to blow us all into christendom if they found him and put him under the light and that was why hed brought those kccpc agents into lhasa on our track a whole cadre of them specialists assigned specifically to hunt him down and throw him into a cell and get all that stuff out of his head finis finito you were just talking i said i hadnt meant to say it hadnt meant it to sound like that i was furious that was all no excuse but of course hed raised his voice never mind let it go it wasnt fellows but someone else must have overheard it and passed it on maybe not wen seeing the danger its too late now so dont worry about it but youve how do you know the kccpc think i am in lhasa how do you know that gray light flashing across his glasses as he bent forward toward me furious too furious with me for christs sale i told you dont worry the thing but you do not answer my question you wish to accuse me of doing something wrong but you will not answer my question that is unjust characteristic of the man hed ranted and raved about justice to the chinese government until theyd chased mm into the embassy dr xingyu the important thing for you to remember my question my question keep your voice down for gods sake dont you realize answer my question hissing it out now and tell me why you think the kccpc because they were watching every single place where you can buy insulin doesnt that answer your question i came away from the wall and got on my knees to face him close as i could to stop him raising his voice again how do you know they were watching patience god give me patience because one of them followed me perhaps you believed he was following you you are always suspicious because you are an intelligence officer and you therefore believe dr xingyu i leaned closer i was followed by a kccpc agent and i led him into cover and when he tried to shoot me i killed him with my bare hands now will you understand that we are not playing games in a moment you killed him yes that is terrible taking a life is always terrible yes but if this man had overpowered me i would have been taken to a cell and tortured until i told them where you are and they would have come here for you now will you understand why we have to do things that are sometimes terrible you must get a perspective on this he said nothing i sat kneeling as he was we faced each other in the gray light from the windows looking i suppose like two monks at their prayers in a moment i said your life is in danger dr xingyu every minute you must understand that my government has committed me to protect you and defend you until you can go back to beijing in a few days and lead your people toward the new democratic government that is their most fervent dream and if you can bring perspective to bear youll see that the death of one junior officer of an organization that is the most ruthless enemy of the people was necessary terrible but necessary after a time he raised his head and looked at me i am not very helpful to you am i youre not trained in the field thats all i am not used to violence not personally no but you can remember the violence in tiananmen square those are the people you have to fight you have a reputation for being among the first to man the barricades and youve got to understand that youre there again now these are the barricades in a moment yes i understand that good you must also understand that when the kccpc agent who followed me is reported missing its going to look as if someone in fact bought some insulin and managed to silence the agent have you ever used a gun what for have you ever fired a gun on a practice range of course not his back had straightened he was indignant now that you know your life is in danger here every minute would you be prepared to fire a gun hi your own defense he looked from side to side into the shadow confused hunted no of course not all right dont worry about it but did you imagine i would be capable of such a thing no then why did you suggest it because at this moment dr xingyu im looking for miracles stiffly i am afraid i cannot help you in beijing if we could ever get him there he would climb onto the rostrums and face the people and throw them miracles until they were dizzy with them but here in the burnedout hulk of the monastery he could offer them none not even the pressure of his finger on a trigger to defend his life the life of their messiah i understood that i understood but i could have used a miracle myself it would have lightened the load forget i mentioned it dr xingyu but youve got to do something for me it would have been far less difficult as you know to have taken you out of hong kong to safe territory where your government has no jurisdiction but you asked us to bring you to lhasa and we took your point and we agreed you had friends here you said now this is what youve got to do for me youve got to trust no one no one you must talk to no one even if youre alone with him even it its the abbot himself or the monk who guards you while im away bian especially him because its natural that you should want to talk to him youre not used to being alone with no companionship they were chanting still below and a bell had started tolling the huge bell that id seen in the garden behind here its mouth two or three feet across with a beam as big as a tree trunk slung on ropes to strike it with and as its rhythmic booming sounded through the great hollows of this place it made me afraid im not sure why perhaps it was just the vibration stirring in my body in my bones or perhaps it had the semblance of a clock its beat inexorable as it measured the seconds bringing us closer to what was to come fatigue surely fatigue and the altitude and the head wound everything adding up as i knelt there swaying in front of him in front of dr xingyu baibing yes i knew him once we were trying to get him back into beijing but they ran us too close the great bell boomed in my bones finally he said i will talk to no one no one trust no one i understand do that for me i will do it for you like a litany kneeling together because at any time now i told him theyre liable to start hunting for you now they know youre in lhasa theyve got hundreds of men they can use they can search every building beat every bush i was swaying again and made an effort to straighten up but i can keep you hidden dr xingyu ive had extensive training and a lot of experience i can make it extremely difficult for them ever to find you with luck impossible the great bell booming but i cant do anything for you i said if you take risks if you put us both in danger by talking some of the monks in this place dont even know that youre here the abbot assured me of that only a few know so dont talk to anyone dont trust anyone whoever he is i understand the great bell booming in my bones i wonder if he does if he does in my bones drunk we couldnt do anything pepperidge said the police were already there my skin crawled what time was that my chap got there just before noon he took another spoonful of soup he was fast i said adequate new to the field oh no been here a year english chinese how are you feeling bit skewed still listen when you debriefed him did he say how long he thought the police had been there when he turned up he said not long they hadnt brought the body out how long did he stay a good hour he was in a jeifang made out whats that sorry truck big as a dinosaur always breaking down so it was good enough cover he had the bonnet up got some spanners out hes bureau yes reports to hong kong his yellow eyes were on me suddenly youre active are you call it eighty percent he hadnt been satisfied when id told him i was a bit skewed i shouldnt have done that got to play by the book and the book says the shadow executive has to give his director in the field his exact condition when asked for all right say eighty percent fully active would mean i was fit enough to do anything at all nothing barred run a mile flat out or swim submerged or deal with any sort of attack and defeat it and get clear i couldnt do that not as i felt now the head was still a degree dizzy and i could feel the effect of the altitude in the lungs look i said they couldnt have got onto it that fast i mean from their end they couldnt in other words have put down that agent as missing and started a search for him and found him at the temple there hadnt been time someone must have heard the shots and reported it pepperidge was quiet for a moment the inference was there all right and it gave me the creeps if anyone had heard those shots they could have seen me leaving the temple soon afterward and given the police my description possible pepperidge said at last two people came in peasants slamming the door and it reached my nerves its not very good i said is it not very spooned some soup nil desperandum easy to say the kccpc had suspected that xingyu baibing was here in lhasa because hed blown it at the embassy in beijing and now theyd found that body it wouldnt be long before they identified it even though id made a gesture and changed coats and taken his papers and theyd check their assignment roster and find that the agent posted on watch at the apothecarys wasnt there anymore and thatd be all theyd need how did you do it pepperidge asked me the agent this was for norfolk for the new recruits i broke the thyroid cartilage with a halffist immediate internal hemorrhage he had a gun yes and he fired it yes he could smell the cordite on me how much light was there not much practically dark tell those poor bloody children at norfolk to try that one against a loaded gun and theyd get their brains blown out dont do as i do and so forth how did you get here pepperidge asked me there was a tourist bus at the monastery down the road just starting back he thought about that who was running it couple of australians there werent any chinese i said on board goodo he finished his soup and pushed the plate away and said ive been in signals with london as you can imagine because of the temple thing they asked me what i thought our chances are now his yellow eyes on me chances of what specifically of protecting the subject what did you tell them head on one side what would you have told them i gave it a minute not the time for making a wild guess id have said our chances are fiftyfifty he looked away youre that sanguine im not a bloody amateur at this kind of thing no offense of course but you see youre operating on foreign soil with the police the public security forces the intelligence services and the military already searching for the man youre assigned to protect on top of that this town is under martial law and theres a curfew his fingers drummed softly on the barewood table i dont think your chances are fiftyfifty tough shit i understand how you feel so what did you tell them i told them that in my considered opinion our position is close to untenable if hed been loman or fane id have walked out and gone underground and taken xingyu with me but this man i could respect and he wasnt getting cold feet he was seeing things as they were or as he thought they were most of the situations in most of the missions were given are untenable for christs sake its part of the job you know that he leaned closer tracing the edges of the stains on the tabletop with a finger theres so much stacked you see on this one we have to play for safety cant go taking risks we so what did they say his finger tracing the stains your instructions are to get the subject to beijing as soon as possible without waiting for the deadline bloody dog sniffing around my feet and i kicked out and got a yelp shepley said that hyde but of course it would have come from bureau one theyre out of their bloody minds at first glance perhaps but they have a point door slammed again they wanted a bit of rubber or something on that door stop it banging all the time got on your nerves theyre not out here in the field i said theyre five thousand miles away in london looking at a chessboard what the hell are you talking about i dont think he said that theyre asking the impossible the thing was to keep my voice down keep control but it wasnt easy the whole of this operations built on timing and coordination he cant go into beijing until theyre ready for him there until the tanks have taken control and they can meet him at the airport and escort him to tiananmen square you know that and now londons pushing the panic button and telling me to go pitching into a precipitate lastditch sauve qui peut thats going to cut right across bamboo and blow it to hell he waited for a while looking past me at the people in here fingers drumming softly on the bare stained wood giving me time to listen again to what id just said test it out perhaps perhaps reassess it didnt work let the defense rest bloody london his eyes came back to rest on mine and his voice was gentle the overall timing is important yes but not to us we are local our bailiwick is here all were being asked to do is to get the subject out of lhasa and into beijing and the only difference is that they want us to do it now instead of later head throbbing wouldnt leave me alone that worried me because it wasnt the injury so much it was the stress and if the executive was starting to lose his cool at this stage of the mission then god help us all the door opened again and i tensed waiting for the bang i dont see anything precipitate here pepperidge said right or wrong and i think im right ive reported that our position here is nearly untenable and london is simply changing procedure to protect the mission when we started out we believed that beijing was too hot for our subject so we brought him here the last place as he told us where theyd expect him to be now things have changed lhasa has got too hot for him and the last place theyre going to look for him is in beijing weve got plenty of people there and theyll keep him underground till everything else is ready he leaned forward touching my arm theres no real problem you see its difficult someone over there was getting drunk a roundeye hitting the table shouting something in english something about bloody travel agents its difficult for me always has been to give london credit its not because they dont deserve any theyre not stupid in fact theyre brilliant or i wouldnt work for them the trouble i have with london is a lot of my own making you know that if youve known me long although theyve certainly got habits that can drive you straight up the wall and people of course people like that bastard loman with his cufflinks and his polished shoes and his pedantic bloody speech enough to send you but you note how easily i can get carried away about london come and see the marvels of the holy city on the roof of the world the man over there was shouting and all ive seen so far is a lot of burnedout fucking monasteries and yak shit wherever you go stinking the fucking place out hitting the table redfaced woolen hat with a bright green bobble on it while two other men tried to shut him up no the thing with london is that they control me i signed for it fair enough but its not easy to live with i dont like it when a signal hits the board from the field and croder or shepley picks up the executive like a bloody pawn and puts him down on another square when in point of fact the said executive can be working his way through a minefield in the dark with a pack of wartrained dogs on his tracks or cooped up in a plain van with a gun trained on him while he tries to get at his capsule before they put him under the light ive been in both situations and a dozen like them not a dozen dear god a hundred and you get to resent those people back there in whitehall the redtabs ensconced comfortably behind the firing line doing their daily stint and going home to a nice hot shower while youre lying out there in a cellar in zagreb with four days filth on you and blood in your shoe you get to resent invigorating mountain air they told us christ you cant even fucking breather you should try those people in london my good friend then youd have some real yak shit to chew on theyre right i told pepperidge he leaned back letting his breath out i was hoping youd see its the only thing we can do if we can do it but of course carpe diem seize the day quite so the mask is still in safekeeping yes and you can fit it on for him yes then we shouldnt have any trouble how is he bearing up im treating him as gently as i can head on one side in what way hes so bloody innocent i had to know what had brought the kccpc on our track and i found out hed told someone at the embassy that he wanted to go to lhasa if he could get out of there i think he was overheard his fingers began drumming again in a moment possibly but i got a signal early this morning our people in bombay have taken a good look at sojourners body hed been tortured in a moment i asked him between the time he was taken out of hospital and the time he was killed right not before the snake bit him so it could have been that sojourner had talked to the subject at the embassy of course oh my god not happy is it but lets not see demons sojourner could have blown the whole thing bamboo a brief shrug possibly london doesnt think so why not because our sleepers in beijing have reported no movement at all among the army generals and their garrisons if the chinese government had got wind of things theyd have taken our general away from his command and shot him he is alive and well is that all were relying on a wintry smile we rely on anything we can get but it stands up you know they wouldnt have let the subject leave the embassy if sojourner had been broken it wasnt easy id never known a mission to be so dogged step after step by the threat of destruction ambassador qiao in london blown and killed sojourner in bombay blown and killed and the very man we were protecting the subject the messiah treating the whole thing as if those thugs in power in beijing were a league of gentlemen he knew bloody well they werent hes such a saint i said and he thinks everyone else is the same he the subject what yes he crash as the man over there knocked a metal bowl off the table shouting his head off and another gust of freezing air came through the door as one of the staff went trotting outside the talk had died down in here these people were unused to drunkenness and all you could get in here anyway was chang he thought it was all right i said to talk about coming to lhasa he fell straight into their trap at chengdu and he didnt believe id been followed this morning i had to spell it out ive warned him not to talk to any of the monks but he hasnt got any idea of even normal discretion and hes got the whole thing in his head you know that the whole mission pepperidge sat with the collar of his sheepskin coat turned up against the draft from the door fingers restless on the rough tabletop the dregs congealing in his soup bowl then we must simply be careful he said and you know how to do that he was quiet again for a while i assumed hed started working out the future the immediate future for the mission anytime now i was going to get his instructions and i didnt feel ready for them i wasnt fully active wouldnt be able to take on anything really critical and be certain of coming through you got a lift here pepperidge said on a tour bus you still dont want a car no wed been over it before in my first briefing here in a big modern city the executive has got to have a car because it gives him transport cover protection a mobile base and a weapon but in a place like lhasa a car was too noticeable and if id used one it would have established a dangerous travel pattern to the monastery and back very well pepperidge leaned forward again and folded his hands on the table were safe for the moment in thinking that while the subject is instantly recognizable without the mask on the kccpc are not looking for you this gives us the edge we need youre still operational at street level argot the opposite of street level is going to ground losing yourself burying yourself unless someone saw me at the temple i said i didnt think anyone had just wanted to make the point what are the chances he watched me with his yellow eyes trusting me not to lie how do i know for christs sake anyone could have seen me go in there or come out not precisely a lie call it an exaggeration playing it safe playing it too safe because i didnt want any action i was still healing uncertain of my strength if there were demands made on it out there at street level i think pepperidge said the chances are slight but i wont push you i looked away we were getting awfully close to the unthinkable signal for bureau one his eyes only executives injury has left him less fully active suggest bringing replacement to stand by the unthinkable push me i said push me as hard as you need to perhaps then a compromise take every chance you can find of normal cover dont reinforce the image show my face in other words as little as possible that was all right what ill do pepperidge said is bring in the jeifang the truck ill use the same man chong the man you sent to the temple yes he got out a scrap of paper and a ballpoint the jeifang is green most of them are in lhasa this is the number plate hell be at the rendezvous after dark at twenty hundred hours and hell take you and the subject to gonggar where youll sleep for the night in the truck the caac plane normally leaves between ten hundred and tenthirty in the morning i want you to fit the mask on the subject and see him as far as the departure gate but dont keep close youll be there simply in case of any trouble then youll go back to the truck hell be met in beijing and taken off the street immediately chong stays with the truck yes whats his cover if were stopped im going to ask for my fucking money back they cant do this bottle smashing then very quiet i suppose the man on the staff had gone darting out just now to fetch the police chongs cover pepperidge said is just what it looks like hes the driver for a transport company will he be armed no pepperidge watched me thoughtfully do you want him armed no then the door opened again and sumay came in and caught sight of me by chance and edged her way between the tables and passed close to us whispering you shouldnt be in here the police are looking for you and i saw them in the doorway fur hats red stars bolstered guns shiatsu skull of a dog how do you know freezing in here the window was open i have to report back there she said twice every day the public service bureau where shed helped me this morning skull of a dog on the wall narrow bed in a corner and a few bits of rough wood furniture and one or two oil lamps the window blind with a bracket loose at one end hanging at an angle no telephone need i tell you cut off i was cut off from my director in the field cut off from london and going to ground i would have to go to ground lose myself bury myself dont think about it dr xingyu baibing stuck up there on the third floor of a monastery and the man who was meant to get him to the airport stuck in a tenthrate hotel and freezing to death while the police scoured the town for him think about anything but that why why did she have to report back to the psb station twice a day she didnt volunteer very much i had to keep asking questions i broke the curfew last night her teeth were chattering she was freezing too or frightened or both so you have to report back cant we shut the window she went across to it but it was stuck and i helped her shed had trouble with the stove by the look of it the front was raised and there was ash on the floor the cheap linoleum had burned patches why i suppose shed had to leave the window open smoke stank in here it wasnt wood smoke it was yak dung having to make an effort i was having to make an effort to think straight get things in order because the mission was like a sinking ship now rolling in midocean in the dark the decks awash and wallowing and the stern down sliding to the cold vast bosom of the deep must get perspective yes you are not well sumay said so what happened when you reported back the officer who dealt with you this morning was still there he asked me about you she went across to the stove and got some dung out of a torn brownpaper bag what did he ask if i knew where you were staying i said no she lit some paper and put the stuff on top and began blowing at it why did they want to know where i was staying i suppose it was just her way didnt talk much they are looking for a man who was seen near a temple they say someone was found dead there an agent of the kccpc i moved nearer the stove it wasnt giving out any heat yet but there was a flame to watch what did you tell them about me i told them we parted she said as soon as we left the psb station i said i had not seen you since then she was squatting by the stove the box of matches still in her hand here eyes lifted to watch me with the question in them quite clear did you kill him what else did they ask what else did they say give it to me all at once will you everything you can think of she looked down ashamed id criticized her they said that i should look out for you wherever i went and tell them immediately if i saw you again the small flame growing in the stove its yellow light reflected in the sheen of her thick black hair the matches still in her long ivory fingers forgotten i told them i would look out for you and tell them if i saw you what else could i say i got down beside her sat on the gritty linoleum standing made me tired you are not well shed said did i look that bad there was nothing else i said you could tell them when you came into the cafe you didnt expect to see me there of course not she brought her head up and looked at me if i had known you were in the cafe i would have gone there sooner to warn you thank you there is hot water here for the shower she put the matches down on the plank of wood fixed to the wall with bent wire supports a shelf other things on the shelf incense a torn glove a halfburned votive candle on a spike in a rusty bowl not really hot a shy smile put on acted because that too was shameful she was my host and could offer me hospitality but it wasnt as it should be not really hot but it is not cold either please use the shower if you wish do not think it strange my good friend in lhasa in wintertime a shower that is not freezing cold is a luxury beyond all the perfumes of araby and i probably smelled most people here did lived in their clothes and id soaked these with sweat in the temple when hed come for me her invitation must be counted as grand hospitality id like that i told her she got up quickly and i said sumay do you think the psb officers followed you away from the station she looked confused would you know i asked her if anyone was following you i have never thought of it dont worry about it they could have followed her or they could have passed my description on to the police for what it was worth the police had come into the cafe but that had been because of the drunk shed gone straight to an empty table and sat down facing me holding her eyes on me a warning in them im going to fucking sue them on his feet now swaying between two friends a woman trying to quieten him pepperidge watching me hed caught her whisper i had said ill be at the small hotel two blocks from here in xingfu donglu its called the sichuan get chong to pick me up there at eighteen hundred hours tell him to wait outside understood you the police i want to talk to you ive been ripped off by a bloody travel agency i passed close to her table can i go to your hotel of course through the back way past the toilets and stacked crates and some bicycles and a hen in a cage slipping on broken eggs and finding the door and the yard and the alley she came behind me but vanished soon afterward and got there before i did to the hotel we werent tagged didnt have to lose anyone it was the only place i could go the only rendezvous i could give pepperidge for chong and if i walked any farther than two or three blocks id run into a police patrol towel not very big sumay said dissembling caac insignia i took it into the shower a cramped corner of the bathroom lined with sheets of plastic flakes of plaster from the ceiling embedded in the grime on the floor a streak of rust down the wall under the tap but the water was warm as shed promised and as i stood under the thin sputtering jets i was conscious of the benison not only of the healing water but of the grace of womanhood that had offered me this much comfort at a time when i badly needed it more in point of fact than comfort a kind of sanity regained a renewal of the heart the means even by which i could conceivably do what i had to do after all when dark came it would be easier the dark has so often been my shelter the ultimate safe house when all other doors are shut i found my clothes and sumay said leave your coat off i will give you shiatsu shed pulled the bed away from the corner so that she could move around it cold now but you will soon be warm there were hours before dark came and i lay down and she began working on me youre an air hostess an interpreter and you practice shiatsu youre very accomplished i have a license as therapist must understand many people in china do two or three different jobs if they can to afford anywhere nice to live nice food i earned more than my father and he is university professor her fingers moved over the tsubo points tell me where there is pain all right the message will have reached him by now the one i told you id send her hands paused so quick by telephone from here she meant from lhasa it worried her from here to london i said and from there to beijing id asked pepperidge told him shed been helpful to me at the psb station my eyes were closed but i felt her attention in the stillness of her hands if i could reach beijing so easily who was i what other powers did i have thank you she said at last it means very much to me my mother is dead i have only my father my brother was killed in tiananmen square my father will have worried about me i vanished from out of his life when i came here now there is the message she cupped her hands against my face for a moment very gently then went on with her work please relax your muscles are so tight everywhere in a moment it hurts just there yes very well she worked on the tsubo point and warmth flowed and hope flowed with it i would have yes to go to ground but the jeifang the big green truck would offer me safety and there might still be a last chance of getting xingyu to the airport some time in the night and there i said very well your head is in pain because of this bit sore yes i tripped and fell hit the edge of a door even the partial truth is uttered seldom in our trade i felt saintly the dung in the stove was glowing now i could see it at the edges of my lids it seemed less freezing in here because of the stove and her hands and what they were doing to me easing away some of the fear that always dogs the foot steps of a creature that knows its hunted you have pain also in your heart she said no i do not mean in your heart exactly in your spirit there is a ghost there immediate gooseflesh i felt the hair lifting on my arms its always haunted me this business of taking a life in the course of a mission its nothing to do with guilt the man in the temple would have taken mine if it had suited him its that the closeness to death your own or anothers brings you to the edge of the unknown where quantum forces play among the infinite reaches of the universe and souls drift like leaves on the cosmic wind seeking their new incarnation it awes me in a word but then of course theres the physical thing the sweat and the muscle burn and the mechanics of force and leverage as one body tears the life out of another theres that too and it leaves a taste in the mouth and in the heart a feeling of despair post mortem also animal triste est i said to her ive got quite a few ghosts one more wont hurt her hands moved over me tracing the meridians and in the stove a pocket of trapped air popped did you kill him that thing i said on the wall what is it the skull of the dog set in a pattern of straw and colored wool bloody thing had been worrying me ever since id come into the room it is a spirit trap when enough bad spirits have been caught in it someone will take it down for burning how will they know when its full i think they just leave it for a time knowing what it will do spiritual airwick traps bad karma replace as necessary so forth id given her an answer in any case by not answering she knew anyway she could feel his ghost in my spirit why a dog because they are sacred please turn over and relax more if you can did you go into that cafe for something to eat yes her fingers moved along my spine seeking the knotted tsubo points pressing youre still hungry then no it was for comfort the world is very frightening in a moment i said it wont be long before they change the regime in beijing and then your fathers going to be safe and a hero it happened all over europe yes i very much hope but until it is real i am frightened if the public service bureau here in lhasa finds my name in the records and sees who my father is they will send me straight to beijing and use me as a hostage to bring him from hiding so i am afraid every hour every minute hurt here no here yes her finger pressed kneading against my closed lids the light was fading over the minutes before long now it would be dark and i would have a cloak for my clandestine purposes theres nowhere else i asked her that you can stay where they cant find you she pressed again and a nerve flared i have one or two friends in lhasa yes but i cannot go to them it would mean danger for them i know some other people but not well they might turn me over to the police it happens a lot everyone is frightened everyone it wont last long i said the leaders are old and the people are enraged i turned my wrist and looked at my new watch a cheap digital thing the best i could find id bought it from a stall on my way to the cafe the time was now and we lacked nineteen minutes to the rendezvous the people are enraged sumay said yes but the soldiers have guns it is always the same she worked in silence for a time and i watched the shadows darken across the floor and heard the sounds from the street below diminishing a man shouted and a dog yelped bells had begun tolling two then three then many their carillon summoning the night that is all sumay said and took her hands away i didnt move for a minute or two my whole body was tingling youre gifted i said i feel well again i am glad i got off the bed and found my coat how much do i owe you nothing i earn a little here and there translating for the tourists acting as a guide in the shadowed room the expression in her long dark eyes was hidden what happened in the temple has great value for us for the chinese people we rejoice in the downfall of even one of the enemy the glow from the stove touched her face on one side bringing a spark of light into her eye you are going now yes but where you are like me everywhere is dangerous for you a siren had started up somewhere its undulating sound threading through the tolling of the bells if the police are looking for me i said i cant stay here i wanted to check my watch again but couldnt now i didnt want her to know i had any kind of appointment the rendezvous must be close but the timing wasnt critical chong was bureau pepperidge had said i could therefore expect routine procedures from him if i werent down there in the street at hours hed wait for me to make circuits sumay moved closer to me in the shadows i think she wanted to say something important i could feel it the siren was louder coming toward the building think of a friend i said someone you can trust and shelter there it might not be for long in a moment she put her hand on my arm it is difficult everything is very difficult for me to understand there are things i would like to tell you but i cannot i waited not interrupting there was no warmth from her hand on my arm she was still cold still frightened then she said quietly you must be careful when you go down to the street make sure you are not followed that was the important thing i suppose that id felt shed wanted to say by the police no by anyone ill be careful i said and took her hand from my arm and kissed it and went out and down the stairs and waited in the hallway until the sirens howling had died to a moan through one of the windows i could see the vehicle was an ambulance it had stopped some fifty yards along the street and people were gathering to watch there was one minute to go but when i walked into the street the huge green jeifang was already waiting there higher up with its engine running facing away from the scene of the accident and out of sight from the hotel windows and i crossed over and the door of the cab came open and i climbed inside and we started off there wouldnt be anyone following us hed be in the ambulance by now it looked all right until we got as far north from the town as the no truck depot along jeifang beilu i mean the vehicle we were in was good cover and pepperidge had protected the rendezvous and i was looking forward to telling xingyu baibing we were going to get him to the airport and fly him into beijing tomorrow hed be seeing his wife sooner than hed expected but as we approached the crossroad where daqing lu runs eastwest we saw red lights flashing in the dark and chong said it was a police roadblock and put his foot on the brakes chong not police i said theyre military i could see the vehicles had camouflage paint on them as the lights of the traffic swept across their sides yes chong said soldiers there was snow blowing on the wind thered been a few flakes in the town when wed left there ten minutes ago most of the traffic was coming the other way from the north the soldiers werent stopping it against the dark background of the hills we could see lighted batons waving the stuff through jeeps a tourist bus horsedrawn wagons another big green jeifang overtook us from the south from the town and came to a stop behind the traffic piling up against the barrier a couple of hundred yards from where we were standing what are they looking for chong sat with his thin shoulders hunched over the wheel a big motheaten fur hat dwarfing his small face his jaws working on some chewing gum theyre always looking for something can we go north any other way we could turn back and get onto linkuo lu then where north again as far as the sky burial grounds then west then north again on the road we are on now how long would that take maybe fortyfive minutes lets do it okay turn your lights off before but hed hit the switch already and looked at me and away again and made a uturn and switched the lights on and throttled up some heavy metal clanking in the rear of the truck what are we carrying mining gear hed learned his english in the states or from an american im on contract whats your cover story for this run oh i sometimes work late do you know what were going to do he looked at me briefly again pick him up take him to the airport at gonggar we rumbled through the night it is difficult everything is very difficult for me to understand there are things i would like to tell you but i cannot her long eyes shadowed what things you must be careful when you go down the street make sure you are not followed why had she said i could go to her hotel when shed known thered be surveillance on it from the street by the police no by anyone who thesnow slanted across the windshield whitening from the dark across the headlight beams when we turned again i asked chong if we were now on linkuo lu the road to the north hed talked about yeah maybe another thirty minutes now i wound the window down an inch and the freezing air blew in but it was better than the exhaust gas seeping up through the floorboards you know youve got a leak in the exhaust on this thing sure leaks everywhere head was aching again because of the bumps when we went across potholes everything rattled and bounced the windshield the seat the floorboards the brains inside my skull i would ask pepperidge to get a coverage on her from london her father was a university professor and she was an employee of the civil aviation administration of china with a licence to practice shiatsu and all those things would be in the official records london could get one of our sleepers in beijing to raise everything there was on her background if we ran into trouble it might be useful i could get some idea of where her loyalties lay what value she might have for the mission what dangers she might pose but of course if we could get xingyu to beijing tomorrow it wouldnt matter a damn nothing would mission completed so forth shit chong said red lights flashing a mile ahead of us to the north are they at the crossroad yeah we should turn west there then north again yeah he braked and ran the big truck onto the rough ground at the side of the road and doused his lights have you seen military blocks like this before you bet i mean at two adjacent crossroads not so much thing is when they block every goddam highway means theyre probably in a ring right around the town traffic was coming past us from the north running into the screen of snow and breaking it up sending it into eddies as the wind took it again this snow is it going to settle guess not the grounds too dry itll maybe pile up into drifts against the scree thats all its too cold for it to keep on coming down he moved his gum to the other side of his mouth we go back a ring around the town jesus it wouldnt matter where we went wed run into a block in a minute i asked him if i werent with you would you have any trouble getting through he thought about it i cant answer that i mean sure in the ordinary way maybe id get through okay my covers watertight ive got my contract i can show them this is one of my regular routes and everything but see it depends what theyre looking for what they want they can just say look i dont give a damn if youre the king of siam you just turn around and get your ass back down that highway with these people you cant make any predictions switch this bloody engine off will you i got the window down as far as it would go blast of cold air but at least it was fresh snow blew against the side of my face and i put a gloved hand up the wind hit the truck rocking it on its springs i didnt know suddenly what we were doing here with a ring of military checkpoints set up around the town there wasnt a chance of reaching the monastery and bringing xingyu baibing back through an armed blockade your instructions are to get the subject to beijing as soon as possible pepperidge no go chong was there a phone anywhere along the road weve just come up any building we could phone from guess not are you sure yeah he was probably right the only buildings id seen were sheds barns ruined temples then where is the nearest phone way back down there on dongfeng lu the telecommunications office thirty minutes away we dont often feel like asking for instructions at the highest level from london when were stuck in the field with the odds stacked and the chances thin because we know the situation and the environment better than they do but tonight i thought there was a case for putting a signal through phoning pepperidge were cut off by roadblocks set up by the military and theres very little chance of bringing this thing off until at least the morning if then so please signal london and see what they say i knew of course what croder would say follow your instructions his small pointed teeth nibbling at the words like a rat with a corncob one hand stroking the metal claw that he used for the other his black eyes watching for your reaction ready to catch any sign of hesitation of weakness ready to pull you off the mission and throw you out of london and into norfolk for refresher training executive replaced stroking the metal claw ready to bury it into your guts if you were found wanting following your instructions oh the bastard follow your instructions chong can we make any kind of detour mean get past the block yes he began chewing faster jeez i dunno i waited for him to run it through his head thing is sure we could try yah but we couldnt use our lights theyd see us i mean theyd see we werent on any kind of a regular highway be on a pretty rough surface west of here but of course this baby can handle what you might call inclement terrain so high off the ground sure we could try it that what you want to do yes he started the engine but take an angle i told him go south about half a mile if the grounds all right then stay parallel with the eastwest road you got it i think he was pleased in his quiet way hadnt wanted to give up and go back chong have you ever been in trouble argot for intensive action getting out of a trap battling unequal odds running a frontier under fire things like that what kind of trouble he didnt work in london wasnt used to the idiom say breaking out of an interrogation cell and leaving dead oh right yeah couple of times he turned his small head to look at me i tote a capsule i just wanted to know what your status is weget into trouble tonight he said i aim to kick any asses around i can find working his gum call me reliable he looked ahead and put the big truck at a slope of shale and gunned up with the lights off we couldnt always make out what was ahead of us the moon was a hazy crescent high and beyond the flying snow pepperidge would not of course have given me an amateur it was nerves that was all id never worked with this man chong and if those people up there at the roadblock caught the outline of this truck theyd come and ask questions the snow made a light screen but this thing was as big as an elephant can we work our way south a bit more guess not theres ravines down there not big ones but we get a wheel jammed and we could break the axle crash of metal from behind us as we took a bump skewing across loose stones and swinging back take it slower i told chong you got it but sometimes see you got to take a run at a slope or you dont have enough momentum keep the sound down as best you can yes sir he fished in a pocket care for some gum not just now he spat out of the window and peeled the packet saves my nails you worked in beijing no i was born there mom and dad fighting like cats when i left school so i shipped out on a freighter to san francisco five or six years there got involved with a private detective agency and took in most of the cities across the states did a few things for the cia kind of under the table then i shipped out again to london got into a very interesting situation getting a nicaraguan viceconsul out of a hostage deal at the embassy in gloucester road that time i was still on the unofficial payroll of the cia but it brought me in touch with your outfit they wanted someone like me in beijing bilingual native with a little experience in what they called the clandestine arts those guys kill me so i said okay the wheels began spinning again across loose shale and he played with the steering and got us straight then you know what happened i found i was chinese again and see i had a kind of advantage in beijing i could sink right down into the daily life and look out from there with what you could call western eyes and see what was really going on and at first it didnt bother me too much this was in maos time but i learned to live with it because i was in your outfit now sending stuff in to london and they were very pleased he slowed the truck and we rolled carefully down a slope with the brake shoes moaning in the drums then something happened that kind of changed things i had a sister see and she had a kid couple of years old good husband i liked him still do works in a coal mine and then they made a law you couldnt have more than one kid keep the population down and she made a mistake and had another one and they towed her and a lot of other women naked behind a truck through the streets as punishment and that was what really changed things for me see he turned to look at me that really changed things i told my director i wanted different work where i could get at these people with my bare hands you know the police and the psb and the kccpc and the military any son of a fucking gun i could get near so i could practice my clandestine arts you understand me the slope leveled out and he gunned the engine again you wanted to know my status and now you do his big fur hat bobbed as we took the bumps his thin body coming right off the seat over the bad ones his small gloved hands playing on the thick rim of the wheel i didnt say anything but it reassured me what hed said if we got into anything sticky on this trip i wouldnt have to carry him sometimes the moon came out as the wind took the snow and cut swatches through it letting the light reach the ground what happened at the rendezvous chong he caught the truck as it skewed again over the stones i guess it was more or less routine your dip sent a guy along to see if the hotel had any surveillance on it and it did so we took it from there its in the book under the heading of protecting the rendezvous there are fifty ways of doing that but tonight pepperidge had chosen this one because it had suited the situation there were people in the street and the jeifang had a big profile and i had to climb into it without anyone paying attention and in any case the peep had got to be removed so that he couldnt tag me so our man had worked out the timing and ten or fifteen minutes before the rendezvous hed dropped the peep with a discreet nerve strike and then made a show of helping him as he lay on the ground told someone to call an ambulance this man was having a heart attack and by the time the ambulance was on the scene everyone in the street was watching the action while i got into the truck farther along is he going to follow up your dip yes sure told me he would we need all the info we can get right right who the peep was who was running him the man whod dropped him would stay close there was an inch of snow on the window on my side and i let it down an inch again and saw the red lights still flashing up there to the north behind us a little now wed been going for fifteen minutes but this was virgin rock without even a wagon track and our average speed wasnt much more than walking pace snows easing chong said yes we didnt want that the light from the threequarter moon was brighter now across the ground throwing shadows it made the going easier but the truck would stand out more against the lights of the town to the south chong he turned his head whats your cover story for driving overland like this im looking for the new mining site the research crews have just set up camp theres no road made yet what are they going to mine theyre not sure yet its just an assay theyre going to drill a hundred meters down and take samples the geologists say there should be copper in this region thats your full story he looked at me you think anyone in the peoples liberation armys going to question it possibly tell you something what the average soldier in the pla has got in his head is rice i let it go it shouldnt come to that if they were going to see us theyd have seen us by now the snow had almost stopped isolated flakes drifted black against the sky and turning white as they settled on the dark green of the truck the shadows were sharp now and rocks stood out their flint surfaces glinting in the light chong where are you going to put him i got crates back there one of them empty he can breath okay gaps where the lid goes we can pile a whole lot of drilling gear on top see hell be snug as a bug in there got a blanket and some cushions nothing too good for that guy a front wheel caught a loose rock and threw it upward and it banged on the underside of the truck like a gunshot reaction from the nerves and it worried me the effects of the the shiatsu had worn off a little or it was simply that i was standing back in my mind and seeing the whole thing in perspective from overhead the truck small from that distance crawling across the dark terrain a mile and a half from the group of army vehicles and the flashing red lights a mouse creeping across the floor under the nose of a cat not a pleasant simile no uncomfortable unnerving you werent there chong asked me in beijing that time the time of tiananmen it was how they all spoke of it these days as that time no i was there the rocks glinting ahead of us bright now too bright the shadows too black too sharp i turned my head the worst thing the way i remember it chong i said theyve seen us headlights in the dark flower your papers say youre a tourist yes then what are you doing in this truck im a geologist im interested in minerals but how did you come to be in this truck i met this man in a bar hes going to show me the mining camp theyre going to drill for minerals okay chong said thatll stand up like i say they got their gourds full of rice he didnt sound nervous headlights bouncing over the rocks they were too bright for us to see what kind of vehicle it was but it must be small bouncing like that perhaps a military jeep is there a gun in this truck chong looked at me he wasnt chewing any faster than usual i liked that i guess not he said its instant jail they find one on anybody in this town we need a gun no you carry one no he lifted his gloved hands off the rim of the wheel and dropped them again got these if thered been a gun in the truck i would have told him to throw it across the scree out of sight the beams of the headlights swung away sweeping the black shale and sending the shadows jumping like choppy water then coming around in a halfcircle and lining us up dead ahead and closing in blinding us through the windshield he didnt trust us hadnt just come up alongside above and between the headlight beams there was movement and a glint of metal something quite long perhaps an assault rifle don xia che he says we have to get out chong said the shale was gritty underfoot we stood by the doors one on each side of the truck ju ql shdu lad chong raised his hands and i did the same hed switched off his engine when wed seen the headlights the engine of the jeep was still running nothing happened for a while the soldier was watching us standing in the middle of the jeep the light bouncing off the rocks and the front of the big jeifang and glinting on his gun then he dropped onto the ground and came toward us the shale scattering under his combat boots he said something to me his voice barking and i looked at chong ta bu hui zhongwen chong said telling him i didnt speak chinese the man concentrated on chong talking to him getting answers then chong took his coat off and the soldier frisked him kicked at his leggings stood back then came over to me chong started to follow him but the man swung around and shouted and chong stood still i took off my parka and dropped it onto the ground the soldier frisked me keeping the muzzle of the assault rifle lodged against my stomach then he stood back he wasnt a young recruit id say he was over thirty looked experienced seasoned with a strong squat body under a heavy military coat insignia on the sleeve perhaps a sergeant the exhaust gas from the jeep drifted on the air the snow had stopped and there would be moonlight across the ground here when the glare from the jeep had gone the night was still the temperature below freezing i could feel the heat from the huge radiator of the truck smell the tires the diesel oil in the tank sound would carry well on a night like this cold and with no wind now a man would get nowhere in stealth over this kind of ground not of course that either chong or i would have any chance of using stealth of getting anywhere i was just analyzing incoming data visual acoustic tactile olfactory because at some time we would have to make an attempt to get away from this man this soldier this strongbodied sergeant in his warm greatcoat who was eyeing me from underneath the red star oh his cap as if i were something hed found on a rubbish dump i didnt like him chong tell him i want to put my coat on translation he says you can he wants to know all about you i give him the story you told me okay yes gooseflesh it was too late to do anything if chong hadnt tested this man to make sure he didnt understand english but he must have dene that i was to expect if we remember professional procedures from anyone pepperidge would send in the director in the field one of his caliber can ask for blind faith from his executive sometimes many times where the difference between life and death is on the cards i put my parka back on while the sergeant watched me then he walked over to chong not turning his back on me walking sideways a little keeping me within the periphery of his vision field where the eye detects only movement he held the big gun level aimed at chongs diaphragm and they began talking it wasnt conversation the sergeant had this gutteral bark loud and unpleasant to the ear his squat body jerked forward sometimes from the waist to put emphasis on what he was saying chong looked relaxed arms hanging head angled forward by a degree i liked that too he wasnt on the defensive had the confidence of a man who can do no wrong ta zai ze cheli ganshao why was i with him in the truck perhaps if i were a tourist ta shige dizhixuejia dui kuang chan you xingqu i am not normally worried by guns for several reasons theyre often held by amateurs who dont know they should keep their distance when theyre using them as a threat and then its only a matter of how fast you can move before they can fire a gun also allows false confidence and that can be fatal has been in my own experience fatal to those who have held a gun on me so normally they dont worry me except that i dont like the bang they make i am by nature a quiet soul this man though worried me with his gun he wasnt an amateur and even with a thing this size he was keeping his distance there was no question of whether chong or i could move fast enough to make a strike before he could fire nor was the gun giving him any feeling of false confidence he was a professional soldier trained in the armory and at the butts trained to man a roadblock and conduct an interrogation of enemy prisoners we got these chong lifting his hands off the steering wheel dropping them back but our hands werent going to be enough i would have liked to know what was in his mind chongs as we stood here in the blinding light he nursed a hate for these people the people in uniform who took orders from the overlords who themselves had thought fit to turn women into cattle and drive them behind trucks through the streets but i could only hope that he could control it his hate and not let it reach flashpoint and tempt him to rush the gun he wouldnt of course do it without thinking he wasnt mad but he might let the idea simmer might watch for a chance that could be fatal he might watch for a chance and see it suddenly and take it and get it wrong and go flying back with his feet coming off the ground and the smoke curling out of that thing and the echoes banging their way among the rocks and the people up there at the roadblock turning their heads go and see whats happening with the sergeant down there fatal not just for chong but for bamboo and for dr xingyu baibing and for me id have to speak to him to chong if i could you will not make a move i repeat you will not make a move that is an order there exists within the structure of command laid out by the bureau a form of ranking that is designed not with any kind of military pecking order in mind but the concept of safety it is safer when a shadow executive is in the field with other people support couriers contacts sleepers for this ranking to be recognized and observed so that everyone knows where he is and what he can do and above all who calls the shots dao chehoumian qu in any given situation its the executive who calls the shots and if this man chong has been trained in bureau lore and mores he would know this and observe them we got to walk to the rear of the truck okay he didnt go for our stories he says you must be a journalist merde i said dont do anything he didnt answer i didnt expect him to any kind of exchange between us would sound like connivance and the sergeant would be onto it straight away no talking so forth and that would make things more difficult for us it was all we had left to save ourselves with if we could communication more shouting cmon over here he wants us side by side i walked past the big radiator feeling its heat on the side of my face we couldnt do anything with heat not too close okay i stopped turning my back to the light and heard the sergeants boots crunching across the shale away from us he was getting into the jeep it occurred to me that it could suddenly be over that hed positioned us close together in the beams of the headlights so that he could pump out a dozen or so shells from the assault gun and then drive away they tried to sell some kind of story about being geologists but i think they were just a couple of underground revolutionaries and were better off without people like that send someone to take the truck in to the barracks leave them where they are because that was the way of life in the peoples republic of china now you wave a placard with the word democracy on it and theyll shoot you dead you kneel on a prayer mat and theyll burn your monastery from under you these are the dark ages in a totalitarian country and if you try to run counter to the requirements of the state then the state will require you to be shot so it is written so it shall come to pass zhou walk chong said the engine of the jeep was throttled up a little and there was more shouting we keep in front of the headlights began walking the jeep behind us its tires crunching across the ground chong dont do anything you got it if i think theres anything we can do ill give you time more shouting keep in front of the headlights the jeep was turning in a curve and we moved with it our shadows going ahead of us reaching into the darkness beyond the range of the headlight beams sure okay youll give me time the spread of light turned in a halfcircle and we turned with it walking the four of us two men and two shadow men across the roof of the world we couldnt do anything with shadows the truck came into view again and we approached it from the rear and there was another shout halt chong said boots rang on metal then a third shadow moved in as the sergeant walked into the light orders you stay right where you are okay chong went forward to the tailboard and hit the pins clear of the posts and it swung down banging against the stops the sergeant walked past us at a distance of fifteen feet with the gun trained on us then he climbed the side of the truck and sat on the roof of the cab facing the rear high on the big truck he was above the full glare of the beams he barked an order and chong pulled himself up to the bed of the truck and stood there waiting his back to me now his shadow beside the sergeants legs on the rear of the cab la shi xie shenme pointing chong looked down then up at the sergeant again what are those something like that theyre drilling rods la xiene chong began shifting the equipment dragging the steel bars to one side heaving a canvas bag off the floor and dumping it out of the way the sergeant sat with the big gun sloping downward keeping us both covered some of the equipment was light short steel rods fivepound hammers a set of levers with a strap around them chong pulled them aside stacking them out of the way i watched him they would make good weapons we couldnt do anything with weapons there were three crates and that was what the sergeant was interested in he barked more orders and chong snapped the fasteners open and lifted a lid in the first crate there were instruments of some sort i couldnt see into the crates from where i stood because the bed of the truck was more or less at eye level but chong was taking a few things out holding them up in the second crate there was camping gear for the drilling crew billy cans butane stoves a frying pan blankets chong dropped them back into the crate and swung the lid down i knew now the exhaust gas came clouding through the wash of light giving it a bluish tint and sometimes the engines note faltered and picked up again perhaps because of impurities in the fuel or a loose sparkplug lead my shadow stood against the tailboard of the truck stark sharpedged at this distance i knew now what the soldier was looking for what they were all looking for the soldiers up there manning the roadblock the soldiers manning the roadblocks in a huge circle right around the city of lhasa chong worked on the fasteners of the third crate and swung the lid open laer shi shenme chong pulled out a blanket then a cushion then another one i got crates back there one of them empty hell be snug as a bug in there got a blanket and some cushions nothing too good for that guy a lot of questions now from the sergeant and answers from chong wei shenme chule zhe xie dongxi wai zhe xiangzhi shi kongde ling yige xiangzhi mei kong you heng duo kong da kai xiangzhi chong went to the first crate the one with the drilling gear and opened it bu shi laige xiangzhi shi di er ge chong let the lid fall and went to the second crate and opened it i think the sergeant had asked why there were only a blanket and a few cushions in the last crate and chong had said there wasnt room in the other ones but it didnt matter very much what construction i was putting on things because the sergeant was standing upright suddenly henghao excitement in his voice triumph in his whole attitude he hadnt found the man he was looking for the man they were all looking for but he believed he might have found a potential hiding place for a hunted man in transit if one needed he wouldnt be sure chong might have told him that the empty crate was for the ore samples theyd be bringing back and that the blanket and cushions had been thrown in there for the drilling crew as an afterthought but the search the army had mounted tonight from here to the lhasa river was for dr xingyu baibing the notorious dissident and that was all this sergeant had got on his mind hia che chong came across the tailboard and dropped to the ground his eyes passing across mine with some kind of message that i couldnt interpret he looked calm still and i wondered whether hed been interrogated before when id asked him earlier if hed seen any action hed said sure a couple of times but that didnt tell me much he might have fought some kind of rearguard operation or got clear of an intelligence trap but that kind of experience wouldnt help him now the sergeant would keep the assault rifle trained on us until we were back in the cab of the jeifang and hed be behind us all the way to the roadblock then we would be interrogated and by professionals there wouldnt be any kind of rearguard action we could fight and we werent going to get out of this trap because there wasnt anything we could do about it now we couldnt do anything with heat or with shadows or with weapons and id stopped grasping at straws in my mind and started thinking ahead and all i could see ahead of us was an interrogation cell and their eyes in the shadow of their peaked caps and the instruments whatever instruments they would use these people had refined the art of torture over thousands of years but there still wouldnt be anything more effective than a sharpened twig of bamboo under the eyelids or the nails i tote a capsule quite possibly but a capsule isnt the answer to everything if the opposition think youre a highlevel intelligence officer theyll search you for a capsule and if they find it youre finished but even if they dont make a search youve got to reach the bloody thing and pop it and break the shell before they can move in and theres something else you can put a man through norfolk and throw every psychologist in the place at his head and pass him out with a suffix after his name in the ultraclassified records as a man who is confidently expected to use a capsule if the circumstances dictate the necessity and that is of course a quote my good friend it is a direct quote from the book of rules dont you think its charming i mean as a euphemism meaning as it does that he is confidently expected this man this doomed and beleaguered spook to use his capsule because he believes and undertakes in his contract to uphold and implement the belief that his life has less importance than his duty that he recognizes the highest priority of them all in this circumscribed and exacting trade to protect the mission dakai che dangban chong moved to the tailboard of the truck yet even then the capsule trick isnt foolproof you may well have passed out of intensive training intensive but i joke my good friend its ruthless merciless murderous you may well have passed out with the exotic suffix after your name and it may be that the opposition has failed to search you for a capsule but there will be the moment of decisionmaking and that will vary from one man to another will vary even within each individual according to his personal disposition as he sits under the blinding light with his inquisitors for you cannot always decide exactly when you will no longer be able to stand this no longer be able to allow them to do this to you as the sharpened twig of bamboo is thrust again no longer be able to shut off your mind to what is happening and shift into theta waves is thrust again and deeper now deeper you cannot always decide how long it will be before the instant arrives when you know you would prefer death and then of course its too late to get at your capsule so you have to compromise chong heaved at the tailboard he wasnt a strong man too thin too light but he was winning hed got it to shoulder level the sergeant watched him struggling you have to compromise you leave it as late as you can and then decide you go into the cell and look around and see what theyve got for you how serious they are how professional and you look at the people who are going to work on you and make a decision if they look as if theyre prepared to take things to the limit and you dont feel within you at this particular moment the ability the spiritual almost supernatural ability to go through anything anything at all then you go as fast as you can for the capsule and crack it with your teeth finito la shi shenme sergeant shouting i knew my capabilities what they would be when we arrived in the interrogation cell but i didnt know what his would be chongs and it worried me because he knew where xingyu baibing was and that would be their only question la shi shenme the sergeant had moved to the tailboard i couldnt quite see what was happening because chongs body was in the way but i think hed tried to hide something push it among the other stuff in the truck and the sergeant had seen him wanted to know what it was na guolai gel wo chong gave it to him some kind of wallet and the sergeant opened it holding it in the glare of the jeeps headlights and i was close enough to see a wad two wads of chinese banknotes with elastic bands round them zhe yonglai gan stenmede xunllan gdngren de gdngzhi wages for the drilling crew there wasnt any drilling crew they were y banknotes if both wads were the same it looked as if there were two lots of perhaps fifty at a rough guess the equivalent of ј sterling the sergeant was looking at them looking at chong chong was saying nothing the engine of the jeep throbbed steadily in the background the exhaust gas clouded blue in the headlight beams its on record that the pay of a sergeant in the peoples liberation army runs at about y a month this one was looking at twenty months pay ni xiang hulluo wo dangran bushi asking chong perhaps if he was trying to bribe him but he couldnt be there wouldnt be any price on the honor and prestige of this man if he could find the archenemy of the peoples republic of china xingyu baibing chong would know that henghao the sergeant pushed the wallet inside his greatcoat and went on talking and when hed finished chong turned to me okay he says we have to stay right where we are when hes back in the jeep we have to get into the cab of the truck and head for the roadblock up there he follows us christ sake dont make any kind of move okay hes mad at me he turned back to the sergeant and gave him a careful bow the sergeant began walking backward to the jeep keeping the assault rifle at the hip you know the worst thing for me chong said about tiananmen they turned the lights out before they started the massacre dont you think that was obscene the sergeant swung his assault rifle into the jeep and chong took his glove off and put a hand into his pocket and there was a dull flash and the sergeant bloomed like a huge crimson flower in the night dont you think that was obscene chong said turning the lights out bells something brushed my foot a rat i think i stood still just inside the doorway it was as far as i had got i watched the two great beams of timber above my head and to my right there was a gap there where the balustrade along the second floor had broken away the movement had been there just now i had seen it when i had come in they were everywhere the rats you heard them squeaking it was winter and they were desperate for shelter all over the town desperate for food the movement had been just there in the gap along the balustrade or what id thought was movement this was the door the abbot had shown me earlier i could come in this way without disturbing the monks id told him it was important to me not to disturb them in their prayers their daily life and in part it was true but he understood it mattered more to me that i wasnt seen coming or going the moon was high in the south its light slanting in rays through the breaks in the timber where the roof on that side had been destroyed the rays were gray substantial like a milkness in water because of the incense they burned in here and the yakbutter lamps with their smoky wicks i was used to the smell of this place it was pungent a presence it only faded after id been back here for an hour or so dpal idan mgon po it was close on midnight a time i suppose for the last prayers of the day the chanting was not loud it came from the big hall on the east side of the monastery where the huge gilded buddha sat brought here from a gutted temple after the uprising the abbot had told me po spyan hdren na a small bells rang at intervals the chanting and the bells didnt worry me the whole ruin was already alive with sound in the intense heat of the sunshine during the day the timbers swelled and at night cooled their straining was as familiar and as particular to this place as its smell and i was used to it it was a kind of silence and unfamiliar sound would alert me movement again and i caught it but not in time to identify it before it was gone i kept still waiting for minutes then took a step across the earth floor sighting again from a new angle at this point hallucination began the eyes becoming jaded by the unchanging view the mind presenting phantasmagoria for them to look at i let them close and stood for minutes on end clearing the images perhaps it had been the same kind of illusion when id come in the movement id seen thought id seen or possibly there were owls here it was time to go forward find the first ladder and climb xingyu baibing was in danger here now the police and the psb had called in the military to help in the search and theyd set up roadblocks everywhere and soon theyd be beating on every door in the town searching every building house hotel temple monastery chong was waiting outside with the big jeifang it had taken three hours to get here moving overland and keeping clear of the roads and their intersections coming up against terrain that wouldnt allow even the big truck across it turning back a mile and going north again keeping a watch on the lights flashing far in the distance little thing i learned from the cia wed been bumping and rattling for nearly two hours since wed left the jeep over rocks that split under the weight of the front wheels and sent bright slivers flying through the moonlight i was waiting for a tire to blow how to make them yes the little remotecontrol bombs they were designed for automobiles and planes but ive used them a few times on people theyre good i call them peopleboomers i got a few bigger ones stashed away building boomers you need any you tell me hed driven the military jeep half a mile and run it into a ravine deep enough to hide it from level sight theyd see it all right from a chopper in the morning but we couldnt do anything about that all we wanted was enough time to get to the monastery and take xingyu baibing to a new hideout there was no hope of getting him to the airport now wed left the sergeant to the birds hell be picked to the bone inside of two hours from first light chong said when he got back into the truck theres a skyburial site a couple of kilometers from here that direction the birds know where to come then get a wind the rest should be covered in silt but the military are going to look for the bastard anyway once they find the jeep he peeled some chewing gum did me a whole lot of good you know drop in the ocean sure but i got a real kick out of looking at all that red in the moonlight head coming off did you see the head coming off kind of making a personal statement lighting one little lamp in tiananmen you know the trouble with guys i mean guys as distinct from gals theyre so fucking romantic glory of war all that shit i let him go on talking as we drove the big jeifang north he didnt want any answers any questions i was getting to know him underneath the easy manner there was rage burning in the name of tiananmen we got enough gas he said after a while for maybe another fifty kilometers this kind of ground if the tires hold out got two spares got food i brought some army rations canned stuff last awhile the two of you xingyu and myself chong would make his way back and report to pepperidge and provide liaison i put my feet on the top of the dashboard to ease the muscles head was all right wasnt throbbing so much now in spite of the bouncing around a crack had started in the windshield this wasnt shatterproof glass the whole truck was taking a beating and that couldnt last for ever perhaps not even for fifty kilometers what are the chances i asked chong of finding somewhere for him between here and the airport he knew the region better than i did and i could be missing something he turned to look at me we dont have any we dont have any chances go south with him on board were just putting him into their hands north then i said within fifty kilometers what have we got few farms few more monasteries up in the hills yak herds nomad camps couple of mining sites theyll check all those the military bet your ass they will they got choppers go where they like put troops down and beat the bushes a front wheel hit a rock and something smashed i think a headlamp shit i asked him if there were caves caves you bet few hundred how big he halfturned on the seat interested all sizes i guess but thered be plenty with enough room for just two people no crowding you know some of them big as a ballroom sure you could do that for a couple of days maybe more if you had to i thought about it the objective for bamboo was to fly xingyu baibing into beijing assuming the coordinator replacing sojourner had managed to take over without any delay but we couldnt do that now all we could do was keep him from being flushed out and sent to beijing and brainwashed and pushed in front of the cameras the return of the prodigal son penitent reformed an example to others who thought fit to impede the onward struggle for socialism thats the plan chong was watching me taking snatched glances away from the moonlit rocks ahead theres nothing else i said we can do okay have to do it tonight use the dark that sun comes up were going to see a sky full of choppers looking for that fucking sergeant that had been an hour ago and now he was waiting outside the monastery with the truck it didnt need two of us to fetch xingyu baibing thugs rje hdul dang dbang i crossed the earth floor and climbed the ladder if there had been movement if it hadnt been an errant flicker of hallucination i would find out what it was at close range the first ladder had a tilt to the left and i put my feet on the other side testing the rungs this was the ladder the monks used bian the guard and his replacement they brought water from the reservoir and food and changed the sanitary bucket it was a good strong ladder and the tilt didnt worry me it was something else that worried me i stopped climbing and let the data come in the chanting and the bells and the moonlight and the scent of the incense and the lamps the feel of the rough wood under my hands while the primitive brainstem signalled the nerves opening the pupils by a degree stimulating the olfactory sensors turning the tympanic membranes to sweep the environment for unfamiliar sounds sensitizing the tactile nodes of the fingers and palm returning me to the ancient status of the animal in the wild seeking the means for survival the skin crawling now and the hairs lifting on the scalp because of the scent id detected strange and sweet and unfamiliar here perhaps dangerous i couldnt identify it couldnt find the key the association with other things other environments where id smelted this scent before i waited standing still on the ladder and let the mind range on its own taking slow breaths to present the stimulus nothing came nothing came and i climbed again watching the long gallery on the second floor watching the gap where the timbers had fallen during the fire watching for movement ldna na dpal ldan mgon po my boot scraped a splinter from a rung of the ladder and i heard it fall because it was silent here in this huge derelict place with a silence beyond the chanting and the bells and the creak of the beams as the cold contracted them a silence in which all i could consciously hear were unfamiliar unexpected sounds the animal brainstem tuned to them and this was good this was as it should be the senses taut alert beyond the norm but i was not reassured there was still something else other than the strange sweet unfamiliar scent that was causing the gooseflesh lifting the hair on the scalp screech of a night bird somewhere and i felt the sweat springing saw lights for an instant leaping against the dark as the nerves were fired i stopped moving absorbed the shock climbed again still something else but i was beginning to know that its source wasnt physical sensory information was shimmering at a level of awareness beyond the conscious as subtle as the trembling of a web and it was bringing fear into my spirit bringing desolation but let us not my good friend lend ourselves overmuch to the imagination the organism is under stress and prey to fancy let us rather climb to the gallery and find things out you know its true its not just your imagination yes but what can i do about it for gods sake the ladder gave a little when i reached the top one of the rawhide straps had worked loose but no matter i was safe enough i was on the gallery and this was where the movement was the one i had seen from below it was a colored rag hanging across a strut of timber and moving very slightly in a draft of air it must have dropped from the floor above and caught across the rough woodwork i hadnt noticed it the first time id come perhaps it hadnt been there po spyan hdren na a faint now the voices below the muted tinkling of the bells what were they praying for down there where the great gold buddha sat with his fat stomach and his enigmatic smile for peace on earth and goodwill to all men for a brave new china and the blessings of democracy for the sergeant down there across the trackless wastes or perhaps for dr xingyu baibing the new messiah let them pray for him above all pray for him screech of that bloody bird enough to scare the wits out of you as they say i suppose it was one of those that wheeled and dived across the burial site that chong had spoken of as id seen them doing in bombay and theres a euphemism for you skyburial a pretty thought but what it means when you get down to it is that you leave your dear ones out there under the sky and those bloody birds come down and pick at them taking chunks of flesh in their great hooked beaks and flying off with them plundering the dead i would rather call it the flesh tearing under the talons nor is it the time though to be morbid no i take your point standing here on the gallery with the sweat seeping along the skin and the hackles raised and the fear of christ in me because of that strange smell and the intelligence that informed my spirit that something had gone wrong here in the monastery tonight horribly wrong dawn the subject has been seized i waited giving him time in a moment is he still alive i dont know they killed the monk on guard waited again pepperidge would want to put the questions in order of their priority and i left it to him hed have to signal london as soon as id rung off and theyd want the precise facts the mission had crashed and i didnt know what they would do put another one together with a standby executive fly people in from hong kong call out everyone theyd got in lhasa sleepers supports agentsinplace god only knew what they would do if there was anything they could do at all when would you say it happened there was a lot of crackle on the line but i suppose that was normal for this place i cant say for certain one of the monks said he thought he heard something like a shout not long before we got there call it between twentythreethirty and midnight chong watched me from the cab of the truck hed broken the lock on the gates of the depot to get me inside to the phone and then brought the truck up to block off the entrance his face looked smaller than ever at the window of the cab cold pinched his eyes watchful pain in them it hadnt been his fault but it had bruised him hed been called in by pepperidge to support a major operation and the subject had been dr xingyu baibing the messiah and hed only been with the mission a matter of hours before it had crashed and on the long nervewracking trip south across that appalling terrain hed been terse brooding banging his fists on the rim of the big wheel and shouting above the din of the truck cursing in chinese cursing or praying i didnt know which then falling quiet for an hour two hours finally finding his center and talking normally the rage and frustration buried again behind the easy americanstyle manner he watched me from the cab turning sometimes to check the street in the sky behind him to the east a crack of saffron light lay across the horizon neither of us had eaten slept washed for the past twelve hours rations in the truck but we couldnt touch them no appetite for anything but the rancor in the soul to chew on was there any sign pepperidge asked me that he wasnt taken alive that he was killed i thought back it didnt look as if thered been a struggle bian the monk was lying on his back staring into the moonlight his prayer beads lying half across his face i would think that another monk or someone in a monks robes had brought food or water to the third floor and surprised him killing him silently and going in to xingyus cell told him these facts pepperidge these assumptions there would have been a second man possibly a second man whod climbed the ladder as soon as bian had been dealt with in case it needed physical force to take xingyu but i thought i knew now what that strange sweet smell had been in the monastery chloroform were his things missing yes the diary the technical papers the flight bag insulin kit but they didnt find the thing that koichi made the mask i brought that away and youll keep it with you yes hell was he talking about there was only one man in this world the mask would fit and he was gone and it looked unlikely wed ever see him again you told the abbot yes brought them away from their prayers the abbot and the interpreter committing a sacrilege ive no doubt their sandals scuffing the earth floor their robes sickly with the smell of incense the abbots eyes wide as i told him his hands going at once to his beads ni kendin bian shile the interpreter looked at me you are sure that bian is dead yes im sorry xingyu xianshen ta met shi i dont know they came for him but i doubt if it was to kill him later the abbot spoke to the interpreter who turned and called two other monks away from their prayers they passed us with shock in their eyes their robes flying as they hurried across the main floor to the ladder in the corner in a moment i said your holiness i imagine there are monks here who joined you not so long ago people you dont know very well as yet do you think anyone like that could have betrayed dr xingyu for an instant he looked appalled then said through the interpreter only four of us knew about our guest only four the abbot himself the interpreter bian and the monk whod shared duty with him the man who helped bian i said did you know him well but of course it was a great responsibility i gave him i left it at that didnt ask if this man might have talked to anyone else here it wouldnt have been easy for those who knew about this eminent guest of theirs to keep silent this was a small sect and the messiah was in their house i told pepperidge this much and then for a moment there was nothing on the line but crackling then he said that could have been what happened yes people talked someone chose to betray him but they didnt go to the police no xingyu hadnt been taken by the police the psb the kccpc or the military or there would have been jeeps raising the dust outside this place and shouting and the tramp of boots and xingyu would have been hustled away with his wrists bound and his feet dragging the abbot too summary trial and execution it wasnt the police i said who took him or anyone official it was a private cell and this was the worst of it i hadnt told chong on the way south in the night he was support not executive his job was to provide manpower pass information liaise with the director in the field protect the shadow blow up sergeants support people must be told even less than the executives because theyre more vulnerable more in danger of capture and interrogation i wouldnt have told him in any case he was frustrated enough as it was but this was what we faced now we hadnt just got the police and the public service bureau and chinese intelligence and the peoples liberation army to deal with somewhere in lhasa in the streets behind the walls behind the doors in the shadows there was a private cell operating professional effective and with powerful political backing or they wouldnt have targeted a man like xingyu baibing and this was the worst of it because the forces of vast organizations like the police and the military have got the advantage in numbers and equipment and information resources and its often difficult to keep out of their way but at least you know where they are and what they look like you can see them coming a private cell is different you can be standing next to a man in a bar or a hotel or an airport and not know that youre in hazard not know that your mission has been infiltrated and that youll crash if youre lucky or be found dead by morning if youre not a private cell can work in the dark in silence and in stealth its power to destroy the opposition is not paraded like that of a rattlesnake but shrouded like that of the black widow we were the opposition do you think pepperidge on the line that someone is just trying to make some money xingyu would have a price on his head a big one no the people who took him were professionals not mercenaries not terrorists it had been done with great expertise theyd not only succeeded in finding xingyu baibing but theyd gone into a monastery full of monks and got out again with the man they wanted killing silently and disturbing no one chong was getting out of his cab looking along the road looking at me his gloved hands palm down pressing the air dont worry just keep a low profile stay where you are dont come into the street i told him id gone to ground but going to ground doesnt necessarily mean that youve got to bury yourself in a cellar though it might come to that if its the only way to survive the field and finally get out and go home it normally means youve got to keep off the streets if you can stay away from hotels and taxis and airports watch for the police every minute youre exposed and be ready to duck and run and wait things out if they see you its a status we loathe and fear because it can only get more dangerous as time goes by they knew my name at the public service bureau theyd checked my papers there and asked sumay wang if she knew where i was the police would have been alerted as a routine procedure and id given my passport and visa to pepperidge in the cafe because if i were stopped on the street i couldnt show them would have to say id lost them and then try to get clear before they took me along to the station for an inquiry you cannot in a town where martial law obtains go without papers pressing his hands down chong everythings under control his breath clouding on the raw morning air as the light in the east took on more color pouring gold along the horizon do they want the subject pepperidge asked or what hes got in his head not after facts now simply tapping me for what he could get for what i could give him because london would ask these questions and hed need answers if all they wanted was information i said theyd have gone for me not him information on bamboo the information id been forced to give xingyu to keep him from running home to beijing so what do they want him for i had to think but it wasnt easy the cold was like a clamp numbing the body numbing the brain not cold so much as fatigue been a hard day last night they want him i said for bargaining perhaps as a hostage there were a lot of possible scenarios with xingyu baibing as the catalyst brought forward to bring political pressure a guarantee a bargaining chip a martyr to bring the weight of the people against the chinese government they cant do anything with him here no theyll have to take him to beijing but they cant do that his voice kept fading coming back any more than we could have now that hes being actively sought in a moment what is your situation ground chongs still in support i told him about the roadblocks the sergeant can you still use the truck yes the sergeant wouldnt have seen it distinctly enough from the roadblock to identify it as a green jeifang and the most he wouldve said to anyone would have been that there was a vehicle on the move down there hed go and check it out if they were searching vehicles pepperidge said it couldnt have been a coincidence someone must have told them you were going to him a beat theyre very close arent they i didnt say anything id thought about that before but it hadnt got me anywhere simply confirmed that we had a private cell dogging my shadow infiltrating bamboo driving me to ground ill have to signal pepperidge said of course the line cracked and i waited chong came through the gates standing inside his back to me stamping his feet gloved hands rammed into the pockets of his coat an engine was rumbling and i watched the gates they were heavy timber with gaps at the hinged ends a gap in the middle i will relay pepperidges voice came again what youve told me theyll want to know what your plans are that had been the reason for the silence on the line hed been thinking out how to put it because this was going to be rough in a moment i said to find the subject it was an army vehicle a camouflaged personnel carrier i watched it through the gaps in the gates past chengs motionless figure it was loaded the carrier chinese troops in battle dress it was going slowly toward the centre of the city yes pepperidge said your plans are to find the subject of course but london will ask for details either they were coming down from the intersections in the north the roadblocks or they were moving into the town from an outlying base to begin a housetohouse search for xingyu baibing tell london they cant have any details i said into the phone the carrier had stopped not far from the big green jeifang and chong turned and stood facing me now his mouth working on the chewing gum his eyes blanked off wed agreed on our way south through the night that we would go on using the truck as our base at least for the first hour or two of the day that it wasnt a risk wouldnt call attention there were hundreds of these things in the city and around it and along the roads to chengdu golmud kathmandu most of them painted green like this one the only man who could have recognized it as ours was dead but perhaps we were wrong because boots were hitting the ground as men dropped from the carrier or their citywide search was going to start here at the truck depot its like this you see pepperidge ive got every confidence in you and i think youve got as good a chance as anyone of bringing this thing home the mission as good a chance of bringing it home as any other executive they might fly out here to take over and do what he could to go in cold and try pulling something else out of the wreckage the only point i said in getting someone else out here would be that he could work at street level unknown to the police and the psb unknown to the private cell boots on the outside i watched the gates the engine on the personnel carrier was still running it hadnt moved on what theyll say pepperidge is that while i have total confidence in you they cannot share it unless you can give me any idea of where you plan to go from here they may well instruct me to send you out of the field he hadnt liked saying that he would have done anything not to say it i quite understand best i could do put him out of his misery take it like a man so forth as i watched the gates and saw coming over to them three soldiers chong didnt move he was standing twenty feet away between me and the gates facing them now perfectly still there were trucks standing in the depot a dozen or more most of them big jeifangs adequate cover on the far side was a low wall and that was the way i would have to go and this is the problem of going to ground you can be forced at any minute to run and keep on running theres no base anymore that you can work from no stability the sands are shifting all the time under your feet you can see their point cant you in london quite understand shivering in the first pale light of the new day shivering under the warm padded coat the one id taken from the man in the temple first his life and then his coat uncivil of me i will admit shivering despite its warmth as the soldiers came to the gates and started banging on them da kai chong didnt move shouted back at them zher hai mei ren pepperidge i can only obey their instructions of course londons if they he broke off was that someone shouting yes are you pressed not really tamen shenme shihou dao crackling on the line who is shouting chong hes all right but i might have to ring off if i do ill get through to you again from somewhere else in a moment dont leave anything too late chong hadnt moved jiu dian shouting at them he would give me time i knew that if they started forcing the gates hed turn and give me the signal and wed separate make our own way out if they didnt start shooting first look i said they cant get him out of lhasa hes still here somewhere im going to find him soldiers banging at the gates chong standing perfectly still shouting at them lihai zher ba jiu dian huilai pepperidge on the line worried by the noise id be happier if youd ring off and look after things there hes still in this town i said and im going to find him tell them to give me a bit more time a few hours banging at the gates thats all im asking a few hours dog chong hit the brakes and the big truck lurched to a stop what did you tell them jesus he said weve done a kilometer in thirty minutes down this goddam road we were blocked off by a yak wagon couldnt overtake i told them nobody was at the depot yet theyd have to come back they didnt argue he rested his hand on the huge vibrating gear lever the engine rumbling sure they argued but their heads are full of rice one of the yaks was lying slumped in the shafts whats the problem its died everything dies wait long enough he kicked the clutch and hit the gear lever and we moved off again we going anywhere he was still furious his throat tight when he spoke we going to find where they took him maybe i watched the road ahead eventually this was the road south into the town linkuo lu where the temple was where id taken the coat from the man grit blew in through the cracks of the doors there was a wind getting up eventually yes of course we would find where theyd taken dr xingyu baibing and we would bring him back under our protection but meanwhile they would not be very happy in london there would be no dancing in the streets subject seized location unknown pla sergeant deceased croder at the signals board his black basilisk eyes watching the man with the piece of chalk as the stuff came in from pepperidge hyde standing there poking his tongue in his cheek the whole place very quiet as they listened to his voice the calm and gentle voice of my director in the field as it reached them through the government communications mast in cheltenham and the unscrambler in codes and cyphers three floors above subject is expected to reveal critical information with or without duress his captors believed to be private cell repeat private cell operating in the field theres a bell in lloyds of london the lutine bell since that is the name of the vessel it was salvaged from and they ring it whenever news comes that a ship has gone down and there is a silence afterward its rather like that in the signals room when news comes of the kind that pepperidge had given them now that the mission had foundered executive to ground and inactive the two major items of course were that the subject was expected to reveal critical information to blow bamboo and that the executive had gone to ground and was inactive which meant that he must be wanted by the police and security forces of the host country and could no longer operate at street level and that he had no further ability to advance or even protect the mission whos this bastard chong said man waving the signal reporting a deceased pla sergeant in the field was obligatory any terminal incident must be noted in the records but it also told london control that there was now a hue and cry going on as a result with the military searching earnestly for the assassin pull up i told chong the report that a private cell had entered the field was of critical importance but with the mission crashed and the executive incapable of further action there wasnt much that london could do about it you say pull up yes not quite incapable that is a mortuary word suggestive of worms and the silence of the tomb pressed harassed beleaguered what you will the man who had been waving came to the side of the cab as the truck ground to a stop with the brake drums moaning his beijing jeep was standing at the roadside keyi da nide bian che ma chong whats he saying stink of diesel gas seeping through the floorboards i wound the window down wants a lift well give him one chong looked at me he a friend as distinct from foe trade argot yes shang che as the man came around the front of the truck i said chong you dont speak english gotcha i pushed the door open and shifted over to make room and the man came aboard hauling himself up by the big iron handgrip expensive duffel jacket heavy black beard an energetic barrelshaped body dropping onto the seat beside me pulling the door shut with a noise like a bomb xiexie thats all right i said ah peering at me then well well youre getting a lift too yes i had sunglasses on otherwise he would have recognized me sooner even with the twoday stubble a lot of people wore sunglasses here without attracting attention the ultraviolet was intense at this altitude this was cataract country trotter how is the head much better thanks of course to you my dear fellow im glad it turned out all right in a moment that bloody jeep always gives trouble about here i do this road every day grit in the carburetor i daresay an occupational hazard for every vehicle in lhasa but the thing is they never replace the air filters at the rental place he sounded i thought a degree too talkative thats a shame i said chong shifted the huge gear lever again for a truck as big as a dinosaur there wasnt much room in the cab i felt trotter moving closer to me very quietly under his breath this chap speak english no ah gloved hands a little restless on his knees fingers tapping i dont know if youre aware of it my dear fellow but the police are looking for you locke isnt it yes how do you know im sort of local here on and off come here to dig as often as i can police know me well and they sometimes haul me in whenever theres a problem with a roundeye ask me if i know anything and so on in a moment from what i gather there was an agent of the kccpc found dead in a temple yesterday a beat the one where i picked you up it appears someone described you he turned his face toward me i can assure you it was not i chong hit the brakes again as a tour bus cut things close past a horse and cart and we put our hands on the dashboard bie dang dao i hadnt given trotter any kind of an answer look he said in the first place i told them i didnt know anything about you obviously it wouldnt be wise for me to refuse to help those buggers when i can because they turn a blind eye if im still on the road after a curfew back late from a dig that sort of thing but they get damned little out of me i can assure you buildings were coming up as we passed the nomad camp ground the big telecommunications office in the distance wed been making better time i hadnt said anything in the second place his deep voice muted im not the slightest bit interested in your affairs but if by chance you happen to have dispatched an agent of the kccpc then im delighted between you and me youre certain are you that this chap doesnt understand english certain well and good because this is tricky territory as i imagine you realize never know who youre talking to his gloved hand on my knee for an instant i mean the chinese so the thing is since the police are after you it might be a good idea to make yourself scarce dont you agree it sounds logical ni yao kouxiangtang ma chong holding out his packet of wrigleys trotter shook his head bu xiexie ni its not easy he said in a place like this to make oneself scarce with martial law and everything of course the entire populace hates and detests the authorities but one or two are so scared of reprisals that theyll give anyone away even their friends even their relatives we reached for the dashboard again as chong used the brakes for the first traffic lights the drums moaning what i would like to tell you my dear fellow is that if you need a good place a safe place to sort of lie low till things blow over id be delighted to assist he leaned forward looking past me at chong mafan ning keyi rang wo zai xiayitiao jie xia che ma keyi i gave you my card i believe yes phone me at any time my dear fellow at any time i know a safe place if youre really stuck not the hotel of course its just a tiny apartment in the native quarter dear god the whole town used to be the native quarter but now the chinese are taking over its appalling the sooner they get that gang of cutthroats out of power in beijing the happier i shall be not to mention my good friends the intellectuals he looked at chong again wo qian ni shenme ma bu heng huanying ni da wo de che ni zhenshi ge re xin ren he braced himself as the truck slowed the big black beard close to my ear please remember mr locke that you can count on me for the aforesaid reasons i have a feeling you are hardly a friend of those bastards in beijing which makes you one of mine he used a fist on the door handle and dropped onto the street looking up at me with his dark eyes serious you know where to find me swung the door shut with a bang across the road was a redandwhite sign in chinese and english truck rental chong gunned up and got into second gear you know that guy slightly british yes how many people i asked him have we got in the field maybe a dozen in support some of them sleepers got a short courier line to the airport longer one to kathmandu then we can use all right i want a twoway radio with a tenkilometer range and fresh batteries i want another one delivered to our dip with the frequencies synchronized he slowed for traffic lights and i gave him a rendezvous i also want a different truck what are those brown things with the rounded front called a dongfeng sure i can rent one of those how long will it take to get what i need how soon do you want it fast as you can he worked at his gum gimme an hour okay i switched to receive hear you ive had no response yet there wouldnt have been time with the signals board in the state it was theyd have to call in bureau one the allhighest and hed have to confer with croder and possibly that bastard loman and decide which way to go leave me out here in the hope that i could make another move or call me in and replace me did you tell them im asking for a few hours more of course but i assume nothing has changed he waited you cannot lie you can lie to every single human being you meet in the field you can lie like a trooper like satan himself because your life will often depend on it and that is understood but the shadow executive cannot lie to his director because he is his link to london to control and to the signals board and the mission screens in the computer room and finally to the decisionmaking process that is the crux and fulcrum of the entire operation that too is understood no i said into the radio nothing has changed someone else came through the doorway across the street a man wrapped in rags with some kind of basket on his back i watched him until he was out of sight past the vegetable stall i was sitting in the truck the new one the dongfeng bloody thing reeking of yak dung but at least we are now in constant touch pepperidge said that was like him hell always find the remnant of a silver lining in the darkest reaches of despair and bring it into the light said yes location it would be very dangerous to give it to him there was no scrambler on these things i cant do that very well i had a signal he said through beijing an hour ago the deadline has been moved up a little mother of god the briefing was that premier li peng was due to address the chinese nation on television from the great hall of the people at ten oclock on the morning of the th and that was the governing factor that fixed the timing of bamboo the premier was to be removed by force from his desk and dr xingyu baibing installed in his place the briefing had noted that if the deadline couldnt be met we wouldnt get another chance for months premier li wasnt scheduled to speak again until the spring i asked pepperidge by how much the speech was going to be made at ten hundred hours on the fifteenth as you know its now down for eighteen hundred hours the previous evening which means that the bomber will have to pick him up at gonggar at three tomorrow afternoon instead of midnight short silence bit rough i know i watched the doorway nine hours whats london telling the coordinator in what way i think he knew but didnt want to get it wrong this was sensitive ground is the coordinator being told that the subject is now missing that we cant have him ready for the rendezvous at gonggar in any case in a moment wo a gust of wind rocked the truck blew dust along the street when will they tell him i think theyll leave it to the last possible moment theres not much to lose after all the bombers scheduled to leave beijing at fifteen hundred hours beijing time thirteen hundred hours lhasa if we cant make the rdv all we have to do is put through a signal for them to cancel the flight five minutes before takeoff it gives us a slight edge if theres anything we can do in the meantime meant find xingyu all right i said in a moment have you any plans im going to follow up whatever i can find couldnt tell him what id asked chong to do for me we werent scrambled but i think he knew what i was going to do i think he knew very well a note of cheerfulness i wished he wouldnt do that it was like whistling at a funeral meant to be kind he meant to be kind god knew how this man had got through all the missions he had major operations three of them classification one to my knowledge global scale with this much humanity this much compassion simply because perhaps he could preserve enough heart in his executive to keep him running on give him the feeling he wasnt alone take enough tension out of his nerves to let him see a chance he might otherwise miss and muster the strength to take it miracles do not always come easily do not burst upon us with the holy light of revelation they must sometimes be conjured from the sickly flame of despair the hands held close to keep the draft away and the gaze steadfast bringing to bear upon the matter the grace of faith until through the dark of disaffection the small flame thrives leaping at last to burn with a light that holds the very soul in thrall by which i mean my good friend that one must not go limping home must one when all is wretchedness no one must sit here in this stinking truck and watch the doorway over there not for an instant taking the eyes away in case there is a last chance however thin of conjuring that little flame within the hands and there she is sumay she was alone coming through the doorway of the little brokendown hotel first looking to her right and then to her left in the way they do the amateurs when they want to take care they are not watched making her way past the vegetable stall a small figure bundled against the freezing wind soon to be lost among the bladeedged shadows of noon hit the button breaking stay open out she was at a table in the far corner i could only just about see her large luminous eyes set in a small pale face above the fur collar of her parka something had gone wrong i suppose with one of the stoves in here the cafe was thick with smoke this was a bigger place than the one id gone to before with little sumay and later pepperidge it was crowded people hungry in the middle of the day my stomach was empty but i hungered not had ordered tea fear doth not prick the appetite and lord i was afraid the oil lamps flickered against the walls like warning beacons across a foggy sea and dark figures moved through the smoke servers customers beggars and monks dogs darted between their feet and under the rickety bamboo tables and out again seeking scraps for their hallowed stomachs they are sacred she had told me little sumay believed by some to be the reincarnation of departed monks i think shed said believed by some but not by me kicked at one of the little buggers and felt it connect theyll start gnawing on your bloody ankle if you dont watch out sitting with my hands around the cup of tea nursing my nerves because it had come to this when a mission has crashed and the opposition has gained the field and there is nothing you can do almost nothing we will correct that almost nothing you can do there is always a last desperate play that you can consider using and it has never failed it will give you access again a way in through the wreckage and if you get it right you will once more confront the enemy and with luck and the blessing of every saint in christendom you may even finally prevail men moved like shadows in this ghostly place women too i suppose though it was difficult to tell because most of them were swathed in robes or skins or coats and big fur hats the drab plumage of their winter hibernation here on the bleak roof of the world someone was coughing his heart up in the drifting smoke and a door was banged open behind me to let some of it out there were no mirrors in here its not in the book the ploy i was talking about even though it has never failed youd think a thing like that would be a dead ringer for the manual of procedures which is the bible rewritten for the shadow executives of the bureau and ive tried to get it put in but their lordships of the hierarchy wont have it and the best i can do is spell it out for the neophyte spooks whenever i give an instruction class between missions at norfolk she had been sitting alone but now a man was joining her at the table his black leather outfit gleaming in the shadows as the light from the oil lamps caught it he looked young athletic he was an oriental i didntthink id seen him before though i might have no one in this smoke was easy to recognize i hadnt known shed come here to keep a rendezvous but id thought it possible by the way shed checked the street outside the hotel right and left in the way they do the amateurs the unfortunates in this life who pass too close to the machinery sometimes with the thought in mind of monetary gain or the perverse excitement of betrayal sometimes just by accident as in her case i believed little sumays passing too close to the subtle and delicate machinery of international intelligence fine as the web of that black widow we talked of you and i the machinery of subterfuge and treachery deceit and untimely death they were talking she and the young athleticlooking oriental their heads close she hadnt seen me i knew this she would have reacted would react if she saw me they wont allow it in the book their lordships of the hierarchy because although this last desperate play has never failed it is deadly it is lethal it has killed at first i thought she was all shed seemed to be little sumay a refugee from the continuing oppression in beijing afraid for her father then id thought had known she was something more than that perhaps working for the private cell that had moved into the field not certainly working for the police or chinese intelligence she was totally untrained then id assumed that she had yes simply passed too close to the machinery to become caught up her loyalties compromised fragmented so that she was grateful to me for the message id sent to her father impressed that id killed an agent of the kccpc the arch enemy had protected me from the police in the cafe perhaps on instructions but had been working against me for the private cell and even then had become torn both ways and finally had warned me you must be careful when you go down to the street make sure you are not followed by the police no by anyone all i knew of her now was that she might provide me with the only link there was to the opposition to whatever agent or cell she was working for and could conceivably lead me to xingyu baibing the man in black leather could have been one of the people who had gone into the monastery last night and seized xingyu and killed the guard i could be within touching distance of the subject the messiah it was all that sustained me this thought all right this straw i was clutching at without it nothing could have made me leave the truck and follow this woman here through the bright streets of noon totally unable to know if i myself had picked up a tag among the people of this place in their robes and skins and coats and big fur hats their disguise if you will because thats what it amounted to totally unable to know if i had been followed here and being watched at this moment through the drifting smoke no mirrors and a door wide open behind me does that tell you anything normal security measures had gone to the dogs id used no cover on my way here hadnt even looked back had walked into this place alone instead of waiting for other people to camouflage the image through the doorway had sat down at a table in the middle of the room my back to the door breaking every single bloody rule in the book chapter and verse because that is what the ploy demands before it can work for you i took another swallow of tea it was thin bitter sharp with tannin but hot scalding still from the big black insulated jug they carried from one table to the next it warmed my hands burned them as i sat here with the skin crawling and the nerves flickering along their pathways like liquid fire a lone spook cut off now from all support contact and communication sitting here like a rabbit on a firing range divorced from the mission sequestered in a location unknown to my director in the field offering myself body and soul to the opposition in the hope that all could be reversed as the hours mounted slowly through the day to allow me at last a chance however small of finding him xingyu dr xingyu baibing and of bringing him to safety you know what it is the ploy she was standing up suddenly sumay at the far table in the corner still talking to the man in black leather looking down at him one hand resting on the tabletop a bag of some kind slung from her shoulder you know what it is my good friend if youve soldiered with me before it is a matter of getting in their way if you cannot find them let them find you let them see you let them come for you let them trap you and if it becomes necessary let them do the most dangerous thing of all let them take you voila jason did it in sri lanka and got away with it brought home the product tomlin did it in costa rica got in and got out and left a chief of police hanging from his feet in a brothel cartwright did it in tokyo took on their mafiosi and got a british national home and followed on with a smashed hip and his nerves like a bombed piano but they were the success stories the ones we pass around in the caff between missions to remind ourselves how good we are at this game how successful how intrepid as an antidote to the fear of going out again there are also the others the other stories which are not passed around in the caff brockley tried the getintheirway thing in athens and the colonels had him shot at dawn fairchild tried it in calcutta and went out wearing a garotte myers tried it in damascus and lasted three days and died mad i was there in the signals room when the dip reported through a drug runners radio executive seized believed under torture am pulling out so that is the way it is it sometimes works and then youre in spooks heaven and hallowed by the name around the teaslopped tables in the caff but it very often doesnt work and you can end up in the scuppers of some stinking hulk with your throat cut or spreadeagled on a trash heap with their heavy bonewhite beaks picking at the stillwarm flesh i dont mean i do not mean to sound discouraging my good friend but that as i say is the way it is we must keep our fingers crossed and from the depths of the timorous soul pluck up a prayer that this time it will work for us she had taken a step had turned again and was coming between the tables coughing in the smoke and i angled my head to make sure shed recognize me and she slowed at once almost tripping then went on past my table without looking at me again her voice just loud enough for me to catch you are in great danger swallowed some more tea didnt actually need telling of course but shed meant well could have saved me as shed done before in the other place went out she went out through the wideopen doorway into the street he stayed ten minutes the young oriental in black leather then put some money down and left the table moving along the bar on the far side without coming anywhere near me though the path sumay had taken was the more direct so i had made contact and must follow up put five yen on the table the generosity of a man with nothing to lose got up and went to the door and found the smoke drifting into the sunlit street and some policemen pulling up in a jeep it looked in fact as if the whole place was on fire turned my face away and followed the man in black he wouldnt carry a gun the police were fussy here pick you up on the spot and search you and hed known that but he was a senior belt by his walk and that was far more dangerous and he wouldnt be alone he was walking alone toward the marketplace but there would be others not far away this was already a mobile trap theyd got me in it hadnt you see failed it never does they wouldnt like it in london executive in immediate contact with opposition and fully compromised its the way they say things on the signal boards and i suppose it works as a kind of shorthand they wouldnt know of course for a while theyd have to wait until id surfaced and reported my new position to pepperidge or had not of course reported at all because of the bonewhitebeaks thing they so charmingly call skyburial how does it feel to have the left eye plucked from the socket and carried aloft and then the right carried aloft by those great black wings and digested in the airy pathways of their going the eyes and the tongue and the genitals and then the whole thing buried in the sky with only the skeleton left down there grinning at its fate how does it feel but we must not be morbid we must keep on walking keep up a steady pace and not bump into any monks theyre everywhere there must surely be redemption for this doomed spook in a place so holy turning to the right into an alleyway the man in black leather and i followed him the sun beat down from a brazen sky and the smells from an apothecarys stall were rich and strange as i passed through them they grind the bones of tigers here and bottle the ashes of snakes and sea horses a different smell you will acknowledge than your good old milk of magnesia i walked into the alleyway and in a moment they followed the others but simply kept station not crowding me and i felt pleased as well as frightened horribly frightened pleased that even though i might never get out of this alive at least i had decided to make a final effort and get in their way not for his sake xingyus not for the future of the chinese people or the stock market in hong kong but of course from pride the stinking pride of the professional that and vanity the constant itch to take on dangerous things to prove not that i can do them but wont die in the doing that personal and very special game of hideandseek you play in the shadows so that when the grim reaper comes you can take him by surprise and with his own dread scythe cut him asunder there were stray dogs here in the alley mangy and hollowflanked their eyes milky and one of them dirty white with brown patches backed off from me as i went down on my knees and stayed like that for a moment and then fell prostrate like the monks id seen the dog coming close now and sniffing at me as i wondered if i was facing the east as i should be prone on the ground like this mad naked she was more slender than id imagined it had been the clothes shed worn thick and padded against the cold that had made her look almost dumpy in spite of her small face sitting like this in the soft light of the lamp she had the stillness of an ivory figurine one arm resting across her raised knee her dark eyes watching me and her mouth pensive her throat shadowed flawless a tuft of silken black hair curling from her armpit her small breasts high on her chest their nipples erect in the center of their large ochercolored aureoles she hadnt spoken since wed come in here for a time i just let my eyes take in the beauty of her face her body and then i began feeling restless because it wasnt enough and i put my hand on her sharp delicate shoulder blade and she came against me at once but i couldnt see her so clearly now because theyd taken one of my eyes the shadows of their great wings falling across her body and then i was sightless and my tongue flared and they began tearing at my genitals and i think i called out though there wasnt any pain just a feeling of surprise that i knew what it was like now to be buried in the sky ta kuai xingle indefinable scents in the air and colored lights drifting against the walls casting rainbows across the huge gold man yao wo qu jao ta ma no colored lights not drifting anywhere it was when id turned my head the lights werent moving s h the huge gold man sat very still id seen one as big as this before in the monastery they were all over the place all sizes water i heard sandals scuffing across the floor opened my eyes again the lids had closed without my knowing it saw the head and shoulders of a man going through a doorway i must be lying on my back here a face near me creased into fine lines a dark mole on the temple just above the eye reflections throwing light across it reflections from the glass of water a stray thought quick as a spark hed known i would be thirsty the water had been here he wasnt the man whod gone through the arched doorway thank you drink yes thirsty wheres the dog he frowned shaking his head tugging his robes tighter around his thin body perhaps he didnt know about the dog the dirty white one with the brown patch feel pain what no i finished the water and he took the glass away putting it down on something hard perhaps marble this was a temple and the colored light came from a window high in the arched roof no pain but felt heavy weighed down when i moved when i tried to sit up couldnt manage it someone was coming tried again to sit up and the big man came across the room and got me gently by the arms and gave a heave let me help you my dear fellow white teeth in a thick black beard dark intelligent eyes couldnt think of his name for the moment things a bit hazy still sitting on the ledge now a kind of plinth where theyd kept altar bowls and prayer wheels theyd been moved onto the floor to make room for the blankets for me this was a temple got it now trotter yes oh i said hello this is dr chen trotter turned to him what do you think doctor he is all right soon is the altitude sickness that is all there you are trotter said nothing to worry about rest up a bit right as rain he looked around and brought a teakwood stool over and sat on it facing me but tell me how you feel tone hearty voice coming from a barrel id noticed how strong hed felt when he pulled me upright formidably strong i feel i said like anyone else would feel when someones drugged his fucking tea id meant to follow them to their base so that id know where it was but this place could be anywhere there were a thousand temples like this one all over lhasa trotter said sorry about that yes his tone had changed dropping the false bonhomie time was of the essence you understand i needed you here the colored light was fading now dusk would soon be down id been out cold for five or six hours we were running it terribly close all i could hear were distant sounds some dogs fighting the chanting of monks the rumble of a cart prayer bells no modern traffic no trucks this temple was on the outskirts of town i see i tilted forward and got onto my feet nearly fell but he caught me used some kind of cologne we stood like that for a bit dancing in a sinister way sinister because this man was so strong and even if id been in good condition i wasnt sure i could have reached his nerves before he threw me against the wall take it easy he said and when he thought i could stand on my own he took his hands away doing rather well stray shred of incoming data he wanted me on my feet not sitting down anymore thank you i said jumping to conclusions could be misleading possibly dangerous hed probably killed bian the monk or had him killed but that didnt make him a barbarian in this trade if i got a chance of playing him i might do well to play him like an english gentleman in deep with some kind of spook faction he didnt seem deranged but he could be neurotic psychotic a latterday philby and he was certainly running a professional cell want to walk about he asked me yes took a few steps felt the motor nerves stirring the balance mechanism making frantic adjustments and then getting it right until i could walk from one wall to the other looking at my watch when i turned didnt want him to know how very important it was that i should get it all back a clear head and usable muscles reasonable strength enough to overwhelm if i could be quick and get in there for the major paralysis strikes dr chen wouldnt give me any trouble unless he had a gun under his robes and i didnt think so he looked so very old so very wise could be perfectly genuine a doctor turned monk or a monk turned doctor his services available to anyone in need of them to a man like trotter who would be generous pay him well but i didnt count on it those people running china were old too and murderous a lot of thinking to do but id got one thing now it didnt make any difference to trotter whether i could walk from one wall to the other he wanted my head clear because hed brought me here to talk so we needed to get the circulation going again get blood to the brain and the liver deal with the lingering effects of the drug that was all right i wanted my head clear too and it was no good making out i was still groggy there wasnt time the military i said have they been here yes they searched the place late yesterday they wont disturb us i kept walking throwing in the odd word or two when i was facing him because i had to see his reactions if he let any get through were you in bombay yes i hate to seem uncivil but i need answers from you not the other way round facing him did you kill sojourner no reaction did you have that snake put in his bed of course not that was the work of a jealous lover but you got him out of hospital sucked his brains dry killed him had him killed with studied patience as i have said the questions are for me to ask not for you but first of all there are a few things you need to be told it will help us both i heard dr chen moving behind me but not with any stealth his sandals flapped a spark came into each of trotters eyes as a lamp was lit the operation i am running is precisely similar to yours mr locke my avowed intention is to get dr xingyu baibing out of lhasa and into beijing so that he can go in front of the cameras at eighteen hundred hours tomorrow we youve got him here yes hes perfectly well and were giving him his injections as prescribed you killed the monk had him killed i just wanted to know his style it was an accident im afraid those were not my instructions there was a struggle he shrugged these things happen when there is a great deal at stake but believe me i feel about him he was nothing more than a holy man doing what he believed was right exercise a little if you want to just a little dont overdo it i swung my arms up on the toes and down again when id looked at my watch a few minutes ago it had been eleven minutes now give or take fortyfive seconds i began worrying because i wanted to know things from this man everything i could before we were interrupted and i wanted my strength back as much of it as possible you also need to know trotter said that i have not only been keeping pace with your operation but protecting it keeping pace since bombay since hed had sojourner worked over since bamboo had been blown oh jesus long before we knew it the shadow executive his director in the field and london control let them put that on the signals board in the chill of this place with its marble and stone and hard surfaces i began feeling the outbreak of sweat this english gentleman with his style and his manners was not only formidably strong he was formidably intelligent it had crossed my mind that he could have been sent to bombay by some other branch of the secret service but he hadnt used a word of the language and thats always the dead giveaway i would have said he was from beijing not london protecting my operation i asked him in what way oh keeping a watching brief thats all i told wang sumay to look after you and i got you away from the temple out there where you killed that kccpc agent got your head fixed up offered you sanctuary nothing major but helpful i hope you feel try a few knee bends what do you say my heads clear enough now oh good well the crux of it is locke that i cant any longer protect you that much is obvious not to worry he was lefthanded id noticed that before if i could do anything at all id have to go in on his right side he hadnt turned his back to me since hed come in here he wasnt secret service operation not mission sanctuary not safe house but he was nevertheless a professional not to be underestimated i could go in on his right side or anywhere else but i could get myself killed if i got it wrong nothing could be relied on it wanted ten minutes now to six oclock but nothing could be relied on and those ten minutes could give me the last chance id get let me trotter said put it briefly for you his thick arms hung easily and this too i noticed you need perspective your operation is very big and its sponsored by hm government and its intentions are to secure the future of the chinese republic and incidentally to save hong kong now i take that very seriously of course but try to understand that i am now in a position to take over that i have to take over if those aims are to be achieved his massive head on one side trust me dr chen moved and i turned my head to keep him in the periphery of my vision field look i told trotter time is of the essence for me too and ive got to go now just to see what hed say im afraid i cant let you tone softer no smile now the chinese was lighting another lamp that was all im afraid youve got to the double doors were heavy twentyfive feet away i couldnt see any other exit although there were some brokendown screens leaning in a corner could be a door there but if i got that far got outside there would be people of his there and theyd be trained killers because that was the kind of cell this man was running if i let you go trotter said quietly youd get yourself arrested within the hour the police are looking for you and the military are going through this town systematically work it out for yourself he took a step toward me you know what the psb agents are like theyd flay you alive until you told them all they wanted to know and youd give me away and theyd come for me too and theyd have me shot for harboring a criminal you know this you know this dogs still fighting over something out there and the sound of a truck now the light in the stainedglass window had died to an embers glow eight minutes seven more like seven you worry too much trotter slight reaction for the first time he didnt like being made light of just a flicker deep in his eyes perhaps i could work on that unbalance him emotionally enough to give me an edge i was born he said in china i spent my first ten years there first with a nanny and then a tutor at a british consulate then england of course prep public oxford but my first country is china and my love for its people is deep and abiding getting down to basics here was his soul the altar bowls were heavy brass small enough to use in one hand big enough to use as a curved blade and to kill given the necessary force to split the skull there was nothing else id have to break the screens up before i could make a weapon the best chance would be to work on his nerves with the bare knuckles use science not bloody bricabrac the sweat springing on the flanks now time running out five minutes less when did you hear id got something going i asked him head on one side sojourner was indiscreet so you see im prepared to do a lot for china thats why im here now to take over your operation and be assured his huge hand rose in a gesture of avowal be assured that i shall see our friend safely in beijing according to plan i thought id better put it on the line because i needed to know exactly what i was up against if i let you leave here with him i mean supposing i trusted you to see things through where would i stand the heavy brows lifted i think he was surprised thought i already knew the answer to that one you cant use this as your sanctuary forever youll have to show yourself in the streets tomorrow or the next day youre a risk you see youd expose me as soon as those buggers in the psb got down to the questions a little shrug and i cant afford that it could destroy my plans for him for us all another step closer there would be nothing personal you must understand its a question of expedience these things happen when there is a great deal at stake but believe me i feel bad about him he was nothing more than a holy man doing what he believed was right i heard myself asking a strange question those bloody birds on my mind i suppose would i be given burial needle burial only if you insisted and if we had time a dead bodys going to attract attention trotter was within six feet of me now still not close enough but it couldnt be made to talk forgive me for putting it like that i have great admiration for you and if things had turned out better you would have completed your operation and our friend would have reached beijing under your aegis and i personally would have been mightily pleased he took another step closer perhaps because chen was here and understood english and this was an intimate matter we were talking of now trotter and i my death at his hands directly or otherwise i can only hope its a consolation for you to know that your goal will be reached nevertheless this worried me too he wasnt putting it on wasnt enjoying this he meant what he was saying that he would have to kill me to keep me quiet crudely put if you like but that was the crux of the matter and hed feel genuine reluctance genuine sorrow and it worried me because it gave him deadly credibility i needed to know more the organism was clamoring for information my eyes were measuring the distance between us and the height of the carotid artery on the right side of his neck and noting that his left foot was slightly in front of his right and would spin him effectively out of reach if he was faster than i when i moved my ears were sifting the aural data available street sounds the moan of the wind gusts through the cracks in the wall alert for anything that could give me clues to the environment outside but it was my mind that was desperate for information on a level far more subtle and it could only get it from the mind of the man in front of me why did you take him by force like that from the monastery get a man killed to do it why didnt you contact me instead as soon as you started thinking i couldnt get him to beijing and ask me to hand him over a smile of disbelief you would have agreed just wanted to know if you were listening but id learned a bit more so where do we go from here i need certain information from you the name of the man whos to meet our friend at gonggar the type of aircraft i must look for the time of its arrival there were four minutes to go give or take a bit to allow for mentalclock error and the nerves were tight now the adrenaline coming into flow i took a step toward him five feet away slightly less but still not close enough oh for christs sake i said how on earth do you think you can put him on a plane at gonggar get him past the security the police the psb agents the military more easily than you im not a wanted man but theyll recognize him dont you know that nerves in my voice it was a shade too loud a slight slackening in control and dangerous id have to watch for that we were getting down to the center of things now and the rational fear of my getting killed had given way to the overwhelming thought that these people would take xingyu baibing to gonggar and try to get him through and lose him to the police or the military finis in winter here trotter said reasonably everyone is wrapped up in hats and scarves as you know listen anyone trying to leave gonggar is going to be told to take off his hat and his scarves and stand under a bloody floodlight youre not even thinking trotter his eyes flickered again he didnt like being told off you got him through hong kong he said and ghengdu and gonggar if at that time the whole of the peoples liberation army wasnt hunting him down and hed had a mask on couldnt tell him that look theres this to be said he had a point i was a risk if he was really trying to get xingyu into beijing i could stop him in his tracks if the police picked me up and i couldnt get to the capsule and they beat everything out of my skull theyd start hunting for this man too and find xingyu capita you cant get him airborne at gonggar i said unless i remain alive i had the mask that is untrue in my opinion quietly said but with an edge he was starting to dislike me that would be useful to work on get him riled offbalance look trotter whats your motivation whos running you no one is running me im engaged in this enterprise because of my profound love for china and her people and because of what happened to them in tiananmen square black eyes smoldering there is my motivation in tiananmen off on your own little crusade tell you this trotter you can not get him out of tibet if you kill me off because theres a certain element involved that will guarantee his getting through gonggar and onto the plane and you havent got it and i have he watched me carefully seemed interested an element would you be more specific as good as a passport as good as a laissezpasser the only certain means of getting him through in a moment element means im sorry but i dont believe you unless youre prepared to tell me precisely what it is not bloody likely he looked offended there was something frighteningly genuine about this man he was telling me quite simply that it was regrettably necessary to kill me off and that i was expected to feel consoled to know that at least xingyu baibing would reach beijing and he seemed surprised that i wasnt totally ecstatic about the idea i was missing something then i got it tiananmen hed spelled it out for me after all but it hadnt connected his rage at tiananmen was allconsuming and the only thing he had in his mind was to turn it into action put the messiah back in the capital and kick out the geriatric junta there and let the people free lay the bloodied ghosts of tiananmen and compared to that the life of one solitary spook already hunted by the police already on his way to the execution yard was not to be counted then im afraid we must proceed he said do what you like kill me you lose him you lose everything needed time to think trade time to think about that trade my life for the mask let him take me to xingyu and fit the mask and let them go on their way and then get under the ground and tunnel my way out of tibet like a bloody mole we may start to think like that when things get tricky when it looks as if theres not a single chance left of staying alive its natural enough the graves got a certain smell to it can turn your stomach you cant blame me and i dont give a damn if you do its my life on the line not yours the other information i shall need trotter said concerns beijing i want the name of the pla general who has committed his forces in your support and the arrangements for having our friend escorted to the great oh for christs sake give him a name cant you xingyu dr xingyu bribing this our friend thing is so bloody coy and incidentally im surprised to hear you still need so much information i thought youd got the whole thing buttoned up i turned away from him and walked for a bit just a few paces wanting to think wanting urgently to think without his face in front of me the face of my executioner and when i came back i stopped a bit closer to him four feet now call it striking distance if i had to go for it sojourner died trotter said before we could get everything what oh hadnt got the name of the general so forth yes i hadnt been paying attention because in those few paces id done some thinking and it had shaken me quite a bit because listen i might have to trade the mask not for my life but for the mission we get vain you know the longer were in this trade the more we get used to bringing the bacon home time after time with nothing much more than a broken ankle or a shark bite or a bullet lodged somewhere in the organism we start thinking we can go on like that start thinking were invincible that only we can see it through to the objective bring it home i suppose its the same in most professions but in this one its a lot more dangerous if one day we find were wrong the objective for bamboo was to get xingyu baibing back into the chinese capital and i was in possession of the mask and the critical information that trotter wanted from me but my chances of taking xingyu even as far as gonggar airport were appallingly thin all right yes grab him if i could and run the gauntlet with him through the streets and try to keep him buried somewhere in a cellar or a cave until we had to keep the rendezvous with the bomber hell or high water so forth but that could simply be an act of braggadocio of professional vanity the alternative looked better give this man the information he needed give him the mask let him keep xingyu here in this temple a place where the military had already made their search where he wouldnt be disturbed and let trotter take him to the airport openly as a man already familiar to the police and to an extent trusted theyre used to me by now you see and i help them sometimes and let the mission run its course without impediment to its objective because i was the impediment must be mad all right i said tell me what youre going to do needed more time to think not mad perhaps saner than i knew but i couldnt go through with a thing like this without londons approval trotter would have to let me signal before we did anything else youre suggesting that you hand over the mission london croder or hyde or bureau one yes to a stranger running a private cell look i know it sounds have you conferred with your director in the field he cant make a decision this big its got to come from you please confer with your dip immediately and ask him to signal his report look there isnt time and you dont know the facts confer with your dip let me give you the facts your instructions are to report immediately to your dip theyd think i was mad the instant i put the phone down theyd pick up theirs and get pepperidge on the hotline through cheltenham tell him to pull me in and take me off the mission send me home head was throbbing again i was pushing things hadnt slept since the night before last hadnt eaten needed a break wouldnt get one but dont let go for christs sake dont let go theres got to be a decision made and not in london but here where i was standing now with the lamps on the walls sending shadows beating in silence like great wings across the airy spaces their bonewhite beaks watch it the airy spaces of the burial ground gods sake watch it youre yes straighten up a little losing things drugged my bloody tea and that hadnt helped not just the lack of sleep would you like to sit down what no watching me carefully the man with the big black beard four feet away less an inch or two less by my reckoning go for it now not the carotidnerve thing a heelpalm drive the nosebone into the brain and take the other man as he came for me not as difficult then stay by the door and wait till they came in here and go for them in whatever way i had to go for the kill to make it certain done it before do it again but theres no future in that scenario no future in it now because hed have more chance than i would trotter getting xingyu through to beijing i think we should sit down he was saying what i made an effort to get him in focus you look a little donein trotter said dont make things hard for yourself here he pulled the stool over for me didnt sit down how many people have you got people men oh enough but what sort of training have they had im sorry but weve got to get on now dr chen the chinese went over to the plinth and opened a black leather case took out a few things and laid them near one end of the blankets where id been lying hypodermic syringe roll of needles box with a picture on it alcohol swabs i suppose small plastic tray with three glass phials trotter turned back to me what i would really like is for you to give me the information i need of your own free will including the nature of what you call the element are you willing to do that hate syringes theyre so bloody sinister ritualistic id been having a bad enough time with the insulin thing ive got to telephone london i said he looked a bit sideways im afraid you cant do that i need thing is trotter you could have a point you might get him through gonggar better than i could but not without the information and the element i think on the face of it im prepared to let you have them give you a much greater chance but its a decision i cant make for myself it means handing you the mission but they might let me do it if i spell things out for them in london he watched me surprised why would you want to hand me your mission ive told you i think youve got a better chance of flying him out in a moment it sounds a little altruistic dirty word i know but i want that man in beijing and i dont care how i do it completes the mission for me and you dont know what that means its the holy grail syndrome completing the mission risk our lives for it all the time so im not oh i see he said youre ready to make a deal for your life not really thats less important i mean hes such a bloody good man isnt he and he could work miracles for all those people you love so much if we could only get him to beijing i mean imagine the headlines china free spectacular i want to make it happen you see it wasnt absolutely certain theyd say no in london not absolutely you come up against the most bizarre situations in this trade thats very touching edge of sarcasm but only an edge i think he was a charitable man at heart had a certain amount of compassion but your life is surely one half of the deal not essentially theres an overweening confidence as ive told you in our own ability to look after ourselves there could be a chance somewhere along the line for me to cut and run youre an unusual man trotter said they broke the mold i would of course be tempted to accept your offer mr locke but theres no telephone here and that would mean risking exposure in the street and youll give me the information i need in any case and the name of the mysterious element theyve made great advances in the field of psychiatric drugs and unless youre willing to speak of your own volition dr chen will induce your full cooperation when i have what i need he will ease your passage to the hereafter there is of course no question of pain except my own the reflection of the lamps behind me made a spark in each of his dark intelligent eyes there was nothing i could see in them no hostility no enmity perhaps if anything a hint yes of pain reluctance what do you say will you speak freely wed come down to the wire rather fast and the sweat glands were reacting and i could feel the old familiar heat of adrenaline in the blood i cant i said without londons okay i really mean that neither of us is joking is he theres so much in the balance all i need is a telephone he turned away for a moment had his back to me and the muscles pulled tight and i was set to go already in the zone where all the mind has got to do is say yes and stand back and let it happen the targets selected and different now because hed got his back to me a chudan mae keage to the coccyx to paralyze the legs and a heelpalm to the occipital area to produce concussion and deaden the optic nerve but it still wasnt the answer the organism had simply noted the chance when the opponent had turned his back that was all it had had enough training god knows to do things without being told go for him no its you or him and hes exposed hes i think we can get london in if i work on him kill him for gods sake before he kills you shuddup its his life or bloody well shuddup turning back trotter was turning back youll really have to listen to me i said i cant offer you more than the mission and itd work youd get him through to beijing he didnt answer for a moment his face had changed in some way his eyes his expression because of whatever hed been thinking about i suppose while hed stood there with his back to me there was a softness about him and it worried me in a moment my dear fellow you still dont understand i appreciate your thinking but theres nothing you can offer me its for the taking and then are you a catholic by any chance said no with hesitation i thought you might perhaps be willing to give me absolution it was a moment before i got it absolution for taking my life what the fuck are you talking about im not a priest shocked him did me good and if i were a priest id damn you to hell do you know what a rattlesnake does when it injects its venom its partly of course to paralyze the prey to kill it but its partly to digest its body i mean its to start the process of assimilation to soften and prepare the tissues i suppose other snakes do it too cobras for that matter but i happen to know rattlers lived with them for a bit but isnt that awful dont you think for something to start digesting you before youre even dead it gives me the bloody creeps i understand your feelings of course his voice very quiet you bloody well dont thered been fright in his eyes id noticed when id talked about damning him to hell he took his faith seriously perhaps i could work on that i didnt like him now forget the compassion bit this bastard had started digesting me he didnt say anything more looked at the chinese and gave a little nod and chen started getting things ready breaking a needle out of the packet and pressing it onto the syringe and i didnt like that i was beginning to wonder why trotter hadnt made an honest approach come to me earlier and put it on the table and tell me his ambition was the same as my own instead of dodging me like a bloody espion and setting me up for an interrogation thing under the needle and then the final insult what had he called it easing your passage to the hereafter bloody hypocrite meant kill me kill me like a dog and hadnt got the guts to say so but there was this thought above all i was prepared to believe he wanted to get xingyu baibing into beijing but for the first time i was beginning to question why it wasnt necessarily for the benefit of his beloved chinese he could be selling dr xingyu baibing down the river in some way and i didnt like that xingyu was mine he was under my protection he was the whole of the mission bamboo and i didnt trust this man anymore this man trotter and he went down but hed seen it coming and swung away very fast for such a big man took only half the weight of the strike and was still conscious shouting the place down and i didnt have time to follow up with the killer because they were in here now three of them coming at the double with their guns out and i took the first one head on and heard the bone go heard the bone go driving upward into the brain and he screamed very briefly and then it was cut off as he died the second one coming but i wasnt quite ready because the whole weight of my body had gone into the strike and the momentum was still trying to carry me forward and i needed to recover wasnt correctly set up zhua zhit ta bie kai qiang trotter shouting again as the second man came at me and i did what i could broke his arm but it didnt stop his momentum his gun went clattering across the floor but he wouldnt have used it anyway none of them could trotter wanted a live brain lying there under the needle and they knew that he would have told them instructed them one of his hands trying to get a grip on my triceps and i smashed a hammerfist down but the target was too insensitive and he hung on and another man began locking my legs at the ankle and all i could do was try for an eye gouge and got it half right got another scream but it didnt mean anything useful they were hanging on me like dogs on a fox trotters face somewhere above me blood shining on it because id raked the skin open with the strike his eyes frightened because if he lost me now hed lose the whole thing tried one more strike a strong hijiuchi with enough force behind it to break whatever it hit but it didnt connect because i was on the floor now and trotter was up there huge dripping with blood while they wrapped something around my ankles and he lifted me by the shoulders and they took my feet and between them they laid me on the blankets on the plinth where id been before got in a quick tigerclaw and drew blood again but technically it was ineffective simply an attempt to save face they held me down the three of them trotter and the two surviving chinese while dr chen broke open the top of one of the little phials and wiped it with an alcohol swab from habit i suppose there wouldnt be time for me to get any kind of infection would there the head throbbing a lot now because one of them had opened the wound under the bandage when wed been milling about i watched the chinese dr chen as he pushed some air into the phial and tilted it and began suction with the plunger theyve made great advances in the field of psychiatric drugs i could believe that trotter was an intelligent man would know what he was doing the weight of his huge hands on my shoulders keeping me down ive never had to deal with anyone so strong blood on his black beard his eyes watching the syringe the plunger still drawing the stuff in quite a lot of it we were nearing the cc mark on the barrel i hate these bloody things one of the hit men was sniveling a bit because of the eye gouge id used on him didnt look pretty mucus dripping from his nose couldnt wipe it away had to keep both his hands on my legs i tried a last essay jerking my knees to connect with his face but it was no go theyd been waiting for me to do something didnt trust me anymore bloody shame my eyes closing against the flickering light of the lamp over there watch it yes gods sake stay with it yes indeed one must remain conscious mustnt one opened my eyes again and slowed the breathing deepened it sought prana drew it into the lungs felt better a little better now he was stopping at cc pulled the needle out of the phial and tilted the syringe pressed the air out and got another swab asking one of them to pull my sleeve higher wiped my arm and dropped the swab and brought the syringe into position and i said trotter youd better listen to this chen looked across at him but trotter shook his head keep going i suppose it meant when i got him through hong kong and chengdu and gonggar i said it was because he was wearing a mask the element i couldnt have got him through without it you wont get him through to beijing without it either zhan zhu dr chen was holding the syringe like a dart ready to stab but he didnt move now watched trotter i said listen if this stuff is as good as you say it is ill tell you where the mask is but it wont do you any good because you wont know how to put it on his face it requires skill and experience takes nearly an hour and you havent been trained and i have im the only one who can put that mask on trotter so youd better tell the good doctor hadnt you to put that bloody thing away i suppose trotter would have given it some thought but there wasnt time because the doors of the temple blew open and the whole place shuddered and i saw the light of the explosion on his face before the air blast reached the lamps and blew them out and i twisted and rolled and dropped and got onto my feet and began running through the dark toward the patch of moonlight where the doors had been in there i told chong and he lobbed the next one into the buddha room and the force came in a wave and i went down under the blast and hit something with my shoulder and spun away and got up again a few seconds of darkness after the flash and then the moonlight came back filtering through the smoke where the roof had blown out shot whining close and bouncing against stone someone had survived in there but the light was too tricky to let him do any more than shoot wild and checked the vestibule on my left and didnt find anything more than rubble crossed through the line of fire at a run and called for chong to look after things and he lobbed another one through the doorway and the building bellowed again and i squeezed my eyes shut against the flash and waited for them to accommodate and then took the room on the other side and found him there xingyu another man with him and i went for a certain kill and called out to chong again where was the truck xingyu was conscious and on his feet and i found his flight bag and checked it for the insulin by the light of the flames that had broken out in the buddha room and then got him through the rubble another shot and i called out to chong again but he didnt answer we needed another bomb in there xingyu felt heavy against me and i had to halfcarry him smoke in the lungs and the light deceptive shadows everywhere as the fire took hold and began blazing chong crackling of timber and a beam came down with a crash and sparks flew a billow of smoke rolling through the doorway and clouding gray in the moonlight the eyes stinging as we reached the open and i saw the truck chong but no answer i got xingyu into the dongfeng and checked for the radio and the map and started the engine and waited chong were going the whole place was roaring and i thought i saw trotter his huge body silhouetted against the flames as i hit the gear in and rolled the thing out of harms way still no sign of chong but there was a sweep of bright light coming in from the highway and i got into motion again with the headlights off and took a dirt track where the smoke was rolling used it for cover and kept going as more lights silvered the landscape and i saw a personnel carrier red star on the cab it must have been in the area and i suppose you cant blow a temple up in the dark without attracting attention chong where was chong we had to keep going before the military picked us up in their headlights i think the first time id called out to him without getting an answer was just after the shot the second one so it could be that something bumping against me in the cab xingyu and i pushed him upright when did you last get insulin who are you he sounded lethargic slurred sat there lolling so i reached over and got his seat belt round him and hit the door lock down who are you stressed out of his mind the dirt track was coming to an end and i turned the lights on and kicked the dip switch and took the road to the right away from the blazing temple throttling up and shifting into top the main town to the left to the north the river on the other side gonggar behind us in the west but forget gonggar find shelter it was all we could do now id been with chong when hed drawn the map sitting in the truck while i was watching for sumay okay this is where the foothills begin so this is where they are along this line here the caves which one should we make for listen we take our pick a whole lot of them are going to be big enough to hide the truck so we can set up our base facing the south keep a watch on the road this one here the only way in and it aint that hot anyway mostly rocks but if they take the search parties that far its the road theyll use we checked our radios and synchronized watches and he started peeling a fresh stick of gum and i said all right this is what well do if i can get them to pick me up youll take over the truck and keep me in sight until you see where theyre taking me if its in the town or where anyone else can get hurt report on your radio to my dip and hell bring in support if its anywhere remote where you can use your bombs do it at your own discretion he thought for a moment okay zero eighteen hundred hours ill work around that but youre only a backup chong if i can do anything on my own id rather do it a bomb is a blanket weapon and if xingyus there i dont want him endangered he dropped the wrigleys wrapper onto the floor like to kind of modify that his tone a little hurt i mean you can pick locks with those babies you do it right no offense we talked about where to bring the truck covering a dozen assumed sites urban and remote and in between we talked about signaling if any were possible access egress how to keep xingyu protected how to get him clear and finally we talked about eventualities and their appropriate action if one of us cant get away i said hes left behind and the other one takes xingyu gotcha hed got out of the cab of the truck and buried himself among the equipment we were carrying back there and began waiting it out where are we going xingyu i looked across at him in the backwash from the headlights he was crouched into his coat his face drawn his eyes dull but he sounded interested in who i was where we were going dr xingyu its a few minutes past six in the evening when did you have you last shot of insulin i cannot remember are we going to beijing yes to meet your wife no particular reaction perhaps a look of cynicism how much warning i asked him do you get when youre running low on insulin he turned his head to look at me a little while what do you mean by a little while ten minutes or an hour or what about half an hour then i want you to tell me as soon as you feel youre ready for another shot he didnt say anything do you understand yes are you hungry no thirsty no all right let me know if you need anything chong had dumped a bag of provisions in the back of the truck when hed kept the rendezvous and id asked him to include a firstaid kit the mask was still in its cheap cardboard box wedged behind the seat and i would have liked to use it but wed need fresh water clean hands and time up to an hour the risk of taking this man along a highway in a truck tonight without the mask on was appalling but the risk of being stopped by the police or the military was worse if i tried fitting the mask and failed to get it right theyd detect it and rip it off his face finito the risk of pulling up anywhere to look for shelter was the worst of all and the only chance we had was to get to the foothills and the caves and stay there until pepperidge could work something out the blaze was well behind us when i looked back a bright ember against the horizon that left a trail of orange fire reflected along the river headlights were sweeping the area as the emergency teams moved in and two vehicles quite distinct were behind us on the road out of the town i noted them because they could be military i picked up the radio and switched it on calling dip dip dip hear you subject is in my care in a moment very good since wed broken radio contact soon after noon today pepperidge had been sitting in his hotel room trying to make himself believe that id somehow manage to stay alive because hed known i meant to get in their way and thats something the directors in the field always hate and always try to keep you from doing the risk is of course totally calculated but wickedly high he hadnt expected jam on it id located and secured xingyu baibing im proceeding according to plan it was all he needed id told chong to take him a copy of the map and it showed the caves we should be there in an hour wo precise location at this point no ill send that i watched the two sets of headlights in the mirror the distant vehicle had pulled up on the one immediately behind me theres a temple on fire southeast of the town and the emergency crews and i assume the police and military are already on the scene there are several dead one of them might be chong in a moment noted he did very well the subject appears physically normal except for stress and extreme fatigue you have insulin yes but please note i estimate that we shall be exposed for another half hour on a public highway and the koichi artifact is not in place repeat not in place hesitation then half an hour estimated i gave him tune to think id located and secured the subject but the chances of getting him under cover were shockingly thin with his face undisguised and a major search operation by the military still in progress there was also an added risk if any of them had got out of that temple alive they would have tried to follow this truck one of those people had still managed to pull off a couple of shots after the first bomb had gone in or it could even have been the two of them each with a gun trotter had been running a firstclass cell with highly trained personnel and if hed been killed in the buddha room any surviving hit man would know what hed got to do if trotter couldnt fly xingyu into beijing himself hed want him dead obviously you have no alternative pepperidge no alternative but to try getting xingyu to a cave in the hills through a military dragnet no its the least risk so be it anything more nothing more whats your condition fully active that wasnt inaccurate if i didnt get some sleep before too long i was going to drop in my tracks and the drug theyd put in my tea had left the motor nerves a degree sluggish and my reflexes were less fast than i was used to and the head wound was still throbbing but if anything critically active started id be all right because the adrenaline would make up the difference once the survival mechanism is triggered and youre functioning in the zone the body chemistry shifts into a different equation and the strengthoftenmen syndrome kicks in you could probably use some support its not feasible the only chance weve got is to keep a strictly low profile things had changed in the mirror the vehicle immediately behind had peeled off and i saw the red star on the side the other one was closing on us i would have said it was a beijing jeep by the short distance between the headlamps there was now a bit of traffic starting to come the other way and i kicked the dip switch if you felt you needed support would you ask for it yes hed got my thinking straight on that point before the man slumped behind me in the cab was potentially the most powerful figure in the asian hemisphere and if i thought that even one support agent could help me protect him then i would say so if the situation changes pepperidge said i can send in a whole cadre he was worried thought i was digging my heels in no director in the fields all that happy when the executives walking a tightrope with the subject of the mission in his arms noted we were going to have to find a hole xingyu and i find a hole in the night and stay there sleep there hibernate until the dawn and any kind of support would attract attention flush us out ill signal control remain in contact will do i switched to receiveonly and put the radio on the seat itd cheer them up a bit at the board in london executive has located and secured the subject so forth a truck came past from ahead of us and in the glare of its lights i saw the red star again and a huddle of soldiers swaying in the back i checked on xingyu before the light had gone he was sitting more upright now staring through the windshield and he squeezed his eyes shut and jerked backward against the seat as the shot smashed through the rear window and into the windshield and it snowed out and i hit a hole in it and got the truck straight again keep down shot hit a tire and it blew and the truck lurched and i got it back and bits of snowed glass flew inward as xingyu started hitting at it shouted at him again keep down headlights coming the other way and the glare blinding wiping everything out and i felt the truck lurch again and then the tire came off and we were on the rim took my foot off the throttle lights again there was a whole line of stuff coming past keep down i told him right in the line of fire for christs sake the twin lights of the jeep behind us were jazzing around in the mirror and i tilted it and tried to see where the road was there was no border it just ran into a waste of flat land with boulders standing black on one side silvered on the other by the lights a whole string of them this was an army convoy red stars glowing on the sides shot and the mirror went the force of the bullet throwing it forward until it caught the windrush and blew back into the cab christs sake keep down i told xingyu the dongfeng lurched again and a truck coming past us the other way had to swerve but it wasnt enough and we clipped his fender and the driver leaned on the horn the doppler effect bringing it down to a moan in the night as i dragged at the wheel and went for the flat land and kicked the headlights full on and watched out for the boulders and then things began happening behind us lights sweeping in an arc across the terrain and then another shot but it was wild and i suppose one of the army trucks had made a uturn to come back and overhaul the jeep and ask them what they were popping off a gun for either that or it was the truck id hit coming back to talk about the damage you dont you do not hit an official vehicle of the peoples liberation army without being asked some questions it was no go it was no bloody go in this thing and i chose a boulder and got to the other side of it and used the brakes and slewed the dongfeng at an angle and hit xingyus seatbelt buckle out were getting out i hooked the radio into my coat and got his flight bag and the provisions from the back and found him wandering in the moonlight a cold wind cutting across the scree come on threw an arm around his shoulders come on quicker than that huddled against the wind the two of us leaning on it tripping on stones the lights on the road very active and men shouting but no more shots i suppose it was all hed been able to do keep on firing even though he knew theyd ask questions keep on firing in the hope of a killing shot and hed come close hit that bloody mirror a foot from xingyus spine i must go to beijing his voice thin against the wind what out of his mind of course yes beijing sweat running on me because wed left the dongfeng less than a hundred yards from the road and if they started sweeping their lights across the scree theyd see it and we hadnt got far enough yet not far enough along the road to beijing dear god what was he talking about what had they done to him in that temple lurching along together like a couple of drunks and not fast enough not nearly fast enough i could see the dark rim of the foothills against the stars but it looked like five miles could be more and i didnt know if he could make it on his feet or if id have to carry him get him far enough before the need for sleep knocked me over the rim of the hills dipping as i watched it rising and dipping the air coming into the lungs like knives and stone loose underfoot shots down there some shots back along the road no particular theory coming to mind they were trying to take him i suppose or both of them if thered been two and they wanted to keep on our track shouting again a lot of shouting as the line of trucks shunted to a halt the officers wanting to know what was going on another shot and that was the last i heard xingyu heavy against me weve got to walk quicker than this i told him yes i must go to beijing merciful god listen dr xingyu they are soldiers back there and weve got to get away from them i didnt know how much he understood about things weve got to keep going yes keep going snow on the wind flurries of it like last night listen to me i said if anyone follows us on foot i want you to go that way toward sirius you see sirius yes thats your direction if we have to separate go that way to the east and find shelter and lie low ill go in the other direction you understand ill lead them away now do you understand yes but i couldnt tell if he did or if he just saying it this bloody wind freezing against the skin the eyes streaming ill give you your bag and the insulins there all right all you do is lie low and wait and ill send for help understand yes all he could say like an automaton lurching over the stones ill radio your position as close as i can get if i have to send for help if the situation changes pepperidge i can send in a whole cadre all you do is lie low and use the insulin when you need to are you listening to me yes he tripped and started to go down and i pulled him upright poor little bastard doing his best facing straight ahead of him against the wind with tears freezing on his cheeks one foot in front of the other soldiering on i must not let them get this man he was the messiah potentially a name to go down in history if i could get him to walk faster for christs sake faster than this we could still hear them shouting down there and all it wanted was for one of them to turn his truck and pick up our dongfeng in his lights and wed have to separate because theyd take a look at it and find the engine warm and then theyd start looking for the driver finis snow on the wind flakes sticking to our faces and freezing the skin he tripped again and i caught him held him closer an arm around his shoulders the rim of the foothills rising and dipping and the stars swinging i would like to sleep swinging across the night sky and swinging back the stone loose underfoot treacherous the night treacherous with stones and soldiery lord i will lay me down to sleep in another mile another mile of this lay me down to sleep i must get to beijing he said xingyu and tripped and dropped like a dead weight and i wasnt quick enough and he stayed there on his knees a dark shapeless bundle against the stones the messiah head hanging like a dogs the wind howling among the boulders and his voice crying in it i must get to beijing his gloved hands hitting the ground in frustration and i dragged him onto his feet and he started walking my arm around him again walking into the wind and the whirling snow and i said to him yes you must get to beijing fugue it was very quiet there was a hole in the sky and i watched it feet ached my feet ached those bloody boots feet were cold too frozen looked down at them felt them no boots on that was the trouble id pulled them off when we got here i must go to beijing what then everything came back and i said yes and looked at the luminous digits of my watch slept for three hours id slept for three hours and six minutes because id checked the time when wed got here and reported to my dif not a hole in the sky this was the cave and the hole was the entrance down there full of moonlight missing something dr xingyu are you all right yes need insulin no i was missing something and it worried me i didnt know what it was but i knew it was something important xingyu was sitting upright against the wall of the cave looking straight in front of him and i felt gooseflesh along my arms this man had changed he was different now giving me answers like an automaton yes and no sitting bolt upright like that and staring in front of him saying hed got to go to beijing hadnt said it before at the monastery so what was in his mind i didnt like this there were things i wanted to know oh jesus yes got up and staggered as far as the mouth of the cave and switched to send dip dip d hear you have you been trying to raise me wo so relax but i wasnt terribly pleased with myself there was a bloody mountain on top of this cave and he couldnt have raised me if hed wanted to the last time id signaled him wed been still outside in the open three hours sleep excellent sounded happy about that part of the job of your dip is to look after your welfare hour by hour and pepperidge had known when id last got any sleep because id reported on it subject is with me no injuries i confirmed the bearing id given pepperidge when wed got here three hours ago and then began giving him the general picture not terribly reassuring the snow was still coming down in flurries making a hazy screen across the terrain below the hills and through it i saw lights moving this cave was the third opening along from a granite bluff an estimated four miles south by southeast of the road where it turned north in a wide curve with an estimated radius of one mile it was the fifth opening from a low escarpment in the other direction that jutted at thirty degrees from the lie of the hills there were no other landmarks except for the boulders some of them huge ten or fifteen feet high but they were strewn across the scree at random like thrown dice theyd set up a roadblock the military halfway through the curve in the road theyd been alerted by the shooting from the jeep behind me and the obvious decision would have been to trap all traffic in the area thered be another road block set up toward the west though i couldnt see its lights from here because of the snow but i could see the lights of the convoy it was still stationary most of the vehicles facing west the way wed come in from the temple it was difficult to say how many vehicles there were down there perhaps twenty twentyfive the ones that had passed me from the east had been personnel carriers estimate then three hundred armed troops at least three hundred some of the vehicles had been swung at various angles to the road providing a fan of light southward toward the hills and containing degrees from this distance and with the snow flurries blowing i couldnt see the dongfeng truck wed abandoned near the road or if i could see it i wouldnt be able to distinguish it from the boulders but it would be there standing in the fan of light and they would have checked it out three hours ago and found the engine warm and they would now be looking for the driver and any passengers those were the moving lights i could see as the soldiers spread out in a systematic search they were already a mile from the road making their way across the scree like a tide rising toward the hills toward the cave i reported this to pepperidge the line of soldiers was at ninety degrees to my angle of vision and wed have to allow a margin of error perhaps fifteen even twenty percent this being given i estimated that they would reach the caves in the hillside before morning at the latest this too i reported nothing but static for a moment or two then and at the earliest i cant predict that if they increase their speed they could be here sooner than that i didnt like telling him i did not like telling him this crouching here in the cave mouth in the freezing wind with that man inside there looking so strange talking so strangely giving me ideas one of them so appalling that i couldnt express it to my director in the field until id tested it out because it would change everything it would blow bamboo into christendom but if it occurs to them i told pepperidge that the people in the truck might have headed for the caves theyll logically send troops in three or four files straight in this direction and spread out and start a search at this level static i waited they could reach you then in two or three hours yes waited again what are your plans all i can do is play it by ear i can get out of here and take him deeper into the hills or stay here and explore the cave and hope to find a bolt hole and cover our tracks if we start moving higher well be making a race of it with three hundred men and i dont think we could win it on my own yes but i dont know how long he can hold out i havent questioned him yet if we stay here theres the chance that you might be able to do something you or london hed said earlier tonight i can give you a whole cadre if you need one wed need a regiment in a moment i signaled london the moment you reported you were at the caves i said it was impossible for you to get him to gonggar that you had no transport that the koichi artifact was not in place that was correct yes but now the situation is fully urgent argot in any signal any briefing any instructions fully urgent has ultra priority and takes precedence over everything else it means sound the alarms freeze all other action bring bureau one into the signals room and clear all communications lines to and from london through the intelligence mast in cheltenham and the dip controlling the field in the host country using scramblers or speech code or audiogrids or whatever means that will pull the whole network together and keep the shadow executive in constant touch with london control and the signals board and the agentsinplace and the sleepers and support groups and courier lines right across the spectrum of the mission and if i told pepperidge yes the situation was fully urgent that whole process would kick in and start running said yes a beat then how much time have we got would you say before you could be discovered if they began sending probes into the foothills and the caves directly what is my deadline i looked down through the drifting screen of snow at the string of lights in the valley the soldiers would be three miles away by now as a rough estimate and the terrain was rough loose and inclined at something like ten or fifteen degrees there was moonlight but under the snow flurries it didnt amount to much more than a glimmering sheen across the scree with no real shadows across this kind of terrain a man couldnt go too fast without risking a broken ankle and at this altitude the lungs would be starved of oxygen to a critical degree wed reached here xingyu and i exhausted i said into the radio two hours waited two hours that is my deadline yes a wind gust came cutting across my face and leaving snow whirling into the cave mouth very well that tone of cheerfulness again got on my nerves made things worse because he only ever used it when things were tricky in the extreme a great deal can be done in two hours a great deal unless theres anything you want to add ill get on with things right away there was nothing important id been going to report the suspicions id had earlier tonight when wed been lurching across the scree to the caves a couple of tunes i thought id heard faint sounds behind us closer than the road down there and once id told xingyu we were going to take a rest and id sat there listening to the rushing of the wind across the stones but that was all id heard i hadnt thought about it since then nothing to add i said then stay open to receive i went into the cave i must get to beijing sitting there staring at nothing a shadow humped against the rock face dr xingyu id like you to move a bit nearer the mouth of the cave ive got to be there to monitor the radio radio i spelled it out for him saying that the signals wed be receiving would help us to get him to beijing and he tried to stand up and i gave him a hand and we managed it snow was coming into the cave mouth and we sat crouched with our backs to it its a bit colder here im afraid i dont mind small talk id descended to small talk putting off the question that had to be asked that had to be answered before we could do anything more before even london could order the fully urgent process into action because if it was the wrong answer i would have to signal pepperidge at once you dont need any insulin yet dr xingyu no nothing to eat no the question night like this i said nice tot of rum would go down rather well rum he turned to look at me face blank ask the question never mind i said the wind buffeted the rocks moaning now he sat huddled into his coat staring in front of him dr xingyu why must you got to beijing he turned to look at me again the moonlight throwing a sheen on his pale face to tell the students they were wrong in tiananmen democracy is not the way mother of god hear you the snow whirled against my face hes been brainwashed i said pendulum zhege ymgguoren si dulde i tapped the pendulum in english please baibing you dont mind if i call you baibing it would set him more at ease invite his trust in me no the snow had eased over the last half hour as it had done last night when chong had seen to the sergeant out there the moon was brighter now shining on the pendulum id taken the silver paper from the packet of syringes on xingyus flight bag and wrapped it around a stone and hung it on a bit of string from one of the stalactites in the roof of the cave and set it swinging it had taken a long time to persuade xingyu to keep his eyes on the pendulum there are things you dont remember important things youll have to remember them or we cant take you to beijing swung the pendulum but i havent forgotten anything yes you have i want you to remember everything or you cant go home and see your wife again to and fro to and fro a tiny silver moon a little distance from his eyes i watched his eyes there is nothing i want to tell you taken a long time fifteen or twenty minutes wearing him down hed never get to beijing never see his wife over and over again tapping the pendulum but now he was deep in theta waves and under my control zhege yingguoren si duide in english baibing theyd talked to him in mandarin or course in the temple trotter or the man whod been with xingyu when id found him or both but it wouldnt make any difference i was asking him for images ideas not speech patterns the englishman is right he said is he right about what he didnt answer went on staring at the tiny silver moon i was up against a block something he felt was very important important not to divulge right about democracy i asked him and that broke his resistance yes there is no future in democracy for the peoples republic no room for it you can see what democracy has done to europe and america we cannot contemplate that happening in china i touched the stone to keep it swinging what has it done baibing to europe and america in a moment its all there in the manifesto what manifesto of course it is but i forgot where you put it the manifesto silence he was having to find his way mentally through a bewildering field of concepts his own fierce convictions before trotter had gone to work on him then the doubts trotter had put into his mind then the new convictions hed been given under hypnosis and now i was starting to ask worrying questions we cant go to beijing i told him without the manifesto swinging the pendulum he said he would give me a copy of it on the flight to beijing whats it about the manifesto it is the blueprint for the new china under democracy hesitation noted no under communism yes under your present leaders no oh really under what leaders under xu yun making some progress now xu yun was on the second level of the hierarchy a young minister said to be brilliant and on his way but hed been given a rap on the knuckles for going personally into tiananmen square in june to talk to the students and peddle a soft line to bring the tension down what will xu yun do for china he will at first seem to favour democracy then gradually swing the ideas of the people toward the new communism he is very clever and the students approved of his actions in tiananmen when he went to listen to them good and what is the new communism a society in which all people are truly equal with no rich and poor as we see in europe and america with no millionaires and homeless sharing the same streets with no pollution as the end product of industrial greed no crime waves induced by social inequality no drug culture spawned by the egocentric devotion to the self instead of the state it is in the manifesto gooseflesh again as i listened to trotter speaking with xingyu baibings voice and a sense of revelation because i was beginning to learn more about the englishman and the dream that had driven him thats very interesting baibing would you like to tell me more he hesitated again the question seemed to worry him i have not read the manifesto but our friend mr trotter talked to you didnt he for quite a long time tell me a little more in a moment the human race has so far proved itself the least intelligent of all living species man is the only animal incapable of living within its natural environment and accepting nature as its earth mother instead of a system to be conquered and controlled by the use of fossil fuels the construction of nuclear power stations the destruction of the rain forests and of life in the oceans we are destroying the planet itself its surface and its protective envelope his tone was easier now less hesitant he was on his own ground here speaking of ideas hed held long before hed come under trotters influence and the new communism will be able to do something about that not immediately it will take ten or twenty years but it must be done for the planet and human life to survive instead of nuclear power with its unconscionable problem or chernobyllike disasters and lethal waste disposal we need to harness the infinitely greater power of the suns heat and the force of the winds and the oceans instead of fossil fuel with its equally unconscionable problems of the increasingly lethal accumulation of poison gas in the atmosphere we need electric transportation much of it solarpowered instead of impoverishing the soil and saturating food products with toxic chemicals and irradiation we need to allow the land to enrich itself again by disciplined crop rotation and the development of organic fertilizers all this can be achieved it is in the manifesto i stood up to check on things outside the snow had stopped and moonlight flooded the scree as the wind shifted i could hear sounds from below the banging of tailboards and the murmur of engines the line of light had crept higher away from the road and toward the hills the soldiers were still too far away for me to pick out individuals but their line was nearer now tempted to pick up the radio your deadline was two hours and theres ninety minutes left have you done anything are these bastards awake in london the tide was rising and all i could do was to go back in there and listen to trotters vision of a brave new world xingyu was still sitting bolt upright absorbed by the rush of concepts and images going through his mind i must get to beijing he said not really not now so china can achieve all that i said in a matter of a decade two decades if fossil fuel suddenly dried up overnight the united states of america would have an efficient electric automobile industry within two years otherwise trillions of dollars would be lost industry is very inventive the lure of gold being its mainspring in the peoples republic we can be equally inventive otherwise life itself will be lost i leaned against the rockface feeling its chill through my coat feeling its reality i needed life too and even more than that i needed to vouchsafe the life of this man here because the mission is the holy grail and held to be above the survival of the executive and the mission tonight was to protect dr xingyu baibing the messiah the little robot sitting here regurgitating a romantics manifesto i found myself sitting very still my back to the freezing rockface and my eyes on the moonlit sky and my mind suddenly close to the englishmans to trotters as if a mental zoom had closed the distance between us he had lied very little that man and then only by omission his objective had been precisely the same as mine to get xingyu baibing to beijing and in front of the cameras he had wanted the geriatric tyrants there to be thrown out of power as we did he had protected my operation all along the line just as hed said because he didnt have the dissident commanders tanks readied to defend the people as we did in tiananmen square didnt have the contacts the coordination the military escort that would lead xingyu to the cameras after premier li peng had been seized and put under military arrest so trotter had used the bureau had used me our aims are the same my dear fellow i do hope you understand the same up to a point not just as far as getting xingyu out of tibet not just as far as getting him into beijing and through the streets and into the great hall of the people but to the very point when the lights would come on and the cameras start rolling and he would appear on the television screens right across the nation and speak not for democracy but for the new communism under xu yun as its leader sat very still shutting my eyes absorbing the light of revelation i do hope you understand my dear fellow yes i think so hed wanted as we had to put this man on the television screens but with a robots brain when they came for you at the monastery baibing was mr trotter there yes and what did he say to you that i would not be hurt i see the object had not of course been to hurt xingyu baibing but to keep him sequestered in the temple and subjected to intensive brainwashing probably under the influence of a hypnogenic drug from dr chens little black bag did they give you an injection i dont mean insulin i dont remember it wasnt important it would simply have been useful to know what kind of change i was dealing with psychochemical or hypnotic did mr trotter tell you that hed be letting you go free hesitation again quite pronounced this time he said i would be returned to your protection yes i see he was then to have been released in such a way that i would discover him and take him somewhere to safety and finally to beijing the same man but not with the same mission and then id mucked everything up for mr trotter by deciding to get in his way and find xingyu for myself i do hope you understand my dear fellow actually yes were you given posthypnotic instructions baibing i dont know what he would have said because the radio crackled and pepperidge came on and i acknowledged and began listening shadow what is your situation theyre closer i told him i watched the ragged line of light in the valley below by how much half a mile a mile its difficult to tell are they looking for you or xingyu baibing or both i thought about that the military were alerted by two things the fire in the temple and someone shooting at us from a beijing jeep behind us i think trotter could have been hi the jeep alone or with one of his hit men or it could have been just a hit man or two of them i think trotter was probably injured by the bombs could be dead by now the line of light seemed to be breaking up in one or two places either one or two of the soldiers were moving up faster than the rest because of easier ground or the officer in command had ordered probes to move directly into the hills to search the caves i didnt report this i wasnt certain yet what might have happened i said into the radio is that the military caught whoever was firing at me from the jeep and put him straight under interrogation and he told them you were somewhere in the area yes with xingyu they wouldnt have mounted a search on this scale for me alone the police and the psb agents are looking for me but not the army i waited my position was not good it was probably lethal but i preferred it to what pepperidge was going through hed been pleased to take this one on had been courteous enough to say hed be honored to direct me in the field and wed done well together got the chinese communist governments most dangerous political opponent through the trap in hong kong and the trap in chengdu and got him into hiding then trotter and his private cell had moved in and the objective for bamboo had changed totally it wasnt that we could no longer hope to fly xingyu into the chinese capital we no longer wanted to it was the last thing we must do all that was left of the mission was a static rearguard action outnumbered by something like iso to one and my final instructions from london would simply be to save this mans life if i could i did not envy my director in the field he was talking to me from this lonely room in that shabby hotel the link between london control and his beleagured executive trapped in a mountain cave in tibet with no further objective except to survive his voice of course was perfectly steady and that helped they havent brought helicopters in god forbid quite so but if they do please report at once understood have you explored the cave yes theres no hiding place will you decide to leave there do you think since the search is closing on you yes unless theres something you can do better to be overtaken in the open and on the run than raked out of a hole like a couple of bloody badgers in a moment i signaled you to tell you that london has been very active indeed since i reported our predicament through the embassy in beijing and our courier line they have contacted general yang yang he is the commander who would have supported xingyu baibings television appearance with a tank corps in tiananmen square he was told of dr xingyus critical situation and agreed to send one of his colonels immediately to gonggar airport to see if anything can be done there was a crackle of static suddenly and then his voice came in again was course originally hoped that he might be able to help us get the subject to beijing until you reported that he has been compromised read brainwashed if the colonel can do anything now his name his zhou it will be to attempt to rescue both of you from the cave london reports that he has already left beijing in a mig fighterbomber and should arrive gonggar in a little less than two hours i have no information on what he will do then but i assume hell use his rank and try to halt the search that is now in progress but that is conjecture i didnt answer immediately it would be pleasant to catch some gleam of hope in what london had set in motion but it would also be indefensible if there was going to be any chance of getting this man out alive it could only be taken by a strictly cool appraisal of the facts and i didnt believe that a tactical fighterbomber now airborne over central china could have any real connection with the line of soldiers less than two miles from where i was crouched at the cave mouth pressed to transmit i wish the colonel a pleasant journey regretted it immediately but of course too late we must not despair my friend we must not despair noted static again and i looked down into the valley but there was no helicopter in sight i think another military vehicle had moved in a big one and it could be that how is the subject bearing up hes all right physically but not totally all there doesnt really know whats going on i think he was still under drugs when i got him out of the temple structions lond as possible theres some static i didnt get oh christ bright flood of light fanning suddenly across the scree down there from the vehicle that had just moved in information theyve brought in a mobile searchlight will that affect your position not directly its down there by the road theres a lot of terrain to cover and they obviously dont think anyone could have got as far as the caves but it means theyre dead set on finding us throwing everything in but the kitchen sink did you say something about instructions the huge light beam swung slowly across and across the landscape the soldiers moving in like insects hundreds of them hundreds silvergreen because of the light on their uniforms and throwing long black shadows theyd make better headway now could see where they were going yes your instructions from control are to protect the subject as far as humanly possible that is your final objective poor little bugger sitting there dreaming about his bloody windmills a fine man hed been a fine man before that blackbearded bloody maniac had gone to work on him said i understood im in constant signals with control of course the tone cheerful rallying goodo but they couldnt do anything now they could do nothing look im going to take him higher into the hills all right the snow had given over and the sky was clearing and id be able to get a fix on polaris when we went into the open im going to head due north so if that colonel wants to know where to find us well be somewhere along that line hed already got a bearing on the cave in a moment can you wait another thirty minutes before you leave cover i looked down into the valley the soldiers were making better headway but there were no probes breaking their line yet why dont like the idea of you leaving cover at least not yet look that colonel cant get here in time no one can do anything were on our own now insects down there ants on the move but theyd be much bigger when they got here and theyd be carrying assault rifles you havent been party to signals general yang has committed himself totally to saving this wellloved and eminent man colonel zhou was chosen for his reputation for high intelligence and courage a beat it would do us no good to underestimate him do you understand i thought about it all right well stay put for thirty minutes if those are your instructions i wouldnt have listened to those bastards loman or fane or welford but i would listen to this man he wouldnt give up on us they are not my instructions its more important than that i value your life perhaps more than you do point taken thirty minutes please stay open i turned back to the cave i didnt care much for trekking north from here myself but if we left the cave it was the only direction we could take and it was uphill and rough going and there might not be another refuge for miles and we couldnt go that far we couldnt go for miles he was a diabetic and hed been drugged and manhandled and put into shock and all he wanted to do was sit here and think about his windmills and his solarpowered peoples cars thousands of them millions enough for all those millions of lucky ants i sat down facing him how do you feel very well spoke in a monotone he was still under so tell me some more about the new communism why should it fall to china to bring about these great changes it is the ideal cradle for change the chinese created a civilization before all others we are a cultured people we possess vast territories vast manpower vast natural resources i see but this man xu yun your potential leader hes going to start things off with a lie so youve said telling the people hes going to give them democracy and then leading them down the same old garden path id call him a bloody hypocrite turning his head to look at me saying with great force but there is no other man to lead us no one but a bloody hypocrite something was happening i didnt know what it was he is for the peopled so was chairman mao for gods sake he had you walking about with your noses stuck into a little red book dont you remember that he was changing xingyu eyes different looked different he was surfacing and i snapped the string of the pendulum and let it fall mao was wrong he was for the people in the beginning theyre always for the people baibing it was the peoples liberation army that murdered the people in tiananmen square their own army surely you remember that i went on talking because something was happening to xingyu baibing and this wasnt a political argument anymore it was something much bigger than that communist leaders are always the same you know that theyre either shoving your nose in a book or a gun down your throat they but i was told other things breakthrough i didnt say anything he sat staring at me but now there was intelligence in his eyes hed lost that look of a zombie i didnt know what had happened to him but it could have been that the effect of the drugs had worn off or that id challenged him for the first time instead of listening to his precious manifesto correction let me correct something i did know what had happened theyd only got so far trotter and his dr chen only so far with him and this mans integrity of mind had resisted them and gone on resisting because all his life hed had the convictions of a revolutionary a rebel born for the barricades and the stuff had gone in all right the utopian bit but it hadnt stuck there hadnt been time before chong had got there and blown the whole thing up this man wasnt brainwashed hed just had a halfbaked manifesto shoved into his subconcious and hed brought it all out again got rid of it and the change that had come into his eyes was because hed surfaced from the effects of drugs and was coming back into beta waves i was told other things he said again yes but you can forget them now he is a very persuasive man yes and a bloody communist i understood something else trotter had known he hadnt got far enough with xingyu there hadnt been time to saturate his brain with the tenets of the manifesto to the point where he could safely go in front of the cameras in the great hall of the people and spread the new communism right across the nation and that was why the jeep had followed us away from the temple and the shots had come and the windshield was smashed and the mirror had gone flying because if dr xingyu baibing couldnt go on the screens with his mind fully indoctrinated then he couldnt be allowed to live glow on the roof of the cave from the distant searchlight his practical ideas xingyu said have a certain merit his technical ideas i looked at him wed need to do a little work yes but the west is also waking up to things and if theres still time to save life on earth it wont be run as a slave planet this man xu yun what are your thoughts about him he looked surprised he is a communist too as i have told you that doesnt answer my question my thoughts then are that he hesitated and i thought christ we havent got any time left for this while he is genuinely for the people listen baibing chairman mao was for the people and he brought them to their knees and deng xiaoping was for the people and he ordered a bloodbath in tiananmen and now youre saying that xu yun is for the people and you think hes going to turn out to be a fucking saint i shifted closer to him got down on my hands and knees to face him you are the only hope left for china baibing the most powerful voice in the land but the communist credo has rubbed off a little on you even on you and youve got to understand that any man getting up on his feet in a communist state and talking about the good of the people the people the people has got to be told to shut up and sit down and if he wont shut up and sit down then hes got to be taken away and shot before he becomes too dangerous lowered my voice baibing youre a man of enormous intelligence and you have got to get rid of the idea that communism in your country will ever see its people with anything more to their name but a halfempty rice bowl that man xu yun will have nothing to offer you but servitude suffering and blood in the streets are you listening to me in a moment yes silence again and in the silence i could hear the sound of the engines below and voices now carried on the wind as the light across the roof of the cave grew stronger so what are your thoughts on xu yun he is potentially dangerous he can you trust him then no i cannot hes a communist baibing what are your thoughts on that he is to be mistrusted he will only bring suffering sweat on his temples i didnt know why bright on his temples you help to put that man in power baibing and what will he do he will perpetuate communism in china and youll have blood back in the streets blood back in the streets yes it must not happen it if we can get you in front of the cameras baibing what will you tell the people that they must establish a democracy a true democracy as the only way the only way yes of course as the only way democracy as the only way but yes of course it is what i have been saying to them in beijing for so long then you can say it again if we can get you there and not just on the campus baibing but right across china right across china yes it seems to me he said and he lifted a hand to stop me interrupting again it seems to me that i have come very close dreadfully close to being turned into a traitor to my own people dreadfully close the sweat trickling on his face and now i knew why but thats over now felt tired suddenly should have been the other way shouting glory hallelujah so forth but didnt just felt very tired yes over now he said and lifted a hand again this time in a kind of appeal or that was my impression do you think i am fully recovered mr locke i made an effort got to my feet picked up the radio probably but if we can get you onto a plane therell be enough time to put you through it again make sure we know what youre going to say when you get to beijing dont think about it just take it easy id say youre back in your own mind now pressed to transmit dip dip di hear you i hear you i was just going listen this is for london hes come out of it now they didnt have enough time to do a proper job i think he could go in front of the cameras i know its probably academic but london ought to know you agree static i watched the soldiers below and the flood of light across the rocks wed have to get out of here now whatever pepperidge said whatever london said have to save our skins if we could london must indeed know this changes everything static again and i didnt know if id missed anything case going signal you london has been in direct contact with colonel zhou in flight and so have i his eta gonggar is twentyoneohfive hours in thirtytwo minutes from now xingyu had got onto his feet for the first time since wed reached the cave stood stretching his legs and i motioned him to keep back in the shadows i said to pepperidge thirtytwo minutes is nothing like good enough gonggars sixty kilometres away and hed have to get right through the town and god knows how many roadblocks i could see their guns now the searchlight sweeping across them the whole scene silvered the stark shadows of the boulders angling over the scree as a beam of light swung across them and pepperidge came in again colonel zhou has raised the military garrison at gonggar from his plane and ordered an m helicopter to stand by for him with a pilot and navigator by the time he lands the maximum speed of the m is twofifty kph so allowing for changing planes and liftoff he estimates he can arrive your area by twentytwo hundred hours in fiftyfive minutes from now xingyu was standing there watching me i didnt know if he could hear pepperidges voice clearly enough but he could hear mine its still not good enough heard myself saying it having to say it then you must work something out yes indeed those were the only instructions my director in the field could give me they were as close as that i can hear their voices now and youre talking about fiftyfive minutes you must work something out i expect you to work something out and so does london control hed caught my tone the color of my speech and heard i was tired close to exhaustion been a thick night two nights the mission had been running four days now and the pressure hadnt let up listen if id been fresh id have got xingyu out of here and higher into the hills on my back if id had to but i wasnt fresh and pepperidge knew that and all he could do was to try putting some energy into me enough faith and energy to work the magic no magic left im going to take him north with me i told him all i can do its all i can work out we wont get very far so if that colonel can find the cave hell have to look for us north of there maybe a few hundred yards due north tell him that in a moment if that is your decision we cant stay here theyre too close now too close and oh jesus look down there theyve also moved a helicopter in and its putting a light beam across the ground were getting out you understand all we can do now xingyu baibing watched me from the cave his eyes large and alert concentrating on what i was saying i believed he would give me no trouble lend what strength hed got left push himself up that bloody hill if i helped him pepperidge came in again i will tell colonel zhou where to look for you now these are your instructions he will fly both of you to gonggar and put the subject into the fighterbomber and take him to beijing you will be placed in the hands of two dissident pla captains ostensibly under arrest they will take you by military plane to chengdu and will personally see you aboard a civilian flight to hong kong do i need to repeat any of those instructions said no running things much too close for the colonel to do anything that bloody chopper down there tracing a line of light from east to west turning and moving closer toward the caves west to east the sound of its rotor slapping at the night but perhaps it was the fatigue perhaps i didnt have the nervous energy to believe there was a chance now one in a thousand put faith in him then faith in pepperidge believe in the thousandth chance please stay open to receive his voice came through the static will do then on an impulse perhaps just to hear myself say it give it substance maybe he can make it in time say again this colonel maybe he can get here in time but of course he will i put the radio down and went back inside the cave to talk to xingyu the acid glow from the searchlight spreading brighter now across the roof and then suddenly the huge black shadow rearing above us and i spun around as he came for us trotter eta the voices of the soldiers had been reaching as far as the cave on the soft night wind but i couldnt hear them anymore because the search helicopter was flooding the ground with light much closer now to the foothills and the beat of its rotor covered all other sounds the whole terrain out there must be awash with light now that the helicopter had arrived it would help colonel zhou when he came if he came if there was going to be anything left here for him to come for he would see the lights from a long way off i am very tired my friend the roof of the cave changed as the light changed darkening and brightening as the helicopter made its run from east to west from west to east and the shadow of the stalactites stood like bristles across the rockface slanting and straightening and slanting again as the helicopter flew past some of the stalactites had broken away over the centuries and were lying on the ground reek of kerosene on the air a sickening smell when you are tired very tired heavy odors are unwelcome arent they get on your stomach make one irritable i feel irritable my good friend beat of the rotor blades drumming in the mouth of the cave throbbing against the ears xingyu was over there on the ground dr xingyu baibing lying on the ground he moved again and i tightened the lock on his throat but oh my god he was strong and rolled half over and i had to bring my knee up in another strike for the spine but it didnt have enough force because this man had drained most of the strength out of me since hed come in here and gone for xingyu first because he was the priority target and id managed a hookkick to throw him before he could make his kill and it had started from that point and there was blood on the floor of the cave his and mine and all i could do now was keep the hold id got on his throat and see how long he could go without the oxygen he needed his breath was a low sawing close beside me moved again and i almost lost it the sweat running on him and making the lock slippery and that was dangerous and could be lethal i was appalled at the degree of strength still left in the man he must have caught a shot down there before hed started crawling after us across the rocks thered already been blood on his face when hed reared above us in the cavemouth but it hadnt weakened him beat of the rotor the light brightening lowering the stink of exhaust gas i thought xingyu was coming to trying to raise his head i would have to tell him not to come any closer he must keep out of this mans reach because the last of the strength i still possessed was diminishing over the seconds draining away kept moving my other hand my free hand over the floor of the cave they made a faint metallic ringing the broken stalactites as i groped among them and at last found one that felt good enough long enough pepperidge was signaling me id left the radio switched to receive as hed instructed but i couldnt hear what he was saying because of the noise the helicopter he moved again trotter feeling the point of the stalactite against his skin he moved with appalling strength and i received it received his strength and was in awe of it and made it my own drawing it into my arm and forcing the lock tighter letting my mind float to bring the tension down concentrating on his enormous strength as i let it flow into me and through my arm until the lock was tight enough to keep him still and i drove the stalactite in i was wondering if youd give me absolution my dear fellow drove it deeper through the running of the blood there is nothing personal you understand in this drove it to the hilt of my clenched hand until the sawing of his breath became liquid and it frightened him and he found the last degree of strength that we can only find when survival itself demands it and broke my armlock and threw me off him and i rolled away across the metallicsounding shards rolled away as he came after me huge a huge man his blood shining in the light from the helicopter as it flowed from him and he came forward again hanging on his hands and knees like a monstrous quadruped his black eyes wide and watching me came forward again and then stopped hanging on all fours again with no further will to move or that was my impression his eyes watching me in a blank stare i am for the dark am i not my dear fellow i am for the dark now i believe watching me until his black eyes dulled and he dropped like a dead bull i am tired my good friend very tired sleep now sleep they were like little bells the shards the stalactites a delicate tintinnabulation in my ears as boots moved over them blood congealing on my bare hand can you hear me my face against the rough floor of the cave can you hear me xingyu looking down at me saying it is the radio tried to get up and he helped me his eyes staring perhaps hed thought i was dead too been sleeping that was all i had been sleeping oh sweet jesus for how long for how long can you hear me swaying on my feet the light sweeping across the cave mouth a wave of exhaust gas blowing in and when the sound of the rotor died away i could hear their voices the soldiers calling to one another and i picked up the radio hear you i hear you colonel zhous eta should look its too late we cant leave the cave theyre too close now theyd see us beat of the rotor the chopper coming back static then colonel zhous eta should bring him directly over your location at this moment i will repeat beat of the rotor its downdraft picking up a vortex of grit from the rocks and whirling it into the mouth of the cave and i shouted for xingyu to keep back but there was no light flooding down this was a different machine a bigger machine the landing skids putting down on the loose shale and tilting and straightening again as a door swung open and a man dropped onto the ground and came jogging toward the cave and i went to meet him i am colonel zhou we must hurry please i turned and beckoned to xingyu but he went on standing there seemed uncertain or the damage that trotter had done to him had left him groggy so i went and got an arm around his shoulders and shielded his face from the flying grit and brought him to the helicopter i watched from the windows of the military shed at gonggar two pla captains with me one an each side as the fighterbomber lifted from the runway and left a storm of sound booming among the buildings he had looked grubby and dogtired xingyu his face drawn and his eyes nervy as theyd helped him into his flying gear but he would catch some sleep on the flight and theyd clean him up hi beijing and hed look all right on the screen that was what mattered take what one of the captains was holding out a packet of cigarettes the end torn open take i pulled one out and he struck a match for me and we stood together with its light on our faces you help china people well hope so took a quick puff as a gesture the end
