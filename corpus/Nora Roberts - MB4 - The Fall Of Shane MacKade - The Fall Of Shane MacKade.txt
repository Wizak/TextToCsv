you better say no loud and clear and say it fast rebecca shane said huskily tell me you dont want me dont want this and make damn sure you mean it she was melting against him soft fragrant wax his blood pumped in response to those soft sexy sounds she made in her throat under her palm rebecca felt the furious beat of his heart and her hand trembled shed thought it was fear but it wasnt oh no it wasnt fear it was longing i cant she let out a whoosh of breath i wouldnt mean it triumph suited him i know prologue ice covered the shoveled walk from the house to the milking barn and the path was slick with it the predawn air was cupped by a dark sky chiseled with frosted chips of white stars each gulp was like sipping chilled razor blades that sliced then numbed the throat before being expelled in a frigid steam wrapped in a multitude of winter layers from long johns to knitted muffler shane mackade headed toward the milking parlor and the first chores of the day unlike his three older brothers he was whistling between his teeth he just plain loved the frosty and still hour before a winter sunrise his oldest brother jared was nearly seventeen and went about the business of running a farm like an accountant approaching a spreadsheet it was all figures to him shane knew and he supposed that was well enough they had lost their father two months before and times were rough as for rafe his restless fifteenyearold soul was already looking beyond the hills and fields of the mackade farm the milking and feeding and tending of stock was simply something to get through and shane knew though they never really talked about it that their fathers death had hit rafe the hardest they had all loved their father it would have been impossible not to love buck mackade with his big voice and big hands and big heart and everything shane knew about farming everything he loved about the land had come straight from his father perhaps that was why shane didnt grieve as deeply the land was there so his father was there always he could have talked about that thought with devin at fourteen devin was already the best of listeners and the closest to shanes own age shane was going to make the big leap to thirteen next tuesday but he kept the thought and the feeling to himself inside the milking parlor the first of the stock shifted and mooed tails swishing as they were prepped it was a simple enough process could even be considered a monotonous one the cleaning the feeding the attaching to machines that would pump the milk from cow to pipe from pipe to tank for storage but shane enjoyed it enjoyed the smells the sounds the routine while he and devin dealt with the second line of stock rafe and jared led those already relieved of milk outside again they made a good team quick and efficient despite the numbing cold and early hour in truth it was a job any one of them could have handled alone or with very little help but they tended to stick together even closer together these days still there were chickens and pigs to see to yet eggs to gather muck to shovel fresh hay to spread and all this before they gobbled down breakfast and climbed into jareds ancient car for the drive to school if he could have shane would have skipped the school part entirely you couldnt learn how to plow and plant how to harvest or judge the weather by tasting the air from books you couldnt learn from books how to look into a cows eyes and see that she was ailing but his mother was firm on book learning and when she was firm she was immovable what the hell are you so happy about grumbling rafe clanged stainlesssteel buckets together that whistlings driving me crazy shane merely grinned and kept on whistling he paused only long enough to talk encouragingly to the cows thats the way ladies you fill her up content as any of his bossies shane moved down the line of milkers checking each one im going to pound him rafe announced to no one in particular leave him be devin said mildly hes already braindead rafe smiled at that its so damn cold if i hit him my fingers would probably break off going to warm up some today shane patted one of the cows waiting in the stanchions to be hooked for milking get up into the thirties anyway rafe didnt bother to ask how shane knew shane always knew big deal he strode out of the milking parlor toward barn and hayloft whats eating him shane muttered some girl dump him he just hates cows jared stepped back in smelling of grain thats stupid youre a sweetheart arent you baby shane gave the nearest cow an affection swat shanes in love with cows devin flashed the wicked mackade grin which had a dimple flickering at the corner of his mouth he has better luck kissing them than girls immediately insulted shane narrowed his eyes i could kiss any girl i wanted to if i wanted to under the layers of clothing his lean rangy body was on full alert recognizing the signs jared shook his head he just didnt feel like a tussle now there was too much work to do and he had a big test in english lit to worry about devin and shane were too evenly matched and a fight between them could go on indefinitely yeah youre a regular don juan he said it only to focus shanes attention and temper on him all the little girls are puckered up and waiting in line devin made a long loud kissing noise that made jared want to slug him as shane pivoted to do just that jared stepped between them but before you make their hearts flutter lover boy the water troughs iced over these cows are thirsty aiming a glance that promised devin retribution shane stomped outside he could kiss a girl shane thought as he hacked at the ice if he wanted to he just wasnt interested well maybe he was a little interested he admitted blowing on his fingers to warm them some of the girls he knew were starting to get pretty interesting shapes and hed felt an odd sort of tingling under his skin when jareds girl sharilyn wiggled up against him when they were packed into the front seat of jareds car the other day he could probably kiss her if he wanted he set the iron bar aside looking toward the milk barn as the stars winked out overhead that would show jared a thing or two they all figured he didnt know what was what because he was the youngest but he knew plenty at least he was starting to imagine plenty hauling up the bar again he clumped over the slippery snowpacked ground to the pig shed he knew how sex worked all right hed grown up on a farm hadnt he he knew how the bull went crazy and whiteeyed when he smelled a cow in heat he just hadnt thought the whole thing looked like a whole hell of a lot of fun but that had been before he began to notice how girls filled out their clothes he hacked away the layer of ice for the pigs and leaving his brothers to finish up the milking dealt with the feed he wished he was grownup he wished he could do something to prove he was besides holding his own in a fight as it was all he could do was simply wait until he was older and know that then he could take control of his life the land was his hed felt that in his bones as long as he could remember as if at birth someone had whispered it in his ear the farm the land that was what really mattered and if he wanted a girl too or a whole platoon of them hed get that too but the farm was what counted most the land he thought looking over the snowcoated fields as the sky grayed with dawn and turned explosive at the tips of the eastern mountains the land his father had worked and his father before that and before that through droughts and floods through war theyd planted their crops and brought them in he thought dreaming a little as he walked toward the fields even when war came right here with confederate gray and union blue clashing in these very fields and in the thick woods just beyond the farm had stayed whole he knew just what it would have been like turning the rocky soil behind a horsedrawn plow your back and shoulders aching your hands raw but the crops would be planted and you would see them grow corn springing up spreading hay waving and going gold with summer even when the soldiers came even when their mortars and black powder singed the drying cornstalks the land stayed bodies had dropped here he thought as a chill crept up his spine men had screamed and crawled through their own blood but the land they had fought over fought for didnt change it endured he flushed a little wondering where that word had come from that word and the strong almost dizzying emotion behind it he was glad he was alone glad none of his brothers could see he didnt know how to tell them that he knew the farm had been his responsibility before and would be again but he knew when he heard the sound behind him he stiffened and shouldering the bar again turned with his face carefully closed free of emotion there was no one there he swallowed hard he was sure hed heard a sound a movement then a small weak cry it wasnt the first time hed heard the ghosts they lived here as he did in the fields in the woods in the hills but they terrified him nonetheless gathering all his young courage he moved around the shed toward the old stone smokehouse it was probably devin he told himself or rafe or even jared trying to get a rise out of him trying to make him bolt as hed nearly bolted the time they spent the night in the old barlow place on the other side of the woods the haunted house where ghosts were as thick as cobwebs get a life dev he said loudly loudly enough to calm his speeding heart but when he rounded the building he didnt see his brother or even any tracks in the snow for an instant just a quick tripping heartbeat he thought he saw a figure there crumpled spilling blood over the ground the face as white as the untouched snow the eyes dulled with pain help me please help me im dying but when he stepped forward there was nothing nothing at all even the words that rang in his head faded away in the wind shane stood there a young boy with his whole life a wonderful mystery yet to unfold and stared at the unbroken ground he stood there shuddering as the cold reached through the layers of clothes through his flesh and into his bones then he heard his brothers laughing heard his mother call from the kitchen door that breakfast was ready and to get a move on or theyd be late for school he turned away closed his frightened mind off to what he had seen and what he had heard he walked back to the farmhouse and said nothing of that one jolting moment to anyone chapter one shane mackade loved women he loved the look of them the smell of them the sound of them the taste of them he loved them without reservation or prejudice tall short plump thin old young their wonderful and exotic femaleness pulled him drew him in the slant of an eyelash the curve of a lip the sway of a shapely female bottom simply delighted him he had in his thirtytwo years on earth done his very best to show as many women as possible his boundless appreciation for them as a gender he considered himself a lucky man because the ladies loved him right back he had other loves his family his farm the smell of bread baking the taste of a cold beer on a hot day but women well they were so varied so different and so delicious he was smiling at one now even though regan was his brothers wife and shane had nothing but the most innocent and brotherly feelings for her he could appreciate her considerable female attributes he liked the way her deep blond hair curved around her face he adored the little mole beside her mouth and the way she always looked so sexy and so tidy at the same time he thought if a man had to pick one woman and tie himself down rafe couldnt have done better are you sure you dont mind shane mind what he caught her quirked brow as she lifted the newest mackade onto her shoulder oh the airport run right i was just thinking how pretty you look regan had to laugh she was frazzled jason mackade her youngest son was squalling her hair was a mess and she was afraid she smelled more like jasons diapers than the scent shed dabbed on that morning i look like a madwoman nope to give her a breather shane took jason from her and jiggled the threeweekold baby into hiccups just as pretty as ever she glanced over to the playpen shed set up in the back room of her antique shop where her toddler nate napped through the chaos he had the look of his father she thought with a burst of love which meant of course that he had the look of his uncle shane i appreciate it i can use the flattery i really hate to ask you though shane watched her pour tea and resigned himself to drinking it its not a problem honey ill pick up your college pal and get her back to you safe and sound a scientist huh hmm regan handed him a cup knowing he could juggle that and his infant nephew and a few more things besides rebeccas brilliant overthetop brilliant i only roomed with her one year she was fifteen and already a sophomore she ended up graduating summa cum laude a full year ahead of me and the rest of her class pretty intimidating regan sampled the tea and the relative quiet now that shane had jason calmed down to bubbling coos it seemed she was always in some lab or the library sounds like a barrel of laughs she was is a serious type and tended to be shy after all she was years younger than anyone else in school but we got to be friends shed have come for the wedding but she was in europe or africa regan waved vaguely somewhere shane was thinking nostalgically of his own fifteenth year when he had learned the intricacies of the backhook bra in the dark its nice youve got a pal coming to visit well its kind of a working visit for her regan gnawed her lip she hadnt mentioned rebeccas purpose except to rafe she supposed if she was going to dragoon shane into meeting her friend at the airport she ought to make it clear she studied him as he made faces at the baby then nuzzled jason all the mackades were stunners she thought but there was something about shane just an extra slice of charm she supposed he had the looks of course that thick midnightblack hair that he now wore in a stubby ponytail the thin bony mouthwatering face with its angles and planes lush mouth flashing dimple and thickly lashed green eyes his shade of green was dreamy the shade of an ocean at twilight he had the build tall rangy muscled broad shoulders narrow hips long long legs it showed to advantage in jeans and work boots and flannel he had the charm all four mackades had it to spare but regan thought there was an extra dollop in shane something about the way his eyes lingered on a woman the quick appreciative grin when he spoke to one be she eight or eighty that easygoing cheerful manner that could explode into temper then just as quickly edge away into a laugh hed probably scare the hell out of poor shy rebecca youre awfully good with him she murmured you keep making babies honey ill keep loving them amused she angled her head still not ready to settle down now why would i want to go and do that he looked up from jason and his eyes danced with humor im the last single mackade im honorbound to hold the fort until the nephews start springing up and you take your duty seriously you bet hes asleep shane lowered his head and kissed jasons brow want me to put him down thanks she waited until shane had jason settled in the antique cradle rebeccas expecting me i wasnt able to catch her before she left for the airport frazzled all over again regan ran her fingers though her hair the babysitter canceled rafes in hagerstown getting building material cassies got a full house over at the inn emmas got the sniffles and i just couldnt ask savannah to help out last time i saw her she looked ready to pop to demonstrate the condition of jareds wife shane made a wide circle with his arms in front of his flat belly exactly shes too pregnant to drive a threehour round trip and with a furniture delivery being rescheduled for this afternoon i didnt know who else to call and impose on its no trouble to prove it he kissed the tip of her nose i dont suppose shes as pretty as you is she regan chuckled at that how am i supposed to answer that and not sound like a jerk in any case i havent seen her in five years i guess the last time was on a quick trip to new york and she was hipdeep in some paper she was writing shes four years younger than i am and has two doctorates maybe more i cant keep up shane didnt wince he liked women with brains as much as he liked women without them but he knew the old routine about smarts and wonderful personalities he didnt think he was going to be picking up a beauty queen at the airport psychiatry and us history for sure regan continued kind of an odd mix but then rebeccas unique i remember she minored in some sort of complex math and there was science too physics chemistry she did postgrad work on that at mit why shane wondered out loud with rebecca it would be more a matter of why not shes got what they call a photographic memory sees it reads it files it up there regan said tapping her head and shes a shrink she doesnt have a private practice she consults writes papers lectures i know she used to donate a day a week to a clinic she wrote a definitive paper on well some psychosis or other or maybe it was a phobia im a business major anyway shane regan smiled brightly and patted his hand shes into parapsychology as a hobby into what is that like ghostbusting its the study of the paranormal esp psychic phenomena ah hauntings ghosts shane concluded and this time he did wince dont we have enough of that around here already thats the point shes interested in the area the legends its different for you shane regan hurried on knowing her brotherinlaws aversion to local legends you grew up with it all the barlow house the two corporals the haunted woods the whole idea of hauntings is one of the main reasons rafe and i have been able to make such a success out of the inn people love the idea of staying in a haunted house shane only shrugged hell he lived in one i dont mind all that its just when tourists want to go tramping around the farm that the look in her eye stopped him made him narrow his own she wants to tramp around the farm she wants the whole picture and i know shed like to spend some time out there but thats totally up to you regan said quickly you need to get to know her a little shes really a fascinating woman anyway i wrote down her flight number and so forth regan offered him a sheet of paper you still havent told me what she looks like i doubt shes going to be the only woman off that flight from new york right brown hair brown eyes she used to wear it just sort of pulled back or hanging down shes about my height thin skinny or slim theres a difference i guess more on the skinny side she may be wearing glasses she uses them to read but she used to forget to take them off and shed end up running into things a skinny clumsy brunette with glasses got it shes very attractive regan added loyally in a unique way and shane shes shy so be nice im always nice to women all right be good then if you dont spot her you can have her paged dr rebecca knight airports always entertained shane people were in just as much of a hurry it seemed to him to get where they were going as they were to get back from wherever theyd been everyone hit the ground running loaded down with carryons he wondered what it was about the places people chose to leave that didnt appeal enough to keep them there not that he was against travel he just figured he could get anywhere he really wanted to go by sitting behind the wheel of his pickup that way he was in charge of time and distance and speed but it took all kinds he also figured he could spot regans college palsince she was a woman and he knew women shed be in her midtwenties about five foot five skinny brown hair brown eyes probably behind thick glasses from regans brief rundown he didnt imagine rebecca knight had a great deal of style so he would look for a plain intellectual type with a briefcase and practical shoes he loitered at the gate eyeing a pair of flight attendants who were waiting for a change of crew now that he mused was a profession that drew pretty women it almost made a man feel thered be some advantage in being stuck in a flying tin can for a few hours as passengers began to pour out of the gateway he judiciously shifted his attention businessmen looking harried he noted the suitandtie brigade no amount of money could convince him that it would be worth wearing a suit for eight to ten hours a day nicelooking blonde in sleek red slacks she gave him a quick flirtatious smile as she passed and shane pleased himself by drawing in the cloud of scent she left behind pretty brunette with a long groundeating stride and big wide gold eyes they reminded him of the amber beads his mother had kept in her good jewelry box here came grandma with an enormous shopping bag and a huge mistyeyed grin for the trio of children who raced up to hug her knees ah there she is shane decided spotting a slumpshouldered woman with brown hair scraped back in a frowsy knot she carried an officiallooking black briefcase and wore thick laced shoes and square glasses she blinked owlishly behind them looking lost hey he gave her a quick flashing smile and a friendly wink that had her backing up three steps into a frazzled man lugging a bulging garment bag hows it going he reached down to take her briefcase and had her myopic eyes going round with alarm im shane regan sent me to fetch you she had complications so how was the flight i i the woman pulled her briefcase protectively against her thin chest ill call security take it easy becky im just going to give you a ride she opened her mouth and made a squeaking noise when shane reached out for her arm to reassure her she gave him a solid thwack with the briefcase before he had decided whether to laugh or swear he felt a light tap on his arm excuse me the pretty brunette cocked a brow and gave him a long considering study i believe you may be looking for me her mouth which shane noted was wide and full curved into a dryly amused smile shane you said that would be shane mackade yeah oh he glanced back at the woman hed accosted sorry he began but she was already darting off like a rabbit pursued by wolves i imagine thats the most excitement shes had in some time rebecca commented she thought she knew just how the poor woman had felt it was so miserable to be shy and plain and not quite in step with the rest of the world im rebecca knight she added and thrust out a hand she wasnt quite what hed expected but on closer study he saw he hadnt been that far off she did look intellectual if you got past those eyes rather than practical shoes it was a practical haircut as short as a boys he preferred hair on a woman personally but this choppedoff do suited her face with its pointy almost foxlike features and she was probably skinny it was just hard to tell with the boxy shapedisguising jacket and slacks all in unrelieved black so he smiled again taking the long narrow hand in his regan said your eyes were brown theyre not it says they are on my drivers license is regan all right shes fine just some domestic and professional complications here let me take that he reached for the big manypocketed bag she had slung over her shoulder no thanks ive got it youre one of the brothersinlaw yeah he took her arm to steer her around toward the terminal strong fingers she noted and a predilection for touching well that was all right she wouldnt squeak as the other woman had as she herself might have a few months before when faced with a pure unadulterated male the one who runs the farm thats right you dont look much like a phd on first glance dont i she sent him a cool sidelong look shed done a lot of mirrorpracticing on that look and the woman who is probably even now hyperventilating in the nearest ladies room did it was the shoes shane explained and grinned down at rebeccas neat black canvas flats i see as they rode down the escalator toward baggage claim she turned to face him flannel shirt open at the collar she noted worn jeans scarred boots big callused hands thick black hair spilling out of a battered cap on top of a lean tanned face that could have been on a poster selling anything you look like a farmer she decided so how long a drive is it to antietam he debated whether or not hed been insulted or complimented and answered just over an hour well get your bags theyre being sent pleased with her practicality she patted the bag over her arm this is all i have at the moment shane couldnt get over the sensation the uncomfortable sensation that he was being observed sized up and dissected like a laboratory frog great it relieved him when she took shaded glasses from her jacket pocket and slipped them on he was used to women looking at him but not as though he were something smeared on a slide when they reached his truck she gave it a brief look then gave him another as he opened the door for her she granted him one of those cool smiles then tipped down her glasses to peer at him over them oh one thing shane because shed paused he frowned a little yeah nobody calls me becky with that she slid neatly onto the seat and set her bag on the floor she enjoyed the ride he drove well and the truck ran smoothly and she couldnt help but get a little glow of satisfaction at having annoyed him just a bit men who not only looked as good as shane mackade but had the extra bonus of exuding all that sex and confidence werent easy to take down a peg shed spent a lot of her life being intimidated on any kind of social level only in the past few months had she begun to make progress toward holding her own shed become her own project and rebecca thought she was coming along very well she gave him credit for making easy conversation on the trip annoyed or not before long they were off the highway and driving on winding back roads it was a pretty picture hills and houses pastures and trees that held their lush summer green into the late hazy august an occasional horse or grazing cow hed turned the radio music politely low and all she could really hear from the speakers was the throb of the beat the cab of the truck was neat with the occasional strand of golden dog hair drifting upward and the scent of dog with it there were a couple of scribbled notes attached by magnet to the metal dash a handful of coins tossed into the ashtray but it was ordered perhaps that was why she spotted the little gold twist of a womans earring peeking out from under the floor mat she reached down and plucked it up yours he flicked a glance caught the glint of gold and remembered that frannie spader had been wearing earrings like that the last time they took a drive together a friends shane held out his hand when the earring was in it he dropped it carelessly amid the coins shell want it back rebecca noted idly its fourteenkarat so there are four of you right yep do you have any brothers sisters no but you run the family farm thats the way it worked out jared has his law practice rafes into building devins the sheriff and youre the farm boy she finished what do you farm we have dairy cattle pigs grow corn feed mostly but some nice silver queen hay alfalfa he could see she was taking it all in with those big intense eyes and he added very soberly weve had ourselves a nice crop of potatoes really in unconscious sympathy with the beat whispering through the speakers she drummed her fingers on her knee isnt that a lot of work for one man my brothers are there when theyre needed and i take on some h students seasonally he moved his shoulders ive got a couple of nephews coming up theyre eleven now i can usually con them into believing theyre having fun when theyre feeding the stock and is it fun i like it this time he looked at her ever been on a farm no not really im an urbanite then youre in for a surprise with antietam he murmured urban its not so regan tells me and of course i know the area through my studies it must have been interesting growing up on one of the major battlefields of the civil war rafe was always more into that than me the land doesnt care if its historical as long as its tended so youre not interested in the history not particularly the truck rumbled over the bridge that spanned the piece of the potomac river between virginia and maryland i know it he added you cant live there all your life and not know it but i dont give it a lot of attention and the ghosts i dont give them a lot of attention either a smile shadowed her mouth but you know of them again he moved his shoulders part of the package you want to talk to the rest of the family about that theyre more into it yet you live and work on a farm thats supposedly haunted supposedly he didnt care to talk about it or think about it look regan mentioned something about you coming out to do whatever it is you do to study and record any paranormal activity her smile spread its just a hobby yeah well youd be better off at the old barlow place the house rafe and regan put back together its a bedandbreakfast now one of my other sistersinlaw runs it its lousy with ghosts if you believe in that sort of thing mmm its on my list in fact im hoping they can squeeze me in for a while id like to stay there and from what regan told me you have a large house id like to stay there too he wouldnt mind the company but the purpose didnt sit well with him regan didnt mention how long you were planning on being around that depends she looked out the window as he took a route through a cut in the mountains it depends on how long it takes me to find what i want to find and how long it takes to document it dont you have like a job im taking a sabbatical the word had such marvelous possibilities she closed her eyes to savor them i have all the time in the world and i intend to enjoy it opening her eyes again she saw the glint from the little gold earring in the ashtray dont worry farm boy i wont cramp your style when the time comes you can tuck me into some little room in the attic ill do my thing you can do yours he started to comment but she made some soft strangled sound and sat bolt upright in the seat what she could only shake her head absorbed in the jarring sense of deja vu the hills rose up grass green against outcroppings of silver rocks in the distance the higher mountains were purple shadows against hazy skies fields high with green stalks of corn thick with summer grains rolled back from the road on a sloping embankment blackandwhite cows stood as still as if they were on a postcard woods dark and thick ranged along a field while a winding creek bubbled along the verge it looks just as it should she murmured softly exactly perfect thanks its mackade land he slowed the truck a little out of pride you cant see the house this time of year trees are too thick its back down that lane she saw the rough gravel road the way it swung left and followed the line of trees with her heart thudding dully in her breast she nodded come hell or high water she thought she was going back there and she would stay until she found all the answers to all the questions that plagued her she took a deep breath turned to him how far to town just a few miles now his eyes narrowed with concern shed gone dead pale you all right im fine but she did open the window to take a deep gulp of late summer im just fine chapter two through the display window of her shop regan saw the truck pull up to the curb with a child in each arm she dashed outside dr knight mrs mackade rebecca slid out of the cab of the truck and let out a cry of pure pleasure then launched herself at her friend as her vision blurred gone was the cool and the clinical shane noted and he found himself grinning at the way the two women babbled and embraced hed had some reservations about rebecca knight and maybe hed keep a few of them but there was no doubt as to the depth of affection here oh ive missed you ive missed you rebecca said over and over as tears stung her eyes oh regan youre so gorgeous and look at these your babies she let the tears come shed never had to hold back or feel foolish with regan sniffling she touched nates cheek then stroked a finger along the babys soft head i dont see you for a few years and look what you do married and the mother of two ive got to hold one always willing nate held out his arms you must look like your daddy rebecca commented delighted when nate puckered up for a kiss daddy nate agreed play ball shane he bounced up and down like a spring shane gimme ride shows what you know choosing your uncle over a lady but shane hauled nate onto his shoulders where the toddler could squeal and grip his hair you found each other regan beamed at both of them im sorry i couldnt get away to pick you up myself id say you had your hands full rebecca turned to give shane a mild smile and your brotherinlaw managed just fine all in all you must be tired come into the shop im just closing up shane come in for some tea i have to get back thanks anyway down you go nate he swung the boy around inciting a series of rolling belly laughs wise to her son regan clutched nates hand firmly in hers the minute his little feet hit the ground thanks she kissed shane lightly on the lips i owe you one i want to give rebecca a welcome dinner tomorrow when shes had time to catch her breath youll come wont you a free meal he winked count on it see you thanks for the lift farm boy shane paused at the driversside door anytime becky regan lifted a brow as he drove away becky just a little joke objectively she looked up and down the street noted the light traffic the old stone buildings the people loitering in front of doorways im trying to picture regan bishop as resident and shop owner of small town usa it was home the minute i saw it come inside she said again tell me what you think of the shop now she could picture it rebecca realized the moment she stepped into past times the style the elegance of gleaming antiques lovely old lamps and glass and statuary there was a smell of spice and baby powder that made her smile mama she said after turning around in a circle how does it feel incredible i cant wait for you to meet rafe she moved into a back room setting the baby in a bassinet then lifting nate into a high chair where he occupied himself with a cookie it gave her time to take a breath of course youve seen shane so youve got a fairly good idea of the mackade looks are they all like that tall dark and ridiculously handsome every one of them with badboy reputations to match she leaned back took a long survey rebecca its always what people say when they havent seen in other for a while but i have to say it anyway you look wonderful rebecca smiled as she tugged on a short tress of chestnutbrown hair i got the nerve to have this hacked off when i was in europe a few months ago you were always trying to coax me into doing something with my hair id have never been that brave or inventive boy it suits you rebecca and the clothes her smile widened that was europe too i had a crisis of style so to speak i was walking along the left bank and happened to catch a glimpse of this woman reflected in one of the shop windows she looked like an unkempt scarecrow her hair was tangled and hanging down in her face and she had on the most dreadful brown suit i thought poor thing to look like that in a city like this and then i realized it was me youre too hard on yourself i was a mess rebecca said firmly a cliche the dowdy prodigy with a sharp brain and bad shoes i walked into the nearest beauty salon gave myself no time to think to rationalize to intellectualize and threw myself on their mercy whod have thought a decent haircut could make such a difference to the way i felt it seemed so shallow i told myself that even when i walked out with several hundred dollars worth of skin creams she laughed at herself as she realized that after all this time she was still savoring that moment then i realized that if appearances werent important it couldnt be a problem to present a good one then ill say it again you look wonderful regan reached out for rebeccas hands in fact since youre happy with the change ill be perfectly honest and tell you i wouldnt have recognized you youre absolutely striking and im so glad to see you looking so fabulous i have to say this she gave regans hands a hard squeeze regan you were my first real friend rebecca my very first the only person i was close to who didnt treat me like an oddity ive wanted to tell you for a long time what that meant to me what you meant to me but even with you i had a hard time getting that kind of thing out youre making me cry again regan managed theres more i was so nervous coming here worrying that the friendship the connection might not be the same but it is hell rebecca gave a lavish sniff got any tissue regan dived into a diaper bag and pulled out a travel pack she handed a tissue to rebecca used one herself im so happy she said weeping me too rebecca decided the rambling old stone house just outside of town suited regan and rafe mackade perfectly it had the rough masculine charm of rafe mackade and the style and feminine grace of regan all rolled into one she would have spotted rafe as shanes brother from a mile away with one eye closed so powerful was the resemblance so she wasnt surprised when he pulled her into his arms for a hard hug the moment he saw her shed already gleaned that the mackades liked women regans been fretting and fussing for two weeks he told rebecca over a glass of wine in the big airy living room i have not been fussing or fretting rafe smiled and from his seat on the sofa reached up to stroke his wifes hand as she sat on the arm near him she polished everything twice vacuumed up every dog hair he gave the golden retriever slumbering on the rug an affection nudge with his foot most of the dog hair regan corrected im flattered rebecca jolted a little when nate knocked over his building blocks and sent them scattering attaboy rafe said mildly if its not built right just tear it down and start again daddy come play its all in the foundation rafe said as he got up and ranged himself on the floor with his son they began to move blocks rafes big hands moving with nates small pudgy ones regan says you want a closeup look at the inn i do i want to stay there at least for a while if you have a vacancy oh but we want you here rebecca rebecca smiled over at regan i appreciate that and i do want to spent time here as well but it would really help if i could stay a few nights there anyway ghostbusting rafe said with a wink at his son if you like rebecca returned coolly hey dont get me wrong theyre there the first time i got a good hold of regan was when i caught her as she was fainting in the hallway of the inn theyd spooked her thats not entirely true regan said i thought rafe was playing a prank and when i realized he wasnt i got overwrought tell me about it fascinated rebecca leaned forward what did you see i didnt see anything regan blew out a breath her son was too involved with his blocks to notice the subject of the conversation and in any case he was a mackade it was more a feeling of not being alone the house had been deserted and empty for years then rafe hadnt even begun the renovations but there were noises footsteps a door closing theres a spot on the stairs a cold spot you felt it rebeccas voice was flat now that of a scientist assessing data right to the bone it was so shocking rafe told me later that a young confederate soldier had been killed there on the day of the battle of antietam the two corporals rebecca nodded at regans surprised look ive been researching the area the legends two soldiers from opposite sides met in the woods on september its thought they were lost or perhaps deserting they were both very young they fought there wounded each other badly one made his way to the home of charles barlow now the mackade inn the mistress of the house abigail was a southern woman wed to a yankee businessman she had the wounded boy brought inside and was having him carried upstairs to be tended instead her husband came down and shot and killed him there on the stairs thats right regan agreed youll often smell roses in the house abigails roses really rebecca mulled the information over well well isnt that fascinating her eyes went dreamy for a moment then sharpened again i managed to contact a descendant of one of the barlow servants who was there at the time it seems abigail did her best to take care of the boy even after his death she had the servants search his pockets and they found some letters she wrote to his parents and arranged for his body to be taken back home for burial i never knew that regan murmured abigail kept it as quiet as possible likely to avoid her husbands wrath the boys name was gray franklin gray corporal csa and he never saw his nineteenth birthday some people hear the shot and weeping cassie thats devins wife runs the inn for us she can tell you more id like to see the place tomorrow if i can and the woods i need to see the farm too the other corporal name unknown was buried by the mackades i hope to find out more my equipment should be here by late tomorrow or the next day equipment rafe asked sensors cameras temperature gauges parapsychology is best approached as a science tell me have there been any reports of telekinetic activities the movement of inanimate objects poltergeists no regan gave a quick shudder and im sure wed have heard well i can always hope baffled regan stared at her you used to be so seriousminded i still am believe me im very serious about this okay with a quick shake of her head regan rose and i better get serious about dinner ill give you a hand regan arched a brow as rebecca stood dont tell me you learned to cook in europe too no i cant boil an egg you used to say it was genetic i remember now i think its just a phobia cookings a dangerous business sharp edges heat flame but i remember how to set a table good enough late that night when rebecca settled into her room she snuggled up on the big padded window seat with a book and a cup of regans tea from down the hall she dimly heard the sound of a babys fretful crying then footsteps padding down the hall within moments the quiet returned as rebecca imagined regan nursed the baby shed never imagined the regan bishop shed known as a mother in college regan had always been bright energetic interested in everyone and everything of course shed attracted male companionship rebecca remembered with a small smile a woman who looked like regan would always draw men but it was not merely regans beauty but her way with people that had made her so popular with both men and women and rebecca dowdy seriousminded outofplace rebecca had been so shocked and so dazzled when regan offered her friendship shed been so miserably shy rebecca thought now staring dreamily out the window while the cup warmed her hands still was she admitted beneath the veneer shed developed in recent months shed had no social skills whatsoever then and no defense against the fastmoving college scene except for regan who had found it natural to take a young awkward unattractive girl under her wing it was something rebecca would never forget and sitting there in the lovely guest room with its big fourposter and lovely globe lamps she was deeply warmly happy that regan had found such a wonderful life a man who adored her obviously rebecca thought anyone could see rafes love for his wife every time he looked in her direction a strong handsome fascinating man two delightful children a successful business a beautiful home yes she was thrilled to find regan so content as for herself contentment had been eluding her of late academia which had encompassed her all her life had lately become more of a prison than a home and in truth it was the only home she had ever known yet shed fled from it for a few months at least she felt compelled to explore facets of herself other than her intellect she wanted feelings emotions passions she wanted to take risks make mistakes do foolish and exciting things perhaps it was the dreams those odd recurring dreams that had influenced her whatever it was the fact that her closest friend had settled in antietam a place of history and legend had been too tempting to resist it not only gave her the opportunity to visit and recement an important relationship it offered her the chance to delve more deeply into a hobby that was quickly becoming a compulsion she couldnt really put her finger on when and how the study of the paranormal had begun to appeal to her it seemed to have been a gradual thing an article here a question there then of course the dreams they had started several years before odd little snippets of imagery that had seemed like memories over time the dreams had lengthened and increased in clarity and shed begun to document them after all as a psychiatrist she understood the value of dreams as a scientist she respected the strength of the unconscious shed approached the entire matter as she would any project in an organized precise and objective manner but her objectivity had been systematically overcome by pure curiosity so she was here was it coincidence imagination or fate that made her believe shed come to a place she was meant to come to had been drawn to she would see meanwhile she would enjoy it the time with regan the beauty of the countryside the professional and personal delight of standing on historic land she would indulge herself in her hobby work on her confidence and explore the possibilities she thought shed done well with shane mackade there had been a time not so terribly long ago when she would have stammered and flushed or mumbled and hunched her shoulders in the presence of a man that male her tongue would have thickened and tied itself into knots at the terrifying prospect of making conversation that wasnt academic in nature but shed not only talked with him shed held her own and for the most part shed felt comfortable doing so shed even joked with him and she thought she might try her hand at flirting next what could it hurt after all amused at the idea she got up and climbed under the weddingring quilt she didnt feel like reading and refused to feel guilty that she wasnt going to end the day with some intellectual stimulus instead she closed her eyes and enjoyed the feel of the smooth sheets against her skin the soft cushiony give of downfilled pillows under her cheek the spicy scent of the bouquet in the vase on the dresser across the room she was teaching herself to take time to enjoy textures scents sounds just now she could hear the wind sigh against the windows the creak and groan of boards settling the gentle swish of her leg moving over the sheet small things she thought with a smile ghosting around her mouth the small things she had never taken time to appreciate the new rebecca knight took the time and appreciated very much before snuggling deeper she reached out to switch the lamp off in the dark she let her mind wander to what pleasures she might explore the next day a trip to the inn certainly she was looking forward to seeing the haunted house meeting cassie mackade and devin she mused he was the brother married to the inns manager he was also the sheriff she mused probably a good man to know with luck they would have a room for her and she could set up her equipment as soon as it arrived but even if not she was sure she could arrange for a tour of the inn and add some stories to her file she wanted a walk in the woods again reputedly haunted she hoped someone could point out the area where the two corporals had supposedly met and fought the way regan had explained the layout rebecca thought she might slip through the woods and get a firsthand look at the mackade farm she wanted badly to see if she had a reaction to it the way she had when shane drove by the land that bordered the road so familiar she thought sleepily the trees and rocks the gurgle of the creek all so oddly familiar it could be explained she supposed she had visited the battlefield years before she remembered walking the fields studying the monuments reenacting every step of the engagement in her head she didnt remember passing that particular stretch of road but she might have while she was tucked into the back seat of the family car being quizzed by her parents no the woods wouldnt have beckoned to her then she would have been too busy absorbing data analyzing it and reporting it to take note of the shape and color of the leaves the sound of the creek hurrying over rocks she would make up for that tomorrow she would make up for a great many things so she drifted into sleep dreaming of possibilities it was terrible terrible to hear the sounds of war it was heartwrenching to know that so many young men were fighting dying dying as her johnnie had her tall beautiful son who would never smile at her again never sneak into the kitchen for an extra biscuit as the sounds of battle echoed in the distance sarah forced back fear forced herself to go on with the routine of stirring the stew she had simmering over the fire and to remind herself that she had had johnnie for eighteen wonderful years no one could take her memories of him away god had also given her two beautiful daughters and that was a comfort she worried about her husband she knew he ached for their dead son every day every night the battle that had come so frighteningly close to home was only one more cruel reminder of what war cost he was such a good man she thought wiping her hands on her apron her john was strong and kind and her love for him was as full and rich as it had been twenty years before when she took his ring and his name and she never doubted his love for her after all these years her heart still leaped when he walked into the room and her needs still jumped whenever he turned to her in the night she knew all women werent as fortunate but she worried about him he didnt laugh as freely since the terrible day theyd gotten word that johnnie had been lost at bull run there were lines around his eyes and a bitterness in them that hadnt been there before johnnie had gone for the south rashly idealistically and his father had been so proud of him it was true enough that in this border state of maryland there were southern sympathizers and families ripped in two as they chose sides but there had been no sides in the mackade family johnnie had made his choice with his fathers support and the choice had killed him it was that she feared most that john blamed himself as well as the yankees that he would never be able to forgive either one and would never be truly at peace again she knew that if it hadnt been for her and the girls he would have left the farm to fight it frightened her that there was the need inside him to take up arms to kill it was the one thing in their lives they never discussed she arched her back placing the flat of her hand at the base of her spine to ease a dull ache it reassured her to hear her daughters talking as they peeled potatoes and carrots for the stew she understood that their incessant chatter was to help block the nerves that jumped at hearing mortar fire echo in the air theyd lost half a cornfield this morning the fighting had come that close she thanked god it had veered off again and she wasnt huddled in the root cellar with her children that john was safe she couldnt bear to lose another she loved when john came in she poured him coffee there was such weariness in his face she set the cup aside and went over to wrap her arms around him instead he smelled of hay and animals and sweat and his arms were strong as they returned the embrace its moving off sarah his lips brushed her cheek i dont want you fretting im not fretting then she smiled as he arched one silverflecked black brow only a little he brushed his thumb under her eye over the shadows that haunted there more than a little damn war damn yankees what gives them the right to come on my land and do their killing bastards he turned away and picked up his coffee sarah sent her daughters a look that had them getting up quietly and leaving the room theyre going now she murmured the firing is getting farther and farther away it cant last much longer he knew she wasnt talking about this one battle and shook his head the bitterness was back in his eyes itll last as long as they want it to last as long as men have sons to die i need to go check things he set down the coffee without having tasted it i dont want you or the girls setting foot out of the house john she reached for his hand holding the hard callused palm against hers what could she say that there was no one to blame of course there was but the men who manufactured war and death were nameless and faceless to her instead she brought his hand to her cheek i love you sarah for a moment for her his eyes softened pretty sarah his lips brushed hers before he left her in sleep rebecca stirred shifted and murmured john left the house knowing there was little he could do in the distance drying cornstalks were blackened and hacked he knew there would be blood seeping into his ground and didnt want to know whether the men who had died there had been taken away yet or not it was his land his damn them when he plowed in the spring he knew he would be haunted by the blood and death he turned into the earth he reached into his pocket closing his hand over the miniature of his son that he always carried he didnt weep his eyes were dry and hard as they scanned the land without the land he was nothing without sarah he would be lost without his daughters he would willingly die but now he had no choice but to live without his boy grimfaced he stood there his hands in his pockets his eyes on his land when he heard the whimpering his brows drew together hed already checked the stock secured them had he missed a calf or had one of his dogs broken out of the stall hed locked them in to keep them from being hit by a stray bullet he followed the sound to the smokehouse afraid he would have a wounded animal to tend or put down though hed been a farmer all his life he still was struck with guilt and grief whenever it was necessary to put an animal out of its misery but it wasnt an animal it was a man a damn bluebelly bleeding his guts out on mackade land for an instant he felt a hot rush of pleasure die here he thought die here the way my son died on another mans land you might have been the one to kill him without sympathy he used his boot to shove the man over onto his back the union uniform was filthy soaked with blood he was glad to see it coldly thrilled then he saw the face and it wasnt a man it was a boy his soft cheeks were gray with pain his eyes glazed with it then they fixed on johns daddy daddy i came home i aint your daddy boy the eyes closed help me please help me im dying in sleep shanes fist curled in the sheets and his restless body tangled them chapter three it was one of the most exciting moments of rebeccas life just to stand in the balmy air a vivid blue sky overhead and the old stone house spreading out in front of her she could smell early mums the spice of them mixing with the fragrance of the latesummer roses shed studied architecture for a time and shed seen firsthand the majestic cathedrals in france the romantic villas of italy the ancient and glorious ruins of greece but this threestory building of native stone and wood with its neat chimneys and sparkling glass touched her as deeply as her first sight of the spires of notre dame it was after all haunted she wished she could feel it wished some part of her was open to the shadows and whispers of the restless dead she believed her dedication to science had taught her that there was much that was unexplained in the world and as a scientist whenever she heard of some unexplained phenomenon she needed to know what how when who had seen it felt it heard it and whether she could see feel hear it was like that with the old barlow house now the mackade inn if she hadnt heard the stories didnt trust regan implicitly rebecca would have merely seen a beautiful house an inviting one with its long double porches and delightful gardens she would have wondered how it was furnished inside what view she might have from the windows she might have pondered a bit over who had lived there what they had been where they had gone but she knew all that already she had spent a great deal of time researching the original owners and their descendants now she was here walking toward that inviting porch with regan beside her and her heart drummed in her breast its really beautiful regan you should have seen it before regan scanned the house the land with pride poor old place falling apart broken windows sagging porches and inside she shook her head i have to say even though he is my husband rafe has a real talent for seeing what could be then making it happen he didnt do it alone no her lips curved as she reached for the door i did one hell of a job she opened the door see for yourself one hell of a job rebecca thought beautiful wide planked floors gleamed gold with polish and sunlight silkcovered walls elegantly trimmed antiques both delicate and majestic were placed in a perfect harmony that looked too natural to have been planned she turned into the doorway of the front parlor with its curvy doublebacked settee and adam fireplace atop its carved pine mantel were gorgeous twin vases holding tall spires of larkspur and freesia and flanking silverframed tintypes you expect to hear the swish of hooped skirts rebecca murmured that was the idea all of the furnishings all of the color schemes are from the civil war era even the bathrooms and kitchen reflect the feeling even if they are modernized for comfort and convenience you must have worked like fiends i guess we did regan said reflectively mostly it didnt seem like work at all thats the way it is i suppose when youre dazzled by that first explosion of love explosion rebecca smiled as she turned back sounds scary and violent it was theres very little calm before or after the storm when youre dealing with a mackade and apparently thats just the way you like it apparently it is whod have thought well to tell you the truth i always imagined youd end up with some sophisticated streamlined sort of man who played squash to keep in shape glad i was wrong so am i regan said heartily then shook her head squash or polo maybe a rousing game of tennis rebeccas laugh gurgled out well regan you were always so tidy and chic she lifted a brow and gestured to indicate the knife pleat in regans navy trousers the polished buttons on the doublebreasted blazer still are im sure you mean that in the most flattering way regan said dryly absolutely i used to think if i could just wear the kind of clothes you did do get my hair to swing just that way i wouldnt feel like such a nerd you were not a nerd i could have given lessons in the art but she ran a hand down the side of her unconstructed jacket im learning to disguise it i thought i heard voices rebecca looked toward the stairs and saw a small slim blonde with a baby snuggled into a sack strapped over her breasts rebeccas first impression was of quiet competence perhaps it was the hands she mused one lying neatly on the polished rail the other gently cupping the babys bottom i wondered if you were upstairs regan walked over to get a peek at the sleeping baby cassie youve been changing linens with the baby again i like to get it done early and ally was fussy this must be your friend rebecca knight girl genius regan said with an affection that made rebecca grin rather than wince cassandra mackade irreplaceable manager of the mackade inn im so glad to meet you cassie took her hand off the rail to offer it ive been looking forward to coming here for weeks this must be quite a job managing all this it hardly ever feels like one youll want to look around im dying to ill just finish upstairs give me a call if you need anything theres coffee fresh in the kitchen and muffins of course there is regan laughed and brushed a hand over allys dark hair take a break cassie and join the tour rebecca wants stories well cassie glanced upstairs obviously worrying over unmade beds id really appreciate it rebecca put in regan tells me youve had some experiences id be interested in hearing about you actually saw a ghost i cassie flushed it wasnt something she told many people about not because it was odd but because it was intimate im hoping to document and record episodes while im here rebecca said prompting her yes regan told me so cassie took a deep breath i saw the man abigail barlow was in love with he spoke to me fascinating was all rebecca could think as they wandered through the inn with cassie telling her story in a calm quiet voice she learned of heartbreak and murder love lost and lives ruined she felt chills bubble along her skin at the descriptions of spirits wandering but she felt no deep stirring of connectedness an interest yes and a fullblooded curiosity but no sense of intimacy shed hoped for it she could admit to herself later as she wandered alone toward the woods that she had hoped for a personal experience a viewing or at least a sensing of some unexplainable phenomenon her interest in the paranormal had grown over the years along with her frustration at having no intimate touch with it except in dreams and rebecca knew they were merely the work of the subconscious sometimes fraught with symbolism sometimes as simple as a thought shed never been touched by the otherworldly though the house had unquestionably been lovely though it had brought back echoes of a lost past she had seen only the beauty of it whatever walked there had not spoken to her she still had hope her equipment would be in by the end of the day and cassie had assured her she was welcome to set up in a bedroom at least for a few days as the anniversary of the battle drew nearer the inn would be full with reservations already booked but she had some time when she stepped into the woods rebecca felt a chill but it was only from the thick shade here she knew two young boys had fought essentially killing each other others had sensed their lingering presence heard the clash of bayonets the cries of pain and shock but she didnt she heard the call of birds the rustle of squirrels scrambling for nuts to hoard the faint buzz of insects the day was too still for the air to stir the leaves and the leaves themselves were a deep green not even hinting of the autumn that would come within a month following cassies competent directions she found the stand of rocks where the two corporals were reputed to have met sitting down on one she took out her notebook and began to write what she would transpose onto a computer disk later there have been only mild and perhaps selfinduced sensations of deja vu nothing that equals that one swift and stunning emotion at seeing the edge of the mackade farm from the road its wonderful seeing regan again being able to view firsthand her happiness her family i think it must be true that there is indeed the perfect mate for some people regan has certainly found hers in rafe mackade theres a sense of strength of self an arrogance an underlying potential for physical action in him thats oddly appealing particularly i would think to a female offsetting it perhaps enhancing it is his obvious love and devotion to his wife and his children theyve made a good life and the inn they have created is successful due to their vision its location and history of course add to its success undoubtedly their choice of chatelaine was also inspired i found cassie mackade to be competent organized and anything but aloof theres a i want to say innocence about her yet she is a grown woman with three children a demanding job and from what regan has related to me a miserable past perhaps sweetness is more accurate in any case i liked her immediately and felt very much at ease with her this ease isnt something that i feel with a great many people im looking forward to meeting devin mackade her husband who is also the sheriff of antietam it will be interesting to see how much he resembles his brothers not only physically but in that less tangible but equally strong aspect of personality shane mackade has a personality that is impossible to forget that arrogance again though he is perhaps a bit more goodnatured than his older brother rafe i would theorize that shane is a man who has great success with women not only due to his unquestionably stunning looks but theres also a high degree of charm and a blatant sexuality is it an earthiness i wonder and if so is it due to his choice of profession i found myself attracted in an immediate way id not experienced before all in all it wasnt an unpleasant sensation but one i believe it would be wise to keep to myself i dont think a man like shane needs any sort of encouragement rebecca stopped frowned shook her head her notes she thought with some amusement were anything but scientific then again she mused this was more a personal journal of a personal odyssey in any case i experienced nothing out of the ordinary during my tour of the mackade inn cassie and regan showed me the bridal suite which had once been abigail barlows room a room where she had lived in virtual seclusion the last years of her life a room where she had died in cassies opinion by her own hand out of despair i walked through the masters room charles barlows room into the nursery that is now a charming bedroom and sitting area i explored the library where both regan and cassie claim to have had strong experiences of a paranormal nature i dont doubt their word i merely envy their openness to such things it seems that despite my efforts to the contrary i remain too rooted in the rational here in woods that have been haunted for more than a century i feel only the cool shade see only the trees and rocks perhaps technology will help me ill see when my equipment arrives in the meantime i have an urge to see the mackade farm im not sure of my welcome my impression was that shane is as closedminded about the paranormal as i am determined to experience it but welcome or not ill cut through the woods as cassie instructed me if nothing else it will be interesting to see the ins and outs of a working farm firsthand and on a personal note it wont be a hardship to get another closeup look at the farmer he is quite beautiful smiling to herself rebecca folded her notebook slipped it back in her shoulder bag she thought shane would probably enjoy being called beautiful she imagined he was used to it her first glimpse of the farmhouse came across a fallow field that smelled strongly of manure she didnt mind the scent in fact it intrigued her but she was careful to watch where she walked it was a peaceful scene blue sky puffy harmless clouds an old spreading willow gracefully draped near a narrow creek at least she assumed there was a creek to her right as the sound of gurgling water came across clearly she saw stands of corn row after row spearing up to the sun fields of grain going gold there was a big weathered barn with those odd windows that looked like eyes and a pale blue tower she assumed was a silo more silos sheds paddocks and pens cows she thought with the ridiculous grin of the urbanite at the sight of them grazing in a green field with rocks scattered gray throughout the pasture from a distance it was a postcard a quiet and remote rural scene that looked as though it were always just so and the house she thought at the core of it her heart was beating fast and sharply before she realized it she stopped where she was breathing carefully as she studied the house it was stone probably from the same quarry as the inn in this building the stone looked less elegant more sturdy and simple the windows were boxy and plain in the twostory structure and the wide rear porch was a faded gray wood she wondered if there was a front porch and assumed there was there would be a rocker on it perhaps two there would be an overhang for shade and to keep the rain off during a storm so that you could sit out and watch the clouds roll in through a buzzing in her head she heard the barking of dogs but it barely registered she studied the chimneys then the gray shutters that she was sure were functional rather than merely decorative she could almost picture herself reaching out drawing them in to secure the house against the nights chillstoking the kitchen fire so that there would still be embers in the morning for a moment the house was so clear almost stark in its lines and colors against the sky it might have been a photograph then she blinked and let out the breath she hadnt been aware she was holding that was it of course she realized a photograph regan had described the farm to her given her such a detailed picture of it rebecca decided it was her own memory of that and her ability to project and retain that made it all so familiar so eerily familiar she laughed at herself and continued to walk hesitating only briefly when two large yellow dogs bounded toward her regan had told her shane had dogs the parents of regans golden retriever rebecca didnt mind animals actually she rather liked them in a distant sort of way but obviously these dogs had no intention of keeping their distance they raced around her barking tongues lolling tails batting back and forth in a flurry of fur nice dogs at least she hoped they were and held out a testing hand when her fingers were sniffed then licked lavishly rather than taken off at the knuckle she relaxed nice dogs she repeated more firmly and drummed up the nerve to rub each yellow head nice big dogs fred and ethel right in agreement each dog gave a throaty bark and raced back toward the house taking that as an invitation rebecca followed pigs she thought and stopped by the pen to study them clinically they werent nearly as sloppy as shed imagined but they were certainly larger than shed imagined a pig to be when they grunted and snorted and crowded near the fence where she stood she grinned she was bending down to stick a hand through the slats of the fence to test the texture of pig hide when a voice stopped her theyll bite her hand snapped back out like a rocket there was shane standing two yards away carrying a very large wrench her mind went utterly blank it wasnt fear though he did look dangerous it was she would realize later absolute sexual shock there were smears of grease on his arms arms that gleamed with sweat and rippled with muscle arms she thought dazedly that were stunningly naked he wore a thin tankstyle undershirt that had probably once been white it was a dull washedout gray now snug ripped and tucked into lowslung jeans that were worn white at the knees he had a blue bandanna wrapped around his forehead as a sweatband with all that wonderful black hair curling over it in a glorious tangle and he was smiling a smile rebecca was sure that reflected an easy knowledge of his effect on the female system bite she repeated fighting off the erotic cloud that covered her like fine rain thats right sweetie he tucked the wrench into his back pocket as he walked to her she looked so cute he thought standing there in her shapeless jacket those gold eyes squinting against the sun theyre greedy if you dont have food in your hand when you stick it in theyll make do with your fingers casually he took her hand in his examined her fingers one by one nice fingers too long and slim yours are dirty she was amazed the words didnt come out in a croak ive been working so i see she managed a friendly smile as she drew her hand free i dont mean to interrupt its all right he ruffled the dogs who had come back to join the company the rake needed some adjustment thats all her brows shot up you get that dirty fixing a rake his dimple flashed im not talking about a stick with tines on the end city girl been over to the inn yes i met cassie she showed me through shes going to give me a lift back to regans when im ready since i was in the neighborhood she trailed off and looked back into the pen ive never seen pigs close up i wondered what they felt like mostly they feel like eating then he smiled again theyre bristly he told her like a stiff brush not very pettable oh she would have liked to see for herself but wanted to keep her fingers just as they were instead she turned around and took a long scan of the farm its quite a place why havent you planted anything over there land needs to rest for a season now and again he glanced toward the fallow field near the woods you dont really want a lecture on crop rotation do you maybe she smiled but not right now so he laid a hand on the fence beside her a standard flirtation ploy rebecca thought and told herself she was above such maneuvers what do you want a look around if i wouldnt be in your way instinct urged her to hunch her shoulders shift away but she kept her chin up and her eyes on his pretty women arent ever in the way he took off the bandanna used it to wipe his hands before sticking it in his pocket come on before she could evade or think to he had her hand in his the texture of his palm registered hard rough with calluses strong as they skirted around a shed she had a glimpse of a large dangerouslooking piece of machinery with wicked teeth thats a rake he said mildly what were you doing to it fixing it he headed toward the barn most city people he knew wanted to see a barn but when they passed the chicken coop she stopped you raise chickens too for eggs for eggs sure and for eating her skin went faintly green you eat your own chickens sweetie at least i know what goes into my own why would i pick up a pack of chicken parts at the market she made some sound and looked back over her shoulder toward the pigpen reading her perfectly shane grinned want to stay for dinner no thank you she said faintly he just couldnt help himself ever been to a hog butchering its quite an event real social we usually hold one out here once a year hook it up with a fundraiser for the fire department hog butchering and allyoucaneat pancake breakfast she pressed a hand to her unsteady stomach youre making that up nope you havent tasted sausage until im thinking about becoming a vegetarian she said quickly but pulled herself together that was nicely done farm boy it was a little too hard to resist appreciating her quick recovery he gave her hand a quick squeeze you had this look in your eyes like you were calculating every squeal and cluck filing it away somewhere for a report on the average american farm maybe i was she shielded her eyes with the flat of her hand so that she could study his face he really was a most remarkablelooking male details interest me so do reports enough details and you have a report a good report equals a clear picture seems to me somebody whos into details reports and clear pictures wouldnt be out chasing ghosts if scientists hadnt been interested in explaining the unknown youd still be working your land with a stone ax and offering sacrifices to the sun god with that she stepped into the barn stalls and concrete floors that sloped hay motes of dust that tickled the nose the light was dimmer here and the scent of animal stronger rebecca strolled toward the stalls then let out a shriek as an enormous bovine head poked over a door and mooed at her shes got an infection shane said and wisely disguised a chuckle with a cough had to separate her from the rest of the stock rebeccas heart was slowly making its way from her throat back down to its proper place oh shes huge actually shes on the small side you can touch her here top of the head taking rebeccas reluctant hand he held it between his and the cow rebecca was hardpressed to decide which texture was tougher will she be all right yeah shes coming along you treat the stock yourself dont you use a vet not for every little thing he liked the feel of her hand under his the way it tensed then slowly relaxed the way her fingers were spread now and stroking curiously over the uninterested cow you dont run to the doctor every time you sneeze do you no she smiled turned her head but i dont imagine you can find cow antibiotics at the local pharmacy feed and grain store carries most of what you need but what he was interested in at the moment was the way she looked at him so cool so objective she presented a challenge he couldnt resist deliberately he skimmed his gaze down to her mouth what do you do with all those degrees regan says you have collect them with an effort she kept her voice light and use them like building blocks to get to the next why because knowledge is power remembering that and using the knowledge that he was teasing her with his easy sexuality gave her the power to step aside you know i am interested in the farm itself and when weve got more time i hope youll show me more of it but what id really like to see now is the house and the kitchen where the young soldier died we mopped up the blood a long time ago thats good to hear she cocked her head is there a problem yeah there was a problem there were a couple of them the first was that she was flicking him off as if he were a fly regan asked me to cooperate so i will for her but i dont much care for the idea of you poking around my house looking for ghosts certainly youre not afraid of what i might find im not afraid of anything shed touched a nerve a raw one i said i just dont like it why dont we go in you can offer me a cold drink and well see if we can come to some sort of compromise it was hard to argue with reason he took her hand again more out of habit than in flirtation by the time they reached the back door hed decided to give flirtation another shot she smelled damn good for a scientist hed never kissed a scientist he mused unless you counted bess trulane the dental hygienist he had a feeling that cool sarcastic mouth of rebeccas would be quite tasty got some iced tea he offered great it was all she said as she stood just inside the door looking around with dark seeking eyes something she was sure there was something here some sensation just out of reach blocked she thought by that almost overpowering male aura shane exuded it clouded things she thought annoyed it certainly clouded the brain but there was something here amid the scrubbed tiles the spotless counters the old but sparkling appliances it was a goodsize kitchen homey with its glassfronted cupboards showing the everyday dishes what she imagined one would call a family kitchenplenty of elbow room big wooden table sturdy chairs with cane seats the morning paper was still on the table where he had left it she supposed after reading it with his morning coffee there were little pots of green plants on the windowsill she recognized them by scent as well as sight rosemary basil thyme the man grew herbs in his kitchen it would have made her smile if she hadnt been trying to get beyond him into what the room held for her shane held two glasses filled with golden tea as he frowned at her those eyes of hers were sharp as alert as a does and her shoulders under that oversize jacket were stiff as boards it made him nervous and just a little angry that she was studying his things and seeing something that he didnt never seen a kitchen before pasting a cool smile on her face she turned to him she needed to be alone here she decided a few minutes alone and maybe she would get beyond that block its amazingly sexist of me but i didnt expect to find it so tidy and organized you know the cheerful bachelor living alone entertaining willing women and poker buddies this time he lifted a brow i dont usually entertain them at the same time he handed her the glass my mother was pretty fierce about keeping the kitchen clean you eat here you cook here its like making sure the milk house is sanitized the milk house it had a charming sound to it id like to see that next time come by about am you can see it in operation dont you want to take off that jacket its warm and he wanted to see what was under it im fine she moved to the back window lovely view all the windows ive looked out of since ive been here have lovely views do you get immune to them no you get proprietary to please himself he skimmed a finger over the back of her neck she went as still as a stone youve got pretty hair rebecca at least what there is of it of course chopped off like this it shows the line of your neck and its a nice neck long and white and smooth she recited a chunk of the periodic table in her head so that she was calm when she turned to him thinking it a defense rather than a challenge she cocked a brow and her lips curved into an amused smile are you hitting on me farm boy damned if he didnt want a piece of her he realized with more than a little irritation he particularly wanted that piece that made her voice so cool and smug ive got a curiosity he set his glass on the counter behind her then took hers and placed it beside his in a smooth wellpracticed move he caged her in dont you scientists are innately curious he could smell her now clean clear soap and a hint of citrus how about an experiment she refused to fumble to stammer to let him see even for an instant that she was in way way over her head of what sort well i do this chapter four he circled her waist with his hands a surprisingly small waist then ran them up her ribs over to skim up her back the punch of arousal wasnt particularly surprising hed certainly felt it before but he hadnt expected quite the force of this not with her still he enjoyed it slid comfortably into it when she didnt object in fact didnt move a muscle he aligned his body to hers until he felt her curves not much in the way of curves meet the angles of his suddenly he really wanted to kiss her to have a good solid taste of that mouth not simply because it was female and thus desirable but because it was rebeccas and set in firm almost disapproving lines he enjoyed being disapproved of but when he started to lower his head she lifted her chin just enough to put him offbalance an experiment whats your hypothesis huh your hypothesis she repeated relieved to have interrupted him shed have time enough to brace now she decided time to prepare herself your theory as to the outcome of your experiment theory huh he kept his eyes on her mouth it was a truly fascinating pair of lips if a man took the time to really look at them how about mutual enjoyment is that good enough doc sure she was careful not to gulp it would have been embarrassing and certainly would have ruined her attempt at cool sophistication why not you want to kiss me farm boy go ahead i was going to but he bypassed her mouth just for a moment and closed his teeth lightly over her jaw she had the cutest little pointed chin then he touched his lips to hers just a whisper he always liked to draw the pleasure out for himself and the woman involved he nibbled at them testing their shape their softness and found them delightfully full delightfully moist and giving perhaps that was why he stopped thinking long enough to lose himself to sink into that soft wet mouth to trace it with his tongue tease her cool lips apart and explore dark and deep was her taste yet oddly familiar he wondered how it could be that he was kissing her for the first time yet he could be sure deadly sure that he had experienced her taste before and the familiarity was impossibly exciting desperately arousing she was so tiny taut little muscles slim back small firm breasts yielding erotically against him and the flavor of her a cool damp meadow a quiet shadowy glade stirred his blood stirred it so that several dizzy minutes passed before he realized she hadnt moved she wasnt touching him her lips werent sliding under his she had made not one single sound the absolute absence of response was as effective as a slap he stepped back the first movement jerky before he could get a hold of himself with his brows drawn together hard he studied her passive face the faintly interested eyes the amused quirk of that luscious mouth that was very nice she said in a tone so mild he nearly snarled was that your best shot he only stared at her his gorgeous seatoned eyes molten he could handle rejection a woman had every right to reject a mans advances but he wouldnt tolerate snickering and damn it he knew she was snickering under that placid exterior to keep from humiliating himself further he latched tight to control without it he would have hauled her into his arms again and loosed some of the hot violent passion shed managed to incite in him without the least effort lets just say as experiments go that one was a dud ive got work to do with some dignity he nodded toward the wall phone go ahead and give cass a call whenever youre done here thanks see you tonight at dinner at the door he turned glared at her she continued to stand there leaning back against the counter her pretty cap of hair wasnt even mussed youre a cool one rebecca so im told thanks for the drink farm boy and the experiment the moment the door slammed behind him she sagged against the counter she wanted to sit but was very much afraid her legs would buckle before she managed to cross the three feet of tile to a chair shed never known that anyone anywhere could kiss like that her head was still reeling now that she was alone she pressed a hand to her jumping heart and took several long deep breaths that echoed in the room like those of a diver hitting the surface that was apt she supposed she felt as though shed been dragged into some deep dark airless space and escaped just in the nick of time obviously the man was a danger to female society no woman could be safe around him she picked up her drink watched the ice cubes clink musically together as she brought it to her assaulted lips with a shaky hand but shed held together she reminded herself held herself aloof and distant by desperately reciting henry vs st crispins day speech god knew where that had come from but it had kept her from whimpering like a starving puppy true shed begun to lose her concentration by the time she reached we few we happy few but then shane had ended it if hed kept it up for another ten seconds shed never have finished the speech unless it was in incoherent mewings oh boy she managed now and downed every drop in the glass the chilly tea cooled the heat in her throat if not in her blood this kind of passion was a new experience she imagined shane mackade would hoot in unholy amusement if he knew just how violently hed affected her her dr rebecca knight professional genius perennial virgin she could congratulate herself that shed maintained her composure that shed maintained at least the appearance of composure while the top of her head was spinning around a good six inches above her cranium if he had even a hint of her stupidity in the ways of men and women the slightest clue of her dazzled reaction to him personally he would certainly press his advantage not only would she get nothing done during her stay she was dead certain she would leave with a bruised heart she was sure wiser women than she had fallen hard for the charm of shane mackade that kind of chemistry could only result in fiery explosions the safest position was to keep herself aloof to annoy him if and when it was necessary and never to let him know she was attracted safe rebecca thought with a sigh as she set her empty glass in the sink she had good reason to know just how tedious safety could be but she had come to antietam to prove something to herself to explore possibilities and to add to her reputation shane wasnt a part of the plan his house was however she drew another deep breath tried to settle her jolted nerves there was something here for her she was sure of it she couldnt feel it now not when her system was sparkling like hot naked wires she would have to come back she decided she would have to come back and make sure she had time to explore the possibilities here the only way to manage that she decided was to simultaneously charm shane and keep him at arms length dinner at regans would be a good start it seemed to rebecca that there were children everywhere babies toddlers older kids all going about the business of cooing squabbling racing toys were spread all over the living room rug where regans nate could compete with his cousin layla for the best and brightest building block she knew who belonged to whom now layla who held her own with her slightly older cousin belonged to jared and savannah as did the slim darkhaired boy bryan she knew jared was the oldest of the mackade brothers a lawyer who seemed very at home in his loosened tie his wife was quite possibly the most stunning woman rebecca had ever seen hugely pregnant her thick black hair twisted back in a braid dark eyes sultry and amused savannah looked to rebeccas mind like some wellsatisfied fertility goddess connor was about bryans age as fair as his cousin was dark and with cassies slow shy warmth in his eyes there was emma a golden pixie of about seven who squeezed into the chair beside her stepfather rebecca found it both sweet and telling to see the easy way devin mackades arm curled around the little girl while he held his sleeping baby in the crook of the other wild and tough the mackade brothers might be but rebecca had never seen any men so deeply entrenched in family so what do you think of antietam so far rafe stepped expertly over dog toys and children to top off rebeccas glass of wine i think a lot of it she said and flashed him a quick smile its charming quiet bursting with history he cocked a brow haunted no one seems to doubt it she cast an amused look at shane whod settled down next to savannah to pat her belly almost no one some people block their imagination casually savannah shifted shanes hand to the left where the baby was kicking vigorously there are some places in this area with very strong memories it was an intriguing way of putting it rebecca mused memories savannah shrugged violent death and violent unhappiness leave marks deep ones of course thats not very scientific that would depend on what theory you subscribe to rebecca answered i guess weve all had some experience with the ghosts or leftover energy or whatever you choose to call it jared began speak for yourself shane tipped back his beer i dont go around talking to people who arent there jared only grinned hes still ticked off about when i scared the hell out of him when we were kids spending the night in the old barlow place recognizing the look in shanes eye devin decided to step in as peacemaker scared the hell out of all of us he said rattling chains creaking boards i imagine youre looking for something a little more subtle rebecca well im certainly looking it surprised and pleased her when nate toddled over and crawled into her lap she hadnt been around children enough to know whether she appealed to them or they to her im anxious to get started she added as nate toyed with the tourmaline pendant she wore dinner in five regan announced her face prettily flushed as she hurried in from the kitchen lets round up these kids rafe jasons asleep i already put him down ill get layla shane shot savannah a wicked grin its going to take jared at least five minutes to haul you up from the couch jared make sure you punch him after we eat done jared assured his wife and rose to help her up as exits went it was a noisy one as was the meal that followed the big dining room with its tall windows held them all comfortably the long cherrywood table generous enough to make room for the necessary high chairs the choice of spaghetti with marinara sauce platters of antipasto and crusty bread was rebecca thought inspired there was enough for an army and the troops dug in she wasnt used to family meals to spilled milk scattershot conversations arguments or the general friendly mess of it all it made her feel like an observer again but not unhappily so a new experience she thought one to be enjoyed as well as assessed she found it oddly stimulating that while not everyone talked about the same things they usually talked at the same time both toddlers smeared sauce lavishly on themselves and over their trays more than once during the meal she felt the warm brush of fur against her legs as the dog searched hopefully for dropped noodles or handouts she couldnt quite keep up as conversations veered from baseball to the latesummer harvest from teething to town gossip with a variety of unconnected subjects in between it dazzled her her memories of family dinners were of quiet structured affairs one topic of conversation was introduced and discussed calmly and in depth for the course of the meal and the meal would last precisely one hour like a class rebecca mused now a wellorganized wellconstructed and wellordered class at the end of which she would be firmly dismissed to attend to her other studies as the careless confusion swirled around her she found herself miserably unhappy with the memory eat what distracted she turned her head and found a forkful of pasta at her lips automatically she opened her mouth and accepted it that was easy shane rolled another forkful held it out try again i can feed myself thanks struggling with embarrassment she scooped up spaghetti you werent he pointed out you were too busy looking around like youd just landed on an alien planet he reached for the wine bottle and topped off her glass before she could stop him she never drank more than two glasses in an evening is that what the mackades look like from a scientific viewpoint they look interesting she said coolly from any viewpoint how does it feel to be a member of such a dynamic family never thought about it everyone thinks of family where they come from how they fit in or dont its just the way it is shane helped himself to another generous serving from the communal pot but as the youngest youd are you analyzing me doc dont we need a couch and a fiftyminute clock im just making conversation somehow she realized shed gotten out of rhythm and shed been doing so well she made an effort to settle herself took a slow sip of wine why dont you tell me about this hay youre going to mow he angled his head he knew when a woman was yanking his chain and he knew how to tug back ill have the mower out tomorrow you can come on by and see for yourself maybe lend a hand i can always use an extra pair of arms even skinny ones that sounds fascinating but im going to be busy my equipment came in she twirled her fork and neatly nipped pasta from the tines but later on when i set up at your place im sure i can find the time now and then to help you out in fact im looking forward to observing you in your natural milieu is that right he shifted turning to face her the hand he rested on the back of her chair brushed her shoulder on the way and her quick involuntary jolt did a great deal to smooth out his ego which was still raw from their earlier encounter deliberately he leaned closer just a little closer if thats what you want rebecca why dont you come on home with me tonight well shane stop flirting with rebecca regan shook her head as she looked down the table youre embarrassing her i wasnt flirting we were having a conversation his lips curved his dimple winked werent we rebecca of sorts shane cant keep his eyes or his hands off the ladies too logy and sluggish to do justice to the meal savannah pushed back her halffinished plate the smart ones dont take him seriously good thing rebeccas one of the smart ones devin put in i tell you its a sad thing to watch the way some women come sniffing around him yeah i get real depressed about it shane grinned wickedly i can hardly hold my head up just last week louisa tully brought me out a peach pie it was demoralizing rafe snorted the trouble is too many of them havent figured out the way to your heart isnt through your stomach its through your ow he winced laughing when regan kicked him hard under the table mind i was going to say mind im sure you were regan said primly shanes always kissing somebody bryan shoveled in the last bite of his third helping and used his napkin rather than the back of his hand to wipe his mouth only because he caught his mothers eye enjoying herself now rebecca leaned forward to smile at the boy is he really oh yeah at the farm at the ballpark right in town too some of them giggle he rolled his eyes con and i think its disgusting shane had always thought that fire was best met with fire and he turned to his nephew i hear jenny metz is stuck on you bryan flushed from his saucesmeared chin to the roots of his hair she is not but the humiliation of that and the primal fear of girls was enough to shut his mouth firmly jared sent his stepson a sympathetic look and steered the conversation onto safer ground from her vantage point rebecca saw shane lean over murmur something to the hunchedshouldered bryan that made the boy grin the sound of fretful crying sounded through one of the baby monitors almost as soon as the meal was over after a heated debate rebecca started on the dishes babies needed to be tended to as shed pointed out children put to bed she was better suited to washing dishes than to fulfilling either of those responsibilities and and that clinched itwas she a friend or a guest while she worked she could hear voices from the living room and more sounds through the other monitor that stood in the kitchen some soft some deep soothing she mused a kind of routine that dug roots honed traditions she could hear rafe talking to nate as he readied him for bed regan murmuring to the baby as she nursed him someone she thought it was devins voice was calmly directing children to pick up the scattered toys jared poked his head in once apologizing for skipping out on kitchen duty explaining that savannah was exhausted she waved him away she was sure that if anyone else had to face a mess like this the piles of pots pans dishes glasses would be daunting at best tedious at worst but for her it was a novel chore and therefore entertaining shane strolled in thumbs hooked in his pockets looks like id better roll up my sleeves you dont need to pitch in rebecca was working the problem of fitting everything into the racks of the dishwasher into a geometric equation ive got it everybody else is tied up with kids or pregnant wives im all youve got so he did roll up his sleeves are you going to put the dishes in there or study it all night im working on a system fairly satisfied with it rebecca began to load what are you doing im going to wash the pans she paused her eyes narrowing a bit as she recalculated that would be simpler she caught a whiff of lemon from the soap he squirted into the hot running water but when she bent over her bottom bumped his thigh and had her straightening again close quarters around the sink he said with an easy grin to offset it she merely walked to the other side of the dishwasher and worked from there so is flirting with women a vocation or an avocation its a pleasure mmm isnt it awkward in a small town to juggle women i guess it would be if you thought of them as rubber balls instead of people she nodded as she meticulously arranged dishes it would be she mused interesting and educational to delve into the mind of a ladies man ill rephrase that isnt it awkward to begin or end a relationship in a small town where people appear to know a great deal about other peoples business not if you do it right is this another study rebecca she straightened again battling a flush because it had been just that im sorry really thats a terrible habit of mine picking things apart just say butt out rebecca butt out rebecca because there had been no sting in the order she laughed and got back to work what if i just say i think you have a wonderful and interesting family and i enjoyed meeting all of them that would be fine im fond of them myself it shows she looked up lips curved and it almost makes me think theres more to you than a womanchasing farm boy i enjoyed watching all of you together the interaction the shorthand conversations the little signals he set a pan into the drainer is that what you were doing when i caught you at dinner making observations on the mackades in their natural milieu her smile faded a little no actually i was thinking of something else entirely suddenly restless she picked up a damp cloth and walked away to wipe off the stove i do need to talk to you about making arrangements to work at the farm i realize you have a routine and a private life i dont intend to get in your way but you will he thought hed suspected it before but that quick glimpse of sadness in her eyes moments ago had confirmed it he was a sucker for a woman with secrets and sad stories i told regan you could come and work there so im stuck with it she shrugged her shoulder its important enough to me that i cant worry overmuch about it making you uncomfortable when she glanced back at him her eyes were cool again faintly mocking youll be out in the field most of the time wont you baling hay or whatever or whatever damned if she wasnt pulling his strings he thought both of her for he was certain there were two women in there and he had a growing fascination with each one though he hadnt quite finished the pans he picked up a towel dried his hands maybe it was that slim white neck he mused it was just begging to be touched tasted or it could be those odd golden eyes that hinted at all sorts of elusive emotions even when they shone with confidence or maybe it was just his own ego still ruffled from her mocking response to him that morning whatever it was he was compelled to test her and perhaps himself again he moved behind her quietly following impulse he lowered his head and closed his teeth gently on the sensitive nape of her neck she jerked came up hard against him with a shudder that seemed to rack her from head to toe as surprised as he was pleased he took her shoulders firmly in his hands and turned her to face him not so cool this time he murmured and crushed her mouth with a kiss of practiced skill and devastating intensity she hadnt had time to brace to think to defend his mouth quite simply destroyed her her head spun her knees jellied her blood went on fast boil never in her life had so many sensations battered her at once the smooth warm demand of his mouth taking from hers the hard confident hands moving over her the smell of lemon and soap and man her mind simply couldnt compute it so her body took over some weak accepting sound purred out of her throat she couldnt stop it couldnt stop the trembling or the heat or the sudden and baffling need to let everything she was melt into him one shock of pleasure sparked another then another until there was nothing else his first reaction was of arrogant delight indifferent to him like hell she was she was hot she was trembling she was moaning the woman he kissed that morning had been cool and amused and mocking not this one this one was deliciously warm he could have tasted that mouth endlessly so smooth so soft so silky he eased deeper aroused by each throaty moan and murmur his mind went blissfully blank with pleasure when he slid his hands under her sweater and found only rebecca beneath it she quivered her breath catching in her throat as he skimmed those rough palms over small firm breasts his thumbs scraped lightly over her rigid nipples and he swallowed her gasps absorbed her shudders the arms shed lifted to twine around his neck went limp dropped slowly to her sides in a kind of helpless surrender that excited unbearably even as it warned him he eased back clamping bis hands on the stove at either side of her as he studied her face her cheeks were flushed her eyes were closed her breath was coming fast and harsh through lips erotically swollen from his he thought she would look just like that on the floor with him mounting her the image of that had him gripping the stove until his fingers ached then she opened her eyes and he saw that they were blind drugged and a little bit afraid well well well he said it lightly mockingly as much in defense as in triumph as his stomach lurched with need id say we had a different result this time around she couldnt catch her breath much less form a word she only shook her head as her body continued to suffer from quick lethal explosions no theories this time doc he didnt know why he was angry but he could feel his temper building building then spiking as she stood there looking helpless stunned and more and more terrified maybe we should try it again no she got that out she thought her life might depend on the uttering of that single syllable no she said again i think you proved your point he didnt know what his point had been something about amusing himself a test but it certainly didnt apply now now he wanted her with a ferocity that was totally unprecedented he believed desire was as natural as breathing and should cause no more discomfort than the easy exhaling of air and yet he ached fiercely ached you let me by she managed when im ready im waiting for your hypothesis or would it be a conclusion now im curious rebecca how are you going to react the next time i kiss you and which one of you am i going to find when i take you to bed she didnt know and wasnt sure she could tell him if she did she was saved from what she was sure would have been abject humiliation when rafe swung through the kitchen door he stopped summed up the situation in a glance and scowled at his brother for gods sake shane get out its my damn house rafe shot back then well get out he snagged rebeccas arm and took two strides before panic gave her the strength to yank away no it was all she said as she walked past both men and out of the kitchen what the hells wrong with you rafe demanded you had her pinned up against the damn stove she was white as a sheet since when have you gotten off on scaring women i didnt scare her but he realized abruptly that he had and that for a few moments he hadnt cared that he had in fact he been hotly thrilled that he could that was new for him and shaming i didnt mean to it got out of hand frustrated he dragged his unsteady fingers through his hair hell i got out of hand maybe youd better keep your distance until you can handle yourself yeah maybe id better because hed been expecting an argument rafes brows drew together he noted now that shane was just about as pale as rebecca had been you okay i dont know baffled shane shook his head shes the damnedest woman he muttered the damnedest woman chapter five as she was a meticulous woman it took rebecca hours to set her equipment to her specifications there were sensors cameras recorders computers monitors cassie had been able to give her one of the larger suites for a couple of days and she tried to be grateful for it yet it was confining not to be able to set up a camera or two on the first floor she doubted any of the other guests would welcome one in the rooms they slept in still she had space and the thrill of occupying what had been charles barlows room the windows afforded a lovely view of the sloping front lawn the latesummer flowers the wild tiger lilies lining the edge of the road and the town itself she imagined the master of the house would have enjoyed looking out studying the rooftops and chimneys of the houses and shops the quiet stream of traffic everything shed read about charles barlow indicated that he had been the kind of man who would consider it his right even his duty to look down on lesser men she wished she could feel him here his power even his cruelty but there was nothing but a charming set of rooms crowded now with the technology shed brought with her it was frustrating she was positive every one of the mackades had experienced something in this house had been touched by what lingered there why couldnt she her hope was that science would aid her as it always had shed purchased the very best equipment suited to a oneperson operation and shrugged off the expense some women she mused bought shoes or jewelry she bought machines all right perhaps she was buying more in the shoesandjewelry line these days money had never been a problem and didnt look to be one in the foreseeable future in any case she was entitled to her hobby rebecca told herself as she dipped her hands in her pockets she was entitled to the new life the new persona she was carving out a great many of her colleagues thought she had gone mad when word got out on what she planned to spend her free time studying her parents would be deeply annoyed if she ever drew up the courage to face them with her new interest but she wasnt going to let that matter she wanted to explore needed to if she had to go back to being the boring predictable utterly tedious dr knight she would go mad yet shed learned a valuable lesson the night before she wasnt quite ready to handle certain aspects of her new life shed been cocky entirely too selfassured and shane mackade had knocked the chip from her shoulder and crushed it to splinters lord knew why shed thought she could deal with sex all hed had to do was catch her off guard once and shed turned into a trembling mindless mess shed spent some time being furious with him for causing it after she got over being terrified but she was too analytical to blame him for long she had put on the mask of confidence had even tried her hand at flirtation it was hardly his fault that hed believed the image and responded to it she would simply have to be more careful in the future and rethink her plan to stay at the farm the man was entirely too physical too attractive too everything especially for a woman who had barely begun to explore her own sexuality yes she would be very careful and she wouldnt dwell on those sharp and intense needs hed stirred up in her the way his mouth had felt on hers the way his hands had moved over her bare skin what it had felt like to be touched that way by that man so intimately so naturally she let out a long shaky breath and closed her eyes no she wouldnt dwell on that she was going to enjoy herself start her paper on antietam make plans for the book she intended to write and if perseverance counted for anything find her ghosts moving to her computer she sat and booted up im settled in the mackade inn now in what were charles barlows rooms during the civil war period there are other guests and ill be interested to hear if they had any experiences during the night for the moment all is quiet im told that people often hear doors slamming or the sound of weeping even the report of a gun these phenomena happen not only at night but also during the daylight hours regan has experienced them and rafe there are also reports of the scent of roses this particular experience is most common i find this interesting as the olfactory sense is the strongest in my brief meeting with savannah mackade i learned that she has often felt a presence in this house and the woods that border the land i gather that both she and jared are similarly drawn to the woods where the two corporals met and fought its fascinating to me that people find each other this way cassie and devin mackade are another example in this case they lived in the same small town all of their lives cassie married someone else and had two children and from what i can glean a truly horrific marriage still she and devin found each other and from this outsiders perspective seem as though theyve been together always both cassie and devin have stories to tell about the inn and their experiences here ill have to go into them in depth in my official notes shane mackade is the only one who has no stories to tell or rather none hes willing to tell im not used to relying on my instincts rather than pure data but if i were to trust them id say he holds back what he knows or feels which is contradictory as he isnt a man who seems to hold back anything on a personal level id have to say hes one of the most demonstrative people ive even encountered hes a habitual toucher and by reputation one who enjoys the company of women i suppose one would call him earthy without the cruder connotations of the word he is basically a man of the earth and perhaps that explains why he scoffs at anything that hints of the paranormal to be honest i like him very much his humor his obvious attachment to family his unabashed love of the land on the surface he appears to be a simple man yet using those rusty instincts of mine i sense complications underneath he would certainly make an interesting study however the lady doesnt come in here fingers still poised on the keyboard rebecca glanced up and saw emma in the doorway hello is school out uhhuh mama said to come tell you she has coffee and cookies if you want very much at home emma wandered in gazing wideeyed at the machines you have a lot of stuff i know i guess you could say theyre my toys whos the lady shes the one who used to live here she cries like mama used to didnt you hear her no when with calm and friendly eyes emma smiled just now she was crying while you were typing but she never comes in here a quick cold shiver spurted down rebeccas spine you heard her just now she cries a lot emma walked over to the computer and solemnly read the words on the monitor sometimes i go to her room and she stops crying mama says she likes company i see rebecca was careful to keep her tone light and when you hear her crying how does it make you feel it used to make me sad but now i know sometimes crying can make you feel better when youre finished in spite of herself rebecca smiled thats very true are you going to take pictures of the lady i hope so have you ever seen her no but i think shes pretty because she smells pretty emma offered another quick elfin smile you smell pretty too thanks do you like living in the house emma with the lady and everything its nice but were going to build our own house near the farm because were a big family now mama will still work here so i can come whenever i want are you writing a story connor writes stories no not exactly its like a diary really just things i want to remember or read over sometime but im going to write a story about antietam can i be in it oh i think you have to be she ran a hand over emmas springy golden curls it was lovely to discover that yes she did seem to appeal to children and they appealed very much to her i hope youll tell me all about the lady my names emma mackade now the judge said it could be so ill be emma mackade in the story you certainly will be rebecca shut down her machine lets go get some cookies she hadnt intended to walk over to the farm shed set out to take a stroll in the woods or so shed told herself to take some air clear her mind stretch her legs but she was out of the trees and crossing the fields before she knew it she couldnt say why it made her smile to see the house she hoped it was late enough in the day that shane was settled in somewhere or off with one of his lady friends she knew that farm work started early in the day so it seemed safe to assume it would be done by now she could see that part of a hayfield had been mowed but there was no tractor or whatever was used to cut it in sight now she was sorry shed missed the action undoubtedly shane mackade riding through the fields on a large powerful machine would make quite an interesting picture but it was really solitude she wanted before she went back to her rooms and hunkered down with her equipment and notes for the rest of the night that was why she veered away from the house rather than toward it she liked the smells here found them oddly familiar some deeply buried memory she supposed perhaps a former life she was really going to start exploring the theory of reincarnation sometime soon fascinating subject because she knew the story of the two corporals well she wandered toward the outbuildings she didnt know precisely what a smokehouse might look like but regan had told her it was stone and that it still stood there were wildflowers in the grass little blue stars yellow cups tall lacy spears of white charmed she forgot her mission and began to gather a few beyond where she stood was a meadow lushly green starred with color from more wild blooms and the flutter of butterflies had she ever taken time to walk in a meadow she wondered no never her botany studies had been brief and crowded with latin names rather than with enjoyment so she would enjoy it now light of heart she walked toward the wide field of high grass noting the way the sun slanted the way the flowers swayed danced really in the light breeze then her throat began to ache and her heartbeat thickened for a moment there was such a terrible sadness such a depth of loneliness she nearly staggered her fingers clutched tightly at the flowers shed picked she moved through the high grass among the thistles shooting up purple puffs on thick stalks and the sorrow clutched in her stomach like a fist she stopped watched butterflies flicker listened to birds chirping the strong sun warmed her skin but inside she was so very cold what else could we have done she asked herself shivering with a grief that wasnt her own yet was stunningly real what else was there to do opening her hand she let the flowers fall in the meadow grass at her feet the tears stinging her eyes left her shaken baffled as carefully as a soldier in a minefield she backed away from where her flowers lay in the grass done about what she wondered a little frantic now where had the question come from and what could it possibly mean then she turned taking slow deliberate breaths and left the meadow behind all those strong confusing emotions faded so that she began to doubt shed ever felt them perhaps it was just that she was a little lonely or that it was lowering to realize she wasnt a woman to gather wildflowers or walk in meadows she was a creature of books and classrooms of facts and theory shed been born that way certainly shed been raised that way uncompromisingly the brilliant child of brilliant parents who had outlined and dictated her world so well and for so long that she was fully adult before she thought to question and rebel even in such a small way and the life she wanted to create for herself was still so foreign even now she was thinking of going back of keeping to her timetable of sitting down with her equipment no matter that it was something out of the ordinary that she intended to study it was still studying damn it jamming her hands in her pockets she deliberately turned away from the direction that would take her back to the inn she would have her walk first she ordered herself shed pick more wildflowers if she wanted to next time shed take off her shoes and walk in the meadow she was muttering to herself when she saw the cows bumping together under a threesided shed that was attached to the milk barn didnt cows belong in the fields she wondered there were so many of them crowded together there munching on what she supposed was hay or alfalfa curious she walked closer keeping some distance only because she wasnt entirely sure cows were as friendly as they looked but when they didnt seem the least concerned with her she moved closer and heard him singing one for the morning glory two for the early dew three for the man who stands his ground and four for the love of you delighted with the sound rebecca moved to the doorway and had her first glimpse of a milking parlor whatever shed imagined it wasnt this organized oddly technical environment there were big shiny pipes and large chutes the mechanical hum of a compressor or some other type of machine a dozen cows stood in stanchions eating contentedly from individual troughs some of them munched on grain as devices that looked like clever octopuses relieved them of their milk and shane stripped down to one of those undeniably sexy undershirts a battered cap stuffed onto all that wonderful wild hair moved among them still singing or dropping into a whistle as he checked feed or the progress of the milking machines okay sweetie all done caught up in the process rebecca stepped closer how does that work he swore ripely bumping the cow hard enough to have her moo in annoyance the look he aimed at rebecca was not one of friendly welcome im sorry i didnt mean to sneak up on you its noisy she tried a smile and forced herself not to take a step in retreat i was out walking and i saw the cows out there and i wondered what was going on the same thing that goes on around here twice a day every day it was an effort for him to readjust himself hed planned to avoid her for a few days but here she was pretty as a picture with those big curious eyes right in his milking parlor but how do you manage it all by yourself there are so many of them i dont always do it alone anyway its automated for the most part deftly he removed inflations from udders where does the milk go through the pipes i imagine thats right he bit back a sigh he didnt much feel like giving her a class in milking he felt like kissipg the breath out of her from cow to pipes and into tanks in the milk house he gestured vaguely it keeps it at the proper temperature until the milk truck pumps it out i have to take these girls back to the loafing shed loafing shed he did smile now just a little thats where they loaf before and after rebecca made way perhaps a bit more than necessary as he herded the milked cows out she wondered how he kept them straight the ones still to be milked the ones who had been and when he herded more in she realized the answer was obvious their bags were huge she muffled a giggle as he moved them into place with approval for the efficiency and organization of the system she watched him pull a lever that poured grain from chutes to troughs so they feed and milk at the same time foods the incentive he paid little attention to her as he went about his business they eat you milk half of them you milk the other half while you set up the next group quickly and with little fuss he hooked his new stock into their stanchions these are inflations they go over the teats do the work that used to be done by hand you can milk a hell of a lot more cows a hell of a lot faster this way than with your fingers and a bucket it must be more sanitary and you use that solution some sort of antiseptic i suppose on their bags honey you call them bags he nodded you want grade a milk you have to meet the standards how is the milk graded she began then stopped herself sorry too many questions im in your way yeah you are but as the machines did their work he stepped toward her what are you doing here rebecca i told you i was out walking he lifted a brow hooked his thumbs in his front pockets and you decided to visit with the cows i didnt have a plan i think its safe to say you usually do all right he was of course on target no matter what shed told herself when she started through the woods i suppose i felt wed left something unresolved i dont want things to be difficult with you since im dealing with so much of your family while im here umhmm he wasnt precisely sure which side of her he was dealing with at the moment i was pushy do you want an apology unnecessary that made him smile again he had a growing affection for that cocky tilt to her chin want to try it again ive got an urge to kiss you right now im sure you have an urge to kiss any woman just about anytime yeah but youre here ill let you know if and when i want you to kiss me as a means of defense she turned wandered frowned intently at a container labeled udder balm the problem i have is that as long as we have this attraction he put in lust tension she snapped back it makes it difficult for me to follow through on my plan to work here i do want to work here she said turning to him again but i cant if im going to have to deflect unsolicited advances unsolicited advances instead of being annoyed he nearly doubled over with laughter damn rebecca i love the way you talk when youre being snotty say something else im sure youre more used to women keeling over at your feet she said coldly or bringing you peach pies i just want to be certain that you clearly understand the word no he didnt find anything amusing about that she had the fascinating experience of watching his grin turn into a snarl you said no last night didnt you my point is i could have had you right there on my brothers kitchen floor the color that temper had brought to her cheeks faded away but her voice remained steady and cool you overestimate your appeal farm boy watch your step becky he said quietly ive got a mean streak you want to dissolve some tension so you can get on with your project ive always found honesty goes a long way to cutting the tension you wanted me every bit as much as i wanted you maybe you were surprised maybe i was too but thats the fact she opened her mouth but found no suitable lies tripping onto her tongue all right i wont deny i was interested for a moment honey what you were was a long way up from interested dont tell me what i felt or what i feel i will tell you that if you think im going to be another notch on your bedpost think again fine in casual dismissal he walked over to check on his cows wo isnt a word i have any problem understanding as long as you actually say it ill understand it most of her nerves smoothed out all right then we but youd better keep your guard up rebecca he shot her a look that had all the nerves doubling back and sizzling because i dont have any problem understanding a challenge either you want to play ghost hunter in my house you take your chances willing to risk it you dont worry me his smile spread slowly this time yeah i do youre standing there right now wondering what in hell to do about me actually i was wondering how you manage to walk around upright when youre weighed down with that ego practice now he grinned same way you manage it with all those heavy thoughts inside that head of yours im just about finished up here why dont you go on in make us some coffee we can talk about this some more i think weve covered it she moved just quickly enough to get out ahead of him and i dont make coffee for a skinny woman he mused she looked mighty nice walking away dont you want me to kiss you goodbye sweetie she tossed a look over her shoulder kiss a cow farm boy he couldnt resist he was on her in a heartbeat swinging her up into his arms and around in a dizzying circle while his laughter roared out youre the cutest damn thing her breath had been lost somewhere during the first revolution for an instant all she could think was that his arms were as hard as rock and felt absolutely wonderful i thought you understood no im not kissing you am i all innocence shanes eyes laughed into hers unless you want me to just wanted to get a hold of you for a minute i swear you weigh less than a sack of grain thank you so much for that poetic compliment put me down youve really got to eat more why dont you hang around ill fix you some dinner no she said no no no you only have to say it once he cocked his head enjoying the way the pulse in her throat beat like a birds just above the open collar of her silky white shirt why are you trembling im angry no youre not intrigued now he studied her face and his voice gentled did somebody hurt you no of course not i asked you to put me down im going to if i did what i wanted and carried you inside right now id neglect my cows and break my word i wouldnt want to do either so he set her on her feet but kept his hands on her shoulders it seems to me weve got something going here id prefer to take my own time deciding that thats fair because he was becoming fond of it he skimmed a finger over her hair tugged on one of the short soft tresses it occurs to me that ive already decided i really want you not being a psychiatrist or a heavy thinker i dont have to analyze that or look for hidden meanings i just feel it his eyes green and dreamy lowered to hers again and held i want to take you to bed and i want to make love with you and i want it more every time i get near you you can put that into your equation i will it was a struggle to concentrate when his hands were moving in gentle circles on her shoulders but its not the only factor things would be a lot less convoluted if we could back off from this while im getting my project under way less convoluted he agreed amused by the word and less fun fun she thought feeling herself yearn toward him it was a novel and interesting concept when at tached to intimacy he watched her lips curve just a little felt her body soften saw her eyes deepen a knot of need twisted in him as he drew her closer pretty rebecca he murmured let me show you he could have committed murder when a sharp blast of a horn shattered the moment she stiffened stepped back as both of them looked over at the dusty compact that pulled up in front of the house rebecca had a clear view of the sulkymouthed brunette who poked her gorgeous head out of the window shane honey i told you id try to drop by he lifted a hand in a casual wave even as he felt the temperature surrounding him drop to the subzero range ah thats darla shes a friend of mine i bet the chip was back on rebeccas shoulder and it was the size of a redwood she cocked a brow and curved her lips mockingly he didnt have to know the mockery was for herself dont let me keep you from your friend shane honey im sure youre a very busy boy look damn it darla called out again her husky voice a little impatient shane saw with unaccustomed panic that she was getting out of the car with anyone else the meeting would have been easy even amusing with rebecca he had a feeling it would be deadly shed eat darla for breakfast listen i i dont have time to look or to listen rebecca said interrupting him desperately afraid shed make a fool of herself in front of the stunning woman picking her way over the lawn in thin high heels i have work to do you and darla have a nice visit she strode off leaving shane caught between the willing and the wanted chapter six during her stay at the inn rebecca had established a pattern she rose early enough to join the other guests for breakfast it wasnt the food as marvelous as cassies cooking was that nudged her out of bed and downstairs she wanted the opportunity to interview her companions under the guise of a breezy morning chat it was work for her to keep it casual not to fall into the habits of analyst or scientist shed been rewarded over coffee and waffles that morning by a young couple who both claimed to have felt a presence in the bridal suite during the night now alone in her room late at night the inn quiet around her rebecca read over the notes shed hurriedly made that morning subjects corroborate each others experience sudden cold a strong scent of roses the sound of a female weeping three senses involved subjects excited by experience rather than frightened very clear and firm when reporting each phenomenon neither claimed a sighting but female subject described a sense of deep sadness which occurred just after temperature fluctuation and lasted until the scent of roses had faded interesting rebecca mused as she worked the notes into a more formal style including names and dates as for herself shed slept like a baby if only for a few short hours she rarely slept more than five hours in any case and the night before she had made do with three in hopes of recording an event of her own but her room had remained comfortable and quiet throughout the night after her notes were refined and her journal entry for the day was complete she switched over to the book she was toying with writing the haunting of antietam she rather liked the title though she could picture some of her more illustrious colleagues muttering over it at faculty teas and university functions let them mutter she thought shed toed the line all her life it was time she did a little boat rocking it would be a new challenge to write something that was descriptive even emotional rather than dry and factual to bring to life her vision her impressions of the small town with its quiet hills the shadow of the mountains in the distance those wide fertile fields she needed to spend some time on the battlefield absorb its ambience but for now she had plenty to say about the inn and its original inhabitants she worked for an hour then two losing herself in the story of the barlows the tragic abigail the unbending charles the children who had lost their mother at a tender age thanks to cassie rebecca had another character to add a man abigail had loved and sent away rebecca suspected the man might have been of some authority in antietam during that time the sheriff perhaps it was too lovely a coincidence to overlook and she intended to research it thoroughly she was so deep in her work that it took her several minutes to notice the hum of her equipment startled by it she jerked back stared at the monitor of her sensor was that a draft she wondered and sprang up shuddering the temperature gauge was acutely sensitive rebecca watched with amazement as the numbers dropped rapidly from a comfortable seventytwo she was hugging her arms by the time it reached thirty and she could see her own breath puff out quickly as her heart thudded yet she felt nothing but the cold nothing she heard nothing smelled nothing the lady doesnt come in here that was what emma had told her but did the master it had to be charles shed read so much about him the thought filled her with a jumble of anger fear and anticipation moving quickly rebecca checked her recorder the cameras the quiet blip on a machine registered her presence and for an instant an instant almost too quick to notice something other then it was gone over and warmth poured back into the room nearly wild with excitement she snatched up her recorder event commenced at and fifteen seconds am with dramatic temperature drop of fortytwo degrees fahrenheit barely measurable energy fluctuation lasting only a fraction of a second followed by immediate rise in temperature event ended at and twenty seconds am duration of sixtyfive seconds she stood for a moment the recorder in her hand trying to will it all to start again she knew it had been charles she felt it and her pulse was still scrambling dispassionately she wondered what her blood pressure would register come on come on you bully you coward you son of a bitch come back the sound of her own voice the raw intensity in it had her forcing herself to take several deep breaths losing objectivity she warned herself any project was doomed without objectivity so she made herself sit monitored the equipment for another thirty minutes precisely she added the event to her records before shutting the computer down too restless to sleep she left her room in the hall she stood quietly waiting hoping but there was only the dark and the stillness she moved downstairs lingering as she tried to envision the murdered confederate soldier the shocked abigail the terrified servants the murdering barlow they were all less substantial than thoughts to her she tried every room the parlor where some said you could smell wood smoke from a fire that wasnt burning the library which both regan and cassie avoided as much as possible because they felt uncomfortable there in the solarium there was nothing but leafy plants cozy chairs and the light of the moon through the glass she struggled against discouragement as she wandered into the kitchen there had been a moment she reminded herself shed experienced it patience was as important as an open and curious mind she was drawn to the window and that open and curious mind drifted past the gardens and the lawn through the trees to the fields beyond and the house where shane was sleeping the urge was so strong it shocked her the urge to go out walk over that grass over those fields she wanted to go into that house to go to him foolishness she told herself it was doubtful he was alone she imagined he was snuggled up with that beautiful brunette or some other equally appealing woman for the night but still the urge was there so powerful so elementally physical it brought an ache to her belly was it the place that pulled at her she wondered or the man it was something to think about something she would have to gather the courage to explore no more mousy fadeintothecorner rebecca she thought no more spending her life huddled behind a desk or a handy book experience was what shed come here for and if shane mackade offered experience shed sample it in her own time of course at her own pace he saw her as a woman who could hold her own with him and she was going to find a way to do exactly that he wanted to take her to bed how does that make you feel dr knight frightened exhilarated curious frightened you say of the sexual experience sex is a basic biological function a human experience why would i be frightened of it because it remains unknown she answered herself so it frightens exhilarates and stirs the curiosity he stirs the curiosity once i have control of the situation ah dr knight so its a matter of control how do you feel about the possible loss of control uncomfortable which is why i dont intend to lose it she blew out a breath shut off the questioning part of her brain but she couldnt quite shut off that nagging urge so she walked quickly out of the kitchen and went upstairs to bed but she dreamed and the dreams were full of laughter a mans arms around her the two of them rolling over a soft giving mattress like wrestling children giggles muffled against warm lips teasing fingers combing through her long tangled hair hush john youll wake the baby you re making all the noise quick hands sneaking under her cotton nightgown finding wonderful spots to linger you ve got too many clothes on sarah i want you naked mock slaps and tussles more giggles im still carrying around extra weight from the baby youre perfect hes perfect god i want you i want you sarah i love you let me love you while the laughter stilled the joy didnt and the soft feather bed gave quietly beneath the weight and rhythm of mating she was groggy the next day not from lack of sleep but from the dream that wouldnt quite leave her for most of the afternoon she closeted herself in her room using her modem to call up snatches of data on the population of antietam circa her printer was happily spewing out a list of names from census birth and death registries when cassie knocked on the door im sorry to bother you no thats fine distracted rebecca peered through her glasses im trying to find abigails lover if she had one oh obviously flustered cassie ran a hand through her hair but how would you be able to process of elimination ages marital status remembering she took the glasses off and cassie popped into focus you seemed awfully sure he didnt have a wife no he couldnt have and he wasnt in the army but you said something about him resigning some kind of post when he left town its so odd to hear you talk about it about them as if they were real and here rebecca smiled and leaned back in her chair arent they well yes i suppose they are cassie shook her head i get caught up in the story i came to tell you i have to run to the hospital hospital alarmed rebecca shot out of her chair is one of the children hurt sick oh no no shane hes had an accident rebeccas face went dead white where is he what happened rebecca its savannah shes in labor curious cassie watched rebecca sink bonelessly back into her chair i didnt mean to frighten you its all right weakly she waved a hand im supposed to know better than to jump to conclusions shane called a couple of hours ago after jared called him i needed to arrange for a sitter before i could go im going to drop connor and emma off with ed at the diner you havent met ed yet shes just wonderful she cant handle ally tot but theres day care at the hospital uhhuh rebecca had nearly recovered i didnt want you to think youd been deserted theres some cold cuts and a pie in the kitchen if you get hungry i have to take the car but im supposed to tell you that you can go over to the cabin or the farm and borrow one if you need to go out i dont need to go anywhere calm again she smiled savannahs having her baby thats wonderful is everything all right fine at last report its just that we all want to be there of course you do give mother and father my best id be happy to keep ally for you if you like thats awfully nice of you but im nursing and i dont know how long ill be cassie nibbled her bottom lip as she began to organize things in her head were not expecting any new guests and ive left a note for the ones who are out and about today i usually serve tea in about an hour but dont worry well fend for ourselves go on cassie i can see youre dying to be there theres nothing like a new baby no im sure there isnt when she was alone rebecca tried to concentrate but she could visualize it all the whole mackade family would be pacing the waiting room probably driving the nursing staff to distraction theyd be noisy of course one of them would pop into the birthing room to check the progress and come out and report to the others all of them would enjoy every minute of it that was what close families did enjoy each other she wondered if they had any idea how lucky they were she put in another two hours at the computer easily eliminated half the male names on her list before hunger had her wandering down to the kitchen some of the other guests had already sampled the pie cassie had left and someone had been considerate enough to leave coffee on she poured a cup thought about building a sandwich and settled for blueberries baked in a flaky crust when the phone rang she answered automatically hello oh mackade inn youve got a good sexy voice for the phone rebecca shane and a good ear we thought youd want to know the mackades just increased by one what did she have how is she a girl and theyre both terrific miranda mackade is eight pounds two ounces and twentyone inches of gorgeous female miranda rebecca sighed thats lovely cassies on her way back but she might be a while yet picking up the kids telling ed all the details and all i thought you might be wondering i was thanks im in the mood to celebrate want to celebrate with me dr knight ah nothing fancy i didnt have time to change before i can swing by pick you up buy you a beer thats sounds irresistible but good half an hour i didnt say she could only frown at the rude buzz of the dial tone she wouldnt primp sheer vanity had her doing a quick check in the mirror and giving her makeup a buff but that was all he was getting the leggings and thin fawncolored sweater shed worked in that evening were comfortable and would certainly do for a casual beer if she dressed them up with big copperandbrass earrings it was for her own benefit shed begun to enjoy the ritual of decorating her body over the past few months she left a note for cassie on her door then walked out of the inn to wait for shane hints of the coming fall brought a tang on the air the day had been hot and still but now the air was cool the darkness was soft and complete as it was meant to be in the country occasionally a car would rumble by on the road below the steep lane then silence would fall again beautifully shed been sure she would miss the noise of the city the comforting grumble of life the periodic and cheerful rudeness of it in new york shed finally taught herself to join in that life to spend time in the stores and museums to brush up against people instead of shying away from them it was a kind of therapy shed prescribed for herself and it had worked shed stopped walking with her eyes on her own feet stopped hurrying back to her own apartment where she could be safe and alone with her books but she didnt miss it she liked the quiet here the slower pace and the opportunity to get to know people now she was going to have a drink with a very attractive man all in all it wasnt a bad end to a productive day she watched the headlights come and veer toward the lane shifting her shoulder bag she headed toward the truck thats what i like to see a woman waiting for me sorry to disappoint you she hiked herself up and into the cab of the truck i wanted to enjoy the incredible weather its starting to smell like fall you look pretty reaching over he flicked a finger over her earring and sent it dancing so do you it was absolutely true the stubby ponytail the faded work shirt the easy grin where are we going just down to duffs shane slung an arm over the back of the seat and set the truck in reverse its not much but its home it certainly wasnt much rebecca decided at first study the tavern was badly lit with glaring fluorescent lights over the pool table that were only softened by the clouds of smoke from cigarettes a jukebox that blared out whiny country music the decorations ran to scattered peanut shells posters for beer and an oddly charming print of dogs playing poker the air smelled stale and a little dangerous she liked it on their way to the bar a scarred affair guarded by a scrawny man with an irritable look on his face shane introduced her to half a dozen people she got the look outsiders are greeted by in a closeknit community a combination of curiosity distrust and interest someone called out for shane to pick up a cue but he shook his head and held up two fingers to the man behind the bar hows it going duff the skinny bartender grunted as he popped the tops of two bottles usual this is rebecca a friend of regans from new york new york citys a hellhole youve been there rebecca asked politely couldnt pay me to set foot in it he slid the bottles over the bar and went back to scowling at his customers duffs a real chatterbox shane commented as he led the way to a table and the happiest man in town i could tell right off she took her seat after all im a professional grinning shane tapped his bottle to hers to miranda catherine mackade in concert rebecca lifted the bottle and sipped so tell me all about it well the couple of times i got in to see her savannah was a little cranky she said mackade men should be locked up among other things that had to do with specific parts of the anatomy sounds fair coming from a woman in labor yeah well regan and cassie werent quite so nasty then again savannahs a little more out there anyway she spit nails for a while then after it was over she was cooing rose petals and jared went from sweating bullets to grinning like a demented fool thats the way it goes every time we have a baby we its a family affair you could have come it sounds like savannah had enough company she tilted her head so does it give you any ideas huh oh he leaned back grinning it gives me the idea that my brothers are doing a fine job making families no need for me to horn in what about you you thinking about settling down and hatching a brood hatching a brood she had to laugh no shane took a peanut from the plastic bowl on the table cracked it so what do you do when youre not shrinking heads or chasing ghosts or giving lectures i live in a hellhole remember theres always plenty to do muggings murders orgies my lifes very full he skimmed a hand over hers anyone in particular helping fill it out no no one in particular she smiled sweetly leaned forward hows darla he cleared his throat and bought himself a little time by sipping his beer shes fine dandy it wasnt worth mentioning that hed nudged good old darla along despite her invitation to fix his supper and anything else he might like any progress on the hunt thats not a very subtle avoidance of the topic i wasnt trying to be subtle he laid his hand over hers again snagging her fingers before she could draw them away find any good ghosts lately actually i did she had the pleasure of seeing the smile fade from his eyes thats bull no indeed i have some very nice documentation of an event registered a fortytwodegree temperature drop in less than two minutes he took another drink your fancy equipment needs to be overhauled his reaction amused her intrigued her youre very resistant do you feel threatened why would i feel threatened by something that doesnt exist one brow cocked up under her fringe of bangs why would you because i he caught himself narrowed his eyes she was smiling blandly and he noted very much in control is that how you analyze your patients do you feel like a patient cut it out sorry she threw her head back and laughed it was irresistible i dont really do individual therapy but youd make a terrific subject want to try wordassociation no she arched both brows this time youre not afraid are you its very simple i say a word you respond with the first thing that comes to mind im not afraid of some silly parlor game but he was irritated just enough to jerk his shoulders fine shoot home family it made her smile bird feather car truck city noise country land sex women then he brought their joined hands to his lips nipped lightly at her fingers rebecca she ignored the jingling spurt of her pulse its the first thing that comes to your mind that counts all in all id say youre a very elemental man set in your ways and happy with them consider that a thumbnail analysis why dont i try it with you as soon as you get your degree farm boy she waited a beat if youre hungry why dont you try the peanuts i like your hand better to prove it he continued to nibble all the way around to her palm its long and a little bony like the rest of you in a casual move she scooted her chair closer leaned her head toward his do you really think id let you seduce me over a couple of beers at the local tavern its worth a shot he brushed his lips over her wrist your pulse is racing dr knight a basic chemical reaction to stimulus nothing personal we could make it personal he glanced ever his shoulder saw that the pool table was free you up for a bet depends on the type of bet how about a game of pool a friendly wager pool her brows drew together i dont know the rules even better he thought ill explain them youre supposed to be a quick study anybody smart enough to have a bunch of initials after their name should be able to learn a simple game all right whats the bet i win we go out to my truck and neck im really hankering for a taste of you she took a slow breath made sure her eyes stayed cool and if i win whats your pleasure she considered then smiled when i move my equipment over to the farm youll help me with my project on a purely professional level sure with the confidence of a veteran hustler he rose and led her over to the table since youre a beginner ill spot you two balls thats generous she said without having a clue whether it was or not being a fair man and one who rarely lost at this particular game he explained the procedure carefully that also gave him the opportunity to snuggle up behind her his mouth at her ear as he gave her instructions on how to hold and use the cue you want control he told her sniffing her hair but you dont want to force it keep the stroke smooth she tried to ignore the fact that her bottom was snug against him and following his guiding hands struck the cue ball nice he murmured youve got good form and great ears he nipped at one before she straightened but when she turned rather than backing away he set his hands comfortably on her hips why dont we pretend we played and just go neck a bets a bet back off farm boy i can wait he said cheerfully he could already imagine wrapping himself around her and steaming up the windows in the truck you want to break ill leave that to you she stepped away chalked her cue as he did the rules were simple enough she mused you were either solid or striped depending on which type of ball you managed to sink first then you just kept sinking them avoiding the black eight ball if you hit that in before the rest were dispatched unless you struck it with another ball first you lost otherwise whoever sank all their balls first then the eight won she watched shane lean over the table long legs long arms big hands the look of him distracted her enough that she didnt see how he broke the triangle of balls but she did see the results three balls thumped into pockets and he called solids lips pursed she studied his technique the speed and direction of balls rolling over the green felt shed seen the game played of course there was a billiard table in the country club where her parents had a membership but shed never paid much attention it was obviously simple geometry and applied physics she decided quick calculations a steady hand and a good eye were all that was required shane pocketed another two balls before he glanced at her her brow was furrowed her head cocked it was interesting to watch her think he mused it would be even more interesting to watch her feel but it wasnt quite fair to run the table on her when she hadnt even had a chance to shoot to balance the scales a bit he attempted a nearly impossible shot he nearly made it but his ball kissed the corner of the pocket and rolled clear youre up doc he moved around the table to help her with her stance but she shrugged him away id rather do it myself fine he smiled at her with affection and superiority you should go for the one with the yellow stripe its a clean shot into the side pocket i see it muttering to herself she leaned over the table took careful aim squinting a bit to keep the balls in focus and sent it in nice genuinely pleased he walked back to their table to fetch the beer you even left your cue ball in good position for the next shot if you she lifted her head aimed a bland look in his direction do you mind hey he lifted a hand palm out just trying to help you go on ahead he did cluck his tongue a bit as she set up for a bank shot couldnt the woman see her three ball was clear he lifted his beer to hide his grin at this rate he was going to have her exactly where he wanted in five minutes then his mouth dropped open she banked the ball against the side and sent it at a clean angle into the corner pocket she didnt so much as smile never glanced up but went directly back to work a few customers roused themselves to wander over to watch and to kibitz they might have been as invisible as her ghosts she played systematically pausing only briefly between shots with her brows knit and her eyes unfocused as she circled the table he forgot the beer that was dangling from his fingers suffered the elbow nudges and comments from onlookers as she quickly quietly and without a hitch cleaned house to add insult to injury she used one of his own balls the one he could and should have sent home when he was feeling sorry for her to knock the eight ball into the pocket and trounce him at his own game lips pursed she straightened scanned the table is that it there were hoots of laugher several men patted her shoulder and offered to buy her a beer shane merely propped his cue on the table is this how you worked your way through college hustling pool flushed with success now that the work was done she beamed at him no i had numerous scholarships and a generous college fund ive never played pool before in my life ill be damned he dipped his hands in his pockets studying her you ran the table that wasnt luck beginners or otherwise no it wasnt it was science the game is based on angles and velocity isnt it delighted with the fresh knowledge she ran a hand through her hair want to play again i could spot you two balls this time he started to swear but couldnt resist the laugh what the hell well go for two out of three chapter seven so we played pool rebecca was busily adjusting one of her cameras in shanes kitchen while regan looked on hes really very good we ended up closing the place down regan waited a moment tugged her ear as if to clear it you played pool at duffs uhhuh we were just going to play one game then it was two out of three and three out of five and so forth its great fun but i couldnt let all those men buy me beers id have been flat on my face men were buying you beer well they wanted to but im not much of a drinker lips pursed rebecca stepped back to check the positioning shane was awfully goodnatured about it all a lot of people get annoyed when you beat them at their own game excuse me regan held up a hand you beat shane thats shane mackade at pool seven out of ten i think do you know how to work this coffee maker leave the woman alone for a few days and look what she gets into regan thought she cant make coffee but she can beat shane at pool the only person ive ever known to beat shane is rafe and nobody beats rafe bet i could smug rebecca flashed a grin im a natural charlie dodd said so charlie dodd measuring out coffee regan laughed you hung out with charlie dodd and the boys at duffs playing pool what in the world were you doing there celebrating mirandas birth anyway since i won the bet shane has to help me with my project hes not terribly happy about it he has a definite block about anything supernatural curiouser and curiouser regan mused one minor detail hmm what if youd lost the bet id have necked with him in his truck regan splashed the water shed been pouring into the coffee maker all over the counter good lord rebecca what has happened to you a smile ghosting around her mouth rebecca looked dreamily out the window i might have enjoyed it ive no doubt you would have after blowing out a breath regan mopped up the spill and started again honey i dont want to interfere in your life but shane hes very smooth with women and he doesnt tend to take relationships seriously rebecca caught herself dreaming and stopped i know dont worry about me ive been sheltered and secluded but im not stupid she leaned over to coo at the baby napping in his carrier i think im handling shane very well all in all i may have an affair with him you may have an affair with him regan repeated slowly am i having some sort of outofbody experience i hope youll give me all the details if you are regan rubbed a hand over her face told herself to be rational but it was rebecca she thought who was always rational you may have an affair with shane thats shane mackade my brotherinlaw umhmm unable to resist rebecca skimmed a fingertip over jasons soft round cheek im still considering it but hes very attractive and im sure very skilled the fingertip wasnt enough so she bent to touch her lips lightly to the same lovely spot if im going to have an affair it should be with someone i like respect and have some affection for dont you agree well yes in the general scheme of things but rebecca straightened and grinned and if hes gorgeous and clever in bed so much the better a terrific face and body arent everything of course but they are a nice bonus id theorize that the stronger the physical attraction the better the sex the coffeepot was gurgling away before regan found the words rebecca making love with a man isnt an experiment or a science project in a way it is then she laughed and crossed over to take regan by the shoulders there seemed to be no way to explain even to regan what it was like to feel this way free and able and attractive stop worrying about me mama im all grown up now yes obviously i want to explore possibilities regan ive done what i was told what was expected of me for so long forever i need to do what i want with a little sigh she took a turn around the kitchen thats what this is all about why do you think i chose the paranormal as a hobby a firstyear psych student could figure it out all of my life has been so abnormal and at the same time so tediously normal was abnormal thats not true regans voice was sharp and annoyed and made rebecca smile you always did stand up for me even against myself but it is true its not normal for a sevenyearold to do calculus regan or to be able to discuss the political ramifications of the crimean war with historians in french im not even sure what normal behavior is for a sevenyearold except in theory because i never was one before regan could speak she shook her head and hurried on i was pushed into everything so young you cant know what its like to go to school yearround year after year even when i was at home there were tutors and projects assignments and before i knew it my whole life was study work lecture she lifted her hands let them fall earn a degree earn another then go home alone i didnt know you were so unhappy regan murmured ive been miserable all my life rebecca closed her eyes oh that sounds so pathetic its not fair i suppose ive had tremendous advantages education money respect opportunities but advantages can trap you regan just as disadvantages can it seems petty to complain about them but i am now im doing something about it finally with a kind of triumph she drew in a deep greedy breath im doing something no one expects from me something to give my stuffy straightarrow colleagues a marvelous chance to gossip and something that fascinates me im all for it but regan was worried as she opened cupboards for mugs i think its wonderful that youve taken time for yourself that you have an interest in something most people consider out of the ordinary rebecca accepted the mug of coffee but but shane doesnt come under the heading of hobby hes the sweetest man i know but he could hurt you rebecca mulled it over as she sipped its a possibility but even that would be an experience ive never been close enough to a man to be hurt by one she moved over to the window to look out she could see him in the field riding a tractor just as shed imagined no it wasnt a tractor she remembered a baler hed be making hay i love looking at him she murmured none of them are hard on the eyes regan commented as she joined rebecca at the window and none of them are easy on the heart she laid a hand on rebeccas shoulder just be careful but rebecca felt shed been careful too long already she couldnt even cook shane had never known anyone who was incapable of doing more at a stove than heating up a can of soup and even that for rebecca was a project of momentous proportions he didnt mind her being there hed talked himself into that he liked her company was certain he would eventually charm her into bed but he hated her reasons for moving in her equipment was everywhere in the kitchen the living room in the guest room he couldnt walk through his own house without facing a camera it baffled him that an obviously intelligent woman actually believed she was going to take videos of ghosts still there were some advantages if he cooked she cheerfully did the clearingup and it wasnt a hardship to come in from the fields or the barn and find her at the kitchen table making her notes on her little laptop computer she claimed she felt most at home in the kitchen though she didnt know a skillet from a saucepan so she spent most of her time there hed gotten through the first night though it was true that hed done a great deal of tossing and turning at the idea that she was just down the hall and if hed been grittyeyed and cranky the next morning hed worked it off by the time he finished the milking and came in to cook breakfast and she came down for breakfast he reflected though she didnt eat much barely in his opinion enough to sustain life but she drank coffee shared the morning paper with him asked questions lord the woman was full of questions still it was pleasant to have company over the first meal of the day someone who looked good smelled good had something to say for herself the problem was he found himself thinking about how she had looked had smelled what she had said when he went out to work he couldnt remember another woman hanging in his mind quite so long or quite so strongly that was something that could worry a man if he let it shane mackade didnt like to worry and he wasnt used to thinking about a woman who didnt seem to be giving him the same amount of attention it was simply a matter of adjustment or so he told himself she was a guest in his home now and a man didnt take advantage of a guest which was why he wanted her out again as soon as possible so that he could and if he just didnt think overmuch about how pretty she looked tapping away at her keyboard those little round glasses perched on her nose the eyes behind them dark with concentration her long narrow feet crossed neatly at the ankles he didnt suffer but damn it how was he supposed to not think about it when he banged a pot for the third time rebecca tipped down her glasses and peered at him over them shane i dont want you to feel that you have to cook for me youre not going to do it he muttered i can dial the telephone why dont i order something and have it delivered he turned then his eyes bland youre not in new york now sweetie nobody delivers out here oh she let out a little sigh took off her glasses there was tension radiating from him then again there was always something radiating from him he was the most alive she decided man shed ever come across and right now he seemed terribly tense probably a cow problem sympathetic she rose to go over and rub his shoulders youve had a rough one it must be tiring working in the fields like that hours on end then dealing with the stock its easier on a decent nights sleep he said through gritted teeth her bony hands were only tensing muscles that already ached youre awfully tight why dont you sit down ill open a can of something make sandwiches i dont want a sandwich its the best i can do he spun around caught her i want you her heart lurched did a quick nervous jig in her throat before she managed to swallow it yes i believe weve established that she didnt gulp audibly didnt tremble noticeably the temper in his eyes was easier to face than the passion beneath it you also agreed to a professional atmosphere i know what i agreed to his eyes green and stormy bored into hers i dont have to like it no you dont has it occurred to you that youre angry because im not reacting in the manner youre accustomed to having women react were not talking about women were talking about you you and me here and now were talking about sex she answered and gave his arms a squeeze before backing away and im considering it considering it he could have throttled her what like considering whether to have chicken or fish for dinner nobodys that coldblooded its sensible deal with it with a jerk of her shoulder she went back to the table and sat deal with it he thought boiling over is that right so youll let me know when youve finished considering and come to a conclusion youll be the first she told him and slipped on her glasses he battled back temper it was a hard war to win for a mackade coldblooded reason was what she understood he decided so hed give it to her and hoped she choked on it you know now that im considering it occurs to me that you may be a little cool for my taste and definitely bony i like a wanner softer sort she felt her jaw clench then deliberately relaxed it a good try farm boy uninterest insult and challenge im sure it works a good percentage of the time she made herself smile at him but youre going to have to do better with me right now ill do better without you since he obviously wasnt going to win where he was he strode to the door and out all he needed was to decide which one of his brothers to go pick a fight with rebecca let out a long breath and took her glasses off so that she could rub her hands over her face that she thought had been a close one how could she have known that the barely controlled fury the frazzled desire that absolutely innate arrogance of his would be so exciting so endearing shed almost given in the instant he whirled around and grabbed her she might have thrown any lingering doubts to the winds but there would have been no way to control any part of the situation with him in that volatile mood she would have been taken and as glorious as that sounded in theory she was afraid of the fact if he only knew she was waiting now only to settle her own nerves and to be certain he was calm she knew that when shane was calm and amused he would be a delightful and tender lover edgy and needy hed be demanding impatient so they would both wait until the moment was right she sat back her eyes closed it was peaceful now with that whirlwind shane could create around him gone she missed it a little even as she reveled in the quiet she found it so easy to relax here in this room in this house even the creak of the boards settling at night was comforting and the smell of wood smoke and meat cooking the hint of cinnamon and apple the muffled crackle of the fire behind the door of the stove such things made home home after all she froze her eyes still closed her body as tense as a stretched wire nothing was cooking so why could she smell it there was no fire so why could she hear it slowly she opened her eyes for a moment the room seemed to waver and her vision dimmed a castiron stove a fire in the raised hearth pies cooling on the wide windowsill and the sun streaming in a blink and it was gone tile and wood the hum of the refrigerator yet the scents remained clear strong like an echo deep in her mind she thought she heard a babys fretful crying all right rebecca she said shakily you wanted it looks like youve got it rising quickly she darted into the living room amid the cozy chairs the rocker the books stacked haphazardly on shelves was equipment thered been no temperature drop registered but energy was crackling she didnt need a gauge to tell her she could feel it electricity singing along her skin bringing the hair on the nape of her neck stiffly up she wasnt alone the baby was crying with a hand pressed to her mouth she stared at her recorder would she hear that piping wail on tape when she played it back upstairs one of the bedroom doors closed quietly she could hear the squeak and roll of a rocker over wood and the crying died the babys being rocked she thought almost giddy with delight soothed loved that was what she felt through all the energy all the excitement love deep abiding and rich the house was alive with it tears trailed down her cheeks as the warmth of it enfolded her when it was quiet again when she was alone again she picked up the recorder and reported back at her laptop she detailed every instant of the event and copied it to disk then she got a bottle of wine from the refrigerator and celebrated her success it was nearly midnight when shane got back and she was right where hed left her hed vented most of his temper no one had been much interested in a fight but devin had managed to joke him out of his foul mood he was afraid it might come back now that he was faced with her sitting there smiling her hair tousled from her hands her glasses slipping down her nose dont you ever quit im obsessivecompulsive she said very carefully hi hi his brows drew together as he noted the flushed cheeks and sloppy grin what are you doing nothing ive been playing with the ghosts theyre very friendly ghosts much nicer than the barlows he came closer there was a bottle of wine next to her computer all but empty and a glass halffull he took another closer look at her face and snorted out a laugh youre plowed dr knight does that mean drunk if so im forced to agree with your diagnosis im very very very drunk she lifted the glass managed to sip without pouring it down the front of her shirt i dont know how it happened probly cause i kept drinking lord she was cute sprawled in the chair her eyes all bright and glowing her smile was well he thought stupid it was satisfying to realize that she could be stupid about something thatll do it gently he braced a finger under her chin to keep her head from wobbling did you eat anything nope cant cook that was so funny she sputtered with laughter hi yeah hi it was impossible to be angry with her now she looked so sweet and so incredibly drunk he slipped the glasses the rest of the way off her nose and set them aside lets get you upstairs baby arent you going to kiss me with that she slid gracefully from chair to floor with a goodnatured oath he reached down to pick her up she might be drunk but she had damn good aim her mouth fastened on his in a long sucking eyepopping kiss mmm youre so tasty riding on that taste and on the wine swimming in her head she flung out her arms to fasten them around his neck come down here okay and kiss me again it just makes my head go all funny and my heart pound want to feel my heart pound she snatched his hand and slapped it over her breast feel that yeah he could feel it all right cut it out his system was jangled and he had to hold on to honor with a slippery fist youre impaired sweetie i feel wonderful dont you want to feel me this time his curse wasnt quite as goodnatured he hauled her up and couldnt avoid the cheerful kisses she plastered over his face and neck stop it rebecca his voice cracked with desperation as his body went on red alert behave yourself dont want to always behaving tired of it let me just get this off for you with more enthusiasm than finesse she fumbled at the buttons of his shirt i love the way you look in your undershirt all those muscles let me have them now he was cursing bitterly as he carried her from the room youre going to pay for this i swear a hangovers going to be the least of it she giggled kicking her legs letting her hands run through his long thick hair she weighed next to nothing but the muscles in his arms still began to quiver his knees were going weak he nearly yelped when she bit his ear oh i love this house i love you i love everything can we have wine in bed no and youd better he made the mistake of looking at her and her mouth fused to his honorable or not he was human the heat ran through him tormenting tempting with a long desperate moan he teetered on the stairs as he lost himself in those wonderful willing lips rebecca her name was a plea youre driving me crazy ive always wanted to drive someone crazy then i could fix them cause im a psychiatrist wiggling against him she laughed uproariously her fingers tugged on the neck of the undershirt shed uncovered then snuck beneath to flesh that was growing damp with sweat kiss me some more you know the way you do when i can feel your teeth with my tongue i just love when you do that oh my god as a prayer it was perfectly sincere he repeated it over and over again as he carried her to the guest room it was his intention to dump her on the bed and make as quick and as dignified an exit as his scattered wits and aching loins would allow but she pulled tugged and had him flopping onto the big soft bed with her on top of her feels good she sighed then arched oh my he moaned pitifully what was left of his mind scrambled so that all of the blood drained out of it and down he knew his eyes rolled back in his head when she latched those narrow hands on to his butt and squeezed im not doing this his breath was panting out with the effort to keep himself from ripping off her clothes are too soon as we get these pants off his hand vised over hers when she reached for the snap of his jeans he stared at that glowing cheerfully seductive face and with a titanic effort reminded himself there were rules to the game i want you to stop this right now none too gently he hauled her arms up over her head and pinned them the only problem with that was that the position pushed his body more firmly to hers and damn her she wouldnt keep still keep your hands off me damn it she grinned at him lazily experimenting with the sensations that worked their way through her alcoholic haze whenever she rocked her hips i promise not to hurt you a snort of laughter escaped you look so fierce come on and kiss me i ought to strangle you but he did kiss her as much from frustration as from need and the kiss was raw and wild and just a little mean when he managed to pull himself back her eyes were heavy and glazed but those tempting lips curved mmmore his body ached his head throbbed youre going to remember when i make love with you rebecca he said tightly youre going to be stonecold sober and youre going to remember every instant of it and before im finished with you youre not going to know your own name okay she murmured agreeably as her heavy eyes drooped okay then she yawned hugely and passed out he lay there several minutes fighting for breath fighting for strength he could feel the steady rise and fall of the breasts that were crushed under him the clean angles of her body the limp droop of the hands he still held imprisoned youre not going to hate me in the morning baby he muttered as he levered himself away but i might just hate you as an afterthought he tossed a quilt over her and left her fully dressed right down to her shoes to sleep it off he didnt sleep at all as he had been all his life shane was up before the sun but this morning he wasnt whistling he did no more than glower down the hall toward rebeccas room before he trooped downstairs and outside to begin the morning chores if the two h students who worked with him on weekday mornings noticed he wasnt his usual cheerful self they were wise enough to make no comment cows were milked and tended pigs were fed eggs were gathered there were bales of hay to be split and spread the dogs danced around as was their habit but after a short time it seemed they sensed things were not quite as they should be so they slunk off to lie low under the back porch the sun was up by the time shane came back into the house to clean up and start his breakfast physical labor had helped work off most of his black mood his sense of the ridiculous was dealing with the rest here he was a grown man he told himself with a reputation for charming the ladies and he was more frustrated than hed been as a green adolescent taking that first tentative step into female territory it was laughable if you looked at it from a little distance seeing the cool sarcastic and quickwitted dr knight wildly drunk was certainly worth the price of a ticket he thought about it as he fried up bacon shed certainly looked cute sitting there with her glasses sliding off her nose and that stupid grin on her face and a man couldnt complain overmuch about having a pretty woman wrap herself around him no matter how frustrating it had been of course a different kind of man would have taken advantage of the situation a different kind of man would have let her pull his clothes off done the same courtesy for her a different kind of man would have plowed right into that hot little body and because he was tormenting himself he took several long steadying breaths she was damn lucky he wasnt a different kind of man in fact as he saw it she owed him big that made him a bit happier as he poured himself a cup of coffee then again she was going to suffer plenty as the smells of breakfast the zing of caffeine the simple beauty of the morning worked on him he decided he could even feel a little sorry for her she was going to wake up with a champion hangover and a lot of blank spaces he was going to enjoy filling in those blanks watching her cringe with embarrassment it would even the scales somewhat enough he thought so that he could be compassionate hed give her some aspirin along with the mackade remedy for the morning after and if he got a couple of good laughs at her expense well she deserved them poor baby he mused scrambling eggs briskly shed probably sleep until noon then wake up pull the covers over her pounding head and pray for a quick merciful death all in all it was a fair trade for the miserable night hed spent he was very surprised when he turned the burner off under the skillet reached for a plate and saw her standing in the kitchen doorway his brows lifted as he studied her definitely pale he mused heavyeyed still in her robe her hair was wet which meant shed probably tried to drown herself in the shower he grinned just a little evilly hows it going doc cautiously she cleared her throat fine she glanced toward the table the evidence of her crime was still there the bottle of wine the glass still holding what she hadnt been able to gulp down she was going to have to face it i guess i got a little carried away you could say that looking forward to the next few minutes he closed the cupboard door perhaps a bit harder than necessary she didnt wince at the bang and that disappointed him around here wed say you were drunk as a skunk she did wince at that im not much of a drinker as a rule it was foolish on top of an empty stomach i want to apologize and to thank you for getting me to bed his grin was rapidly fading she was entirely too composed for his liking hows the head the head oh she smiled relieved that he would care enough to ask fine i dont get hangovers i must have a good metabolism he simply stared at her was there no justice you dont have a hangover no but i could use some coffee she walked toward the pot no stumbling shane noted as his resentment grew no squinting away from the sunlight not even one quiet pitiful moan you drank the best part of a bottle of wine and you feel fine mmm hungry she smiled at him again as she poured coffee i really was an idiot last night and you were very understanding yeah he was rapidly losing his appetite i was a brick he certainly had been she mused and he deserved an explanation along with her apology you see id had this breakthrough and the expression on his face warned her to fill in those details later youre angry with me you should be i was awful she laid a hand on his arm totally out of control and you were so restrained and sweet sweet he spit the word you remember what happened of course a bit surprised that hed think shed forget she leaned back against the counter as she sipped her coffee i was well pawing you is the only way to describe it not my usual style im very grateful you understood it was the wine talking i wouldnt have blamed you for leaving me sprawled on the floor here because she was more amused at herself than embarrassed her eyes laughed over her cup i must have been quite a handful i cant imagine a ridiculously drunk woman is very tempting but you were very decent very patient she didnt even have the courtesy to be humiliated he fumed and worse much worse she had the gall to make him into some sort of saint you were obnoxious i know then she laughed and cut the last thread of his control still it was an experience ive never been so drunk and dont think i care to be again i was lucky i did it in private and it was you who had to deal with me can i have a piece of this bacon he was calm he told himself listening to the steady if loud beating of blood in his head so he spoke calmly quietly are you sober now rebecca asajudge she nipped at a slice of bacon and im going to stay that way for a long time slowly he nodded his eyes on hers head clear all your faculties in order she started to answer but something in his tone tripped a warning bell warily she looked over at him the dark dangerous gleam in his eyes had her backing up a step shane he yanked her back and sent the coffee cup she still held flying so you werent tempting his mouth full of fury and frustration crushed down on hers i was sweet he added swinging her around until her back rapped into the refrigerator understanding patient between snappedoff words he continued to assault her mouth yes no how was she supposed to think with all the blood roaring in her head you damned near killed me he jerked up her chin and plundered shooting vicious spurts of fire into every cell of her body you know how much i wanted you get the picture he gave her one a very vivid one of hard impatient lips rough ready hands a body that was tight with tension and steaming with heat she fought for breath fought to stay upright as what was left of her mind went to mush she was melting against him again soft fragrant wax his blood pumped in response to those soft sexy sounds she made in her throat eager helpless sounds that turned frustrated lust into a rage of desperate need thats it he muttered and swung her up in his arms with a jolt of panic she pushed a hand against his chest wait the hell i will his eyes flashed at hers all but searing her youd better say no loud and clear and say it fast rebecca tell me you dont want me dont want this and make damn sure you mean it under her palm she felt the furious beating of his heart and her hand trembled shed thought it was fear but it wasnt oh no it wasnt fear it was longing i cant she let out a whoosh of breath i wouldnt mean it triumph suited him i know chapter eight she wanted to remember everything to seal somehow every moment every sound every taste into her mind and heart she wanted to be able to recapture this incredible feeling of being carried in strong arms of being wanted and wanted with such ferocity by a beautiful man of being sampled every few steps by skilled and hungry lips she didnt care if he was gentle or rough patient or frenzied as long as he didnt stop wanting her then he paused on the stairs his mouth swooping down on hers in a way that made any thought of the future float away to make room for the allencompassing present on a moan of sheer delight she wrapped her arms around him and let her own greedy mouth savor the taste of his face his neck the tangy flavor of him poured into her until her head swarmed with sound revolved with halfformed images the sheer force of her appetite made her shudder this she thought dizzily was only the beginning it no longer surprised her to find that her fingers were fighting with the buttons of his shirt she wanted to feel him touch him everywhere all at once he was out of breath and laughing by the time he made it to his own bedroom this is a lot like last night he tumbled to the bed with her on top of her only better cant you get this thing off she was laughing too hadnt realized it was possible when desire was squeezing every throbbing inch of her body with sweaty fists yours is easier with one expert stroke he parted her robe she was milkpale narrow of torso with a low animal sound he took her breast in his mouth the shock of it screamed through her incited an avalanche of new and unexplored sensations even as she struggled to clear her mind to record them the hands that had been busy on his shirt dropped away to grip frantically at the neat spread beneath each tug each nip of his clever and hungry mouth shot arrows of golden heat straight to her center each arrow erupted into a dozen more flametipped missiles that streaked under her skin over it with dizzying speed how could anyone survive these sensations she wondered how could anyone live without them he had her naked in seconds and feasted on her there was panic now panic at the thought that it was possible to die from pleasure her skin was hot and damp quivering at each pass and stroke of those big callused hands tossed by a tidal wave she rolled over the bed with him desperate to keep up he couldnt get enough all that babysmooth skin those long narrow bones the small applefirm breasts he could smell her shower on her and simple soap had never been so arousing he thought he could eat her alive bite by ravenous bite she was writhing under him wrestling over him her hands fast and frantic those wonderful eyes the eyes he could never quite seem to get out of his head were dark as whiskey now and vividly intense everywhere he touched she responded as though shed never been touched before shuddering arching flowing a purr a moan a gasp no woman hed ever known had ever made him feel so powerful so free so needy damn it dizzy with desire he sat up to drag at his boots she reared up wrapping that wonderful naked body around his making his vision waver as she raced hurried kisses over his neck and shoulder hurry she pulled up his undershirt and ravished his back oh i love your body i just mmm she slid her breasts over the flesh shed exposed and drove them both mad with an oath he flipped her over into his lap his mouth found hers waiting and avid her need as wild as his poured into him like a shot of raw whiskey to please them both he cupped her and she was hot and wet he felt her body stiffen tasted the warm rush of impact as her breath caught and expelled she went wild nails scraping hips pumping dazzling him with her unrestricted greed for pleasure ive got to be inside you his voice was harsh his body frantic near violence he shoved her back on the bed yanked at his jeans he couldnt remember his hands ever fumbling before but they did now in his outrageous and overwhelming rush to possess i want to fill you i want to watch you take me hurry her hands were already gripping his hips oh to feel like that again to know he would send her flying again i cant stand it she arched up to welcome he drove inside her in one hard stroke and froze shock disbelief terror tangled with desperation when she cried out when he felt himself ram mercilessly through her virginity the muscles in his arms quivered from the strain and his eyes halfblind locked frantically on hers rebecca god dont move what she was lost delirious oh the extraordinary feel of him inside her inside her body filling her with the sheer glory of invasion what for gods sake dont move he said it through gritted teeth as he fumbled for control his body quivered on the tether he yanked ruthlessly to hold it in place sweet god she was so hot and tight and wet im not going to hurt you anymore he couldnt get his breath simply couldnt pull in enough air just give me a minute what she said again with a primal instinct she locked her legs around him and rose up dont the animal took over clawed aside everything but the urgent need to mate and leaped free helpless to resist he took her plunging in deep driving her to match his frenzied pace until the world seemed to contract to nothing but two bodies linked the hard slap of flesh on flesh the explosive burst of air expelling from labored lungs the musky smells of sweat and sex and that glorious sensation of slicked bodies sliding the dark pleasure swamped him emptied him weak he collapsed on her and tried to gather his scattered wits im sorry was all he could manage and that was no more than a whisper he had to move knew he had to move but he simply couldnt no experience in his life had ever sapped him like this he told himself it was because she had been innocent and the guilt was draining him she was shuddering beneath him quick violent shudders that damned him he was mortally afraid she was crying rebecca you should have told me there had to be some way he could soothe her but this was simply beyond his experience told you she repeated in a voice almost too faint to hear i wouldnt have pushed you i wouldnt havehell i probably would have he found the strength to ease back and look at her face her eyes were closed her lips parted as the breath raced through them i hurt you i must have hurt you her eyes opened then the gold was hardly more than a thin ring around the pupils shock he thought cursing himself again but to his confusion those swollen lips curved no you didnt it felt wonderful i feel wonderful but does it always feel like that she let out a long satisfied sigh so overwhelming so huge as if nothing could stop you from getting from one incredible moment to the next its so she sighed again primitive i no yes what the hell was he supposed to say to that to her i cant think straight yet hearing that made her smile deepen i wasnt sure id be any good at it but i was wasnt i you what the devil was going on she wasnt crying she wasnt upset at all she looked like a cat whod just dined on a platoon of canaries more for his own benefit than for hers he spoke slowly carefully rebecca youd never been with a man before i wasnt particularly interested in a man before she found the strength and started to lift her arms to circle him then her smile faded i wasnt good at it i did something wrong youre not feeling the way im feeling you destroyed me shane rolled off her to lie on his back and scrub his hands over his face i had no control even when i realized i couldnt stop i should have been able to stop im sorry if i didnt do everything right stiff now with embarrassment she sat up it was my first time and id think youd have some patience he swore at her and snagged her arm before she could climb regally from the bed look at me at me he repeated until her sulky eyes met his im not going to give you a damn grade but ill teil you this i want you right now i want you again so much i could swallow you whole it doesnt even seem to matter that i feel guilty that i was rough if id known i would have been gentle i would have taken some care i would have tried you didnt hurt me shane something in her heart shifted as she lifted a hand to his cheek i didnt tell you because i thought it wouldnt happen if you knew i thought youd want someone with experience who the hell are you he murmured why cant i understand you im still working on understanding myself leaning forward she touched her lips to his then sighed as he drew her close to cuddle this was the most beautiful first of my life i want to feel this way again youre an incredible lover how would you know surrendering he nuzzled at her throat ah rebecca hmm is something wrong with those academic types howd they manage to let you get away she rubbed her curved lips over his shoulder if youd known me even a year ago you wouldnt ask you wouldnt have looked at me twice i always look at women at least twice any woman she chuckled enjoying the feel of his muscles under her hands i was a mess believe me it didnt sting to admit it now not now that she nestled in his arms still groggy from loving a certified geek amused he drew her back baby no geeks ever had eyes like yours i dont care whats in your brain those eyes are pure sin she blinked they are he laughed and hugged her hard were going to have to make love a lot it dulls your wits he tipped her head back kissed her lightly ive got work that cant be put off or wed get started right now testing she slid her hands over his chest can you work fast his heart stuttered before they could get into trouble he snagged her hands and lifted them to his mouth i think today i can work real fast she had work to do herself but stayed where she was when shane went downstairs he would have to eat a cold breakfast she mused and found herself wonderfully smug at the knowledge that hed hungered for her more than for food shed tempted him destroyed him she thought grinning at the ceiling his words what a powerful wonderful thing it was to be a woman as much as she would have loved snuggling in bed with him all morning she was glad to have the time alone now she would be able to relive and savor every moment every sensation every surprise dr rebecca knight prodigy lifelong nerd academic wonder and social oddity had a lover women would kill for and at least for a little while he was all hers with a throaty sigh she lay back amid the tumbled pillows holding the excitement the wonder to her he had the face of some dark clever angel the hands of a working farmer and the body of well why be conservative the body of a god and if you went beyond the surface which was outstanding he was kind and sweet volatile certainly but that only added to the package he was sturdy the kind of man who did what had to be done who worked hard loved his family respected his roots laughed at himself for heavens sake he even cooked in her estimation he was as close to perfect as the species came and wasnt it a fine stroke of luck that she should fall in love with perfection she reared up in bed with a jolt that was a textbook reaction she reminded herself swallowing panic she was mixing emotion with a physical experience enlarging affection and attraction into a complicated equation it was a very typical female response sex equals love she knew better than that she was a psychiatrist very slowly she lay back again intelligence training even common sense had nothing with it she laid a hand on her heart gingerly of course she was in love with him shed been in love with him all along the cliche of love at first sight shed ignored it given it different names fit her newly developed sophistication over it but it had been there well what now not that long ago she would have run like a rabbit no doubt if she greeted shane with a declaration hed run like a rabbit but wasnt it just one more new experience an emotion to be added to the others shed finally allowed herself to feel the only sensible course of action was to accept it and deal with whatever came next as best she could she had weeks left to enjoy what she could have and enough experience to know how to live without what she couldnt have it might hurt in the end but she could accept that too much worse than pain she well knew was having nothing at all with the first days of september gleefully pouring out the last of the summer heat shane was sweaty when he headed for the house at midday he was filthy a little bloody where hed scraped his knuckle on a bolt and afraid he might smell a bit reminiscently of the manure spreader hed just finished with but hed also worked hard enough and fast enough to carve out two good hours of free time he intended to occupy rebecca for every moment of them he knew he had a stupid grin on his face and didnt care he wanted her in bed again quickly he needed to see if it had just been the novelty of her or something more all he was sure of was that hed never been so involved so lost in a woman as he had been with her because hed never found it otherwise he believed lovemaking was meant to be a pleasure but with rebecca it had gone beyond pleasure into delirium he was looking forward to taking the trip again there she was at the table working away her glasses perched long fingers flying he started to grin and a spear pierced his heart painfully when she looked up and smiled at him her face lighting up you really are beautiful he murmured and discovered he was clutching the doorknob for balance had a woman any woman ever knocked him off his feet before she could only stare at him no one had ever called her beautiful and at the moment he looked as though he meant it then he grinned and the dazed look left his eyes now if you could only cook i managed some iced tea thats a start and it might do something to cool his suddenly dry throat he took out the pitcher poured a generous glass and gulped choked ah how many bags did you use doc about a dozen he shook his head and hoped his eyes would stay in their sockets the stuff in his glass was as thick and strong as a truckers fist well it ought to get the blood moving she snickered sorry im useless in the kitchen it probably shouldnt have steeped for three hours either probably not cautiously he set the glass aside he wouldnt have been overly surprised if it simply marched away under its own power we can dilute it ive got a fiftygallon drum outside i could make a sandwich when she rose he held up a hand thanks anyway ill do it no dont come near me i smell like the wrong side of a cow enjoying the little bubbles of anticipation bursting in her blood she traced her tongue over her lips youre awfully dirty she said she liked it and sweaty take off your shirt a lightning bolt of desire flashed into his gut youre very demanding i like that in a woman still he backed up again i dont want to touch you youre all neat and tidy and my hands are covered with things you wouldnt want on that pretty sweater she looked down at them then let out a little hum of concern youre bleeding just scraped a knuckle let me wash up ill do it she took his hand before he could turn on the tap she bathed his hand herself knitting her brows over the scrape he had the pleasure of standing there while she soaped his hands rubbed them gently between hers he began to fantasize about taking a shower with her wet bodies slicked skin rising steam i guess youll live but you should be more careful she sniffed wrinkled her nose what have you been doing out there he grinned spreading manure her eyes popped wide with your hands the intriguing little fantasy burst he laughed so hard he thought his ribs would crack no darling weve got technology now even out here in the boonies glad to hear it she turned away intent on helping him with his lunch and bumped solidly into the refrigerator damn it i havent done that in ages feeling ridiculous she snatched her glasses off i used to forget i was wearing them and walk into things all the time he sent her a curious look i didnt think you forgot anything only about myself ask me about anything else and ill give you chapter and verse wool she turned and straightened a platter of ham in her hand from the refrigerator excuse me maybe im thinking about buying some sheep tell me about wool dont be ridiculous he shrugged reached for the bread i guess i found something you dont know about he didnt have to look to know her eyes had narrowed he could hear it in her voice an animal fiber forming the protective covering or fleece of sheep or other hairy mammals such as goats or camels wool is mainly obtained by shearing fleece from living animals cleaning removes the fatty substance which is purified to make lanolin shall i go on amused impressed he studied her thats very cool where were you when i was in high school in a snooty boarding school in switzerland if my calculations are accurate i imagine they always are he murmured the tone the cool defense in it told him this was something to be explored later she spoke of boarding school the way he had once spoken of liver as something highly detested its not just remembering facts he said casually you obviously apply them so how did you decide what to study it was making her uncomfortable she couldnt help it however shallow and politically incorrect it might be she preferred his interest in her body over his interest in her brain initially i was told what to study my parents had a very specific blueprint for my education later i concentrated on what held interest for me her voice was cool and clipped but he wasnt quite ready to let the subject go he turned to get out the mustard you must have wowed your teachers she remained where she was still holding the platter they were selected for their credentials in working with gifted children my parents were relieved if i didnt get hauled down to the principals office for a full week yours must have been thrilled with you theyre both very successful in their own right she said flatly my father is one of the top vascular surgeons in the country and my mother is a respected industrial chemist they expected me to excel any other questions swampy ground again he mused sorry that hed put that note of formality in her voice he turned looked at her and was equally sorry hed put that distant look in her eye just now he wanted to see her smile again just one he said what have you got on under that shirt relief loosened the muscles that had knotted her shoulders the usual oh yeah she did smile as she set the platter on the table maybe youd like to see for yourself thats just what i had in mind she nipped around the far side of the table as he came forward after lunch his lips curved his eyes danced he looked wonderfully dangerous i dont want lunch he circled so did she you have to keep your strength up to spread that manure i had a big breakfast a big late breakfast he feinted nearly snatched her but she slipped away laughing youre quick i know he faked again and as she pivoted snaked out an arm to wrap around her waist when he lifted her off her feet she squealed with laughter im quicker it was dizzying to realize he could hold her suspended with one arm dizzying and exciting i let you catch me bull he kissed her hard then tucked his other arm around her to swing her in three quick circles youre making me drunk again laughing she clutched at his shoulders and enjoyed the ride good he swung her again again caught up in the joy of it the joy of her the sound of her laugh was thrilling familiar the feel of her body against his suddenly as vital as home put me down you fool john her head rolled back the room spun suppers burning she could smell it the bottom of the pot would be scorched for certain she could smell him sweat and smoke and animal beneath her apron the baby she carried quickened panic and something else clogged shanes throat he set her on her feet still supporting her as he shook her rebecca what is it its happening again like last night her face was sheetwhite and her voice became faint and dreamy theres stew in the pot burning in the pot did you bring in more wood for the fire with her eyes unfocused she pressed a hand to her stomach this ones a girl johnnies going to have a sister then as if a light had been switched on her eyes cleared sharpened my equipment she broke away and raced to the living room look at this just look its registering higher than last night theres so much energy i can feel it on my skin like electric shocks while he watched saying nothing she began to mutter to herself checking dials gauges monitors all business now her movements brisk and precise she turned to her recorder event commenced at and five seconds sharp sensory stimuli visual olfactory as if distracted she ran a hand over her hair then competently recounted everything that had happened an overall sense of wellbeing she finished of happiness love its possible sexual anticipation was caused by previous stimulation rather than the event or was enhanced by previous stimulation she tapped her finger on her lips thinking end of event and fiftyeight seconds which at four minutes and fiftythree seconds makes it the longest to date on a long breath she set the recorder down and the strongest she murmured previous stimulation she pulled herself out of her thoughts and turned to shane im sorry what is that what youre calling it previous stimulation technically she dragged her hands through her hair again until it stood up in spikes that was incredible absolutely incredible last night i was sitting in the kitchen and i could see it change it was smaller and there was a fire in a little stone hearth pies on the windowsill there was a baby crying shane excitement sparkled in her eyes and seemed to shimmer in the air around her i got the baby crying on tape i recorded it pressing her hands to her cheeks she laughed i could hardly believe it myself even after i played it back half a dozen times thats why i got out the wine a little toast that turned into several big ones i meant to tell you this morning but we got distracted distracted finally the edgy tone of his voice the flat look in his eyes pierced through her exhilaration the glow faded from her cheeks he was pale his face set his eyes hard why are you angry because this is nonsense he tossed back preferring anger to the heady sensation of fear and because i dont like being called a distraction or a previous stimulation thats not it at all dont you start on me keep your degrees in your pocket and dont poke in my brain youre not angry she said quietly youre scared for an instant his eyes were lethal ive got things to do she darted after him grabbing his arm when they got to the kitchen you said youd help me shane you gave me your word on it leave it alone toughly he shook her off leave me alone she simply stepped into his path and blocked it another man she knew might have mowed her down and shane had the temper for it as well as the strength but he also had what made him shane you had the same experience i did felt the same things i did i can see it in your face he reached out picked her up and set her aside i said leave it alone who were john and sarah she let out a breath when he stopped on his way to the door her name was sarah who were they shane who were we a few minutes ago im exactly the same person i am now as i was a few minutes ago and so are you if youre going to keep playing this game leave me out of it john and sarah she said again was it john and sarah mackade would i find their names in your family bible he whirled back stalked to the refrigerator with one rigid hand he jerked open the door took out a beer after twisting the top off violently he tossed it aside and drank half the bottle down my greatgrandparents she let out a long long sigh i see and they lived here in this house they were the ones who tried to save the young union soldier the day of the battle so the story goes what happened here just now youve experienced similar things before he caught her quick look toward her computer and set his teeth no no way in hell youre going to use me like some damn lab rat all right im sorry this upsets you she walked to him to run her hands up his arms but i think you need to know that for several years now ive had dreams and now i know they were about this house and those people he lowered his beer but said nothing rebecca waited a moment wondering if this kind of intimacy was more than either of them was prepared for the dreams were one of the major reasons i began research into this field they were are real shane ive seen this room this house as it was more than a hundred years ago and ive seen john and sarah i dont know if you have any old photographs of them to corroborate that i can certainly describe them to you at different periods of their lives here together i can even tell you things she thought felt wanted i think you can do the same with him no he said it flatly finally a lie for an honest man a defense for a brave one i dont believe in any of that in frustration she lifted her hands do you think im making it up that im making all of what just happened up i think youve got too many things crowded in that majorleague brain of yours to ease his hot throat he took another swig of beer and i prefer reality she could have told him he was in denial but that would only have made him angry and possibly more resistant patience she decided patience and understanding would be more productive all around all right well let it go as long as you understand you can talk to me about it anytime youre not my therapist no im not her voice was entirely too reasonable he slammed down the bottle i want you in bed understand thats what i want thats what i need just you just me grabbing her hand he dragged her from the room dreams are just dreams and ghosts belong in bad movies so you can just turn off that brain of yours distraction my butt he was all but heaving her up the stairs and she felt twin sensations of alarm and arousal it wasnt meant as an insult too many damn people inside you to suit me i like it simple he let her go to sit down on the edge of the bed and pull off his boots im not simple she said quietly not the way you mean this is simple boots dispatched he rose to pull off his shirt unhook his belt i want you i break out in a sweat just thinking about you thats basic rebecca thats simple it was love every bit as much as need that had her moving to him wrapping her arms around him im here she lifted her head and drew his mouth down to hers she gentled him as he would a skittish animal soothing hands welcoming lips he told himself that if this was familiar this sinking into her this allowing her to smooth away his worries it was because he had lain with her here only that morning but as he fell into the sweet seductive rhythm of loving her it was as if there had been no one before would be no one after only the texture of her skin would stay in his memory the taste of her mouth the sound of her sigh and as she rose to meet him in that fluid movement of comfortable sex part of his mind fretted that he would never want could never want anyone else even as he tumbled over that last edge of pleasure he held himself back from a bigger more dangerous fall chapter nine ive now had three events at the farm the last was during the night i felt such grief such tearing grief there was a candle by the bed burning for a moment i thought there was a figure standing by the window just standing looking out at the night while the grief was in me it was also there shimmering around that figure a shared yet separate pain i thought it was shane and started to get out of bed to go to him but he was asleep beside me and there was no one standing there at all i knew clearly that it was john and sarah and that their son was dead i knew this even before shane stirred restlessly beside me he dreams as i do and he feels as i do but he doesnt want to speak of it theyre part of him the people who lived here who remain here in some fashion not only through blood but through spirit i wonder why they seem to be part of me as well it upsets him so i didnt tell him perhaps this is wrong its certainly unprofessional but im learning that love has its own way i love him so much and in my own limited fashion would protect him from what haunts him i wonder what his feelings are for me but i dont ask i have to protect myself as well i can talk to him about anything but that anything at all and i never run out of words hes in the fields now there is always so much work that must be done yet he never seems to tire of it or resent it for myself in this first dizzying rush of love i realize i could spend every second of every day with him and still not have enough time its a wonderful liberating and humbling thing this love im so grateful ive had the chance to experience it if i could i would take one moment any single moment at all that ive had with him crystallize it preserve it and carry it with me then in all the years to come i could take it out not just to remember but to relive love gives you the oddest fantasies rebecca heard the bark of the dogs and the voices like a woman hiding a secret treasure she saved her document and changed screens devin opened the door followed by boys and dogs and all the noise that comes with them sorry didnt mean to bust in on you thats all right automatically she lowered a hand to rub at the dogs who came to greet her i was just finished cassies just like the rest of the women in the county figures shane must be starving he set a dish on the counter she sent over an apple cobbler its great bryan informed rebecca we had some of the other one she made already obviously at home he poked into the refrigerator are you writing your book connor approached more slowly his eyes on her laptop not right now do you use a computer he was studying hers with naked envy we get to use them in school sometimes but theyre not like this one this ones loaded want to try it he goggled really he looked at his father then put his hands behind his back i dont know how to work this kind nothing to it recognizing the look in his eyes she laughed and took his hand to draw him closer i can show you ive got everything backed up now youve done it devin murmured hes going to start pining for one i can get you a deal on a used one with a grin she rose and pointed at her chair sit down and give it a go you must know the basic functions sure the first thing he did was type his name connor mackade does it play any games bryan wanted to know nope its just a workhorse losing interest immediately bryan cast his eyes on the cobbler forget it devin warned we came by to give shane a hand with the haying he told rebecca you can expect the rest to descend before long oh she glanced toward the window hes out there now mowing it baling it devin told her first you mow then you rake then you bale right you guys head out when youre done here and dont pester dr knight she followed him out to the porch and paused outside the door devin you lived here a long time most of my life have you ever had any unusual experiences of a paranormal nature she added when he flashed a grin youre asking if i think the place is haunted sure it is she shook her head you say that so casually ive lived with it you get used to it not everyone he followed her gaze to where shane guided the tractor over the mowed hay shanes got a stubborn streak so ive noticed and when it comes down to it hes got a sensitive nature devin grinned again hed bloody my nose for that one but he does lived on a farm all his life but he suffers if an animals in pain or if he loses one cant take it as a matter of course theres a lot of leftover emotion in this house it gets to him yet he lives here he loves it devin said simply every stone can you picture him anyplace else she looked out to the hayfield again smiled no no i cant i could help him with whats here if hed let me maybe you could devin sighed he was used to women falling for shane but it was easy to see that rebecca was different he doubted that shed walk away unscathed when the time came id better go give him a hand she made some sound of agreement and watched for some time before she went back into the house devin told himself it wasnt his business as he walked across the field in the easy rhythm of familiarity he fell into step behind the baler they worked together in silence until shane shut off the motor rafe and jared coming should be on their way shane nodded squinted at the sky its going to rain weve only got another hour or two to get this in but his gaze wandered to the house and stayed there damn it shane disgusted devin pulled out a bandanna and mopped his brow youre sleeping with her who dont give me that arent there enough women to dangle after around here without sniffing around regans friend shes not even your type shane worked to keep his temper in check youve always said i dont have a type you know what i mean thats a serious woman serious women have serious feelings if shes not in love with you already she will be then what the hell are you going to do it cut just a little too close to the quick shane had always been careful to keep women from falling in love with him seriously in love in any case and he knew he wasnt being careful with rebecca thats my business isnt it mine and rebeccas i didnt push her into anything to drown out any more unwelcome advice he cranked up the tractor again he wasnt going to talk about it and he certainly wasnt going to worry about it he meant to go on as he always had and that meant at this moment getting the haying done before the rain hit he was grateful when the rest of his family showed up it meant extra hands to load the hay wagon drive it to the barn and offload it it also meant everyone was too busy working to pester him about his private life a man was entitled to a private life he cooled down considerably when it looked as if the job would be done before the storm hit and when he could see children playing in the yard dogs racing around and women going in and out of the house then there was the soothing quality of the steady vibration of the tractor under him the voices of his brothers that sweet strong scent of hay the clouds rolling in from the west shadowed the mountain and the winter wheat hed planted would welcome the rain in the kitchen someone would be cooking he mused glancing over his shoulder to check the progress of the hay wagon it wouldnt be rebecca shed be playing with one of the babies and when he walked in covered with hay dust shed look over and smile she had the prettiest smile by the time they were hauling bales from wagon to barn shane had convinced himself that devin was not only out of line he was off base so rafe took a break gulping down some of the ice water from the cooler just inside the barn i didnt get a chance to talk to rebecca hows the ghostbusting shes into it sharp prickles of dry hay poked through his work gloves as shane heaved a bale she gets pretty intense about something thats just a hobby hey some people play golf jared commented loading the hay lift at least theres a purpose to that get the little ball in the hole win the game its a puzzle to her jared added she strikes me as a woman who likes to solve puzzles find answers maybe ill buy her a jigsaw puzzle shane muttered bothers you huh amused rafe put his back into the work again hear any chains rattling lately any disembodied moans kiss my butt hows it going otherwise jared asked with a vague thought to defusing an argument rain was beginning to patter on the ground and they still had work to do hasnt been a woman living in the house since mom died cramping your style a smile curved shanes lips nope well hell catching shanes look rafe set down the bale hed just lifted youre sleeping with her what am i wearing a sign cant you keep it in your pants for once in disgust rafe sliced his baling hook down regan feels responsible for her guilt and fear only inflamed a ready temper why the hell should anybody feel responsible shes a grown woman you going to get that last load up here devin called from the loft shut up shane spared him a glance before he turned on rafe its none of his business its none of your business anything connected to regans my business and rebeccas connected what do you know about her do you know how she was brought up how she spent all her time in classrooms with tutors in boarding schools what difference does it make irritated because he didnt know knew far from enough shane ignored the rain the work and let out the frustration on his brother shes got a brain she uses it thats all she was ever allowed to use she wouldnt stand a chance if you aimed for her whats the problem here devin stepped out into the rain are we going to get this load in before its soaked or just leave it back off shane snarled at rafe and stay out of my personal life jared sighed looks like were going to leave it this about rebecca interested now devin plucked out a spear of hay and gnawed on it we shouldve figured hed hit on her didnt hit on her thats bull shed barely unpacked her bags and you were stalking her in my kitchen i shouldve punched you out right then shanes eyes narrowed try it now youve got it all figured out dont you now that youve got your pretty wife and your pretty kids all of you there was more anger than hed realized boiling inside him i live my life my way not yours so stick your advice and your judgments and anything else youve got up your from the kitchen window rebecca watched the four men she was puzzled at first it had seemed they were having some sort of serious discussionsome logistical problem with the hay shed concluded then it had looked as though an argument were brewing somethings going on out there she commented and savannah an infant over her shoulder wandered to the window oh theyre going to go at it at what each other what else she shook her head and called to regan and cassie who were busy at the stove our boys are about to rumble fight shocked to the core rebecca goggled you mean theyre going to fight with each other but why regan walked to the kitchen door opened it its just something they like to do from time to time do you think its early enough to stop it cassie wondered out loud we can no regan finished as the first blow was launched too late with horrified eyes rebecca watched shanes fist streak out and plow into rafes face an instant later they were rolling in the dirt but but ill make sure theres plenty of ice cassie turned away from the battle and went to the refrigerator why doesnt somebody stop them regan demanded jared and devin are just standing there not for long savannah predicted as if on cue devin reached down if his intention was to break it up he failed miserably now there were three men wrestling in the mud the rain had churned up this is ridiculous by the time rebecca reached the kitchen door jared had joined in the fray she couldnt see how any of them could tell who was fighting whom she certainly couldnt all she saw were arms and fists and bodies all she heard were grunts and curses outside of movies and television shed never actually seen anyone brawl it was messier than shed imagined and certainly looked more painful isnt one of you going to do anything theyre your husbands well slowly savannah ran a hand up and down mirandas back we could put some money on it ill take jared for five its a matter of loyalty five it is regan agreed cassie all right but devin was up half the night allys teething no handicapping savannah declared straight odds you want to take shane rebecca seems fair totally baffled she stared at the women why youre as bad as they are she straightened her shoulders im going to put a stop to this right now as rebecca marched out savannah slanted a look at regan to borrow bryans phrase shes really stuck on him isnt she im afraid so it worries me i think shes good for him cassie joined them at the door i think hes good for her too both of them need someone even if they havent figured it out yet the only thing rebecca figured as she marched toward the hay barn was that these four grown men brothers no less were absolute fools by the time she neared the battlefield she was soaked her hair plastered to her head like a cap she shook her head at the sight that met her eyes the dogs had joined the party racing around occasionally leaping onto rolling bodies then dancing away with delighted barks stop it it halted the dogs but not the men fred and ethel sat politely tongues hanging out while the men continued to pummel each other i said stop this right now jared made the mistake of glancing over at the order and caught an elbow sharply on the chin he retaliated by ramming a fist into the nearest belly filled with righteous indignation rebecca slapped her hands on her hips she didnt just hear grunts and curses now they were laughing four baboons she decided laughing while they beat on each other she had a good carrying voice when she needed one it had filled many a lecture hall she used it now stop this nonsense immediately there are children in the house devin paused his filthy hand over rafes filthy face what get up from there all of you you should be ashamed eyes hot she scalded every one of them in turn i said get up you choosing at random she pointed a righteous finger at devin youre a sheriff for gods sake youre supposed to uphold order and here you are rolling in the mud like a hooligan yes maam gamely he swallowed a chuckle and disengaged himself from the tangle of limbs dont know what got into me and you that valiant finger aimed at jared a lawyer what are you thinking of nothing he rubbed a hand over his sore jaw before he rose absolutely nothing rafe mackade she had the pleasure of seeing him wince a businessman a pillar of the community husband and father what kind of example are you setting for your children a poor one he cleared his throat and got to his feet he had the feeling that if he let the laugh loose shed put him on his butt again and you she said with such contempt in her voice that shane decided to stay put in the mud i thought better of you she sounds just like mom shane murmured and had his brothers nodding in respectful agreement hey i didnt start it typical response just typical is this how you solve your problems your disagreements he rubbed some of the dirt from his aching face yeah thats pathetic youre all pathetic her authoritative look had three men shifting their feet and shane grinning violence is never the answer theres no problem that cant be solved with reason and communication we were communicating shane said and earned a withering stare i expect you to settle this like rational human beings if you cant control yourselves youll just have to keep your distance from each other isnt she something shane said in a tone that had all three of his brothers studying him have you ever seen anybody like her come on and kiss me sweetie if you think you can she let out a shriek as he swiped out a hand and had her sprawling on top of him you idiot you brainless then she was flat on her back covered by wet hard male his mouth trembling with laughter swooped onto hers shes the prettiest little thing he kissed her again while mud oozed through her shirt get off me you ape she bucked wiggled and gave him a whack violence he was shaking with laughter now his battered dirtstreaked face grinning down at her you see that he called out to his brothers she hit me she isnt solving the problem with reason and communication ill communicate all right her fist grazed his ear before his mouth fused to hers again and then he was kissing her senseless the rain beat down mud slicked her hands and there was an audience of fascinated onlookers she just didnt care as he watched rafe found himself grinning ill be damned he murmured shes hooked him i think youre right devin rubbed his bloody cheek on his muddy shoulder ive never seen him look at any woman that way think he knows it i dont think either of them have a clue delighted jared swiped wet hair out of his eyes its going to be a pleasure rafe hooked his thumbs in his pockets rocking back on his heels a real pleasure to watch shane mackade take the fall should we go inside and leave them alone devin angled his head as he considered or should we haul him off her and pound on him some more rafe touched his fingers to his eye shanes first punch had been a doozy he was going to need some of the ice he was sure his wife was readying i wouldnt mind pounding him some more but shed just get going again i dont think we should leave them out here jared decided they could catch pneumonia not with all that heat with a nod devin moved forward and his brothers flanked him between them they took arms and legs and hauled shane into the air let go youve got your own women this ones mine but they had him pinned so he could only grin foolishly at rebecca baby youre a mess lets go take a shower eyes narrowed rebecca pulled herself to her feet she knew she had mud in places best left unmentioned with as much dignity as possible she swiped her hands down her ruined slacks and through her filthy hair have you got him she asked calmly yes maam recognizing the look in her eyes devin grinned i believe we do shane knew the look too and tried to yank free come on now honey reason remember violence isnt an answer god youre so pretty i could gobble you right up why dont we his breath whooshed out when she clenched a fist and rammed it into his stomach good one he said weakly then coughed and managed to draw another breath you show real potential idiot with a toss of her head she dripped her way to the house isnt she something dazed with admiration and pain shane stared after her isnt she just something in the end he tried flowers after the chores were done supper was eaten and his family had gone their separate ways shane calculated he needed a bit of an edge he went out in the rain in the dark and picked wildflowers by flashlight when he came back she was working at her computer she did glance up it was one of those cool killing glances shed aimed his way all evening he put the wet flowers on the table beside her and crouched down how mad are you im not angry she was embarrassed and that was worse want to hit me again certainly not it was just mud he took her hand brought it to his lips it looked good on you she would have tugged her hand away but he was nibbling on it im trying to work wasnt the term you used avoidance when she turned her head to glare he picked up the flowers and held them out im crazy about you she let out a sigh what was so important about dignity anyway you must be crazy to go out on a rainy night to pick flowers it always worked with my mother you reminded me of her today when you were letting us have it of course shed have pulled us up by the scruff of the neck and then lectured i guess we were smaller then unable to resist rebecca sniffed at the dripping blooms she must have been quite a woman she was the best shane said simply they dont come any better she and my father well they were terrific you always knew somebody was there ready to give you a kick in the butt or a helping hand whichever you needed most reaching up he stroked a finger over her cheek i guess thats why i dont really understand loneliness big families arent always a buffer against it its the people in them she scraped back her chair id better put these in water she wasnt going to tell him he realized she wasnt going to speak of her background her family unless he pushed rebecca what were you fighting with your brothers about she asked it quickly as if she sensed what hed been going to ask stuff then he shrugged if he wanted her to be honest he had to be as well you stunned she turned back me youre joking it wasnt a big deal rafe said something to tick me off thats usually all it takes he crossed over bent down to take a slim old bottle out of the bottom cupboard they think im taking advantage of you i see but she didnt she took the bottle filled it then began to carefully arrange the flowers you told them we were intimate i didnt have to he had an idea of what she was imagining lockerroom talk snickers bragging and nudging elbows rebecca i didnt talk about whats between us and he might have probably would have he realized if it had been another woman frowning he walked over to pour coffee he didnt want he didnt go around bragging about his relationships with women but with his brothers he would certainly have made some comment about a new interest hed kept his feelings about rebecca to himself and it wouldnt have bothered him in the least to have rafe or any of the others tease or prod about his exploits with a woman yet it had with rebecca it had hurt and infuriated and what the hell is this he muttered i thought it was coffee what he stared into his mug no my mind was wandering look it wasnt a big deal its just the way we are we fight he smiled a little we used to beat on each other a lot more i guess were mellowing well thoughtful she carried the flowers to the table set them in the center ive never had anyone fight over me before especially four big strong men i suppose i should be flattered i have feelings for you it came right out of his mouth out of nowhere shaken shane lifted his mug and gulped down coffee i guess i didnt like the idea of somebody thinking id pushed you into bed warmth bloomed inside her a dangerous warmth she knew a loving one she made certain her voice was light we both know you didnt you havent exactly been around the block i wanted you i went after you and i put up a hell of a battle didnt i not especially but he couldnt smile back at her ive been around the block a lot of times are you bragging no i he caught himself there was amusement in her eyes and understanding and something else he didnt know quite what to do with i guess what im trying to say is that id try to go along with it if you wanted to rethink the situation or take some time she swallowed a nasty ball of fear fear made the voice tremble and she wanted hers to be steady is that what you want with his eyes on her he shook his head slowly no lately i cant seem to want anything but you just looking at you makes my mouth water the warmth came back pulsed spread she crossed the room lifted her arms to twine them around his neck then why dont you do more than look chapter ten there were many places to talk to ghosts an open mind didnt require a dark night howling winds or swirling mists this day was bright and beautiful trees touched by early fall were shimmering in golds and russets against a sky so blue it might have been painted on canvas there was the sound of birdsong the smell of grass newly mowed there were fields crackling with drying cornstalks and like a miracle there was a lone doe standing at the edge of the trees sniffing the air for human scent rebecca had come to the battlefield alone early she lingered here near the long depression in the ground known as bloody lane she knew the battle each charge and retreat and she knew the horrid stage of it when men had fallen and lain in tangled heaps in that innocentlooking dip in the land there was a tower at the end of it built long after the war shed climbed it before knew the view from the top was glorious from there she would be able to see the inn the woods some of shanes fields but it didnt call to her as this spot did here on the ground there was no lofty distance between the living and the dead she sat down on the grass knowing she would feel only a sadness an intellectual connection with the past as compelling as hallowed as the ground was she could only be a historian ghosts didnt speak to her not here it was the farm that held the key for her the farm that haunted not only her dreams now but her waking hours as well she accepted that but what was the connection there what was the emotional link a link so strong it had pulled at her for years over thousands of miles that she didnt know she knew only that she was in love she lifted her face to the breeze let it run its fingers through her hair as shane often did how could she be so content and yet so unsettled there were so many questions unanswered so many feelings unresolved she wondered if that was the way of love was she still so passive so undemanding of others that she could settle so easily for what shane offered or was she still so needy so starved for love that she fretted for more when she had enough either way it proved that a part of her rooted deep hadnt changed perhaps never would he cared for her he desired her she was pathetically grateful for that hed be shocked to know it she was certain she would keep that to herself just as she kept this outrageous and overwhelming love for him to herself she had plenty of practice at restricting and restraining her emotions common sense told her she was being greedy she wanted all the love the passion the endurance that lived in that house for herself she wanted the stability of it the constancy and the acceptance she was the transient as she had always been but she wouldnt leave emptyhanded this time and that thought soothed there wouldnt simply be knowledge received and given there would be emotion more emotion than she had ever received more than shed ever given that was something to celebrate and to treasure that should be enough for anyone sitting alone she gazed over the fields the slope of the hill the narrow trench it was so utterly peaceful so pristine and its beauty was terrible shed studied history enough to know the strategies of war the social political and personal motivations behind it knew enough too to understand the romance that followed it the music the beat of the drum the wave of flags and the flash of weapons she could picture the charge men running wildly through the smoke of cannon fire eyes reddened teeth bared their hearts would have pounded roaring with blood they had been men after all fear glory hope and a little madness that first clash of bayonets the sun would have flashed on steel had the crows waited nasty and patient drawn by the thunder of swords and boom of mortar north or south they would have raced toward death and the generals on their horses playing chess with lives how had they felt what had they thought as they watched the carnage here the bodies piling up blue and gray united by the stain of blood the miserable cries of the wounded the screams of the dying she sighed again war was loss she thought no matter what was gained always there would be a john and sarah the essence of the grieving parents for dead sons war stole families she reflected cut pieces out of hearts that could never truly heal so we build monuments to the wars and the dead sons we tell ourselves not to forget john and sarah never forgot and love endured it made her smile as she rose the grass was green here and the air quiet she decided that the world needed places of loss to help them remember what they had she went home to write it was nearly time for evening milking rebecca realized and she laughed at herself how odd that she would begin to gauge the day by farm chores with a shake of her head she hammered out the next sentence why had she spent all her life writing technical papers she wondered this flow of emotion and thought and imagination was so liberating damned if she didnt think she might try her hand at a novel eventually chuckling at the thought she tucked it into the back of her mind there were plenty of people who would consider her present topic the supernatural straight fiction when the phone rang she let the next thought roll around in her head as she rose to answer absently she reached for the coffeepot and the receiver at the same time hello dr rebecca knight please she stiffened then ordered herself to relax why should it surprise even annoy her that her voice hadnt been recognized this is rebecca hello mother rebecca i had to go through your service to track you down i assumed you were in new york no im not she heard the door open and worked up a casual if stiff smile for shane im spending some time in maryland a lecture tour i hadnt heard no im not on a lecture tour she could easily visualize her mother flipping through her filofax to note it down im doing research in maryland on what subject the battle of antietam ah thats been covered very adequately dont you think im coming from a different angle she made way so that shane could get to the coffee but didnt look at him is there something i can do for you actually theres something i can do for you where in the world are you staying rebecca its very inconvenient that you didnt leave word i need a fax number im staying with a friend she turned her back avoiding shanes eyes i dont have a fax here surely you have access to one youre not in the dark ages now she did glance at shane he smelled of the earth and carried a good bit of it on his person not exactly rebecca said dryly ill have to check on that and get back to you are you in connecticut your father is im at a seminar in atlanta you can reach me through the ritzcarlton all right can i ask what this is about its quite an opportunity the head of the history department at my alma mater is retiring at the end of this semester with your credentials and my connections i dont see that youd have any difficulty getting the position theres talk of endowing a chair it would be quite a coup given your age at twentyfour i believe youd be the youngest department head ever placed there i was twentyfive last march mother nonetheless it would still be a coup yes im sure it would but im not interested dont be ridiculous rebecca she closed her eyes for a moment that tone that quick dismissive tone had whipped her along the path chosen for her all her life it took a hard wrenching effort for her to stand her ground im afraid ill have to be and where had that cold sarcastic voice come from rebecca wondered i dont want to teach mother teaching is the least of it rebecca as youre quite aware the position itself i dont want to be the dean of history or the history chair anywhere she had to interrupt quickly recognizing the old familiar roiling in her stomach but thank you for thinking of me im not happy with your attitude rebecca you are obligated to use your gifts and the opportunities your father and i have provided for you an advancement of this stature will make your career whose career there was a sigh longsuffering obviously youre in a difficult mood and i can see that gratitude wont be forthcoming ill depend on your good sense however get me your fax number as soon as possible im a bit rushed at the moment but ill expect to hear from you by the morning goodbye goodbye mother she hung up and smiled at shane brightly overbrightly while the muscles in her stomach clenched and knotted well cows all bedded down sit down rebecca im starving terrified he would touch her and she would fall apart she moved away i think theres still some of that chocolate cake one of your harem dropped off rebecca his voice was quiet and his eyes were troubled she kept pressing a hand to her stomach he noted as if something inside hurt i think you should sit down i can make more coffee ive figured this thing out she started to reach for the canister but he stepped forward took her shoulders gently what the word snapped out her body jerking careful he thought disturbed by the brittle look in her eyes so youre from connecticut she hesitated then shrugged her shoulders under his hands my parents live there thats where you grew up not exactly i lived there when i wasnt in school you dont want to drink that she added glancing at the pot its been sitting for hours id said id make fresh what did she say to upset you baby nothing its nothing but he kept holding her kept looking at her with boundless patience and concern she wants me to campaign for a position at her college its a very prestigious position im not interested its a divergence of opinion and shes not used to me having an opinion it was simple enough he thought or it should have been but there was nothing simple about her reaction you told her no it doesnt particularly matter it never did on the rare occasions i actually got up the courage to say it i expect my father will be calling shortly to remind me of my obligations and responsibilities who are you obligated to to them to education to posterity i have a responsibility to use my talents and to reap the rewards its just a variation on publish or perish the battle cry of academia lets forget it he let her move away because she seemed to need it her hands were steady as she measured out coffee and her face was blank while she filled the pot then with a shudder she set everything down i cant believe im doing this this is how i got ulcers what the hell are you talking about ulcers migraines insomnia and a near miss with a breakdown isnt this why i studied psychiatry she wasnt talking to him shane realized so he said nothing but he was beginning to burn inside repression isnt the answer i know that its one of the things that punish the body for whats closed up in the mind its always so much easier to analyze someone else always much harder to see things when its yourself her rigid hands raked through her hair im not going to be directed this time im not going to be hammered at until i give the hell with them the hell with them they never did anything but make me into a miserable neurotic freak she whirled back to him her face wasnt blank now it was livid do you know what its like to be four years old and expected to read dante in italian and discuss it to sit at the dinner table when you werent shuffled off somewhere else and be quizzed on physics or converse about the renaissance in french naturally no he said quietly why dont you tell me what its like its horrible horrible to have your own parents regard you as a thing a rousing success of genetics i hated it but what choice do you have when youre a child you do whats expected of you then you get in the habit and you keep right on doing it even when youre not a child one day you look in the mirror and you see something so pathetic it hurts to look and you wonder why not just end it the anger inside him turned to drymouthed shock rebecca impatient she shook her head maybe you fantasize about it even obsess and youre clever youre so damned clever that you can find the most effective the most painless way to accomplish it and of course the most tidy he didnt speak now shed shaken him down to the bone and he was chilled to the marrow this woman this beautiful precious woman had considered ending her life she rubbed absently at the headache that throbbed deadcenter in her forehead but youre too intelligent too well programmed to tolerate that kind of waste it frightens you a little to realize you could actually do it so you decide being a practical person to study human behavior psychiatry instead a much more productive outlet all in all how old were you he managed but had to take a steadying breath before he could go on how old were you when you researched suicide she said calmly twelve a dangerous age all those hormones to deal with a shock to the regimented system you have to remind yourself that life however miserable is all youve got and go on with it its easier to go on with it if you just close up close off lock yourself behind books and theories credentials and degrees until you realize thats just a different kind of suicide she took a long shuddering breath im tired she murmured rubbing her hands over her face they make me so tired ulcers a breakdown dear god suicide what the hell had they done to her he wanted to tear them apart all of them any of them who had ignored her heart to get to her mind he wanted desperately to go back in time and find that young girl to give her everything shed needed and deserved but he could only reach out to the woman come on he went to her held her close and gentle despite the storm raging inside him she needed his calm not his fury just lean on me awhile im all right no youre not but you will be he damn well would see to it hold on to me baby so she did and it was so easy she didnt do anything wrong not really we havent seen each other in more than a year i doubt she or my father would recognize me if we passed on the street the change would surprise them he rubbed his cheek over her hair she felt so fragile why hadnt he seen that before where hadnt he looked to see this hurt vulnerable side of her it doesnt matter what they think only what you want you cant always have everything you want once i wanted them to love me id have done anything if theyd just said they loved me you know the problem with a memory like mine you cant forget things even when you want to i remember when they first sent me to boarding school i was so frightened so lonely and unhappy they put me on a plane didnt even go with me i was six years old oh baby im so sorry they could see i had an adult mind but they never considered the childs heart well im grownup now i should handle it better youre handling it fine not fine but better she eased back a little im sorry if youd come in an hour later id have been over it i want you to tell me what you feel very gently he lowered his head and touched his lips to hers i want to know who you are and how you got there i havent been able to figure you out rebecca all those different pieces of you that never quite seem to fit now theyre starting to do me a favor what dont call her back let her stew she smiled a little thats rude yeah so shell just call again my father will call they to prove her point the phone rang there you are he tightened his grip before she could move nothing was going to put that shattered look back on her face while he was here to protect her i dont hear anything the phone we dont have a phone thinking only to give her peace he kissed her again and brought himself some as well and were not here anyway where are we he scooped his arm under her knees picked her up anywhere you want to go as the phone continued to shrill he carried her out of the room as long as it takes a real long time to get there when he reached the bedroom he set her on her feet the phone had stopped ringing and he took it off the hook then set the receiver in a drawer to muffle the buzz that ought to do it you dont even have an answering machine itll drive them crazy good hed have liked an opportunity to speak to either of her parents himself but that could wait at the moment he had only one priority and that was erasing the troubled look in rebeccas eyes so where do you want to go she shook her head her smile puzzled i thought we were there this is just the startingoff point he ran a finger down the vest she wore over a mannish shirt a tropical island a what do you call it mountain chalet we could be snowed in a castle maybe he brushed his lips over her brow lets pretend fantasizing is often a his lips slid down to hers lets pretend a long empty beach white sand palm trees smell the flowers gently he kissed her eyes closed hear the surf lets go there i love the way your skin looks in the moonlight he nibbled at her lips as he slipped the vest aside and slowly so slowly undid the buttons of her shirt theres moonlight on the water on you pretty rebecca lightly he cupped her breasts come away with me anywhere she murmured and let him take her theres no one but us he drew off his shirt always keeping contact with his mouth on her lips her cheek the curve of her ear and nothing to do but make love i want to make love with you rebecca only you rebecca day and night the words were seducing her words were powerful she knew and his were captivating her his skin was under her hands now wonderfully smooth and warm his heart beat slow and thick against hers she would have sworn she heard the waves hiss and rise on the sand in the surf she said dreamily as those wonderful hands glided over her with the water flowing up then away thats right your skins wet and cool slick he said as he continued to undress them both and it tastes of salt still murmuring he lowered her to the bed theres starlight in your eyes he could see it though the last rays of the sun slanted through the windows silver sparkling in the gold we can stay as long as you like as long as you want his mouth slid over hers coaxing giving taking just a little more when her lips softened on a sigh beneath his her body was soft yielding surrendering she was with him now he knew pulse to pulse he wanted to show her what it was to be cherished so his hands were gentle his lips tender and each move each shift was fluid and patient loving he lingered where he knew it pleased her most going quietly easily sinking a little deeper with each stroke of his hands into the fantasy hed created for her she was floating it could have been water sliding over her so sensitive were his hands and the gift he brought to her was a liquid yearning as much of the soul as of the body she dreamed there was sand beneath them wet and smooth and the wind at the windows was the musical murmur of surf the dim light seemed to be rich and silver with the full rising moon the exotic perfume of island flowers the midnight sea that stretched forever the romantic song of tropical birds and her lover was there holding her where are you rebecca with you stay with me she wrapped her arms around him he loved her endlessly building the pace letting the current take her up over when she tumbled down he was there to catch her to begin the journey all over again knowing she was lost in him in them was the most exciting thing hed ever experienced each sigh each moan each catch of her breath poured through him like wine whispering her name he drew her up until they were torso to torso and the pace had to quicken or he would go mad he found her breasts drawing them hard into his mouth when she arched back when she cried out his name it was like music with a driving beat that burned in the blood he had shown her she was cherished now he would show her she was craved all she could think was that the storm was coming now it was wild windy and the waves lashed against her threatening to drag her under into the swirling dark and she would go willingly as long as she could stay with him so she clung to him her mouth desperate on his her body straining toward each shattering fall she plunged her hands into his hair took greedy handfuls of it when he lifted her up to race lips and teeth down her body she was drowning and glorying in it from some dim corner of her mind she heard her own voice begging him for more the moonlight was gone now there was only the flash of lightning the bellow of thunder still he held her up assaulting her system destroying her nerves she could feel the muscles in his arms quiver when he shifted and he was under her look at me his voice was rough raw his fingers dug deep in her hips look at me i want to see your eyes she opened them and through her wavering vision saw his face it was tensed strained beautiful come inside me now for gods sake shane i need you who are you yours she said then cried out when he lowered her onto him she couldnt breathe was sure her heart had stopped her body curved back like a pulled bowstring staggered undone she stroked her hands up her own quivering body from belly to breasts then up over her hair where they linked as if to anchor her hed never seen anything more beautiful more arousing more exciting than rebecca lost in pleasure he watched her head fall back saw the intensity of the climax that ripped through her to savor the moment he held himself still let her absorb every instant of that first assault of sensation then she began to rock and that rhythmic demand spurred him to match it faster until speed was all that mattered when he could no longer wait for her he clutched her hands took her and dragged her under with him when his mind cleared a little he realized that the sun had set and the room was soft with shadows and that he had never in his life felt more content he waited until she lay still her body sprawled limply over his her breathing almost steady so where do you want to go now her laugh started out low in her throat then rumbled out the way he liked it best why dont we try that mountain chalet snow would be a nice change of pace good thinking after dinner we can after dinner hell eyes wicked she lifted her head and began to nibble on him ah listen baby i his breath hitched when she slid down and scraped her teeth over his nipple maybe if you could give me a few minutes to her hand slid lower much lower his oath was soft reverent youve got a reputation to uphold she murmured deciding she liked the idea of playing seductress with an exhausted man ive heard around town that youre lets say insatiable yeah well people exaggerate a little ten minutes he thought no five he told himself watching her neat narrow naked body slither over his he just needed five minutes to recover listen why dont we man youre getting good at that she looked up laughing thrilled with herself i have a photographic memory in case youve forgotten and a very quick mind youre telling me anyway why dont we take a shower or maybe a little nap i dont think id be much good to you at the moment he gulped in air when her busy mouth trailed lower he wondered if his eyes crossed then again maybe i could handle it after all i think we can count on it they did take a shower later she watched shane stick his head under the spray and groan in appreciation from behind she wrapped her arms tight around him and pressed her mouth to his wet back jeez woman do i look like a rabbit but he turned to her always willing to try no laughing she lifted her hands to his streaming hair that was to thank you okay he dumped shampoo on her hair and scrubbed for what she blinked as lather dripped stinging into her eyes you must have been tired and hungry when you came in but you wanted to take my mind off things yeah it was a hardship all right i dont know how i got through it amused he nudged her under the spray i mean it she sputtered tried unsuccessfully to wipe her eyes you were wonderful ill never forget it thats what they all say he grinned when she turned and gave him a narroweyed stare kidding you know of course that most accidents in the home occur in the bathroom ive heard that gotta watch your step watch yours he put his hands on the tile and boxed her in remember the first time we made love in here sure you do you dont forget anything she lifted her brows youre not going to distract me that way i could if i wanted he lowered his mouth to hers but if i dont eat im going to fall down how about if i make you soup he looked pained do you have to she sniffed ducked under his arm and stepped out of the stall cook your own dinner then you know what ive noticed casually he turned off the shower reached for a towel you pick up things in a snap i mean you ask a million questions figure it out file it all away id bet you could go out there in the morning and handle the milking without a hitch dont get any ideas she warned him and toweled off then bundled herself into a robe ive seen you work a crossword puzzle in something under two minutes that time we went to the market and you bought groceries you had the money out before the total came up to the penny she shrugged picked up a comb from the side of the sink and ran it through her hair so im good at parlor tricks you could probably build a nuclear reactor in the living room if you put your mind to it but you cant fry an egg watching her he wrapped the towel around his hips or more accurately you dont want to fry an egg so you dont bother to figure it out she flicked a glance oyer her shoulder caught me now whats your point ill cook and you build the nuclear reactors she smiled but he saw the hint of clouds in her eyes rebecca patient he cupped her face in his hands your brain is only one of the very appealing things about you i like watching you think almost as much as i like watching you when you cant think whatever it took to get you to this point doesnt matter because youre here she let out a sigh its hard to stop wishing you could be normal baby you are normal it doesnt mean you cant be special that was so simple she thought and so sensible and so like him rising on her toes she touched her lips to his thanks anytime she blew out a breath okay lets go downstairs you can give me my first cooking lesson chapter eleven really appreciate the time savannah savannah stretched out her long legs and glanced at the tape recorder rebecca had set on the table between them its no problem ive got the time rebecca scanned the living area of the cabin it was bright and cluttered layla sat on the rug nearby and made engine noises as she raced a large plastic truck a woman with an active son and two kids in diapers cant have much time to spare it only gets crazy around here ten or twelve times a day savannah slid a glance toward her daughter this seems to be a lull how do you manage rebecca blurted out i mean three children a new baby your work your home your life the first trick is to enjoy it and i do since theyre not here to get cocky about it ill tell you that my men do their share you have a beautiful family hearing the wistfulness in her own voice rebecca shook it off let me explain what im after the book im working on deals with antietam specifically the battle of course but the angles im most interested in are the legends that surround this area and personal experiences ghost stories to some extent the mackade connection rebecca continued regan and rafe they were both drawn to the inn shared extraordinary experiences rafe came back to town for the inn and regan was drawn to it through him the inn also played a major part in cassie and devins lives and their relationship ive interviewed each of them separately and each corroborates the others feelings and experiences some of those experiences were shared some separate but all seem to touch on the story of the two corporals and you want me to tell you mine yes i interviewed jared this morning in his office oh and i wanted to tell you i loved your paintings especially the one of the woods thanks it was is the woods for us if you want to use the word connection i suppose thats ours savannah narrowed her eyes as she thought back the inn has a very strong pull what regan and rafe have done there and with cassie and devin living there its i dont know funneled off a great deal of the sadness it was a sad place for a long time but regan tells me you tracked down some information on the confederate corporal franklin gray yes you said that abigail had him identified and sent home to his family thinking of it savannah nodded that was very brave of her and very kind abigail had children of her own she must have imagined what that boys mother would have felt the never knowing the yankee boys family would never have known the other corporal rebecca sighed with just a hint of frustration thats all ive ever been able to pin down on him so far he fought for the union and was a corporal at least thats the information thats been passed down through the mackades what the mackades did for that wounded boy was brave and kind too savannah commented but you need to find him dont you to learn his name see his grave to settle it i suppose i do they were killed so long ago yet it seems unfinished they fought and died at each others hands two ordinary young men who never really lived but their deaths affected so many other people and it seems they still do isnt that part of what you feel in the woods savannah savannah tilted her head what do you consider the strongest emotions rebecca love and hate everything else stems from that yeah pleased savannah smiled thats good for an egghead anyway thats what i felt in the woods love i suppose that was for jared and for home hate it was more the fear and violence that hatred leaves behind why were we both drawn there and drawn most strongly to the spot where those two young boys fought more than a century ago connections she lifted her shoulders a need to settle it or soften it or understand it and did you savannah lifted a brow did jared tell you that the first time we made love was in those woods no no he didnt he probably thought it would embarrass you a slow warm smile utterly female curved savannahs lips the cabin was empty there was a perfectly good bed upstairs but we went to the woods because it was right for us because we were connected because love heals rebecca thought of shane and his tender gift to her yes it does ive sat there and ive heard the rustle of leaves under boots heard the shuddering breaths of frightened boys the war cries the crash of bayonets i heard them before id heard the story rebeccas eyes narrowed with new interest you didnt know about the two corporals when you came here no jared told me about it later but i already knew no felt it do you consider yourself psychic now savannah chuckled no more than anyone a fretful wail had her glancing toward the stairs feeding time she murmured be right back baby layla said as her mother headed upstairs toddling over she handed rebecca a doll baby pretty baby understanding rebecca kissed the doll then the child almost as pretty as you with a grin that had the mackade dimple winking layla squeezed the doll fiercely then passed it back mama she danced in place then squealed with delight when savannah came down with miranda fussing in her arms baby my baby come and see savannah invited settling down her free hand brushed over laylas dark hair as the child bent over the infant baby baby baby she cooed placing wet kisses over mirandas red furious face the babys hungry savannah explained and rolled her eyes at rebecca and boy does she let you know it rebecca watched as savannah chattered with both of her daughters fingers expertly unfastening buttons the baby rooted one tiny hand kneading a breast while her busy mouth found the nipple the envy pure and primal that swarmed through rebecca shocked her because of it she swallowed the questions that sprang to her mind how does it feel to feed your child from your own body is it the intimacy of it that makes your eyes go soft would you rather finish this later no this is fine regan looks like a madonna when she nurses rebecca murmured you dont savannahs lifted brow had her laughing a little thats not an insult i bought these tarot cards part of my research the empress is a card of fertility female power thats what you look like i can live with that well taking a deep breath rebecca got back to work she asked her questions moving savannah from generalities to specifics then moving her on to more esoteric matters by the time she was finished the baby was sleeping again her mouth milky and slack id like to ask a question now savannah rose to tuck miranda into a cradle beside her chair sure what exactly do you intend to do with all this a book i know but i dont quite understand how youll handle what ive told you what weve all told you i want to focus on the experiences of you three couples and the influence of the legends on your lives its intriguing and its romantic the way the past overlapped your present and your future six people whove become three families she explained hands gesturing to illustrate three families who are essentially one family all of your relationships were affected by what happened here long before any of you were born so how much does the past influence us how much does the power of place the strength of who and what was play on those open to accept it and youll add your data to that your evidence and your theories thats right and your reputation savannah turned back what are all those institutes and the suits who run them going to say about dr knights interest in the occult some will shake their heads and think its too bad a brilliant young scientist lost her mind others well there are some excellent and serious studies being done on the paranormal at some of those institutes and she smiled since im doing this for me i dont really care what they think savannah sat again gathered layla up in her arms why havent you talked to shane excuse me you said youd interviewed all of us and intend to use all of us in this book but you never mentioned shane hes not comfortable with it rebecca busied herself tucking her tape recorder back into her bag hes been very tolerant of what im doing but he doesnt like it in any case he doesnt fit into the equation six people three couples the connection nodding savannah ran her tongue around her teeth you know math isnt my strong point but i figure eight people four couples she gave layla a pat as the child wiggled down from her lap and went off to look for other entertainment what about your connection you shane the farm it doesnt really apply of course it does its obvious youre in love with him is it rebecca managed to say relatively calmly youre mistaking attraction affection and a physical relationship for hell are you sure youre not psychic poor thing savannah mused sympathizing with any woman whod tumbled for a mackade poor lucky thing youre a fairly controlled sort of woman rebecca you dont advertise your feelings on your face but i see things savannah waved a hand im an artist and i have shamans for ancestors you can chalk it up to that or to the fact that one woman in love often recognizes another rebecca looked down at her hands i dont know whether to be relieved or worried with that rundown i like you i dont like everyone im selective actually i didnt think id like you at all comfortable she stretched out her legs again a professional intellectual scientist all those initials after your name i got my high school equivalency when i was carrying layla and when regan talked of you all i saw was this enormous brain wearing hornrim glasses the image had rebecca snorting out a laugh shed come a good ways she thought when such a description brought amusement rather than pain if you sketch me that way ill hang it in my apartment thats a deal anyway i did like you do like you if id sat down and tried to piece together the woman who would suit shane she wouldnt have been anything like you and id have been wrong the farmer and the savant the phrase made savannah grin poor shane she thought poor lucky shane in this case it works what are you going to do about it enjoy it while it lasts and thats enough its more than ive had before there would be a price of course she thought she was willing to pay it im a practical woman savannah maybe but how brave are you and how dedicated are you really going to write a book take all that time put in all that effort and leave out a piece of it your piece and shanes can you ignore that connection could she rebecca asked herself as she walked back to the farm through the woods for the book yes she could and would do that for shane personally shed accepted that the connection between them would remain with her forever yet she could leave would leave it would hurt but she would survive it intellectually she knew no one really died of a broken heart emotionally she suspected some could but it would be easier to live when shed had love than it had been to exist without ever knowing it she knew her greek tragedies well there was always pleasure and there was always payment her bill so to speak was coming due she knew if savannah could read her heart so easily others would shane might and then the payment could become too high to bear he meant too much to her for her to put him in an awkward position she would have to start considering that first step away tomorrow was the anniversary of the battle she felt it important even imperative that she stay on the farm through the day and perhaps the next then it would probably be best if she moved back to regans a few days a short transitory period before she went back to new york she stepped through the trees and looked at the farm there was smoke coming out of the chimney from the living room fireplace it was just chilly enough to warrant one she could see the house itself strong stone painted wood the silos and sheds and buildings it would she realized be almost as wrenching to leave the place as it would be to leave shane shed been happier here than shed ever been in her life shed found love here so she would be grateful rather than regretful walk away a voice nagged in her brain rather than risk suddenly chilled she rubbed her arms and began to cross the fallow field she saw the car zip up the curve of the lane and park at the side of the house a quick friendly toot of the horn and the dogs were scrambling to greet the redhead who climbed out the air was clear enough to carry the womans laugh to where rebecca stopped and the distance wasnt so great that she couldnt see shanes lightning grin as he came around the side of the house to meet the woman jealousy ebbed and flowed ebbed and flowed in a nasty unpredictable tide as rebecca watched them embrace easily as the womans arms stayed linked around shanes neck oh no you dont she warned silently hes still mine hes mine until i walk away they stayed close together as they spoke and there was more laughter another quick kiss before the woman stepped away and got back into her car shane ruffled both dogs straightened waved rebecca knew the moment he spotted her in the field and began to walk toward the house again the car darted down the lane between them then disappeared around the curve hey he tucked his thumbs in his front pockets hows savannah fine i had a chance to look at some of her paintings theyre wonderful yeah with his instincts warning him to proceed with caution shane tried to read rebeccas face ah that was frannie spader you met frannie i thought i recognized her because they wanted attention and because it was a good ploy rebecca bent to pet the dogs she just dropped by so i saw i want to transcribe this interview rebecca he touched her arm to stop her theres nothing going on here shes a friend she stopped by it was pure selfdefense that had her arching a brow why do you feel you have to clarify that because i look fran and i used to be we used to be he finished furious with himself now were not and havent been since well since you came to town were friends oh it was satisfying to watch him squirm do you think i require an explanation no yes damn it he imagined himself strolling along and coming across rebecca hugging another man someone would have to die i dont want you to get the wrong idea thats all do you think i have the wrong idea will you cut that out he demanded and paced away then back again i hate when you do that i really hate it when i do what make everything a question how do you feel what do you think he whirled back to her eyes shooting sparks of temper damn it if you had a question it should have been what in the hell were you doing kissing another woman do you feel a show of jealousy would be appropriate when he only scowled at her she shrugged im sorry i cant accommodate you clearly you had a life before i came here and youll have one after im gone thats it throw the past in my face is that what you think im doing he snarled cant you fight like a regular person when theres something to fight about your friends are your business and as i have no idea how many of those friends i might run into every time i go into town it would be remarkably unproductive of me to worry about it his brain was screaming out for him to let it go but his mouth just refused to obey look rebecca if id slept with as many women as some people think id never have gotten out of bed and i havent had sex with every woman ive gone out with either i dont why the hell am i telling you this that was going to be my next question and in my opinion what youre doing is projecting your feelings your anticipated reaction to a situation onto me added to that is a sense of guilt and annoyance resulting from that guilt in transferring the annoyance from yourself to me you shut up his eyes as volatile as a storm at sea he grabbed her face in his hands she came by to see if i wanted to go out later i told her no she asked if i was involved with you i told her yes very involved we talked for another minute she said shed see me around thats it satisfied her heart was tripping lightly quickly in her chest but her voice was cool and faintly curious did i give you the impression that i was dissatisfied his eyes narrowed flashed rebecca found it very satisfying almost as satisfying as his frustrated oath as he turned on his heel and stalked away nice job dr knight she told herself she didnt think shane was going to be kissing anyone else for a while humming to herself she strolled into the house she really did have work to do she thought and patted one of her video monitors as she passed but she could take just a moment to savor the sense of smugness the poor guy had been so predictable classic reactions alarm at the thought that something however innocent could be interpreted badly the added weight of his infamous career as a ladies man not a womanizer she mused one day she might explain to him the difference between a man who loved and appreciated woman and one who used them and then she thought snickering on her way to the kitchen his sense of unease then irritation at her reasonable reaction direct hit on the ego it was so much more interesting to study the games men and women played with each other when you were in the middle of the field than when you were observing from the stands she might just do a paper on it she mused going to the window once shed carved out enough emotional distance by then she would know not only what it was like to fall in love to be in love but what it felt like to lose at love one day she might find the courage to ask him what she had meant to him what the time they had spent together had meant to him in the scheme of things yeah she thought amused at herself she might find the courage for that in a decade or two telling herself it was now that mattered and wondering if the little incident would garner her more flowers she decided to try her hand at cooking dinner solo it was really all just formulas after all and she had regans formula no recipe she reminded herself for fried chicken in her bag digging it out she read it through once and committed it to memory since shanes kitchen didnt run to aprons she tucked a dishcloth in the waistband of her slacks and got down to some serious experimenting it was actually soothing she discovered as she coated chicken with herbed flour at least on a casual level she imagined that if anyone had to plan and cook and deal with the time and mess every day day after day meal after meal it would be tedious but as a hobby it had its points if she could just keep this particular hobby from becoming a vocation as so many of her others had shed be just fine when she had chicken frying in hot oil in a castiron skillet she stepped back and congratulated herself it smelled good it sounded good it looked good therefore according to basic laws it should taste good wouldnt shane be surprised and perhaps even more baffled when he came in and found dinner cooking it was milking time she thought poking at the crisping chicken with a kitchen fork and night was coming earlier as the days shortened toward the stilldistant winter would she see the camp fires burning if she looked out the window the soldiers were so close close and waiting for dawn and the battle she wished john would come in once he was in and the animals were settled they could shut up the house they would be safe here they had to be safe here she couldnt lose another child couldnt live through it nor could john she pressed a hand over the one covering her womb as if to protect it from any threat any harm she desperately hoped it would be a son not to replace the one theyd lost johnnie could never be replaced never be forgotten but if the babe she carried was a son it would somewhat ease the worst of johns grief he suffered he suffered so and there was no comfort for it she could love him tend him share the grief but she couldnt end it the girls tried and god knew they were a joy but johnnie was gone every day the war went on was another painful reminder of that loss maybe it would end here she turned the chicken in the pan as shed done so often in her life would that be some sort of justice for this horrible war to end here where her son had been born was the man who had killed her son out there right now sitting waiting in the union camp who would he kill tomorrow or would it be his blood that would seep into the land she had walked over for so many years why wouldnt they go away just go away and leave the living in peace with their sorrows hot grease popped out of the pan and seared the side of rebeccas hand she barely felt it as she staggered backward emotions thoughts words sounds reeled in her head possession she thought dimly this was possession and for the first time in her life she fainted primed to fight shane burst through the door and another thing he began before he saw rebecca crumpled on the kitchen floor before his heart stopped he streaked forward dropped down beside her to drag her into her arms rebecca his hands were running over her face chafing her wrists rebecca come on now snap out of it terrified into clumsiness he rocked her kissed her begged her until her eyes fluttered open shane thats right relief poured through him in a flood just lie still baby till you feel better i was her she murmured fighting off the fog i was her for a minute i have to check my equipment the hell with your equipment it was pitifully easy to hold her in place do as youre told and lie still did you hit your head are you hurt anywhere i dont i dont think so what happened you tell me i walked in and you were on the floor good lord she took a deep steadying breath and let her head rest in the crook of his arm i fainted imagine that i dont have to imagine it you just scared ten years off my life now naturally there was fury to coat over the fear what the hell are you doing fainting did you eat today damn it you never eat enough to keep a bird alive you dont get enough sleep either down four or five hours then youre up prowling around or clacking away at that stupid computer he was working himself up into a rare state but he couldnt stop well thats going to change youre going to start taking care of yourself youre nothing but bones and nerve didnt they teach you anything about basic bodily needs in those fancy schools or dont you think they apply to you she let him run on until her head stopped spinning he was ranting about taking her to the doctor checking her into the hospital getting vitamins finally she held up a hand and put it over his mouth ive never fainted before in my life and since i didnt care for it i dont intend to make it a habit now if youll calm down a minute and let me up the chickens burning he said something incredible and unlikely when applied to burning chicken but he did haul her into a chair moving quickly he flicked off the heat what the hell were you doing i was cooking i think it was going to be fairly successful too maybe it can be salvaged he grunted turned to the tap and ran a glass of water for her drink she started to tell him he needed it more than she then decided against it obediently she sipped water i was cooking she said again and letting my mind wander then the thoughts werent mine any longer they were very clear very personal you could say but they werent mine they were sarahs ice skidded up his spine youre just letting yourself get too wrapped up in all this stuff shane im a sensible woman a rational one i know what happened here she was cooking chicken with a shake of her head rebecca set the glass on the table isnt it odd that i would have decided to try regans recipe tonight september sarah was cooking chicken the night before the battle so now you know what they ate yes she said facing down his sarcasm now i know she was frying it worried about her family thinking of her son and the baby she carried wondering who would die in the morning soldiers were camped not far from here waiting for dawn she was frying chicken and her husband was out with the animals she wanted him to come in to come inside so that they could close it all out and just be together she worried about him shed have done anything to ease his mind i think youre working too hard shane said carefully and i think youve let the fact that the anniversary is tomorrow influence you steady again she rose you know thats not true you know whats here and youve decided not to face it thats your choice and i respect that even though i know some nights you dream and the dreams trouble you i respect your decision and your privacy i expect you to show my work and my needs the same respect my dreams are my business ive just said so im not asking you to tell me anything no you never ask rebecca he jammed his hands into his pockets you just wait and whittle a person down with waiting i dont want any part of this do you want me to go when he didnt answer she braced herself spoke calmly i suppose ill have to ask its important to me to be here in the morning i cant give you clear rational data on why only my feelings id appreciate it very much if youd let me stay at least another day no ones asked you to go have they he snapped the words out furious with himself now why should he panic at the thought of her packing up there had never been any promises he didnt make them didnt want them you want to stay stay but leave me out of it ive got some work to finish up then im going out all right he wanted desperately for her to ask him where and would have snapped her head off if she questioned him of course she didnt so he couldnt all he could do was walk out when all he wanted to do was stay chapter twelve he thought about getting drunk it wasnt a problemsolver but it did have its points it was a shame he wasnt in the mood for it arguing with someone was a better idea and since rebecca wasnt going to accommodate him he headed for town and devin hed always been able to count on devin for a good fight shane figured it was a bonus when he found not only devin in the sheriffs office but rafe too hey we were just talking about getting together a poker game rafe greeted him with a slap on the shoulder got any money got a beer around here this is a place of law and order devin said solemnly then jerked his head toward the back room couple in the cooler you up for a game maybe shane stalked into the back room i can do what i want when i want cant i i dont have to check with a woman like you guys do devin and rafe exchanged looks ill give jared a call rafe said picking up the phone as shane came back in guzzling beer while rafe dialed the phone and murmured into it devin propped his feet on his desk so whats rebecca up to she doesnt have to check with me either ah had a little spat did you enjoying the idea devin crossed his arms behind his head she kick you out its my damn house shane shot back and reasonable rebecca doesnt spat she changes he went on gesturing with the beer right in front of your eyes one minute shes tough and smart and cocky the next shes soft and lost and so sweet youd kill anybody whod try to hurt her then shes cool oh shes so cool and controlled and he gulped clown beer analytical how the hell are you supposed to keep up well devin mused you cant call her boring anything but she thinks she is at least some of the time hell i dont know what she thinks she is shane brooded into the bottle just today she comes across frannie kissing me does she get mad does she start a fight accuse me of anything no not that it wasnt perfectly innocent but the point is that if youre sleeping with somebody you shouldnt like the idea of them kissing somebody else right rafe had hung up the phone and was watching his brother carefully id agree with that you agree with that dev pretty much yeah pleased with the unity of spirit shane lifted the bottle again there you go but dr knight shes as cool as you please studying me like im a smear on a lab slide again i hate when she does that who wouldnt rafe said and sat down to enjoy himself soothed by brotherly understanding shane finished off the first beer then popped open the second and another thing how come she doesnt ask where all this is leading tell me that women are always asking where all this is leading thats how you keep things from getting too intense by setting down the cards you know is that how devin smiled serenely sure but she doesnt ask he chugged down beer that was why things had gotten so intense he needed to believe that and youd think shed get in the way wouldnt you youd think shed get in the damn way living there but she just sort of fits does she devin grinned and winked at rafe sort of i mean there she is at breakfast in the morning and shes always got something to talk about she works in the kitchen most of the time but she never gets in the way and you start expecting her to be there rafe looked around as the door opened and jared walked in with a large brown bag jared set it on devins desk and took out a sixpack we playing here maybe later to keep the interruption at a minimum devin gestured jared to a chair shanes on a roll yeah jared looked at shane whats he rolling about rebecca you were saying the bedroom smells like her shane muttered she doesnt leave any of her stuff laying around and it still smells like her soap and that stuff she rubs on her skin uhoh jared said and helped himself to a beer you know her parents sent her to boarding school when she was six practically a baby she never had a chance to be a kid sometimes when she laughs she looks a little surprised by the sound of it he paused thought about it shes got a great laugh jared turned to rafe she kick him out he says not its my damn house shane reminded them all my house my land im the one who says what goes on around there if i dont like that stupid idiotic ridiculous equipment of hers then thats it i dont like that shes wrapped herself up in all this bull and shes wearing herself down im not coming in and finding her in a heap on the floor again what amusement fled as devin straightened in his chair what happened she fainted far as i can tell she says she had an encounter with our greatgrandmother he downed beer to wash both worry and unease out of his system yeah right theyre both frying chicken the night before the battle im not getting involved in that is she all right rafe asked would i be here if she wasnt he raked his fingers through his hair and fought to block out the image of her pale small still form on the kitchen floor but he couldnt she scared the hell out of me damn it damn it he squeezed his eyes shut for a moment rubbed the heel of his hand over his aching heart i cant take her being hurt i cant stand it the womans ripping at me with an effort he pulled himself back took another gulp from the bottle she bounces back he muttered ive never seen anybody bounce back like she does shes fine now dandy back in control shes not pushing me into getting hooked up with that business shes not going to hook me into anything brother with some sympathy jared opened another beer and passed it to shane youre already hooked like hell at a guess how many times do you think about her in a given day i dont know annoyed shane decided getting drunk wasnt such a bad idea after all i dont count in lawyer mode now jared briskly crossexamined the witness anyone else youve thought about that much that often so what shes living with me you think about somebody whos in the same house day and night rafe studied his nails its just sex the hell it is like a bullet shane was out of his chair fists ready shes not just a warm body he caught himself and his brothers sly grin im not an animal thats a switch unconcerned rafe sampled his own beer how many other women have you wanted since rebecca came along zip zero zilch terror thats not the point the point is he sat again brooded into his beer i forgot the point is devin said picking up the threads youve lost your balance and youre falling fast hes already hit jared put in he just doesnt have the sense to know it but being a sensible woman rebecca might not fall so easy especially for you what the hells wrong with me as i was saying jared continued shes got a life in new york a career interests you might have a problem keeping her from wriggling away youll have to be pretty slick to convince her to marry you shane choked coughed and gulped more beer youre crazy im not marrying anybody rafe only smiled wanna bet because shane was terribly pale devin took pity on him have another beer pal you can bunk in the back room and sleep it off it seemed like an excellent suggestion she didnt sleep it wasnt only because shane wasnt there and the house seemed to come alive around her it was the wait for morning through the longest night of her life she worked it had always helped her through crises small and large she packed the systematic removal of her clothing the neat folding of it into suitcases was a sign that she was ready to go on with the rest of her life if she had a worry it was that she and shane would part on uneasy terms that she didnt want when he came back she told herself she would try to put things back into perspective and achieve some kind of balance but he didnt come back and the hours passed slowly to dawn when the sun had just begun to rise and the gray mist hung over the land swallowing the barn she stepped outside it was impossible for her to believe at that moment that anyone wouldnt feel what she felt the fear the anticipation the rage and the sorrow it took so little imagination for her to see the infantry marching through that soft curtain of fog bodies and bayonets tearing it so that it swirled back and reformed the muffled sound of boots on earth the dull glint of brass and steel that first burst from the cannons those first cries then there would be hell what are you doing out here rebecca jolted stared it was shane stepping through that river of mist he looked pale grittyeyed and angry enough that she resisted the need to rush forward and hold him i didnt hear you come home just got here she hadnt slept he could see the fatigue in her eyes the shadows under them and detested the stab of guilt youre shivering youre barefoot for gods sake go back inside go to bed you look tired she said knowing her voice was more brittle than cool im hung over he said flatly some of us humans get that way when we drink too much arent you going to ask me where ive been who ive been with she lifted a hand rubbed it gently over her heart it still beat she thought vaguely even when it was shattered are you trying to hurt me maybe i am maybe im trying to see if i can she nodded and turned back toward the house you can rebecca but she was already closing the door behind her leaving him feeling like something slimy that had crawled from under a rock cursing her he headed toward the milking parlor they stayed out of each others way through the morning rather than work in the kitchen she closed herself in the guest room and focused fiercely on the job at hand so they would part at odds she thought perhaps that was best it might be easier in the long run to hide behind resentment and anger from the window in her room she saw him he didnt seem to be working marking time she decided until she cleared out well he would have to wait a little longer she wasnt leaving until the day was over where are you sarah she murmured pacing the room which was beginning to feel like a cell you wanted me here i know you wanted me here for what as she passed the window she looked out again he was walking across the yard now past the kitchen garden where he had late tomatoes greens squash he stopped checked something for ripeness she supposed it was painful to look at him yet too painful to contemplate looking away had she really believed she could take the experience of love and loss as some sort of adventure or worse as an experiment on the human condition that she could examine it analyze perhaps write about it no she would never never get over him when he straightened from the little garden and walked toward one of the stone outbuildings she turned away no she wouldnt wait until the end of the day after all that was too cruel she would speak to him again one last time and then she would go shed send for the equipment she told herself as she went downstairs she would make her exit with dignity albeit with dispatch to regans she told herself breathing carefully to run back to new york just now would look cowardly it was pointless to make him feel bad to let him know hed had her heart and broken it let him think that it had simply been an experience one that was over now one they could both remember fondly she was never coming back at the base of the stairs she stopped to press her hand to her mouth never coming back to this town this battleground this house though she would be in full retreat she would not run she never glanced at the monitors the gauges down the hall she trailed her fingers over wood and paint as if to absorb the texture into memory at the kitchen doorway the power punched like a fist stew cooking the distant pop of gunfire weak she leaned against the wall as the door opened she knew it was shane the rational part of her mind recognized the shape of him the stance even the smell but with some inner eye she saw a man carrying a bleeding boy my god my god john is he dead not yet put him on the table i need towels oh so much blood hurry hes so young hes just a boy like johnnie so like johnnie young bleeding dying the uniform was filthy and wet with blood the new stripe of his rank was still bright on the shoulder of the tattered jacket there was a rustle of worn paper from a letter in the inside pocket as she peeled the uniform away to see the horror of his wounds just a boy too many dying boys rebecca saw it could see the scene in the kitchen perfectly the blood the boy those who tried to help him there the letter in sarahs hands the paper worn where it had been creased and recreased read and reread the words seemed to leap out at her dear cameron they couldnt save him shane said carefully they tried yes after the breath shed been holding was expelled rebecca pressed her lips together they tried so hard at first he only saw the uniform the enemy he was glad that a yankee had died there then he saw the face and he saw his son in it so he brought him home it was all he could do it was the right thing to do the human thing they wanted that boy to live rebecca i know her breath shuddered out shuddered in they fought as hard as they could all the rest of that day through the night sitting with him praying listening to him when he could speak shane there was too much love in this house for them not to try not to fight for that one young boys life but they lost him eyes grim shane stepped forward and it was like losing their son again he didnt die alone or forgotten but they buried him in an unmarked grave she was afraid tears trembled out rolling down rebeccas cheeks she was afraid for her husband for her family nothing meant more to her if anyone found out that boy had died here and john a rebel sympathizer whod lost a son to the yankees they might have taken john from her she couldnt have stood it she begged him not to tell to dig the grave at night so no one would ever know oh she grieved for that boy for the mother who would never know where or when or how he died she read the letter yeah then they buried the letter from his mother with him there was no envelope shane no address nothing to tell them where he had come from or who was waiting for him to come home just the two pages the writing close and crowded as if shed wanted to jam every thought every feeling into them a breath shuddered out i saw it i could read it just as sarah did dear cameron shanes eyes went dark his stomach muscles tightened twisted thats my middle name cameron was my grandfathers name cameron james mackade john and sarahs second son he was born six months after the battle of antietam shane took a steadying breath the names come down through the mackades ever since every generation has a cameron they named their child after the boy they couldnt save helplessly rebecca rubbed the tears from her cheeks with the flats of her hands they didnt forget him shane they did everything they could and then they buried him in an unmarked grave dont hate her for it she loved her husband and was afraid for him i dont hate her for it suddenly weary shane scrubbed his hands over his face but its my life now rebecca my land i cant change what happened and im sick of being haunted by it she offered a hand do you know where hes buried no ive always shut that part out as hed tried most of his life to shut it all out all those wavering memories those misty dreams i never wanted any part of this why did you come in now tell me now i dont know exactly resigned he dropped his hands i saw him beside the smokehouse bleeding asking me to help him he drew a long breath its not the first time i couldnt not come in not tell you anymore youre part of it you knew that all along hes buried in the meadow she murmured wildflowers grow there she reached for his hand again tightened her fingers on his come with me they walked out toward the meadow through the bright wash of sun the mountains were alive with color and the flowers underfoot were going to seed there was the smell of grass and growing things when she stopped the tears still fell quietly for a moment she could say nothing could only stare down at the ground where she had once dropped her first clutch of wildflowers they did their best for him not far from here another man killed a boy simply because of the color of his uniform these people tried to save one despite it she leaned into shane when he circled her shoulders with his arm they cared yeah they cared they still cant leave him here alone we make parks out of our battlefields to remember she said quietly its important to remember he needs a marker shane they would have given him one if they could have could it be as simple as that he wondered and as human all right he stopped questioning and nodded well give him one and maybe well all have some peace theres more love than grief here she murmured and it is yours shane your home your land your heritage whatever lives on through it through you is admirable you should be very proud of what you have and what you are i always felt as though they were pushing at me i resented it yet it had eased now standing there with her in the sun on his land i didnt see why i should be the one to be weighed down with their problems their emotions he looked over the fields the hills and felt most of his weariness pass maybe i do now its always been more mine than any of my brothers more even than it was my fathers my mothers we all loved it we all worked it but but you stayed because you loved it more she rose on her toes and kissed him gently and you understand it more youre a good man shane and a good farmer i wont forget you before he realized what she was doing shed turned away what are you talking about where are you going i thought you might like some time alone here she smiled brushing at the tears drying on her cheeks it seems a personal moment to me and i really have to finish getting my things together what things my things she backed away as she spoke now that weve settled this im going to stay with regan for a few days before i go back to new york i havent had as much time to visit with her as id planned she might as well have hit him over the head with a hammer the quiet relief hed begun to feel at facing what had haunted him was rudely nastily swallowed up by total panic youre leaving just like that experiments over see you around im only going to regans for a few days ive already stayed here longer than i originally intended and im sure youd like your house back im very grateful for everything youre grateful he repeated for everything yes very she was terrified her smile would waver quick was all she could think get away quick id like to stay in touch if you dont mind see how things are going with you we can exchange cards at christmas i think we can do better through sheer grit she kept that easy smile on her face farm boy its been an experience mouth slack with shock he watched her walk away she was dumping him shed just put him through the most emotional most wrenching most stunning experience of his life and she was just walking away well fine he thought scowling at her retreating back dandy that made it clean he didnt want complications or big emotional parting scenes the hell he didnt shed reached the kitchen door and just stepped over the threshold when he caught up with her a tornado of temper he snagged her shoulders whirled her around just sex and science is that it doc i hope to hell i gave you plenty of data for one of your stinking papers what are you dont you want one last experiment for the road he dragged her up hard against him crushed his mouth down on hers it was brutal and it was fierce for the first time she was afraid of him and what he was capable of shane shuddering she wrenched her mouth free youre hurting me good but he released her jerking away so that she nearly stumbled you deserve it you coldblooded he managed to stop himself before he said something he wouldnt be able to live with later how can you have slept with me have shared everything weve shared and then just turn around and walk like it meant nothing to you but a way to pass some time i thought i thought thats how it was done ive heard people say that you stay friends with all the women youve dont throw my past up at me he shouted damn it nothings been the same since you came here youve tangled up my life long enough i want you to go i want you out im going she managed and took one careful step then another until shed reached the doorway for gods sake rebecca dont leave me she turned back steadied herself with one hand against the jamb i dont understand you you want me to beg the humiliation was almost as vicious as the temper fine ill beg please dont go dont walk out on me i dont think i can

epilogue sunlight glinted off snow and the ice that crusted over it so that the land sparkled clean and pure they would all be there soon rebecca thought all the mackades with their noise and their energy and they would come here to the meadow where a simple stone marker rose out of the untrampled snow and cast its thin gray shadow over white but she had come first she and her husband the word even after three months of marriage still made her heart trip with pure joy shane cameron mackade was her husband this day the first day of the new year she had love she had a family and the future was hers she slipped her hand in his the hand that carried the simple gold band shed wanted on her finger and together they stood its what they all wanted shane said quietly acknowledgment for a life that ended too soon acknowledgment is a kind of peace dont you think thats what you feel here now in the air and ill find his familys descendants she turned her head smiled up at shane itll take time

marked a young mans grave and well finish the rest together its what they wanted from us john and sarah i can still feel them in the house in the land we always will content rebecca snuggled into his arms as the wind kicked up and sent snow flying but its different now settled settled he smiled resting his cheek on the top of her head it was a word hed never expected to apply to himself but how well it fit how well she fit i love you rebecca i know still her heart swelled just hearing it i love you it was the perfect time she thought the perfect place though she stayed in the circle of his arms she tilted her head back she wanted to see his face when she told him to see what came into his eyes she drew a breath because the words the first time they were said were so precious were going to have a baby his eyes went totally blank and that made her lips curve what how lovely she thought to have the chance to say it again were going to have a baby in a little over eight months her smile spread her eyes filled as she took his limp hand and pressed it to her stomach were going to have a baby she said a third time youre pregnant his breath eame out in a whoosh and his eyes were no longer blank shock joy delight everything shed wanted to see raced into them were pregnant his gaze dropped down to their joined hands covering a miracle our baby our baby then she let out a rich laugh as she was spun off her feet and into wild circles that sent snow flying into the sunlight he stopped as abruptly as hed begun and now concern and a touch of fear showed on his face youre feeling all right youre not sick you dont eat enough youve got to start eating are you sure you feel all right i feel wonderful invincible she touched her lips to his i feel loved rebecca his mouth lingered then gently deepened the kiss and the arms that cradled her gathered her closer yet you are loved emotion flowed through him as she nestled her head on his shoulder his wife his child its a circle he murmured looking down at the stone marker again season to season yes if its a boy id like to name him cameron it feels right it all feels so right he heard his dogs barking in the distance quick yelps of joy and recognition thats the family coming he kissed her once again then turned from the snowdraped meadow boots crunching as he walked back toward the house i cant wait to tell them

him he only held her closer no i cant you dont have to carry me all the way into the house yes i do his eyes met hers and he laughed ive got you now rebecca mackade im not letting go
