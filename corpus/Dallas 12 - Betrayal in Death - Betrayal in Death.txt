betrayal in death j d robb prologue a murder was taking place outside the privacyscreened windows and some fortysix floors below death life noisy oblivious irritable rushed on new york was at its best on fine may evenings when flowers burst out of beautification troughs along the avenues and spilled from vendors carts the scent of them very nearly overpowered the stink of exhaust as street and air traffic clogged both road and skyways pedestrians scurried strolled or hopped on people glides depending on their frame of mind but many did so in shirtsleeves or the neoncolored tshirts that were the seasons rage in this pretty slice of spring glidecarts sold fizzy drinks in those same violent hues and the steam from grilling soy dogs rose merrily into the balmy evening air taking advantage of the waning light the young danced and leaped over the public sports courts working up a healthy sweat with balls and hoops and pegs in times square business in the video parlors was off as customers preferred the streets for their action but the sex shops and venues held their own in spring many a fancy still turned to porn airbuses carted patrons to the sky mall and ad blimps cruised with their endless stream of chatter trying to herd yet more into the shopping arenas buy and be happy and tomorrow buy more couples dined alfresco or lingered over predinner drinks talking of plans the lovely weather or the minutiae of their everyday lives life bustled bloomed and burgeoned in the city as one was taken above it he didnt know her name it hardly mattered what label her mother had given her when shed come squalling into the world it mattered less to him what name she took with her when he sent her squalling out of it the point was she was there in the right place at the right time shed come in to do the nightly turndown in suite hed waited quite patiently and she hadnt kept him long she wore the smart black uniform and fancy white apron of the palace hotels housekeeping staff her hair was neat as was expected of any employee of the finest hotel in the city it was shiny brown and clipped at the nape with a simple black bar she was young and pretty and that pleased him though he would have followed through in the intended manner if shed been ninety and hagfaced but the fact that she was young attractive enough with her dusty cheeks and dark eyes would make the task at hand somewhat more enjoyable shed rung first of course twice with a slight pause between as required that had given him time to slip into the generous bedroom closet she called out as she opened the door with her passcode housekeeping in that lilting singsong voice people of her trade used to announce themselves to rooms most usually empty she moved through the bedroom into the bath first carrying fresh towels to replace those the occupant registered as james priory might have used since checkin she sang a little as she tidied the bath some bouncy little tune to keep herself company whistle while you work he thought from his station in the closet he could get behind that he waited until she came back had heaped the used towels on the floor for later waited until shed walked to the bed and had finished folding down the royal blue spread took pride in her work he noted as she carefully formed a long triangle with the bed linens at the left corner well so did he he moved fast she saw only a blur out of the corner of her eye before he was on her she screamed loud and long but the rooms of the palace were soundproofed he wanted her to scream it would help get him in the mood for the job to be done she flailed out her hand reaching down for the beeper in her apron pocket he simply twisted her arm back jerking it nastily until her scream became a whimper of agony we cant have that can we he plucked her beeper out tossed it aside youre not going to like this he told her but i am and thats what counts after all he hooked an arm around her throat lifting her off the ground she was a little thing barely a hundred pounds until the lack of oxygen had her going limp he had the pressure syringe of potent downers as a backup but wouldnt need it with such a tiny woman when he released her and she dropped to her knees he rubbed his hands together smiled brilliantly music on he ordered and the swelling sounds of the aria from carmen hed already programmed into the entertainment system filled the room gorgeous he thought drawing in breath deeply as if he could draw in the notes well now lets get to work he whistled as he beat her he hummed as he raped her by the time hed strangled her he was singing chapter one in death there were many layers violent death added more it was her job to sift through those layers and find cause in cause to meet justice however the act of murder was committed in cold blood or hot she was sworn to pursue it to its root and serve the dead for tonight lieutenant eve dallas of the new york city police and security department wore no badge it along with her service weapon and communicator was currently tucked in an elegant palmsized silk purse she considered embarrassingly frivolous she wasnt dressed like a cop but wore a shimmering apricothued gown that skimmed down her long slim body and was sliced in a dramatic v in the back a slender chain of diamonds hung glittering around her neck more sparkled at ears she recently and in a weak moment had been persuaded to have pierced still more were scattered like raindrops through her short chop of brown hair and made her feel faintly ridiculous however glamorous the silk and diamonds made her appear her eyes were all cop tawny brown and cool they scanned the sumptuous ballroom skimmed over faces bodies and considered security cameras worked into the fancy plasterwork overhead were unobtrusive powerful and would provide full scope scanners would flag any guests or staff who happened to be carrying concealeds and among the staff weaving their way through the chatter to offer drinks were a halfdozen trained security personnel the affair was invitation only and those invitations carried a holographic seal that was scanned at the door the reason for these precautions and others was an estimated five hundred and seventyeight million dollars worth of jewelry art and memorabilia currently on dazzling display throughout the ballroom each display was craftily arranged for impact and guarded by individual sensor fields that measured motion heat light and weight if any of the guests or staff had sticky fingers and attempted to remove so much as an earring from its proper place all exits would close and lock alarms would sound and a second team of guards handselected from an elite nypsd task force would be ordered to the scene to join the private security to her cynical frame of mind the entire deal was a foolishly elaborate temptation for too many in too large an area in too public a venue but it was tough to argue with the slick setup then again slick was just what she expected from roarke well lieutenant the question delivered with a whiff of amusement in a voice that carried the misty air of ireland drew her attention to the man then again everything about roarke drew a womans attention his eyes sinfully blue set off a face that had been sculpted on one of gods best days as he watched her his poets mouth one that often made her want to lean in for just one quick bite curved one dark brow lifted and his long fingers skimmed possessively down her bare arm theyd been married nearly a year and that sort of casually intimate stroke could still trip her pulse some party she said and turned his smile into a fast devastating grin yes isnt it with his hand still lightly on her arm he scanned the room his hair was black as midnight and fell nearly to his shoulders into what she thought of as his wild irish warrior look add to that the tall tautly muscled build in elegant blacktie and you had a hell of a package obviously a number of other women in the room agreed if eve had been the jealous type shed have been forced to kick some major ass just for the hot and avaricious looks aimed in her husbands direction satisfied with the security he asked her i still think holding this business in a hotel ballroom even your hotel ballroom is risky youve got hundreds of millions of dollars worth of junk sitting around in here he winced a little junk is not quite the descriptive phrase we hope for in our publicity efforts magda lanes collection of art jewelry and entertainment memorabilia is arguably one of the finest to ever go to auction yeah and shell rake in a mint for it i certainly hope so as for handling the arrangements for security display and auction roarke industries gets a nice piece of the pie he was scanning the room himself and though he was anything but a cop he studied measured and watched even as his wife had her names enough to push the bidding far above actual value i think were safe in predicting that twice the actual value will make up that pie by the end of things boggling eve thought boggling youre figuring people will choke out half a billion for somebody elses things conservatively and before the sentiment factors in jesus christ she could only shake her head its just stuff wait she held up a hand i forgot who i was talking to the king of stuff thank you darling he decided not to mention he had his eye on a few bits of that stuff for himself and his wife he lifted a finger instantly a server bearing a tray of champagne in crystal flutes was at his side roarke removed two handed one to eve now if youve finished eyeballing my security arrangements perhaps you could enjoy yourself who says i wasnt but she knew she was here not as a cop but as the wife of roarke that meant mingling rubbing shoulders and the worst of human tortures in her estimation small talk because he knew her mind as thoroughly as he knew his own he lifted her hand kissed it youre so good to me and dont you forget it okay she took a bracing sip of champagne who do i have to talk to i think we should start with the woman of the hour let me introduce you to magda youll like her actors eve muttered biases are so unattractive in any case he began as he led her across the room magda lane is far more than an actor shes a legend this marks her fiftieth year in the business one which often chews up and spits out those who dream of it shes outlasted every trend every style every change in the movie industry it takes more than talent to do that it takes spine it was as close as eve had ever seen him to having stars in his eyes and that made her smile stuck on her are you absolutely when i was a boy in dublin there was a particular evening where i needed a bit of a dodge off the streets seeing as i had several lifted wallets and other pocket paraphernalia on my person and the garda on my heels the wide mouth shed forgotten to dye for the evening sneered boys will be boys well be that as it may i happened to duck into a theater i was eight or thereabouts and resigned myself to sitting through some costume drama i imagined would bore me senseless and there sitting in the dark i had my first look at magda lane as pamela in prides fall he gestured toward the display of a sweeping white ballgown that shimmered under a firestorm of icy stones the droid replica of the actor turned in graceful circles dipped into delicate curtsies fluttered a sparkling white fan how the hell did she walk around in that eve wondered looks like it weighs a ton he had to laugh it was so eve to see the inconvenience rather than the glamour nearly thirty pounds of costume im told i said she had spine in any case she was wearing that the first time i saw her on screen and for an hour i forgot where i was who i was that i was hungry or that id likely get a fist in the face when i got home if the wallets werent plump enough she drew me out of myself thats a powerful thing he avoided interruption by simply aiming a smile or wave in the direction of those who called him i went back and saw prides fall four times that summer and paid for it well paid the fee once anyway after whenever i needed to be drawn out of myself i went to the movies she was holding his hand now well able to visualize the boy hed been sitting in the dark transported away by the images flickering on screen at the age of eight hed discovered another world outside the misery and violence of the one he lived in and at eight she thought eve dallas had been born to a young girl too broken to remember anything that had come before wasnt it almost the same thing eve recognized the actor roarke didnt really go to the movies these days unless you counted his private theaters but he had copies on disc of thousands of them shed watched more screen in the past year with him than she had in the previous thirty magda lane wore red screaming siren red that painted a stunning and voluptuous body like a work of art at sixtythree she was just dipping into middle age from what eve could see she was approaching it with a snarl this was nobodys matron her hair was the color of ripening wheat and tumbled to her bare shoulders in snaking spirals her lips full and lush as her body were painted the same bold red as her gown skin pale as milk was unlined and highlighted by a beauty mark just at the outer point of one slashing eyebrow beneath those contrastingly dark brows were eyes of fierce and brilliant green they landed on eve coolly a female to female measuring then shifted to roarke and warmed like suns she was surrounded by people and simply shot them a careless smile then stepped out of the circle hands outstretched my god but youre gorgeous roarke took her hands kissed both i was about to say the same youre stunning magda as ever yes but thats my job you were just born that way lucky bastard and this must be your wife yes eve magda lane lieutenant eve dallas magdas voice was like fog low and full of secrets ive been looking forward to meeting you i was devastated i couldnt make the wedding last year it seems to have stuck anyway magdas brows rose then the eyes beneath them began to glitter with appreciation yes it has go away roarke i want to acquaint myself with your lovely and fascinating wife and youre too much of a distraction magda waved him away with one slim hand light shot off the diamond on her ring finger like the tail of a comet before she tucked her arm companionably through eves now lets find someplace where a dozen people wont insist on speaking to us nothing more tedious than idle conversation is there of course youre thinking thats just what youre about to be trapped into with me but ill assure you i dont intend to make our conversation idle shall i start off by telling you one of my own regrets is that your ridiculously attractive husband is young enough to be my son eve found herself sitting at a table in the back corner of the ballroom i dont see why that would have stopped either of you laughing delightedly magda snagged fresh flutes of champagne then shooed the server away my own fault i made a rule never to take a lover more than twenty years older or younger stuck with it too mores the pity but she paused to sip studying eve it isnt roarke i want to talk about but you youre exactly what i thought hed fall for when his time came around eve choked on her wine blinked youre the first person whos ever said that she struggled with herself a moment then gave up why do you say it youre quite attractive but he wouldnt have been blinded by your looks you find that amusing magda noted nodding in approval good a nice sense of humors essential when dealing with any man but particularly one of roarkes nature they were solid looks though magda mused neither glamorous nor staggering but solid with good bones clear eyes and an interesting dent in the center of a strong chin your looks might have attracted him but they didnt snare him i wondered about that as roarke has an interest and an affection for beauty so i having some interest and affection of my own in the man followed the media on you eve angled her head a kind of challenge do i pass amused magda ran one scarlettipped finger around the rim of her flute then lifted it to equally bold lips and sipped youre a smart determined woman who doesnt merely stand on her own feet but uses them to boot whatever asses need booting youre a physical woman with brains and a look in your eyes when you glance around an event like this that says what a bunch of nonsense havent we all got something better to do intrigued eve studied magda in turn more here she realized than some fluff piece who liked to play makebelieve are you a shrink or an actor either profession requires solid elements of both she paused again sipped again my guess is you didnt dont give a hang about his money that would have intrigued him i cant see you falling at his feet either if you had hed likely have scooped you up and played with you awhile but he wouldnt have kept you im not one of his damn toys no youre not this time magda lifted her glass in a toast hes madly in love with you and its lovely to see now tell me about being a policewoman ive never played one i have played women who go outside the law to protect whats theirs but never one who works within it to protect others is it exciting its a job it has its ups and downs like any i doubt like any you solve murders we civilians i suppose youd say cant help but find the process including the murder fascinating thats because youre not the one whos dead exactly magda threw back her magnificent head and roared with laughter oh i like you im so glad you dont want to talk about your work i understand people from outside think mine is exciting glamorous when what it is is a job with its ups and downs like any ive seen a lot of your work i think roarke has everything youve done on disc i like the one where youre a scheming conwoman who falls for her mark its fun bait and switch yes it was chase conner was my leading man in that and i fell for him too it was also fun while it lasted im auctioning off the costume i wore in the cocktail party scene she glanced around the ballroom scanning her things things that had once been vital to her with amusement it should bring a good price and help get the magda lane foundation for the performing arts off the ground so many bits and pieces of a career of a life going on the block before much longer she turned studying a display arranged like a ladys boudoir with a shimmering nightgown an open jewelry case where chains and stones spilled gloriously onto a gleaming dressing table thats a lovely bit of female business isnt it yeah if youre into that magda swiveled back smiling at one time i was desperately into that but a smart woman doesnt survive a fickle career like acting without regularly reinventing herself what are you now yes yes magda murmured i like you very much people ask me why im doing this why im giving so much of it up do you know what i say no what that i intend to live and to work for a great deal longer time enough to collect more she gave that lusty laugh again turned back to eve thats true enough but theres more the foundations a dream of mine a cherished one actings been good to me i want to pass it on while im still around and young enough to enjoy it all grants scholarships facilities for all that new blood to swim in it pleases me that a young actor or director might get his or her start from a break given in my name thats vanity i dont think so i think its wisdom oh now i like you even more ah theres vince giving me the eye my son magda explained hes handling the media and assisting in the security for this extravaganza such a demanding young man she added signaling across the room god knows where he got that particular trait so thats my cue to get back to work she rose im going to be in new york for the next several weeks i hope well see each other again that would be nice ah roarke perfect timing magda turned to beam at him as he walked to the table i have to abandon your delightful wife as duty calls i expect an invitation to dinner very soon so i can spend more time with both of you and indulge in one of those spectacular meals your man arranges what is his name summerset eve said lip curling yes of course summerset soon she said and kissed both roarkes cheeks before gliding off you were right i did like her i was sure you would as he spoke he began to guide her smoothly toward the exit im sorry to interrupt your evening off but we have some trouble a problem with security somebody try to duck out with a pocketful of baubles no its nothing to do with theft and everything to do with murder her eyes changed woman to cop whos dead one of the housekeeping staff from what im told he kept her arm steered her toward a bank of elevators shes in the south tower fortysixth floor i dont know the details he said shortly before she could interrupt my head of hotel security just informed me have the police been contacted ive contacted you havent i eyes grim he waited while the elevator shot up to the south tower security knew i was on site and that you were with me it was decided to inform me and you first okay dont get testy we dont even know if its a homicide yet people are always yelling murder at unattended deaths mostly theyre accidents or natural causes the minute she stepped off the elevator her eyes narrowed to slits too many people in the hallway including one hysterical female in a housekeepers uniform lots of guys in suits and several people who were obviously guests whod popped out of their rooms to see what the commotion was she reached into her foolish little purse pulled out her badge and held it up as she strode forward nypsd clear this area you people go back in your rooms anyone with hotel security stand by and somebody deal with this woman here whos security chief that would be me a tall lean man with a coffeecolored complexion and mirrorsheened bald head stepped forward john brigham brigham youre with me since she didnt have her master code she gestured to the door when he opened it she stepped through scanned the parlor area sumptuous chockfull of fancy furniture including a full bar setup and tidy as a church the privacy screens on the generous windows were engaged and the lights on full where is she eve asked brigham bedroom to the left was the door open or closed as it is now when you arrived on scene it was closed when i got here but i cant say it was that way before ms hilo from housekeeping found her thats the woman in the hall thats right all right lets see what weve got she moved to the door opened it music poured out the lights were on full here as well and shone harshly on the body lying on the bed like a broken doll that had been tossed there by a spoiled child one arm was cocked at an impossible angle her face was raw and blackened from a vicious beating and her uniform skirt was hiked up to her waist the thin silver wire used to strangle her cut deep into her throat like a slender and deadly necklace i think you can rule out natural causes roarke murmured yeah brigham whos been in this suite besides you and the housekeeper since the body was found no one did you approach the body touch it or anything other than the doors in any way i know the drill lieutenant i was on the job chicago psd anticrime division twelve years hilo alerted me she was screaming into her communicator i got here within two minutes shed run back to her base on the fortieth floor i entered the suite came to the doorway here determined by visual that the victim was deceased aware that roarke was on site and accompanied by you i contacted him immediately then secured the suite sent for hilo and waited for your arrival i appreciate it brigham since you were on the job you know how many times a crime scenes corrupted by helping hands did you know the victim no hilo called her darlene little darlene thats all i could get out of her eve was scanning the scene keeping herself back from it and calculating the steps that had led to murder you could do me a big favor and get hilo somewhere quiet and private where she cant talk to anyone but you until i send for her im going to call this in i dont want to go into the room until i can seal up brigham reached in his pocket pulled out a minican of sealit i had one of my men bring this up and a recorder he added handing her a collar clip didnt figure youd have a field kit with you good thinking do you mind sticking with hilo for a while ill take care of it you can tag me when you want to talk to her meanwhile ill leave a couple of men at the door until your crime scene unit gets here thanks idly she shook the can whyd you go off the job for the first time brigham smiled my current employer made me a hell of an offer i bet you did eve said to roarke when brigham stepped out hes got a cool head good eyes she started to spray her shoes then decided shed do a hell of a lot better without them after stepping out of them she sprayed her feet her hands passed off the can then the clip to roarke ill need you to record the scene she pulled out her communicator and called it in her names darlene french roarke read off the data hed called up from his ppc shes worked here for just over a year she was twentytwo im sorry she touched his arm waited until he shifted those hot angry eyes to hers im going to take care of her now record on okay yes all right he slipped the ppc back in his pocket engaged the clip recorder the victim is identified as darlene french female age twentytwo employed as housekeeper the roarke palace hotel apparent homicide this location suite present and acting as primary dallas lieutenant eve also present and acting as temporary aide in recording this log roarke dispatch has been notified now eve approached the body the scene shows little sign of struggle but the body shows bruising and lacerations consistent with a violent beating particularly around the face blood spatter pattern indicates that beating was administered while the victim was on the bed she glanced around the room again noted the beeper on the floor just outside the bath the right arm is broken she continued other bruising on the victims thighs and vaginal area indicates premortem rape gently eve lifted one of the limp hands wishing for microgoggles she examined it carefully got a little skin here she murmured managed to get a swipe in didnt you darlene good for you we have skin possibly hair and fiber under victims fingernails meticulous she moved up the body the uniform was still buttoned over the breasts he didnt bother with much foreplay didnt rip at her clothes or bother to take them off her just beat her broke her raped her a thin wire silver in appearance has been used garrotestyle to strangle the victim the ends of the wire were crossed in front then twisted into small loops indicate the killer strangled her facetoface while he was ranged over her and she was down have you got this from all angles she asked roarke yes with a nod she lifted the victims head tilting her own so that she could see the back of the wire get this she ordered it might shift a little when we turn her the wires unbroken in the back and the bleedings minimal he didnt use it until hed finished the beating until hed finished the rape straddling her she said narrowing her eyes to bring it into focus one knee on either side shes not putting up much of a fight if any by this point he just slips the wire over her head crosses the ends in front then pulls opposite directions it wouldnt have taken long but shed have bucked her body instinctively struggling to throw off the weight her throat burning from the wire and the trapped screams of pain and terror her heart would have pounded and that stormatsea sound would have exploded in her ears at the lack of oxygen heels drumming hands clawing for air until the blood begins to burst in the head behind the eyes and that frantic heart surrenders eve stepped back there was little more she could do without a field kit i need to know who this room is registered to what the housekeeping routine is ill need to talk to hilo she added as she walked to the closet glanced in and it would help for me to be able to interview anyone on staff who knew her well she checked the dresser no clothes not even a lint ball a couple of used towels she might have dropped or simply set down on her way out of the bathroom was anyone registered to this room ill find out youll want her next of kin yeah eve sighed husband if she had one boyfriends lovers exes nine times out of ten thats what you find in a sexual homicide but i think this is number ten nothing personal about this nothing intimate or passionate he wasnt mad wasnt particularly involved theres nothing intimate about rape there can be eve corrected and she knew that better than most when theres knowledge between the assailant and the victim any sort of history even just a fantasy on the part of the assailant it lends intimacy this was cold just ram it in and get off i bet he spent more time beating her than he did with the rape some men enjoy the first more its their foreplay roarke switched off the recorder eve turn the case over to someone else what she blinked herself back to the moment why would i do that dont put yourself through this he touched her cheek it hurts you he was being careful she noted not to mention her father the beatings the rapes the terror shed lived with until she was eight they all hurt if you let them she said simply and turned back to look at darlene french i wont turn her over to someone else roarke i cant shes already mine chapter two the suite was registered to one james priory of milwaukee hed checked in that afternoon at threetwenty and had booked his accommodations three weeks in advance with a planned twonight stay payment for the room and any incidentals was to be made through his debit card which had been recorded and verified at checkin in the parlor of that suite while the crime scene unit and sweepers handled the crime scene eve watched the security disc brigham had sent up to her the checkin recording showed priory to be a mixedrace male mid to late forties dressed in the conservative dark suit of the successful businessman who could afford a highpriced suite in a highpriced hotel for a couple of nights an expense account look eve noted but under the natty suit and wellstyled hair she saw thug he was burly widechested and easily weighed twice what his victim had his hands were square the fingers long and blunted his eyes were the color of the scrim that forms on street puddles in january a cold and dirty gray his face was square as well with a blocky nose and a thin mouth the dark brown hair carefully styled and graying at the temples struck her as an affectation or a disguise he made no attempt to conceal his face even managed a brief smile for the desk clerk before he let the bellman lead him to the elevators he had a single suitcase with the next disc she watched the bellman open the door to his suite and step back to let priory enter first according to the logs he did not leave the suite again before the murder he used the autochef in the kitchenette for a meal steak rare white potato baked sour dough roll coffee and cheesecake rather than contact room service the service bar in the parlor had been lightly used some macadamias and a soft drink no liquor eve noted clear head the next disc showed darlene french wheeling her maids cart to the door of a pretty girl in a spiffy uniform and sensible shoes who had adreamy look in big brown eyes delicate build small hands that played with the little gold heart on a thin gold chain she tugged from under her blouse she buzzed idly rubbed the small of her back then buzzed again slipped the heart and chain neatly under her blouse only then did she slide the passcode from her apron pocket into the slot press her right thumb to the identipad she opened the door called out cheerfully then gathered fresh towels from her cart she closed the door behind her at pm at priory suitcase and towels in hand stepped out of the room he closed the door behind him neatly dropped the towels inside the cart before he skirted around it then strolled like a man without a care in the world to the door leading to the stairs it had taken him only thirtytwo minutes to beat rape and murder darlene french a clear head eve said aloud a cold clear head lieutenant eve shook her head held up a hand to hold her aide off a moment longer peabody zipped her lip waited shed been working homicides with eve for a year and believed she had her lieutenants rhythm her eyes nearly as dark as her straight chinlength hair shifted to the screen where eve continued to study the frozen image of a killer looks mean peabody thought but said nothing what have you got for me eve said at length priory james exec in sales at alliance insurance company based in milwaukee deceased january five of this year vehicular accident well this guys alive and kicking anything wonky about milwaukee priorys vehicular it doesnt appear so sir the report states a driver of a jettruck nodded off at the wheel took out priory and another driver we have a number of other priorys in milwaukee but this is the only james that popped hold off running them this guys got a sheet somewhere i know it tag feeney at home shoot him this disc image and ask him to run it through ircca the international resource center on criminal activity thats an edivision job and irccas his personal darling hell pop this guy out quicker than anyone else she checked her wrist unit i want to talk to hilo she should be coherent by now wheres roarke she demanded glancing around the parlor peabody straightened her shoulders looked directly at the opposite wall i couldnt say damn it eve strode out pinned the guard at the door hilo shes in lieutenant nobody goes in this room without a badge nobody she walked to the elevator jabbed the button the fact that roarke had left the crime scene meant only one thing he was up to something the good news was hilo was indeed coherent she was pale redeyed but sat quietly in the parlor area of one of the hotels smaller suites there was a teapot on the table in front of her and a cup in her hand which she set down when eve walked in ms hilo im lieutenant dallas with the nypsd yes yes i know roarke explained that you wanted me to wait for you here with mr brigham eve shot a look toward brigham who stood staring with apparent fascination at the painting on the far wall roarke explained eve repeated yes he came down to sit with me awhile ordered this tea for me himself its just like him hes a lovely man oh yeah hes just peachy ms hilo have you spoken with anyone but mr brigham and roarke since youve been waiting for me oh no i was told not to she looked trustingly at eve with swollen eyes the color of walnuts mrs roarke dallas eve didnt grit her teeth but it was close lieutenant dallas oh yes of course pardon me lieutenant dallas i want to apologize for causing such a scene before when before she finished and drew in a shaky breath i couldnt seem to stop when i found poor little darlene i couldnt seem to stop its all right no no hilo lifted her hands she was a small woman but solidly built the kind of build eve always thought that kept right on steadily marching after wimpy longdistance runners passed out on the field i just ran out and left her there left her like that im in charge you see from six to one im in charge and i just ran away from her i didnt even touch her or cover her up mrs hilo just hilo she managed a small smile that only made her weary face look sadder its natalie hilo but everyone just calls me hilo all right hilo eve sat put off turning on the recorder you did exactly what was best if you had touched her if you had covered her up you would have contaminated the crime scene that would have made it more difficult for me to find the person who hurt her to find him and make sure he pays thats what roarke said her eyes filled again but she got a handkerchief from her pocket and briskly wiped the tears away he said just that and that you would find the horrible person who did this to her he said you wouldnt stop looking until youd found him thats right you can help me and darlene brigham could hilo and i have some privacy sure you can reach me at ninety on the house link im going to record what we talk about eve said when they were alone all right yes she sniffed straightened im ready eve set a recorder on the table she recited the particulars lets start with you telling me what happened why did you go to suite darlene was behind schedule when the evening routines finished in each room or suite the housekeeper presses code five on her beeper this helps us keep track of the staff and the units completed while it goes toward efficiency its also a security measure to protect the guests and the staff she sighed a little and picked up her cup of tea turndowns generally take between ten and twenty minutes depending on the size of the unit and the pace of the particular housekeeper we allow some leeway of course quite often the state of a unit is such that it takes considerably longer youd be amazed lieutenant really amazed at how some people treat a hotel room it makes you wonder how they live at home she shook her head well be that as it may were near full capacity right now so we were hopping i didnt notice that darlene hadnt beeped in from suite forty minutes give or take thats long but its a large suite and darlene was slow not that she wasnt a good worker she was but she tended to take her time hilo began to wring her hands i shouldnt have said she was slow i shouldnt have said that i meant to say thorough she was such a good girl such a sweet little thing we all loved her its just that she took a bit more time than most to finish her units she liked being in the bigger rooms she liked tending to beautiful things its all right hilo i understand she was proud of her work and she made sure she did it well yes hilo pressed a hand to her lips nodded yes thats exactly so what did you do when you noticed she hadnt checked in oh hilo shook herself back i beeped her the procedure is for the housekeeper to signal back or to contact base over a house link occasionally one of the other guests will detain or delay a housekeeper asking for more towels or whatever its palace policy to serve the guests even if they just want to chat for a moment because theyre away from home and lonely this throws off the pace but were a servicefirst facility she set her cup down again i gave darlene another five minutes beeped her a second time when she didnt respond to that i was irritated lieutenant i was annoyed with her and now hilo eve couldnt have counted the times shed seen and heard this guilty misery in a survivor it was a natural reaction darlene would never have blamed you for it you couldnt help her then but you can help her now tell me what you can yes all right yes hilo drew in a breath let it out slowly yes as i said we were very busy i went to the suite myself to move her along id hoped her beeper was acting up they dont very often but its been known to happen then i saw her cart outside the door and was very annoyed she had to stop a moment remembering how shed planned to give darlene a good piece of her mind i buzzed used my passcode i could see the parlor was fine i marched straight to the bedroom opened the door the door was closed yes yes im sure because i remember calling out as i pushed it open and i saw her poor little thing i saw her on the bed her face was all swollen and battered and there was blood around her neck and on the collar of her uniform and drops of it on the spread shed turned down shed been doing her job you see shed turn down the bed eve interrupted would that have been the first chore shed have dealt with on entering the suite it depends everyone has their own routine more or less i believe darlene liked to check the bath first remove the used towels and replace them then shed check the bed some guests will demand a complete linen change at turndown if theyd had a nap or made use of the bed in any way if that was the case shed strip off the linens and take them and the towels to her cart retrieve fresh linens and so on she would make a note of the use of inventory on her cart log efficiency again and it discourages staff pilfering you see yeah from what you observed shed just gotten around to turning down the bed there was music on would she have turned on the entertainment system yes perhaps but never at that volume if the guest isnt in the unit during evening turndown the housekeeper programs the entertainment unit to the guests requirements or to a classical station if no requirements have been set but always at a discreet volume maybe she intended to turn it down before she left darlene liked modern music hilo managed a smile most of the young staff members do shed never have turned on it was opera wasnt it that program for her own entertainment okay so hed killed to opera eve thought for his own entertainment what then then i froze just froze and i remember running out again slamming that door behind me i heard the crack of it through the screaming i ran out the front slammed that door too and i couldnt get my legs to move anymore so i stood there my back against the door still screaming when i called security she broke a bit pressed her hands to her face people came out of rooms ran down the hall everything was so confused mr brigham came and he went inside everything got all muddled in my head and he brought me down here and told me to lie down but i couldnt so i just sat right here and cried until roarke came and got me tea who could have hurt that sweet little girl why eve waited saying nothing to a question that could never be fully answered while hilo rocked herself steady again did darlene always do turndown on that particular suite no but most usually and traditionally each housekeeper is assigned two floors that remain theirs unless we have an unusual turnover darlenes had fortyfive and fortysix since she finished her training do you know if she was involved with anyone a boyfriend yes i think oh there are so many young people on staff and theyre forever having romances im not sure i remember barry blowing out a breath of relief hilo nearly smiled yes im sure she had a young man named barry hes on the bellstaff here i remember because she was over the moon when he was able to switch to night shift that way they had more time to spend with each other do you know his last name no im sorry she always lit up when she chattered about him any spats recently no and believe me id have heard about it when one of them has a fight with a boyfriend or a girlfriend we all hear about it im sure oh oh the color that had crept into her face drained again you dont think he lieutenant the way darlene spoke of him he seemed like such a nice young man its just a routine question hilo ill want to talk to him you see to find out if he has any idea who might have hurt her i see of course both women looked over when the door opened and roarke stepped in im sorry am i interrupting no were finished for now i may have to talk to you again eve told hilo as she got to her feet but youre free to go now i can arrange to have you taken home ive already taken care of that roarke crossed the room took hilos hand theres a driver just outside hell take you home your husbands waiting for you i want you to go straight there hilo take a soother and go to bed take all the time you need i dont want you worrying about work until you feel up to it thank you thank you so much but i think work might help do whats best for you roarke said as he took her to the door hilo nodded then looked back at eve lieutenant she was a harmless little thing harmless whoever did this needs to be punished it wont bring her back but he needs to be punished its all we can do it was all eve thought and never quite enough she waited until roarke had finished a murmured conversation with what she assumed was the driver then shut the door whered you disappear to i had a number of things to see to arrangements to make he angled his head you dont care for civilians on your crime scenes in any case there was little i could do there and a lot to do elsewhere do you want an accounting of my activities and whereabouts lieutenant letting the question hang he walked to the friggie bar and opening it selected a small bottle of white wine as he poured out a glassful it occurred to her that the way shed asked didnt sound very chummy i just wondered where you were thats all and what i was up to he finished its my hotel lieutenant okay okay lets step back she raked a hand through her hair while he coolly sipped his wine its the second time in a few weeks youve had an employee hit at one of your properties thats hard of course if you factor in that you own half of the city only half he interrupted with a glimmer of a smile ill have to speak to my accountant anyway i could stand here and tell you its not personal and you shouldnt take it personally but thats pretty much bullshit because it is personal to you i get that and im sorry so am i for what happened here and for almost looking forward to taking it out on you now that that diversions been avoided ill tell you again i had a number of things to see to the event downstairs being one he held out his glass of wine but as hed expected she shook her head the palace and the upcoming auction are about to experience a media crisis he continued reporters salivate when a murder takes place in a wellknown hotel and you add all the star power downstairs and you have one hell of a story it needs to be spun as quickly as we can manage i also wanted to see that hilo was taken care of it made a difference eve said quietly itll go easier for her because you took the time shes worked for me for ten years and for him nothing else had to be said words already spread through the staff and some panic needed to be avoided before it could set in theres a young man on the bellstaff barry collins the boyfriend yes hes taking it hard i had him taken home and before you slap at me for it he said even as she wound up he was with two other of the bellstaff dealing with luggage from an incoming medical convention during the time of the murder and how do you know the time of the murder brigham saw to it i was informed of the contents of the security discs did you think he wouldnt no i didnt but i still have to talk to the boyfriend you wouldnt have gotten anything out of him tonight his voice softened the way it could that made it something like music hes twentytwo eve and he was in love with her hes broken to pieces christ he murmured as pity stirred he wanted his mother so thats where i sent him okay she couldnt fight it id probably have done the same i can talk to him later i assume youve run james priory yeah and i assume you already know the results so ill just say im having him run through ircca hell be in the system this isnt his first i can get the data for you quicker he could she thought at home in the locked room that held his unregistered equipment lets do it this way for now he strolled out of here like a man who knew he had some place cozy to go ill find out where soon enough the real question is why he came here with a purpose the fake id room booked well in advance two nights a time pad in case something didnt work out the first night he settled down in his room and he waited for her darlene specifically if so thats another why any housekeeper why again i might get some of that from his history but it troubled her he didnt care that we made him thats a puzzler unless im way off and we dont find a sheet on him it doesnt make sense he wouldnt have taken more precautions giving you or possibly me the finger yeah sometimes its just that simple i have to go to new jersey notify next of kin before i go downtown to file my report how about a lift you astonish me lieutenant he said with surprise maybe i just want to keep my eye on you good enough he set down his wine and going to her cupped her face in his hands pressed his lips to her forehead this ones going to be difficult for both of us ill apologize now for any hard words i might say before you close this okay marriage she thought it was some ride she cupped his face in turn and gave him a long hard kiss on the mouth thats because ill probably say meaner ones his arms slipped slyly around her say something mean now really mean then since we happen to be in a hotel room you can make up for it on the spot pervert she said and with a laugh shoved him away ouch he followed her to the door and out thatll cost you later o o notification of next of kin was the most miserable part of being a homicide cop with a few words you cut slices out of lives no matter how they were put back together later they were never the same once pieces were missing from the whole the pattern was forever altered eve tried not to think about it on the way back from new jersey where shed left darlene frenchs mother and younger sister devastated instead she moved on to the steps that would bring them justice if not comfort if there were any like crimes in the city or other boroughs id have heard about it still she used the indash computer in roarkes spiffy little xxx to do a scan for them we got your strangulations we got your rape and we got your battery she began i love new york yeah me too were sick anyway we have each of the basic elements here and there over the last six months but none that include all three and none with a silver wire used as a garrote nothing in a hotel either but the fact that he used one means he could have hit other cities countries even off planet ill widen the scan when she broke off as the communicator in her purse signaled dallas cant you take one goddamn night off she stared into feeneys mournful eyes i was working on it well work harder you take one maybe some of the rest of us get one i was all kicked back with a bottle of brew a bowl of cheese chips and the yankee game onscreen when peabody tagged me sorry yeah well the sons of bitches lost lost to the freaking tijuana tacos burns my ass he blew out a breath scratching his fingers in his wiry thatch of graying russetcolored hair anyway something about your guy rang some bells when peabody shot the image through couldnt bring it together at first had to run him through ircca with disc image only no prints sweepers say he musta sealed up well get his dna though from the blood and skin under her nails and the semen didnt seal up his dick yeah i know how you guys hate putting a coat on your best friend he gave her a sour smile i dont figure hes worried about the dna sealed up i expect to buy a little time to relocate take us a few hours to get the dna results did you get a pop through ircca im getting to it so i run him image only get me some likelies with probable facesculpting work i fiddle around with them some on the morphing system and i got a real pretty picture added in the murder weapon and rang those bells names sylvester yost sly yost got him a shit pot load of aliases but thats his birth name was priory one of his akas not until now i got it added into the mix anyhow about fifteen years back i worked a case serial strangulations silver wire five victims scattered all over the damn planet we had one in new york female licensed companion secondrate license she had ties to the black market so did the other four victims not the same organization but every victim was a key player in something mucky we got a line on yost but never tugged him in on it the murders stopped and the case sat there going stale a hired hammer we figured but who hired the bastard he hit every major cartel no bias there he comes up most likely on no less than twenty strangulations before and since and he did time in the thirties for assault with deadly yeah i knew hed seen what a cage looks like from the inside only one arrest just the one records show hed have been twenty when the miami cops reeled him in looks like hes gotten better at his work over the years im pulling into central now send me everything youve got on him already did im going to work it some more get you an update in the morning id like a second shot at this guy youve got it tomorrow then hey dallas what whats that stuff in your hair what stuff she reached up dragging fingers through and felt the little raindrop diamonds its just i was out mortified she cleared her throat never mind she muttered and cut transmission o o the man whod been born sylvester yost who had strangled a young maid while under the name of james priory and was currently carrying identification as giorgio masini sipped his second glass of unblended scotch and watched the recording of the evenings yankee game if hed been the type to kill for personal reasons hed have hunted down the yankee pitcher and gutted him like a fish but since murder was a business he merely sat cursing quietly in a surprisingly feminine voice there had been some whod made cracks about the thin high pitch of his voice if he was on a job he ignored them if he was on his own time he beat the living hell out of them but even that was simply a matter of principle he wasnt a passionate man not about people or principles the lack of passion made him an excellent killing machine the money for the nights work had already been deposited in an account under yet another name he had no idea why the girl because shed been hardly more than that had been targeted he simply accepted the contract fulfilled it took the money this particular job had only just begun and promised to reap him a considerable fee as he was considering retirement quite seriously considering it it was a delightful little cushion over the years those fees had allowed him to develop and indulge a refined and cultured taste he could afford the best so he had studied and experienced and discovered just what the best entailed food drink art music fashion hed traveled all over the world and off planet as well at fiftysix he could speak three languages fluently which was yet another sterling job tool and could when the mood struck prepare a brilliant gourmet meal whats more he could play the piano like an angel he hadnt been born with a silver spoon in his mouth but the silver wire had made up for it at twenty hed been the minor thug that eve had seen beneath the polish hed killed because he could and it paid now he was a virtuoso of murder a performer par excellence who had never disappointed his paying customers and who left his own individual stamp on each target pain the beatings humiliation the rape the silver wire murder with class for sly it was a tidy little threeact play with only the set and the second lead as variables he was always the star of the show sly enjoyed traveling and had several scrapbooks filled with postcards he picked up as he did so occasionally he would page through them sipping a drink smiling over the reminders of places hed been and the trinkets hed collected there the meal he had in paris that summer after hed dispatched the electronics manufacturer the view from his hotel window on a rainy evening in prague before hed strangled the american envoy good memories he was confident that though his current employment would keep him in new york for the run of the show it would provide many more of those good memories chapter three in the morning eve sat at her desk in cop central and reviewed all the data feeney had sent her the night before with a few hours sleep a fresh eye and a third cup of coffee she let a picture form in her mind of one sylvester yost a career criminal a stone killer sired by a secondstring gunrunner whod disappeared and was presumed dead during the urban wars birthed by a diagnosed mental defective whod had a penchant for boosting cars and slicing the unhappy owners with a switchblade shed died of a drug overdose in a recovery ward when her son had been thirteen sly had apparently decided to carry on the family tradition with his own style of mayhem she had his juvenile file now hed toyed with knives cutting the ear off his caseworker two weeks after hed been sucked into the system hed sampled rape assaulting one of the girls in his group home and leaving her battered but hed found his true calling with strangulation and had apparently practiced on small dogs and big cats before graduating to the human species at fifteen hed escaped from the juvie facility he was now fiftysix in those fortyone years hed spent only one in a cage and was suspected of fortythree murders the information on him was sketchy despite files compiled by the fbi interpol the ircca and the global bureau for interplanetary crimes the subject was a suspected killerforhire who had no living family no known friends or associates no known address his habitual weapon of choice was wire of sterling silver but victims attributed to him had also been strangled manually with silk scarves and with gold rope in the early days eve noted as she read before he settled on his signature style victims were both male and female of all ages races and financial groups bodily violence including torture and rape were often employed good at your work arent you sly and i bet you dont come cheap she sat back studying the disc image of yost at the checkin desk of the roarke palace hotel who the hell would hire you to kill a young maid who lived with her mother and sister in hoboken she rose paced the crowded box of her office there was a possibility hed made a mistake but that was slim you dont last fortyodd years in the assassin game by plucking at the wrong target logically yost had done what hed been paid to do so who was darlene french and who was she linked with roarkes connection was there no question but while the death would cause him personal unhappiness and some professional inconvenience it just didnt make that much of a ripple in the big ocean of roarkes holdings back to the victim had darlene heard or seen something without even being aware shed heard or seen it hotels were busy places with a great deal of business being done but if the girl had brushed up against something why have her murdered in such an obvious and dramatic fashion take her out quietly and be done with it an accident a botched mugging everyones shocked and sorry the cops take a glance offer their sympathies and it all goes away though the theory didnt gel for her eve decided shed need to go back to the hotel and take a close look at whod stayed in the rooms under darlenes care for the last several weeks she stopped by her skinny window watched the morning insanity sky and street traffic were vicious an airbus lumbered by jammed port to port with commuters who didnt have the luxury or the good sense to work out of their homes a oneman traffic cam hovered with a scissor snap of blades as the rush hour was analyzed reported and broadcast to those already suffering through it the media needed to fill airtime with something she supposed shed already ignored over a half dozen calls from reporters hoping for a comment or break on the murder until she was pushed into giving a statement by her commander she was leaving the media spin to roarke no one did it better she heard the unmistakable sound of cop shoes slapping against ancient linoleum and continued to stare out her window sir theres a woman on this airtram out here with a lap full of flowers where the hell is she going with all those flowers its coming up on mothers day lieutenant could be paying her duty call a little early hmmm i want to run the boyfriend peabody barry collins if we swing with this being a hired job somebodys footing the bill i dont think a bellmans got the wherewithal for yosts fee but it could be hes the connection to someone who does yost oh sorry youre not uptodate she corrected that oversight with her back to the room and her eyes on the sky captain feeneys coming in on the investigation are you going to pull in mcnab eve glanced over her shoulder peabody was working hard to look casual but that square earnest face wasnt fashioned for bluffing not so long ago if id hinted about pulling mcnab into an investigation youd have whined and bitched no sir id have started to whine and bitch then youd have slapped me down after that id have whined and bitched mentally she broke into a grin anyway times change mcnab and i get along better now mostly since were having sex except oh dont dont tell me stuff about it i was just going to say hes been acting a little weird if you look up mcnab in the dictionary weird is the common definition different weird peabody corrected but filed that little gem away to use on him at the first opportunity hes nice really nice sort of sweet and attentive he brings me flowers i think hes stealing them out of the park but still and just a few days ago he took me to the movies a chick flick id made noises about wanting to see he hated it and made sure i knew it after but he sprang for the admission and everything oh man so anyway i think peabody stopped snorted out a laugh as her cooleyed and courageous lieutenant let out a short shriek and stuck her fingers in her ears i cant hear you i dont want to hear you im not going to hear you go do the run on barry collins now thats an order peabody simply moved her mouth what i said yes sir peabody explained when eve unplugged her ears she walked to the door judged her timing i think hes setting me up for something she said and fled ill set you up eve muttered and dropped behind her desk id like to set both of you up then dropkick your asses since she was in the mood to kick someones she called the lab and harassed the chief tech over verifying the dna o o by the time she met with feeney she had conclusive dna evidence that the man who had raped and murdered darlene french was sylvester yost when she told him he nodded sat on her desk and took his habitual bag of nuts from the sagging pocket of his wrinkled suit never doubted it i ran a scan for like crimes nothing in the past seven eight months hes been on vacation or somebody didnt want the bodies found any indication that he ever acts on his own personal reasons nope feeney crunched on a nut patterns for profit ive got mcnab running the interplanetary and off planet scan might find something there youre bringing mcnab in her tone had him lifting his eyebrows yeah you got a problem with him no no he does good work even as she spoke she drummed her fingers on the desk its just this thing with him and peabody feeney hunched his shoulders i dont want to think about that well me neither but if she was going to suffer so was he he took her to a girl movie what feeney paled and the nut currently in his mouth almost rolled off his tongue he went to a skirt movie took her thats what i said ah christ he got off the desk took a quick turn around the room on short bandy legs thats it you know thats the finish boys sunk next thing you know hell be picking her flowers already done dont tell me this shit dallas he turned back basset hound eyes pleading dont put this business in my brain isnt it bad enough i know theyre you know getting naked together nobody listens to me about this she nodded pleased to have found a like mind roarke thinks its sweet he doesnt have to work with them does he feeney said firing up he doesnt have to do the job knowing theres winking and tickling and jesus christ in heaven knows what going on i thought she had her sights on that slickfaced lc monroe shes juggling them feeney peeled back his lips sat again offered dallas the bag of nuts women yeah what is with them feeling considerably better she ate a handful so ive got peabody running the boyfriend i dont think were going to find anything but once we have his data ill swing over and interview him right now im dodging the media thats for roarke to deal with im going back to the crime scene do some poking around the hotel i expect the tox report on french within an hour i figure its going to be clean but you never know about people especially female people he muttered still brooding yeah frenchs parents divorced about eight years back hes harry d french currently living in the bronx with his second wife you got time to snip off that thread and take a look at his data if it was a professional hit maybe it was payback to him for something ill run him now the mother sherry tides french i ran her last night manages a damn candy store at the newark transpo center whistle clean i cant see it coming down through her she tossed him back his nuts rose and plucked her jacket from its hook since youve got mcnab how about having him run the wire lets see if we can find out where he buys it the lab analysis should be coming through before midday yeah ill put him on it keep him busy keep his mind out of his pants there you go eve shrugged into her jacket and headed out o o eves first stop was the hotel manager she requested disc copies of guest records records of current hotel personnel and any employee whod been terminated or had quit in the past year before she could begin her song and dance about aiding the police in a homicide investigation the possibility of a warrant she was handed a sealed file containing everything shed asked for she was told that the staff had been instructed by roarke to give her full cooperation and any data she requested that was easy peabody commented as they took the elevator to the fortysixth floor yeah hes been busy eve tapped the file on her open hand then passed the file to peabody she uncoded the police seal on the door stepped in how do you pass a few hours in a hotel while youre waiting to kill someone enjoy the view watch a little screen have some dinner he doesnt make or receive any transmission from the room link or fax or computer maybe he does on his personal she mused wandering the parlor checks in verifies hes here she turned into the kitchen studied the counter grimy now with the sweepers dust in the sink was a neat stack of dishes he uses the autochef at six plenty of time before turndown a good hour before the earliest start probably he knows the routine that this particular room gets done around eight most nights hed have checked the hotel events calendar so hed know a big deal partys going on a conventions coming in anothers midswing hotels near capacity so housekeepings not going to come by early hey lets have a steak she moved closer to the sink he probably ate in front of the screen on the sofa or at the dining table you wouldnt waste a hotshot place like this by eating standing up in the kitchen then he has dessert and coffee pats his belly he brings his dishes into the kitchen puts them tidily into the sink hes used to taking care of himself picking up for himself doesnt like messy dishes in view she looked at the way the knife and fork were lined up beside the plate how the dessert plate the cup and saucer were stacked on top a little pyramid he probably lives alone might not even go for a server droid he doesnt live in hotels not all the time you live with maids around you dont clear your plates from the table peabody nodded i noticed something last night forgot to mention it what you know all the goodies hotels like this have for guests the bathroom stuff fancy soaps and shampoos creams bath bubbles he took them she smiled at eves speculative look lots of people do but most of them arent waiting to kill somebody or havent just finished killing somebody good eye so hes either frugal or he likes souvenirs how about towels the robes those little slippers they put beside the bed at night they put slippers beside the bed at night ive never stayed in a place that the robes are there she finished catching herself before eve could two of them bedroom closet unused i dont know how many towels you get in a place like this but theres enough for a family of six in the bathroom theyre unused too hed have used towels prior to turndown a shower after his traveling day maybe she started toward the bedroom as she spoke and a good boy who clears the table would certainly wash his hands after he pees he didnt hold his bladder for five hours plus she paused at the parlor bath a smaller version of the master with a blue glass shower stall snowy white towels and a gleaming john discreetly tucked behind blue glass doors bath amenities are gone from here too i didnt catch that before he cleaned the place out why spend money on soap and shampoo if you can get it free particularly when its topoftheline stuff she continued to the bedroom scanning briefly before she walked into the bath this one was huge with a pondsized tub a separate shower offering six jets at adjustable heights and speeds and a drying tube shed spent time in a roarke hotel before and knew that the milelong counter would have been artfully decorated with fancy bottles of creams and lotions this one was bare frowning she walked over to the brass rack that held three thick and monogrammed hand towels he used this one lets have a bag how do you know he used it the monograms not centered like the others he used it washed up after hed finished with her dried his hands then tidy guy that he is hung it back up she mustve come in walked straight in here to take the used towels put in fresh hes somewhere waiting for her getting a look at her figuring maybe the closet she said she starts to walk through again carrying the used towels probably dumps them on the floor she turns down the bed doing her job making it nice for the guests then hes on her snatches her beeper before she can press an alarm tosses it over there where we found it the rest was done on the bed eve thought he didnt give her time to try to run theres no sign in the suite of a struggle not that she could have managed much of one against a guy his size the bed linens got soiled and tangled but nothing else everything else is orderly so he got her there did it all there to music thats the creepy part peabody murmured the rest of its nasty but the music parts creepy when hes done with her he checks the time hey didnt take so long he washes his hands probably tsktsks about the little scratches she managed to dig into him changes his clothes packs up scooping his amenities into his case then the son of a bitch picks up the towels she dropped and carries them out to her cart not going to change the sheets of course but we dont want to leave more of a mess than necessary thats cold oh yeah its cold an easy job in and out of a plush hotel in a matter of hours a good meal a fresh supply of bath products and a big fat fee i can figure him peabody i can figure him but i cant figure who pointed him here or why she stood silent a moment bringing the image of darlene french into her mind and as she did she heard the sound of the hall door opening with one hand on her weapon she signaled peabody to the side with the other she moved down the hall quickly quietly swung around the corner weapon in hand damn it roarke damn it disgusted she shoved the weapon back in her holster as he shut the door what are you doing looking for you this room is sealed its a crime scene and sealed the seal she imagined would have taken him less time to uncode with his clever fingers than it had for her to do so with her master which is why when informed you were on the premises it was the first place i looked hello peabody what do you want eve snapped before her aide could answer im working yes im aware of that i assumed youd want to follow through on some of the interviews you mentioned last night barry collins is at home but his supervisors available at your convenience as is another maid sheila walker who was a particular friend of the victims she came in to clear out darlenes locker for the family she cant touch and so i told her not until you clear it but ive asked her to wait so that you can speak to her she sizzled sparked then cooled down to smolder i could tell you i dont need any help setting up interviews you could he agreed so pleasantly she didnt know whether to snarl or laugh but you saved me some time so thanks i will say i dont want you or anyone else in this room again until ive cleared it understood when youre done you can reach me at zerozeroone on any link were done for now lets start with sheila walker i have an office set up for you on the meeting room level no let me talk to her and the other one on their turf lets keep it informal keep them comfortable whatever you prefer shes in the domestic employees lounge ill show you fine you might as well hang around too eve said as she walked through the door he opened youll make her feel protected o o less than three minutes into the interview eve saw shed called it right sheila was a tall thin black girl with enormous eyes more times than eve could count she looked toward roarke for reassurance direction and comfort she had a beautiful accent like island music but between it and the muffled tears eve began to feel a headache brewing she was so sweet that girl was so sweet you never heard a bad word out of her mouth about anybody had a sunny disposition usually if a guest got to see her or talk to her when she was cleaning theyd give her a big tip cause she made them feel good now ill never see her again i know its hard sheila to lose a friend could you tell if there was anything on her mind any worry oh no she was happy in two days we have off and the two of us we were going shopping for shoes that girl she loved to shop for shoes right before we went for turndowns we were saying how wed go early and get ourselves one of those free makeovers at the beauty counter at the sky mall her thin exotic face crumpled oh mr roarke sir at the fresh bout of weeping he merely took her hand held it eve picked away for another half hour and took away scattered pieces that formed an image of a carefree cheerful young woman who liked to shop go dancing and was having her first serious love affair shed had a regular breakfast date with her boyfriend every morning after shift they ate in the employee lounge except on payday when they splurged on a meal in a coffee shop a few blocks away routinely he walked her to her transpo station waved her off but theyd been making tentative noises about getting a small apartment together maybe in the fall shed said nothing to her best friend as sheila claimed to be about seeing hearing or finding anything unusual or concerning and had wheeled away her cart that last evening with a smile on her face o o the bell captain who she interviewed in a lounge for the bellstaff gave her a similarly rosy picture of barry young eager cheerful and starryeyed over a darkhaired housekeeper named darlene hed gotten a raise only the month before and had shown anyone he could collar the little gold heart necklace hed bought for his girl for their sixmonth anniversary eve remembered darlene had been wearing just such a necklace playing with it as shed waited to enter peabody girl question she said as she walked between her aide and roarke across the lobby im quite a girl right you have a fight with your boyfriend or youre having second thoughts about the whole deal anything like that do you wear a present hes given you absolutely not if its a big fight you toss it back in his face if youre considering dumping him you shed a few tears over it then stick it in a drawer until you work up to the break off if its a minor spat you tuck it away until you see how things are going to shake down you only wear something hes given you at least in plain sight when you want to show him and everybody else that hes your guy how do you keep the rules straight its boggling but thats sort of what i figured hey she slapped at roarkes hand as he tugged the chain around her neck and popped the tearshaped diamond hed once given her from under her shirt just checking apparently im still your guy it wasnt in plain sight she said with some satisfaction close enough and catching the gleam in his eye she narrowed her own you try kissing me out here and im going to knock you down lets go talk to barry anyway peabody she said sliding the pendant under her shirt again close off this angle you she continued tapping a finger on roarkes chest i need to talk to sometime later about the whole media business ill be at your disposal nothing i like better the smile he gave her faded his eyes sharpened as he heard a voice softly crooning a verse of an old irish ballad before he could turn an arm snaked around his neck locked hed have countered was shifting his weight to do so when the laugh sounded in his ear and sent him back all the way back to the alleyways of dublin then his back was hard up against the wall and he was looking into the laughing eyes of a dead man not as quick as once you were are you now mate maybe not in a lightning move eve had her weapon out and pressed to the mans throat but i am step back asshole or youre dead too late roarke murmured he already is mick connelly why arent you in hell and holding my place cheerfully ignoring the laser at his throat mick cackled ah you cant kill the devil can you till hes ready to go arent you a sight you bastard arent you and eve watched baffled as the two of them grinned like morons easy darling roarke lifted a hand gently nudged eves and her weapon down this ugly son of a bitch is in the way of being an old friend that i am and isnt it just like you to hire yourself a female bodyguard cop roarkes grin spread well jaysus chuckling mick stepped back tapped roarke playfully on the cheek you never used to be quite so chummy with a badge im very chummy with this one shes my wife staring mick clutched his heart she neednt bother dropping me im dying of the shock id heard oh one hears all manner of things about roarke but i never believed it he bowed rather charmingly while eve secured her weapon then took her hand and kissed it before she could avoid it its pleased i am to meet you missus pleased as i can be michael connellys my name and mick to my friends which i hope youll be your man here and i were lads together long ago very bad lads we were too dallas lieutenant dallas but she warmed a bit because his eyes green as summer leaves were twinkling with such good humor eve youll forgive the exuberance of my greeting my old mate here but the excitement got the better of me its his neck i have to go she said to roarke but held out a hand in a manner that demanded a shake rather than a kiss on the knuckles nice to meet you likewise for certain and hope to see you again sure later she said to roarke then signaled an avidly watching peabody toward the door mick watched her stride off shes not sure of me is she boyo and why should she be christ its good to lay eyes on you roarke and you what are you doing in new york and in my hotel business always a little business in fact id hoped to run you to ground to discuss it with you deal and wheel wheel and deal he winked have you any time for an old friend chapter four he looked damn good for a dead man mick connelly wore a petalgreen suit roarke remembered hed always been one for color and flash the cut and drape disguised most of the heft hed added in the last years none of them had had any heft to speak of in their youth as varying types of hunger had kept them bone lean his sandcolored hair was cut short and sharp around a face that had like his body filled out with age hed had the front teeth that had bucked out like a beavers fixed somewhere along the way hed lost the pitiful excuse for a mustache hed insisted on sporting and had never come in at more than a smudge over his top lip but he still sported the irish pug nose the fast crooked grin and eyes of wicked and dancing green no one would have called him handsome as a boy hed been short and skinny and covered from top to bottom with gingercolored freckles but hed had quick hands and a quicker tongue his voice was pure south dublin tough music suitable for choreographing flying fists when he stepped into roarkes office in the old and elegant main house of the hotel he planted his hands on his hips and grinned like a gargoyle so youve done for yourself havent you mate id heard of course but seeings a kick in the arse seeing yous the same roarkes voice was warm but hed had time to recover from that instant of surprise and pleasure a part of him held back calculating what this ghost from the dead past might want of him have a seat mick and catch me up ill do that the hotel office was designed to uplift its more pedestrian functions and as anything roarke designed it was as much concerned with comfort as with efficiency the topflight communication center and equipment were blended into graceful furnishings and stylish wall panels the ambiance was of an urban execs fashionable piedaterre mick took a seat in one of the deeply cushioned chairs stretched out his legs scanned the room and roarke imagined the fenced value of its contents then he sighed and studied the view out the wide glass doors and the stone balcony beyond them yes youve done for yourself his eyes darted back to roarke the laughter in them impossible to resist if i give you my word not to lift any of your doodads here will you stand an old friend to a pint roarke moved to a wall panel and opening it ordered two guinnesses from the autochef inside its programmed to draw them proper so itll take a minute been a while since we lifted one together how long do you think fifteen years there or about and the fifteen before that he thought we had been as thick as well thieves roarke leaned back against the table while the guinnesses were built but didnt fully relax his guard id been told youd bought it in a liverpool pub knife fight my sources are usually reliable so why is it mick youre not making book in hell well now ill tell you you may recall my mother god bless her cold black heart would often tell me that it was my fate to die with a knife in my belly she claimed whenever she had a good snootful of the irish to have the sight is she still living then oh aye last i heard i left dublin some time before you did youll remember traveling here and there out to make my fortune however it could be made doing bits of business mostly moving merchandise of one kind or another from one place to another place where it might cool off before moving it yet again which was what i was doing in liverpool on that fateful night idly mick opened a carved wooden box on the table beside him and arched his brows at the french cigarettes inside they were vicious in price and the use of them banned nearly everywhere a body could go mind help yourself for friendship mick took only one rather than palming a half dozen as he would have otherwise now where was i he said as he lit it with a slim gold permamatch out of his pocket ah yes well then i had half the take in my pocket and was to meet my client for the rest of it something went wrong port authority garda got wind raided the warehouse they were looking for me as was the client who got it into his head id weaseled on the deal at roarkes suspicious frown mick laughed and shook his head no indeed i did not id only half my take so why would i in any case i ducked into the pub to think it through and see if i could arrange for some quick and quiet transpo getting out was the main thing what with the cops and the thugs out for my blood and wouldnt you know it while im sitting there stewing about losing my fee about going on the run a fight breaks out a fight in a waterfront pub in liverpool roarke said mildly as he slid two pints of dark foamy guinness from the autochef whod believe it a hell of a one it was too mick took the beer pausing in his story to raise his glass to roarke to old friends then slainte slainte roarke took a seat tasted the first thick sip well i tell you roarke fists and words were flying and there i was just wanting to keep what youd call a low profile for the time being the barman well hes got himself a bat and hes banging it on the bar and the patrons are starting to whistle and take up sides then the two who started it and i never heard what set them off draw knives idve slipped out at that point but there was no getting past them without risking losing a slice of something off me person which i wasnt willing to do it seemed wiser to blend with the crowd which was taking bets and circling and some of the onlookers got into the spirit and began to punch each other for the fun of it it was easy to picture and easy to remember how many times theyd started such an evenings entertainment themselves how many pockets did you pick during the show i lost count mick said with a grin but i made up a small portion of my lost fee chairs began to fly and bodies with them i couldnt help but get caught up in the thing and damned if the two whod started it didnt end up sticking each other mortal too i could see that right off by the blackness of the blood and the smell of it you know how that whiff of death hits the nose yes i do well most of the crowd backed off then quick enough and began to disburse like rats leaving a ship and the barman he goes to call the cops so it comes to me like a flash of light this one dead man heres my coloring and close to my build as well so its fate isnt it mick connelly needs to vanish and how better than to be dead on the floor of a liverpool pub i switched ids with him and ran so michael joseph connelly died bleeding there as his mother had predicted and bobby pike took the next transpo for london and thats my story he drank deep let out a breath of pleasure christ its good to look at that face of yours we had some times didnt we you and me and brian and the rest we did yes i heard about what happened to jenny and to tommy and shawn it broke my heart knowing they died as they did theres only you and me and bri left from the old dublin gang brians in dublin still he owns the penny pig and mans the bar himself half the time ive heard it ill wind myself back to dublin town again and see for myself one day do you go back much no mick nodded not all the memories are good ones after all still you got well out didnt you always said you would he rose then carrying his halfempty pint as he strolled to the glass doors think of it you own this whole bloody place and christ knows what besides last years ive been over the world and off it and nowhere ive been could i say i havent heard the name of my old boyhood mate bandied about like a damn religion he turned back and grinned fuck me roarke if im not proud of you it struck roarke oddly that no one who had known the boy had ever said those words to the man what are you doing with yourself mick oh bits of business always bits of business and when some of it brought me to new york city i said to myself mick youre going to get yourself a room in that fancy hotel of roarkes and youre going to look him up im traveling under my own name again time enoughs passed since liverpool and too much times passed im after thinking since i had a pint with old friends so youve looked me up and were having our pint now why dont you tell me whats behind it all mick leaned back against the door lifted the pint to his lips and studied roarke with those dancing eyes there never was any getting over on you a natural radar youve always had for bullshit but the fact is what ive told you is true as gold it just so happens that it occurred to me that you might be interested in some of the business im here to conduct its a matter of stones pretty colorful stones just wasting away in some dark box i dont do that sort of thing anymore mick grinned let out a short laugh then blinked as roarke merely sat watching him oh come now this is mick youre never going to tell me youve retired those magic hands of yours lets just say ive put them to different uses legal ones i havent needed to pick pockets or lift locks in some time need who said anything about need mick said with a bluster youve a godgiven talent and not just your hands but your brain never in my life have i met anyone with a slick and cagey a brain as yours and for larceny it was created smiling again he walked back to sit now youre not going to expect me to believe you run all of this fucking empire of yours on the up and up i do now and thats a challenge in itself my heart dramatically mick clutched his chest im not as young as once i was i cant take this kind of shock to the system youll live through it and youll have to find another setting for your stones a pity a shame a sin really but what is is mick sighed straight and narrow is it well ive got something straight as i like to mix things up to keep myself fresh ive a little enterprise ive started with a couple of fellows small chickens compared to a big rooster like you scents perfumes and the like with the idea of packaging the product with an oldfashioned spin romance you know would you be interested in an investment i might then well talk about it sometime while im in town mick got to his feet for now i best see what sort of accommodations ive copped here and let you get back to whatever it is you do with yourself youre not welcome at the palace roarke said rising but you are in my home thats kind of you but im not looking to put you out i thought you were dead jenny and the others save brian are i never had them in my home ill have your luggage seen to o o there were already psychiatric personality and pattern profiles generated on yost through various law enforcement agencies around the globe still eve considered sending them and her notes on him to dr mira the nypsds top profiler for a nutshell analysis but a professional killer was in essence only a tool however much she wanted him she wanted his employer more the fbi estimates yosts fee for a single hit to be in the neighborhood of two million usd this doesnt include expenses and escalates according to the target and the difficulty of the job eve inclined her head to the screen in the conference room at central where darlenes image smiled out at her what makes a twentytwoyearold chambermaid worth two million plus information mcnab suggested hed been called in much to his delight as consult from edd now he sat his long blond hair meticulously looped through a trio of round red clips and his pretty thin face sober possible going there we say the victim had or was believed to have had damaging information if so why not arrange for a much lesser fee a botched mugging she had a regular routine coming and going to work used public transportation and walked most usually alone from the transpo stops to the hotel and to her building stick her on the street grab her purse and she goes down as a mugging victim low profile yeah and though he agreed mcnab felt he had to justify his addition to the team by playing devils advocate but theres a real element of risk on the street she gets lucky gets away some good samaritan comes to her rescue you take her at work in a room and theres no mistake shes out and the murder gets priority a big fat investigative team and roarke she added though she didnt care for it somebodys got enough wherewithal for a major hammer he knows just what hes taking on by putting a murder into roarkes lap could be hes stupid mcnab said with a glimmer of a grin could be you are peabody snapped back whoever hired yost wanted it high profile media intense investigation its an attention grabber so it follows he was looking for attention maybe paying for it too okay and maybe i agree with that mcnab miffed shifted to peabody but why the hammer and the victim get the attention he doesnt so whats his point weve got no real motive for french fact is we cant say for sure if she was a specific target or just a handy one shes the dead one peabody shot back and if shed switched rooms with another maid that shift shed be alive and theyd be dead mcnab you surprise me eve kept her voice mild and just faintly sarcastic thats almost real detective thinking according to hotel records james priory aka sylvester yost didnt specify that particular room or even that particular floor when he booked this tells me and is corroborated by the probability scan that i just for the hell of it ran before this meeting just one of those pesky investigative chores we use over here in homicide this tells me she continued as both mcnab and peabody winced that darlene french was not a particular target which in turns tells me that its unlikely she had any particular purpose or meaning other than being alive and in that room lieutenant why does anyone pay a couple million to have someone killed at random lets add to that eve said with a nod toward mcnab why does anyone choose a hammer whos known to every law enforcement agency on or off planet a hammer who will be identified within hours to do the job why is it arranged that the job takes place in a landmark facility that will stir the scent for the media until drool forms when there was silence feeney finally sighed i dont know dallas you try to raise them right give them the benefit of your experience and they sit like idiots roarke he said roarkes the target o o it was the why that worried her why was someone going to this trouble and expense to signal roarke heres what i can do heres what i can dump right at your front door what was the point the media would buzz and he would spin the swarm around the hotel itself might take a few cancellations and would receive twice that much in new reservations due to the morbid curiosity and sick excitement factors some employees might resign others would scramble to fill the slots in the end it would cost him nothing and in the shortterm only garner him publicity he knew exactly how to turn to his advantage unless whoever hired yost knew the way roarke worked inside unless they knew how having an innocent young girl killed on his property under his employ would work on him the price roarke would pay was personal and if the motive had been personal as well yes that worried her her motivation for bringing yost to justice was twofold now justice for darlene french answers for roarke at her desk she studied yosts file again no family no known associates no known address no nothing she thought in disgust for the first time in her career she knew the identity of the killer had a solid case of physical evidence every i dotted toward conviction all within twentyfour hours of the crime and had not a single string with which to tug him closer to hand no leads no avenues where do you sleep you son of a bitch where do you eat what do you do with yourself when youre off the clock she pushed away leaned her head back and closed her eyes lowkey she thought letting the image of his face his eyes his mouth form in her head nothing to grab attention youre a loner nice quiet homes in nice neighborhoods gotta have more than one youre a traveling man personal transpo probably probably but nothing flashy solid dependable discreet classic like the music you kill by but if you drove into new york you didnt use the garage facilities at the hotel meat and potatoes she thought remembering his hotel meal basic expensive the clothes hed worn in and out had met the same criteria as had his luggage luggage she sat up ordered the file disc that contained his checkin yeah yeah one business travelers wheelon basic and expensive and new looks brandspankingnew to me computer enlarge sector twelve through twentyeight magnify twenty percent working the portion of the image that showed the suitcase standing tidily at yosts feet popped she could see no sign of wear on the heavyduty black leather none of the flaws that showed after even minimal trips through the rigors of handling or security checks enlarge sector six through ten this image working and when the image popped this time she read clearly the fancy brass tag of the manufacturer cachet okay what does that give us computer identify model of baggage on screen manufactured through cachet working unit identified as model number c marketed as business elite and available in leather or cloth unit measures fourteen by eight by six and passes faa and paa carryon requirements for all air and space transportation c is a new model available since january of the current year cachet is the tradename of a division of soloar lights roarke industries corporation who didnt know that eve muttered out since january theres a nice little break computer no never mind she shifted to her interdepartment link and snagged mcnab cachet luggage their model c called business elite get me a list of where that model was sold in black leather since its intro in january of this year i want locations and from those locations i want names who bought the bag thats going to take time she finished did you run out of that substance no sir im on it so am i she murmured then rose she grabbed her jacket her files then strode out to peabodys cubicle in the bull pen im heading home to run some data i want you to check on the hair hair sir yosts hair no way that was his just doesnt fit his face and its too damn fussy for his style so its a rug a good one and my hunch is he has a collection start off with the one hes wearing on the security tapes check salons and beauty suppliers toplevel ones major cities he doesnt fool around with second line and start with stuff thats natural fiber and nonallergic or whatever its called he likes things clean he carries a leather suitcase rather than the lighter manmade cloth peabody opened her mouth but eve was already striding away so she didnt get to ask what a leather suitcase had to do with a wig o o eve walked in the front door of the house just as roarke came down the stairs she blew her bangs out of her eyes and frowned at him what are you doing here she asked i live here you know what i mean yes and i might ask the same youre not offshift as yet ive got stuff i want to run here instead of at central ah yeah ah and since youre here i should be able to cut some time ive got some questions you could she started up as she spoke breaking off when he laid a hand on her arm i was just upstairs settling mick into one of the guest rooms mick oh she paused oh do you have a problem with him staying here for a few days no the timing sucks she thought seriously sucks like you said you live here as do you i realize he comes from a time in my life that isnt entirely comfortable for you he ran a finger over the strap of her shoulder harness lieutenant but it is in fact a time in my life i met a few of your friends from dublin before i like brian i know he laid his hands on her shoulders now ran them down her back moving closer until his brow rested on hers mick was important to me eve as close likely closer than a brother might have been through some very ugly times and some good ones i thought he was dead and id adjusted to that and now you know he isnt she understood friendship its pulls and tugs and its puzzles would you mind asking him not to do anything id have to arrest him for while hes staying in one of the guest rooms he shifted just enough to press his lips to hers i think youll like him yeah and they both knew he hadnt agreed to her request you irish guys are pretty likable listen i just want to say you dont need any trouble right now with the way this homicide investigation is heading he nodded it was never her was it that poor little maid i dont think so we need to sit down and figure who would go after you this way and why all right when i can ive some arrangements to put into motion just now were having some people over for dinner tonight roarke i can make your excuses if its not convenient for you magda and her son and a few key people will be here its important to smooth out feathers ruffled by the incident last night and to reassure everyone involved in the upcoming auction that security and publicity are under control no point in asking you to postpone the whole deal none at all he said cheerfully i can hardly put the hotel or any of my projects or my life for that matter on hold because its believed that someones hoping to upset me the next move might be on you his smile never dimmed in fact it sharpened id prefer it i dont want another innocent life on my conscience in any case i have the most reliable of bodyguards very close at hand and she intended to be closer what times the dinner thing eight then id better get some work done i guess i have to put on some fancy deal leave that to me he took her hand kissed it thank you yeah yeah save it i want some of your time before tomorrow she added jogging up the stairs darling eve i want a great deal of yours she snorted kept going and when she reached the second floor paused as mick came out of one of the countless guest rooms hed removed his suit jacket and looked to her eye casual and at home he gave her a quick crooked smile ah lieutenant nothing more annoying than an unexpected houseguest is there and add on to that an old boyhood friend of your husbands whos a stranger to you and you have tedium on top of it i hope youre not too inconvenienced by my staying its a big house she said then realized that was probably not the most polite of responses but he received it with such a huge rollicking laugh she had to grin back at him sorry im a little distracted roarke wants you here so thats fine with me thanks for that ill try not to bore the ears off your head with stories of our youthful escapades actually i like hearing that kind of thing well now thats opening the worm can he winked at her some house he said letting his gaze wander the generous hall and stairs house isnt the word i suppose not near to grand enough for this palace how do you find your way about i dont always she noticed his gaze shifting again resting contemplatively on her weapon harness problem she said coolly now no indeed though im not shamed to say im not one to care for that sort of weapon really idly she laid her hand on it what kind of weapon do you prefer he lifted his arm cocked it at the elbow and bunched his fist this always did fine enough for me but in your line of work well and speaking of that i was just thinking this is one of the rare pleasant conversations ive experienced with a person in your profession roarke and a cop begging your pardon lieutenant theres a brain rattler maybe youd sit and tell me the story of how that came to be one of these days god knows id love to hear it ask roarke hes better at stories than i am id like your version all the same he hesitated then appeared to come to a decision as he approached her roarke wouldnt have settled for less than smart so i figure you for a smart cop lieutenant and as one youd know the likes of me when you look but maybe you dont know that roarkes my oldest friend in this world i hope i can work a truce if nothing better than that with the woman my friend married when he held out a hand eve came to a decision of her own ill take a truce with a friend of the man i married she clasped his hand keep it clean in new york mick i dont want any trouble for him nor do i he gave her hand a squeeze or for meself for that matter you work in the homicide part of things dont you thats right i can say looking you in the eye that ive never had occasion to kill anyone and have no plans to begin that might help things along here it doesnt hurt chapter five leaving the houseguest for roarke and summerset to deal with eve buried herself in her home office to study the case files on the long list of murders tagging yost as the primary suspect she picked them apart put them back together searching for holes in the investigative process for pieces that had been mislaid or ignored whenever she found something she set it aside in what she began to think of as her screwup file thered been a number of definite screwups to her way of thinking witnesses who hadnt been thoroughly interviewed or pushed during an interview trace evidence that had been logged but not tracked down to its root source in a smattering of the cases she found there had been some small personal item taken from the body of the victim a ring a hair ribbon a wrist unit all inexpensive items that held consistent with the lack of robbery as motive but that didnt eve felt hold consistent with pattern if he took something from one he took something from all she muttered he was anal tidy habitual souvenirs she thought he takes a token what had he taken from darlene french she brought up the security video keyed it into the section where darlene had wheeled her cart to the door of froze the image magnified it earrings in the image darlene wore tiny gold hoops at her ears all but hidden by her dark curling hair though eve was certain no such jewelry had been on the body she checked the record splitscreening images so that she could examine darlene battered and broken on the bed he took your little earrings a collector she decided sitting back because he enjoys the work she wondered wants to be able to look back on various jobs remember them revisit them so it wasnt just the money no not just the money are they thrill kills after all her desk link signaled and still studying the two images of darlene she answered dallas got a line on the wire mcnab began its sold by length or by weight primarily to jewelers professional and hobbyists or artists you can get it retail but its a hell of a lot pricier that way than going to a wholesale source most of the retail suppliers sell small lengths and my information is most of thats to consumers who buy it for hairdos or a quick wrap around the wrist or ankle impulse stuff wholesalers eve said hes not an impulse guy and he doesnt like to overpay she added thinking of the hotel amenities figured we got way over a hundred wholesalers globally and another twenty or so off planet you need an artist or craftsman license or a retail id number to purchase at wholesale level you got that you can get it from the source or order electronically okay run them all she brought up her evidence list as she spoke checked the length of the wire removed from the crime scene he used a twofoot length exactly two feet on french she made a quick scan of other case files nodded yeah he likes that length check on orders of that length and lengths with twofoot multiples she shut her eyes a minute silver tarnishes doesnt it gets spotty or something with age you gotta keep it polished unless its coated lab said this was uncoated sterling i got the report right here and theres no mention of any chemical any polish on the metal he couldve wiped it pretty clean i guess i dont know how much might stay on or what the hell it does to the metal highlight the twofoot purchases eve decided list them chronologically going back from the date of the murder my guess is hed want a nice shiny new tool for each job she cut transmission pondered a bit over the properties of sterling silver then picked through the files yet again following the wire other investigators had followed it as well but in less than half the cases they had done full scans on specific lengths and in half of those the primary had focused on suppliers in the city and environs of the murder only sloppy goddamn sloppy she glanced up still scowling as roarke came in what happens to silver when you polish it it gets shiny haha i mean does the polish stuff leave a coat on it or what he sat on the edge of her desk smiled at her why i wonder would you suppose id know the answer to that you know every damn thing thats flattering lieutenant but domestic activities such as silver polishing are just slightly out of my aegis ask summerset i dont want to that would require speaking to him on a voluntary basis ill tag somebody in the lab but when she started to reach for her link roarke simply waved her away and contacted his majordomo on the house link summerset does silver polish leave a coating of any sort on the metal thinfaced pale of complexion and dark of eye summerset filled the link screen on the contrary if properly done the polish is buffed away or the silver would be cloudy and the process removes a minute layer of the metal thank you helpful he asked eve when hed ended transmission just plugging holes do you sell silver wire oh i imagine yeah so did i if youd like help tracing the murder weapon mcnabs on it well see how far we can fumble without you in that area of course but you did want to discuss something with me yeah wheres your pal micks enjoying the pool and weve a couple of hours before our guests begin to arrive okay but she rose walked across the room and closed her office door and standing there looked back studying the man she loved had married and lived with the hit if we accept the theory that this was a hired job cost two million plus expenses at the minimum who would spend that much to inconvenience or embarrass or upset you i cant tell you there are certainly a number of competitors professional rivals or foes those who have a personal dislike for me who have the financial resources to invest that much money to disturb me how many of that number wouldnt see murder as too high a price in business he lifted his hands ive made a lot of enemies certainly but the battles are generally waged in meeting rooms over ledgers while its not unthinkable that one of them might reach flash point and decide eliminating me is a worthwhile business move i cant think of a reason logically why killing a maid in one of my hotels would answer not all your battles used to be waged in meeting rooms or over ledgers no but even they were direct if were dealing with an old grudge it would still be me or mine targeted i didnt even know that girl there she stepped forward now moving in on him her eyes on his face thats the point i keep circling back to it hurts you it preys on your mind and it pisses you off there are other ways to accomplish all of that without killing an innocent girl who wouldnt care she insisted past or present what major deals do you have going on right now where the balance could be shifted if youre not focused not on top of it olympus when we took those few days last week you spent a lot of time fixing stuff the sort of thing thats expected to arise in a project of that size and scope its under control would it be if you werent at the helm he considered there might be some added delays costs some complications but yes i have a strong team in every area of that project as i do on all major holdings im not indispensable eve bullshit she said it with such force it startled him you have your finger on every button in every deal or organization the whole damn mess youve built would spin without you fine but it wouldnt spin the same way theres only one you whove you bumped up against who doesnt want to play it your way no one in particular in any case if someone wanted to yank my attention away from a project cause me to neglect it the most certain way of doing that would have been to try for you and have you hound them until theyre no more than husks you can kick into dust i dont think so he skimmed a finger down the shallow dent in her chin you have a point if its nothing from now then you have to think back the past can circle back on us no matter what kind of maze we build we both know that part of yours is splashing around in your swimming pool right now true enough roarke she hesitated then leaped you havent seen him for a long time you dont know who he is now or what hes done in the years between he shows up right in the lobby of the hotel hours really after the murder youre looking at mick in this he was able to smile again shake his head hes a thief a grifter a liar certainly and not one youd trust farther than a good boot in the ass would send him but murder isnt in him this kind he continued before she could argue this cold and calculated kind is either in a man or isnt eve we both know that maybe but people change and paying for murder can add a nice cozy buffer for some for some not mick on that point at least he hadnt a doubt youre right that he may have changed but never on that most elemental level hed cheerfully cheat a grandmother even his own out of her lifes savings but he wouldnt kill a mongrel dog or order it done for rubies he was the softest of us when it came to bloodshed okay but shed keep an eye on mick connelly nonetheless someone else from back then you need to put your mind to it to deals from before to deals right now something i can work with ill set my mind on it i promise you good and youll increase your personal security will i shed hoped to sneak that one in but hadnt really counted on it youre the target its possible darlene french was just a warning shot look how close i can get without really trying the next step might be to go after you directly or you he countered are you increasing your personal security i dont have any personal security exactly im a cop and i sleep with one he snuck an arm around her waist arent i lucky cut it out this isnt a joke no indeed it isnt but that crack about increasing my personal security ill take as one so i dont become annoyed with my wife right before we have guests for dinner shut up he suggested as she opened her mouth then insured she did so the kiss was long and it was hard and not particularly playful so when she surfaced from it her eyes narrowed i can hang cops all over you you could he agreed and i could shake them right off again as you well know youre the only cop i want hanging all over me lieutenant in fact his clever fingers had her shirt halfunbuttoned before she slapped them away cut it out i dont have time for this he grinned then ill be quick i said but his teeth sunk lightly into her throat shooting the thrill straight down the center of her body right through the toes her eyes might have crossed but she gave him a decent elbow jab stop it i cant i have to hurry and he was laughing as he unfastened the hook of her trousers laughing when his mouth came back to cover hers she might have kicked him if her feet hadnt gotten tangled but her heart wouldnt have been in it even her yelp as he plopped her onto her own desk didnt register much of a protest halfnaked already breathless she levered herself on her elbows all right just get it over with he leaned over her nipped her chin i heard that snicker that was the sound of a sneer was it amused aroused he distracted her with a nibble on her bottom lip i can never tell the difference and what sound is this what sound he drove himself into her one powerful and deep thrust that ripped a shocked cry from her throat that one he lowered his head tasting the heat that rose to her flesh even as her hips arched to meet him and that one she struggled to get her breath back tolerance she managed oh well if thats the best we can do he started to move back she reared up wrapped around him i need to practice my tolerance she skimmed the hair away from his face with her fingers then fisted her hands her lips curved met his when the inhouse link signaled he simply reached over and manually switched it to standby o o it turned out he wasnt as quick as he was thorough when she was reasonably certain her legs would hold her again she pushed off the desk and stood wearing her boots an open shirt and her shoulder harness absurdly sexy he thought his cop i dont suppose youd wait just a moment while i get a camera not quite steady she glanced down got a reasonably clear picture of herself and curled her lip at him play times over she reached down for her trousers then had to simply stay bent over man you fuzz up my brain thank you darling it wasnt my best effort but i was under considerable time restraint with her hands on her knees she looked up his hair was tousled from her fingers his eyes deep blue and sleepy with satisfaction maybe ill let you try again later youre too good to me he walked by patting her affectionately on the ass wed better tidy ourselves up for dinner o o the thing about dinner parties eve had discovered was that you couldnt just sit down at the table and ask your neighbor to pass the potatoes there was a whole ritual to be observed which included proper attire and body adornments an exchange of pleasantries even if you werent feeling particularly pleasant and the premeal consumption of alcohol and tiny bits of food in a room other than the one fashioned for serious dining this by her estimation added about an hour to the event and didnt begin to include the aftermeal section of the interlude she thought shed become reasonably adept at handling the ceremony not as smoothly as roarke but then who could still it didnt take that much brain power to act as host to a bunch of people in your own house even if her mind did tend to wander now and again toward activities shed rather have been involved in if she could get a solid line on the luggage and on the silver wire she could begin to put together a geographic pattern on yost where he shopped how he shopped which could lead to the area of where and how he lived the man liked steak medium rare slabs of prime beef didnt come cheap did he buy his own meat or go out to restaurants top of the line whichever it was did he treat himself to the best when he was working or was it a daily habit what else did he spend his money on he had plenty of it how did he access his funds if she could you seem to be somewhere else entirely what eve focused on magda struggled to clear her head sorry no dont apologize they were sitting on the silky cushions of one of the antique sofas in the formal parlor diamonds bright and round as planets flashed at magdas ears and at the hollow of her throat she sipped at a frothy and pale pink drink in a small flute whats on your mind is im sure a great deal more important than the foolishness on ours you were thinking about that poor girl who was murdered do you know my suites directly below where she was killed no eve let that play around in her mind a bit i didnt know horrible she was hardly more than a child wasnt she i believe i saw her just the night before it happened in the hall as i was leaving my room she said good evening to me and called me by name i gave her no more than an absent smile because i was in a hurry little regrets magda murmured that make no difference at all was she alone did you see anyone with her do you remember the time even as magda blinked eve was shaking her head sorry sorry occupational hazard its perfectly all right i didnt notice anyone but i do know it was sevenfortyfive because i was to meet people in the bar at seventhirty and i was annoyed with myself for being late so divalike id been on the link with my agent about a new project im considering put it away eve ordered herself a new movie its sweet of you to ask when you couldnt be the least bit interested yes a good solid part but i cant give the decision the attention it deserves until after the auction now should i tell you about your guests tonight or has roarke already briefed you there wasnt a lot of time for that eve said and thought about the fast impulsive sex on her desk nearly grinned good it gives me a chance for quick gossip my son she glanced over with affection at the goldenhaired man standing by the fireplace his face handsome and serious my one and only hes becoming quite the sober and steady businessman she said with pride shining i dont know what id do without him hes not yet settled down to give me the grandchildren ive begun to crave but i have hope not she said with some spirit that i see liza trent in the role of my daughterinlaw shes gorgeous of course magda leaned back and studied the curvy blonde who stood with her hand on vinces arm and appeared to hang on his every word ambitious and a reasonably good actor not vinces type for the long haul not very bright all in all but so good for the ego see how she looks at him as though the words fall from his mouth like gold coins you dont like her i dont dislike her its the mother in me i suppose becoming impatient for vince to move on it didnt look like it would happen anytime soon eve mused vince lane might have been his mothers apple but to her he looked a bit weak around the chin fashionwise he went for the trendy and expensive and looked in her opinion elaborate and overdressed next to roarkes understated elegance but then what did she know about fashion then theres carlton mince magda went on looks a bit like a mole doesnt he bless him hes managed my finances for more years than i care to count hes helped me tremendously with the ins and outs of the foundation steady as a rock thats carlton and im afraid just as interesting to most people his wife the woman in the remarkably ugly and unsuitable gown is minnie minnie mince can you imagine shes walking proof that you can indeed be too thin and too addicted to body sculpting eve felt herself smirk before she could stop it the fact was the woman looked like an overdressed overpolished stick with a tower of gaudy red hair twenty years ago she was his bookkeeper magda continued with bad hair and an eye on the goal the last twelve shes been his wife she got the goal carlton and still has bad hair eve laughed thats probably mean oh probably but wheres the fun in talking about people if you only say nice things you look at minnie and are assured money cant buy taste but at the same time she suits carlton to the ground she makes him happy and since im enormously fond of him i like her for that alone last we have roarkes charming friend from ireland what can you tell me about him not a lot they were boys together in dublin and havent seen each other for a number of years and you watch him with a calculating eye do i eve moved her shoulders it paid to remember that actors were the observant sort at least the good ones were i probably watch everyone that way another occupational hazard you dont look at this one with a cops eye magda commented as roarke crossed the room toward them ladies in a gesture both absent and intimate he trailed his fingers over eves shoulder on cue summerset came to the door to announce dinner during the meal eve confirmed that magda was for the most part a keen observer of human nature liza trent either giggled or knit her brows in rapt concentration whenever vince spoke the fact that she could put on a good show of fascination with his tedious remarks earned her points in eves mind as an actor carlton mince was as quiet as the mole magda had compared him to speaking in polite and modulated tones when called on to do so and otherwise steadily burrowing his way through each course as for his wife eve caught her surreptitiously examining the silverware for the makers mark conversation wound its way around to the auction and there at least vince appeared to know his business magda lanes collection of theater memorabilia particularly costume is unrivaled he cut delicately into his pressed duck in fact i tried to persuade her to limit the auction to that alone one fell swoop magda said with a laugh i never could do anything in pieces truer words her son sent her a warm if exasperated look still saving the ball gown from prides fall until last will end the event on a high note ah i remember it well mick let out a wistful loverlike sigh the spoiled and headstrong pamela sweeps into the ballroom at carlyle hall in her simmering gown of the ice goddess daring any man to resist her the dreams i had that night after seeing you in that dress miss lane why theyd bring a blush to your cheek obviously delighted she leaned toward him i dont blush easily mr connelly he chuckled i do does it hurt your heart a little to part with your memories ill never part with them just the visual aides and what the foundation will do with the proceeds will keep me very warm at night it costs the earth to keep all those costumes protected and stored minnie put in and earned the faintest of sneers from magda as a former bookkeeper im sure youll agree at the end of the day the investments been well worth it unquestionably though he kept his attention focused on his duck carlton nodded his head the tax benefits alone from oh not taxes carlton magda held up her hands in surrender not at such a lovely meal even the thought gives me indigestion roarke this wine is sinful one of yours mmmm the montcart elegant he said lifting his glass to the light polished with just a hint of bite i thought it suited you she all but purred eve ill have to confess to being desperately in love with your husband i hope you dont arrest me for it if that was a crime in this state id have threequarters of the female population of new york in cages darling roarke looked down the table met her eyes you flatter me that wasnt flattery liza giggled as if she didnt know what else to do its so hard not to be jealous when youve got a handsome powerful man she gave vinces arm a quick squeeze i just want to scratch their eyes out when they come on to my vinnie yeah eve sipped the elegant enjoyed the little bite me i just punch them in the face while liza tried to decide whether to look shocked or impressed mick smothered a laugh behind his napkin from what ive seen and heard roarkes stopped collecting women he found the jewel of the lot one with numerous facets and who shines in the setting he had waiting now when we were lads he could barely walk for all the girls throwing themselves at his feet you must have stories magda danced her fingertips on the back of micks hand fascinating ones roarkes always so mysterious about his past accomplishments it only whets the curiosity ive stories in bushels and more the pretty redhead with the rich father visiting dublin from paris france or the little brunette with the lovely shape on her who baked scones twice weekly to curry his favor i think her name was bridgett do i have the right of that roarke you do and she married tim farrell the bakers son which seemed to suit everyone he recalled just as clearly that theyd plucked the parisian redheads whatever her name might have been deep purse to the bottom while hed seduced her no one had been dissatisfied with the end results those were the days mick sighed but being a friend and a gentleman ill tell no tales on my old mate no more collecting women for the likes of roarke but a collector he always was rumors are youve an impressive one of weapons ive picked up a few here and there over the years guns vince brightened up and his mother rolled her eyes vince has been fascinated by guns all his life drove the property masters wild whenever i was in a period piece and he came on set i have a number of guns in my collection perhaps youd like to see it id love it o o it was a room that echoed with violence and the tools men devised to wield against men pikes and lances muskets the colts theyd called peacemakers and the autoblasters that had made life among the cheapest commodities during the urban wars the tasteful setting with its soaring ceiling and sparkling glass didnt disguise the grim purpose of each display nor did it dim the elemental and human fascination for the art of selfdestruction lord vince circled the room i havent seen anything like this outside of the smithsonian it must have taken you years to put your collection together a number of them he noticed vinces avaricious glance at a pair of nineteenthcentury dueling pistols obligingly roarke used the palm plate and his code to release the lock on the reinforced glass case he drew a pistol from its slot passed it to magdas son beautiful oooh liza gave a little shudder but eve caught the bright lust in her eyes isnt it dangerous not in its present state roarke spared her a smile and showed her another case the little one there the one with the jeweled grip designed for a ladys hand and her purse it once belonged to a wealthy widow who in the unsettled days of the early part of the century carried it with her whenever she took her morning walk with her pomeranian shes reputed to have shot an unlucky mugger two looters a discourteous doorman and a lhasa apso with carnal intentions regarding her pom goodness gilt lashes fluttered over lizas violet eyes she shot a dog so they say a far different time mick studied a semiautomatic in gleaming chrome amazing isnt it he said to eve that anyone with the price in his pocket and the desire in his heart could pick up one of these over the counter or under it before the gun ban i always thought more stupid than amazing you arent a defender of the right to bear arms lieutenant vince asked turning the dueling pistol in his hand he imagined himself looking very dashing she glanced back at the mean little automatic thats not designed to defend its designed to kill still with some reluctance he replaced the pistol in its slot and wandered over to where she stood with mick people continue to find a way if they didnt youd be out of a job vincent thats rude no its not eve nodded youre right people find a way but its been some years since weve had disturbed children slaughtering other children in school hallways or halfasleep spouses shooting their partners when they stumble in the dark or neighborhoods under siege from gangs who carelessly shoot bystanders while they try to shoot each other i think the old slogan was guns dont kill people people kill people and its true enough but a gun gives them a hell of a lot of help i cant argue with that mick put in never did like the ugly noisy things myself now a good sticker he strolled away a bit to a display of knives at least a mans got to get close enough to look you in the eye before he tries you with one of these takes more courage to stand toetotoe and stick a man than it does to blast away at him from a distance but me ill stick with my fists he turned away grinned a good sweaty brawl solves most disputes and mostly everyone can limp away from it and have a pint we broke some noses in our day didnt we roarke probably more than our share he relocked the case coffee he said smoothly chapter six eve strapped on her weapon and eyed her husband he was enjoying a light breakfast in the sitting area of their bedroom the morning news was playing on the wall screen and the stock reports skimmed by in a puzzling series of codes and figures on the tabletop unit the cat galahad lounged beside him with one of his dualcolored eyes aimed hopefully at a slice of irish bacon neglected on roarkes plate how can you look like youve just come home from a weeks vacation in some pamper spa she demanded clean living my ass i know you were up till after three drinking whiskey and telling lies with your pal i heard his looney laugh as the pair of you stumbled upstairs he might have been a bit unsteady at the end of it he turned to her his eyes blue and clear and rested a few fingers of whiskeys never been known to set me under im sorry we woke you it couldnt have been for long i never heard you come to bed i needed to pour mick into his first what are you going to do with him today he has business of his own and will make his way about well enough summerset can tell him where ill be if he wants to know i thought youd probably work from here today no he watched her over his coffee cup not today stop worrying about me lieutenant you have enough on your plate youre the main course he laughed at that and rose to kiss her im very touched dont be touched she gripped his arms once firmly to make her point be careful ill be both will you at least use a driver and the limo the limo she knew was reinforced and could withstand a hailstorm of boomers yes to set your mind at ease thanks ive got to get going lieutenant what he cupped her face in his hands gently touched his lips to her forehead her cheeks her mouth i love you everything inside her shifted shimmered settled i know even though im not a french redhead with a rich daddy how much did you take her for in what area she laughed shook her head never mind but at the door she stopped looked back at him i love you too oh and galahad just copped your bacon she strode down the hall but caught the mild exasperation in roarkes voice havent we discussed that sort of behavior it made her smirk a little as she took the steps in a jog at the bottom lurking as she thought of it was summerset he held her leather jacket between one long thumb and one bony finger i will assume youll be home for the evening meal unless i hear to the contrary assume all you want she took the jacket but glanced back up the stairs as she shrugged into it i need you a minute i beg your pardon stuff the attitude back up your pointy nose she suggested but she kept her voice lowered she aimed a finger at the front door then swung it open come on i have several tasks on this mornings schedule he began quiet she shut the door behind him drew in a breath of sweet spring air youve been with him for a long time and you know all there is to know first give me your take on mick connelly im not in the habit of gossiping about houseguests goddamn it she rapped a fist on his chest an impatient gesture that caused summerset to show his teeth do i look like i want a cozy gossip here somebody wants to shake roarke i dont know why i dont know the bottom line but someones looking to cause him trouble give me your take on connelly summersets eyes which had gone black as onyx at the fist to his chest narrowed considered her he was wild as they all were they were wild times my understanding was he had a difficult home life but then all of them did some worse than others he came around when roarke settled in with me polite enough if rough around the edges hungry but they were all hungry did he ever square off with roarke there were words and fists at one time or another between all of them mick would have cut off his fingers for roarke any of them would mick looked up to him roarke took a beating for him once from the cops summerset added with a sneer when mick fumbled a pass off after a pocket dip okay all right she relaxed a little this is about the chambermaid yeah i want you to use that yardlong nose of yours for something other than looking down at inferiors sniff around past and present if you catch a whiff of anything anything thats off contact me you can monitor roarke without putting his back up he expects you to know where he is make sure you do summerset put a hand on her arm to stop her from turning away is he in any sort of physical jeopardy if i thought he was he wouldnt get out of the house even if i had to drug him and put him in restraints forced to be satisfied with that summerset watched her go down the steps to where her increasingly dilapidated cityissue vehicle was parked o o eve imagined the steam gushing out of her ears as she marched through the detectives bull pen and on to her office her link light was blinking busily from messages and her computer was beeping from fresh incoming data she ignored both and began riffling through her drawers sir mcnab i want a riot laser eve snapped at peabody full body armor she yanked a sixinch combat knife from its leather sheath and watched with glee as its wicked serrated edge caught the sunlight through her little window peabodys eyes popped sir im going down to maintenance and im going locked and loaded im taking those pissbrain sons of bitches out one by one then im going to haul whats left of the bodies into my vehicle and set it on fire jesus dallas i thought we had a red flag ive got a red flag ive got one her eyes wheeled to peabody ive got under fifty miles on my ride since those lying cheating sniveling shitheads said it was road ready road ready do you want me to tell you about road ready i would like that very much lieutenant if youd sheathe that knife first with one last oath of disgust eve rammed the blade home it starts bucking on me while im sitting at a light just sitting and its kicking like a mule probably i run the diagnostic and you know what it does it brings up the dash map with directions to the morgue is that some sick joke peabodys lips quivered she bit down hard on the inside of her cheek i couldnt say sir then it coughs and stalls and i get it going again two blocks and its lurching you know lurching like frankensteins monster out of steam now eve dropped into her chair im a lieutenant a ranked officer why cant i get a decent vehicle its a sad state of affairs sir if i might suggest rather than going down with a riot laser you could try a case of beer get on the good side of a couple of the crew down there make nice make nice id rather swallow a live snake you call down tell them i need my vehicle up and running within the hour me peabodys eyes pricked with what might have been tears oh man before i go off to debase myself i should tell you that we tightened the line on the wire and the luggage why the hell didnt you say so instantly eve swung to her computer i dont know what got into me lieutenant standing here like a chatterbox when that didnt get a rise peabody huffed out a sigh and went back to her cubicle to bargain with maintenance okay okay what have we got eve ordered the data onscreen there were numerous sources for and purchases of the silver wire that matched the murder weapon but when you filtered it down to twofoot lengths and twofoot multiples that number narrowed to eighteen globally and six nationwide with one single purchase of four lengths of two cash payment from a wholesaler right in manhattan right here what do we bet you bought it right here twenty blocks from the murder scene as she read the data on the luggage a grim smile tightened her lips there were thousands of purchases of the black leather carryon since january but focusing on the last four weeks she found less than a hundred and of the dozen or so purchased in new york city there were only two selected on the same day the wire had been bought and only one paid for with cash there are no coincidences she murmured you got your supplies right here now why would a man buy a transpo carryon if hed already done the trip there was no trip you were already here wigs she thought and switched to peabodys search and scan jesus why dont people just grow their own hair literally millions of wigs hairpieces extensions fillers and fluffers had walked out of salons and stores and suppliers over the last six months she more than tripled that amount if she included rentals patient as a cat at a mouse hole now she pulled up the image of yost outside the door of the suite highlighted head and shoulders erased the face ordered a computer image of three hundred and sixty degrees then dumped the result into the data bank computer list cashonly purchases of human hair wig matching current image working fivehundredtwentysix purchases cash or imaged product in requested period listing while her computer spewed out the supplier locations and dates of purchase eve followed onscreen paradise salon retail fifth avenue new york may three hold and we have a winner busy boy that day werent you shopping all over town computer list any other purchases on this receipt working in addition to human hair wig model distinguished gentleman receipt includes purchase of human hair wig model captain stud two twelveounce bottles of wig grooming product brand name sampson one sixounce bottle of collagen elixir for face brand name youth one each of temporary eye tint brand name wink in viking blue sea mist and carmel cream one dietary product brand name fatzap for men and two threebysixinch scented candles sandlewood purchases total eight thousand four hundred and twnetysix dollars and fiftyeight cents including all applicable taxes a lot of cash eve mused but why leave a paper trail even a false one if you dont have to computer add image of captain stud brand wig to file copy addresses of luggage store salon and jewelry supplier my ppc while her computer completed the tasks eve turned to her link thirtytwo calls she noted since shed logged out the day before odds were the bulk of them were from reporters hoping for a statement or sound bite it was tempting just to dump them but until peabody reported her vehicle was a go she could spare a little time she started through them automatically transferring the usual media pleas to nypsd media relations until she was told differently directly from her commander she wasnt talking to the press she paused on the transmission from nadine furst the star of channel and a personal friend not yet pal she murmured but answered the message with a time delay that way shed be in the field before nadine received it no point in nagging me eve said i dont have anything you can use at this point the investigation is ongoing all leads are being pursued with diligence and blah blah you know the routine when and if i have something for you ill be in touch you tie up my link im not going to feel very friendly satisfied with that eve programmed the message to transmit in sixty minutes she took twenty of them to write an updated report then transmitted it to her commander shed no more than pushed away from her desk and reached for her jacket when the summons from commander whitney came through as a matter of course she snagged peabody on the way up maintenance well you know they have the whole howbackedupandputupontheyare routine down pretty pat eve stepped onto the people glide scowled did you mention riot weapons i thought it best to hold that possibility in reserve sir just as she thought it best not to mention the snide comments made about a certain lieutenants track record with city vehicles and equipment but i made the priority of your current investigation clear and indicated that commander whitney frowned on having his ranked officers going out into the field in a piece of junk that was good thinking as long as nobody down there calls him for verification you know dallas you could request that the commander put the arm on them im not whining to my superior or pulling rank you dont mind having me do it peabody muttered thats right slightly more cheerful eve switched from glide to elevator youll get your update on where we are in the case when i give the oral to whitney i think our man has a homey little hole right here in new york here yeah geared up eve stepped off the elevator on whitneys level since she was waved directly through eve knocked briefly on whitneys door then stepped in he was seated behind his desk and didnt rise he was a big man with dark wide face and beefy shoulders hair rapidly going gray and eyes that remained streetsharp there were two other people in the room male and female neither of them rose either but both studied her closely as she did them the dull and boxy black suits with ties ruthlessly knotted at the neck the good shoes with their military shine and the cold survey tipped her off feds shit lieutenant officer whitney inclined his head and kept his big hands folded on his desk special agents james jacoby and karen stowe fbi lieutenant dallas is primary on the darlene french homicide investigation officer peabody is her aide the fbi has some interest in your case lieutenant eve said nothing and stayed on her feet the bureau in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies has been pursuing the individual sylvester yost for several years in connection with various crimes including murder eve met jacobys eyes im aware of that from my research the bureau expects the cooperation of the nypsd in this pursuit agent stowe and myself will run the case from the new york field office agent stowe and yourself are certainly free to run your case wherever it suits you best you will not run my case from anywhere jacoby had brown eyes dark and smug yosts activities come under the federal net yost is not the exclusive property of the fbi agent jacoby nor of global or interpol or the nypsd but the investigation into the murder of darlene french is mine and its going to stay mine you want to stay connected to this lieutenant youd better dump the attitude if you want to stay in this office whitney cut in youd be wise to dump yours agent jacoby the nypsd is prepared to cooperate with the fbi as regards suspect yost it is not prepared to remove or replace lieutenant dallas as primary of the darlene french homicide your jurisdiction has limits youd be smart to remember what they are jacoby angled himself toward whitney his posture aggressive his eyes going hot your primarys connection to the individual roarke who may or may not be tied to this homicide and has long been under the federal eye as a suspect in various illegal activities makes her a poor choice to head this investigation if youre going to make accusations jacoby put something behind them it took all eves control to keep her voice level would you like to produce the individual roarkes criminal record at this time you know damn well he doesnt have one he got to his feet now you want to sleep with a man whos run every dirty game in the book and still wear a badge thats on you but jacoby stowe rose as well neatly positioning herself between her partner and eve for gods sake lets keep personalities out of this an excellent suggestion whitney pushed back from his desk stood agent jacoby i will ignore that inappropriate attack on my officer once if its repeated in any way in any shape in any form i will report your conduct to your superiors your request for cooperation and for inclusion in any data generated on the darlene french matter by my lieutenant and her investigation team will be considered after said request is submitted formally in writing from your command this meeting is over the bureau has the weight to take over this case thats debatable whitney returned but youre free to submit the appropriate paperwork to that end until that time let me suggest that you refrain from coming onto my turf and insulting this office and my officers i apologize commander whitney stowe shot jacoby a look that warned him to keep silent and we appreciate your time and your consideration she gave her partner a notsosubtle nudge to get him moving out of the room take a minute whitney advised when the door closed behind them before you say something you may regret i assure you commander i couldnt regret anything i might say at the moment but she took a breath i appreciate your support jacoby was out of line he was heading over the line when he strutted in here thinking he could rattle his federal balls at me he asks for cooperation properly hell get it he will not take over your case it may come down to you working in tandem with jacoby and stowe is that a problem it wont be my problem sir a smile flickered around his mouth before he nodded sat again fill me in she did so as thoroughly and concisely as her written report and as she did so she watched whitneys lips purse his eyebrows raise those were the only reactions in all these years the feebs havent put yost in new york they may have sir but not as indicated by any data ive been able to access they have followed the wire but not as far as it shows the specific length to specific outlets i fail to understand how something that basic could have been neglected the luggage the hairpiece those apply directly to french but its likely hes repeated that pattern or a slight variation at other times the fbi profile on the suspect is intricate and thorough which is why i have yet to request one from doctor mira i intend to do so as corroboration and with the additional data ive accumulated cover that and make certain you have documentation and paperwork on every step jacoby may be the type to try to hang you up on technicalities mediawise i want you low profile the tone of the case shades toward roarke which shades toward you i dont want you to give any statements until youre cleared to do so yes sir dont look so smug about it youll be tossed to the media hounds before its finished no leads i take it on who might be pulling the strings here or why no sir then keep your focus on yost smoke him out dismissed yes sir she turned to the door one step behind peabody dallas yes commander i believe you can tell roarke to expect a little federal pressure understood she strode to the elevator resisted kicking the wall shes nothing but a tool to him darlene french to jacoby she muttered no more human to him than she was to yost the son of a bitch shes got you dallas thats right and shes going to keep me eve started to step into the elevator then spotted stowe inside stay out of my face stowe raised a hand in a gesture of truce jacobys gone back to the field office i just want a minute ill ride down with you your partners an asshole only about half the time stowe tried a smile she was a trim woman in her middle thirties who did her best to spruce up the federal dress code with a pretty swing of honey brown hair her eyes were shades darker and direct listen i want to apologize for jacobys remarks and his attitude she let out a sigh and my apology doesnt mean squat however sincere maybe it means squat even if it doesnt mean diddly fair enough look when you cut out the red tape were all cops and all after the same thing are we yost you want him we want him does it matter to you who turns the key in his cage i dont know you guys have had a lot of years to turn that key about as many years as darlene french got to live true enough personally however ive had three months and of the three probably one in pure man hours to assimilate data on sylvester yost if it gets us closer to stopping him ill hand you the key when the doors opened on the garage level stowe glanced out shed have to ride back up to the main lobby level im just asking you not to let jacobys temperament get in the way of the goal i think we can help each other eve stepped out but turned and laid her hand on the door to keep it open keep your partner on a leash and ill consider it she let the doors close and walked to her parking slot her peagreen unit sat dented scarred and with a bright yellow smiley face some joker in maintenance had painted beaming out from the rear window it was probably a very good thing eve didnt have that riot laser chapter seven eve hit the salon first and was pleasantly surprised when her vehicle made the trip without embarrassing her shed walked through the doors of paradise before tracking another murderer another sexual homicide another case that had involved roarke the first one she thought that had connected us it had been more than a year but the opulent decor of the salon hadnt changed soft soothing music played harmonizing with the splashing waterfalls and drifting through the air delicately scented by the long sweeps and tall spires of fresh flowers patrons sat or lounged amid the splendor of the waiting area sipping tiny cups of genuine coffee or springhued glasses of fruit juice or fizzy water the receptionist was the same bountifully breasted woman in snug short red who had greeted eve before the hair was different eve noted this time around it was easter egg pink and styled in a streaming fountain of curls that burst out of a high cone on the crown of her head recognition didnt register in her eyes but dismay and annoyance did the moment she spotted eves worn jacket scarred boots and shaggily styled hair im sorry we serve by previous appointment only in paradise im afraid all our consultants are fully booked for the next eight months may i suggest an alternate salon eve leaned on the high counter crossed her boots at the ankles you dont remember me denise gee im really hurt wait a minute i bet youll remember this smiling cheerfully eve pulled out her badge and pushed it under the receptionists expensively sculpted nose oh oh not again even as the words tripped out of her mouth denise remembered just who the cop had married since last theyd met i mean i do beg your pardon miss i thats lieutenant miss of course denise tried out a lilting laugh im afraid i was distracted were so busy today but never too busy to make room for you what can we do for you wheres your retail section id be delighted to show you is there a particular product you have in mind or are you just browsing our consultants will just show me what youve got denise and get me the manager of the area right away if youd just come with me can i get you and your associate any refreshment peabody spoke fast knowing eve would cut off any hope given half a chance id like one of those pink fizzy drinks nonalcoholic she added when eve gave her a baleful stare ill have it brought right in to you retail was up a level a short ride on a silver glide and beyond a small oasis complete with pool and palms wide glass doors parted with a fluid little tinkle at their approach on the other side the retail area spread in an artful fan with each spoke dedicated to a different form of beautification staff here wore

samples keep your hands in your pockets and your mind on the job but if its free theyll just talk you into spending six months pay on gunk to go with the giveaways the place smells like a jungle was all eve could think hot oversweet and eerily sexual its got to be the oldest con in the books i wont buy anything she spotted one of the enhancement displays with all those fascinating colors girl toys she thought and yearned but all the color and flash was nothing compared to martin denise hurried out in front of him clicking her threeinch red heels over the white floor like a handmaiden before royalty she didnt bow but eve was certain she thought about it before scurrying away and out the glass doors again martin swept up his long trailing cloak of sapphire brushing the floor the skinsuit of silver beneath it sparkling over a long muscled body his pecs rippled his biceps strained his privates bulged his hair as silver as his suit was swept up from a sharply planed face in a complex arrangement of twists that were caught in sapphire cord and left to dangle down his back he smiled held out a hand crowded with rings lieutenant dallas his voice was seductively french and before she could stop him hed taken her hand and kissed the air an inch above her knuckles were honored to welcome you to paradise how may we be of service to you im looking for a man cherie arent we all ha this particular man she said amused despite herself she drew a hardcopy image of yost out of her file bag well martin studied the photo handsome in a brute fashion the distinguished gentleman does not in my opinion suit his facial features nor his style he should have been gently dissuaded from that purchase you recognize the wig hair alternative and his eyes twinkled as he said it yes its not one of the more popular styles as the gray is something most looking for alternatives wish to avoid may i ask why youre seeking this man here in paradise he bought the hair alternative here along with a number of other products may third cash id like to talk to whoever waited on him hmmm do you have a list of the products he purchased eve pulled it out handed it over quite a lot for a cash purchase as for the captain stud much more appropriate for him dont you agree just one moment he strolled off showed the list and photograph to a brunette at the near skincare section she frowned studied the papers then with a nod hurried away we think we may know the consultant who tended to this customer would you prefer to use a privacy area no this is fine you didnt recognize him no but i dont interact with customers unless theres a problem of some sort or unless the customers are such as yourself vips ah heres letta now letta ma coeur i hope youll give lieutenant dallas your assistance im sure and there was just enough midwestern twang in the voice to make martin wince you waited on the man in this photograph eve asked tapping a finger on the picture letta held yes im almost sure its him hes had a little sculpting around the eyes and mouth in the picture but its the same basic facial structure and this product list fits was this the first time youd seen him well i think hes been in before but he wears different wigs hair alternatives she corrected sliding an apologetic glance toward martin and he varies his skin tones eyes he likes a lot of different looks a number of customers clients she amended shaking her head at herself do its one of the services we provide at paradise varying your looks can vary your mood and improve save the sales pitch letta tell me about the day he bought those items okay i mean yes madam i think it was early afternoon because we still had some of the lunch crush id spent a lot of time with a woman who had to look at everything we had in blonde i mean everything and then she ended up doing the ill think about it routine she rolled her purple eyes caught martins then after a jolt relaxed when she saw his smile of sympathy so when this client approached asking to see the distinguished gentleman true black and gray it was a relief he knew just what he wanted even if it wasnt what i thought of as right for him why wasnt it right for him he was a big beefy guy gentleman with a squareshaped head just a look about him that made me think he worked with his hands like a trade the dg was just too fussy elegant for him but he was set on it he put it on himself seemed to know just how to fit it what kind of hair did he have his hair not the alternative oh hes bald as a babys hes a natural scalp totally very healthy scalp too good tone and polish to it i dont know why hed cover it he saw the captain stud on display and asked for that too it was a better look sort of made him look like a general i thought and when i said so he looked very pleased smiled he has a really nice smile he was very polite and courteous too he called me miss letta and said please and thank you you dont get that sort of thing all the time in retail service she paused a moment frowned up at the ceiling then he told me he wanted to buy some youth he laughed a little because you know how that sounds buy some youth and i laughed a little and we went over to skin care were trained to assist clients in all areas of our product line to streamline their paradise experience and all i took him from department to department that way with him telling me exactly what he wanted and with him very courteously again turning off my suggestions for addons we finished with the dietary product and i said that he certainly didnt need it and he said that he was afraid he enjoyed his food a little too much when he was done he indicated that he would take the purchases rather than take advantage of our free messenger service so i totaled and made him a carryout parcel then he handed over that huge wad of cash and my eyes about fell out on my shoes its not usual for a client to pay cash oh we do a lot of cash transactions but ive never personally done one over two thousand dollars and this was more than four times that i guess he saw i was goggling because he smiled at me again and said that he preferred to pay as he went you spent a lot of time with him then more than an hour tell me about his speech pattern did he have an accent sort of not really anything i could place he had a kind of high voice almost like a womans but very nice soft and well cultured i guess come to think of it his voice fit the dg more than it fit him if you know what i mean did he mention his name anything about where he lived where he worked no early on i tried to coax his name out by saying something like id be happy to show you other styles mr but he just smiled and shook his head so i called him sir the whole time i suppose i thought he lived in new york because he took away rather than having sent or shipped but i suppose he could have been from anywhere you said you thought youd seen him in here before im pretty sure not long after i started working here in the early part of the christmas rush late october maybe early november at the skin counter again he was wearing a coat and hat but i really think it was the same man did you wait on him no it was nina but i remember sure i remember now because we bumped into each other behind the counter getting products for our clients and she said how this guy was buying the whole artistry skincare line thats who makes youth thats a couple thousand and a really good commission so i took a peek thinking how i wished id snagged him instead of nina but you hadnt noticed him before or since no maam eve took her through a few more questions then asked to see nina ninas memory wasnt as keen as lettas but when eve moved from her to other clerks she picked up just enough to be certain yost dropped into paradise once or twice a year hell have other places other cities she told peabody when they were back in the car but on this same level he wont settle for less always cash and hell know what he wants when he walks in he pays attention to advertising researches his products watches a lot of screen likely but id bet this guy runs the product data on his computer he wants a handle on the ingredients the manufacturers record the consumer endorsements lets see what edd can do about tracing that skin line backwards from last october when he made that purchase he bought the whole ball of wax so that could mean hed seen the ad done the research then decided to try it out artistrys bound to have a site for consumer information and questions she tried the luggage store next none of the clerks recalled a man meeting yosts description buying the carryon but downtown she hit gold so to speak with the silver wire o o the clerk had an excellent visual memory eve clued into this the moment she stepped up to the small display counter with its riot of loose stones silver coils and empty settings under the glass the clerks eyes wheeled his lips began to tremble she heard his breath heave and initially feared a cardiac incident mrs roarke mrs roarke his voice was heavily accented with what she thought might have been east indian but she was too busy wincing to worry about his origin dallas she slapped her badge on the countertop lieutenant dallas we are honored we are unworthy he began to shout something unintelligible to one of his associates please please you will select anything you want in our humble establishment as a gift you like necklace bracelet you like maybe earrings information only information we take a picture yes we see you many times onscreen and hope for the day you might come into our unworthy shop he piped something else to the young man who scrambled over with a miniature holocamera hold it hold it just hold it your famous husband is not with you today you are shopping yes with your companion we will give also a gift to your companion yeah delighted peabody edged closer shut up peabody no i am not shopping this is police business police business we did not call for the police he turned to the younger man busily taking holoshots let out a series of quick high sounds the response was rapid and accompanied by a fierce head shake no we did not call for the police we have no trouble here you would like this necklace he pulled one out of a long shallow drawer under the counter our gift to you we design we make you will honor us to wear it under other circumstances eve would have been tempted to just punch him to shut him up but his dark eyes were shining with hope and his smile was as sweet as a cocker spaniels thats very nice of you but im not allowed to accept im here on police business if i accept your gift it would cause trouble trouble for you no no we want to give you no trouble just a gift thanks very much some other time you could help me by looking at this picture do you recognize this man confusion and disappointment drenched his eyes he continued to hold the necklace up as he looked at the photograph yes this is mr john smith john smith yes mr smith he is a hobby has a hobby he corrected to make the wearable art but he buys no stones that we suggest only the silver wire two feet in length very specific how often does he buy his wire oh he comes in two of the times first it was cold outside before the christmastime then in the last week he comes again but he does not have this hair on his head i welcome him back to our store and ask if he would like now to look at stones or glass but again he wants only the silver and he pays in cash yes both of the times in cash money how do you know his name i ask him name please to give me your name sir and will you tell me how you have heard of our humble establishment what was his answer he is john smith and he has seen our business page on the internet is this helpful to you mrs lieutenant dallas roarke just lieutenant and yes its helpful what else can you tell me about him did he talk about his hobby he did not care to talk he did not he closed his eyes searching for a word linger he said beaming i say to my young brother that i do not see how mr smith can have success with his hobby as he does not have interest in stones or glass or other metals he does not look at the many designs we have on display he does not wish to speak about his work he is instead very strict business ways business like that is correct yeah he is polite once the link in his pocket rings but he does not answer while he is doing business i ask if the wire he purchased in the winter worked well for him if he was satisfied he tells me only that it did the job then he smiles and i hope he is not your friend because i do not like his smile at that time i sell him the wire and am glad he leaves i have offended you no you interest me peabody do we have a card yes sir peabody rooted one of eves cards out of her own pocket id appreciate you contacting me if he comes in again i dont want you to alert or alarm him in any way or tell him anyones asked about him if he comes in you or your brother should go into the back away from him and contact me the clerk nodded he is a bad man a very bad man this is my thinking when he smiles i tell my cousin of it and he agrees eve shot a look at the young man still wielding the camera i thought he was your brother my cousin in london where we have another humble shop he is agreeing with me when we discover that mr john smith has purchased silver from him also in london eve laid a hand on his wrist how does your cousin know its the same man silver wire three lengths of two feet but mr smith has hair on his head there the color of sand and hair also on his lip but we think it is the same man eve pulled out her memo book give me the name and address of the shop in london your cousins name she noted it down do you have any other humble shops we have ten humble shops im going to ask you to do me a favor his eyes lit up like jewels this would be my very great honor ill want the locations of all of your shops id appreciate it if you would contact your relatives in each and ask if there have been other purchases of silver wire in twofoot lengths im going to send each shop a picture of this man i want to be contacted if he should go into any of the shops this i can arrange for you mrs lieutenant dallas roarke he turned to his brother had a brief exchange my brother will get this information for you and i will personally call my cousins tell them either i or my aide will contact them they will stand beside themselves with pleasure at this he took the disc his brother brought out handed it to eve with some ceremony will you please also take our business card for your famous husband perhaps he will consider visiting our humble establishment sure thanks for the help he walked her to the door opened it for her bowed her out watched her with eyes shining with delight cross the sidewalk to her car tag feeney eve ordered when she was behind the wheel have him run like crimes in and around london it would be my honor mrs lieutenant dallas roarke at eves burning look peabody only grinned sorry i just had to do it once im over it if weve finished laughing uproariously tell feeney if no like crimes pop to take a hard look at missing persons i dont think all the bodies have turned up he does the job she said half to herself as peabody called into edd if his client wants someone to disappear permanently he disappears them but the murder itself would still follow pattern hes a creature of habit we follow the pattern feeneys on it peabody announced whats the next step yours is to contact the cousins im going to track down mira i want an nypsd profile on this guy the feebs arent the only ones who can generate paperwork o o youve already done most of my work dr mira lowered her computer screen and turned to where eve stood hands in back pockets eyes on the view beyond the window you seem to know this man very well on very short acquaintance and the fbi profilers are very thorough you can give me more im flattered you think so mira rose programmed her autochef for tea then wandered away from it she wore a simple suit of dusky blue and her rich brown hair waved back to flatter her soft and pretty face her fingers twisted the long gold chain around her neck hes a sociopath and is probably intelligent and selfaware enough to know it it may be a point of pride pride is one of the engines that drives him he considers himself a businessman the top in his chosen field and choose it he did he enjoys fine things he may not be aware that the rape adds to his satisfaction its just another way of erasing his victim male or female matters not at all it isnt sex of course its debasement mira glanced at her wrist unit her link then into space more efficient would be the simple garroting but he most often beats and rapes these are part of the whole to him like a man testing the color and bouquet of a good wine before drinking he enjoys his work oh yes mira confirmed very much but it is in his mind very much work its unlikely he ever kills indiscriminately or for personal motives hes a professional and expects to be paid and paid well the silver wire is his calling card an advertisement if you will to potential customers he hides nothing the wire his face makes no attempt to conceal dna yet he does wear moderate disguises my belief would be he wears those disguises to amuse himself to add a bit of adventure partly vanity she wandered the office her movements restless and out of character he would enjoy fussing with himself viewing the results before heading out to work the way another man might select a new shirt for a day at the office you the law dont worry him in the least hes evaded the legal system for years i would say at most you amuse him he wont be laughing for long eve glanced back over her shoulder saw mira look down at her wrist unit yet again frown shed forgotten the tea too and that was a first as far as eve knew everything okay hmm oh yes everythings fine you seem a little distracted i suppose i am my daughterinlaws in labor im waiting for word babies tend to take their own sweet time while the rest of us wait i guess because mira gave her desk link a worried look eve went to the autochef retrieved the tea thank you thats the second time in an hour ive forgotten ive made tea ill write your profile eve itll help keep my mind occupied but i dont think itll add much to what you already know why roarke can you tell me that her own concerns mira realized had blinded her to the fact that eve was worried on a personal level now mira sat waited for eve to do the same not beyond what i imagine you already suspect hes rich powerful has enemies professional and personal rivals he has a background with a great many holes officially there may be people hiding in those holes who wish to cause him difficulties im sure youve discussed it with him yeah but its not getting me anywhere if someone had tried a frame tried to set up a murder so hed look like a suspect or have some direct involvement i could see it go after one of his business rivals somebody high profile hit someone whos given him grief or causing him trouble but a chambermaid at one of his hotels whats the damn point mira laid a hand over eves it has both of you concerned and troubled perhaps that was point enough to take a life for it yost all right to him its a job but there has to be more in it for the client yost bought four lengths thats too many for backup on darlene french dr mira hes still on the clock ill continue to study the data run an analysis i wish i could do more her desk link beeped and she was out of the chair like a woman on springs excuse me eve was surprised to see the dignified mira scramble around the desk yes oh anthony is its a boy eight pounds five ounces twentyone perfect inches oh oh miras eyes swam as she lowered herself into a chair deborah shes great shes fine theyre beautiful have a look eve shifted angling her head enough so that she could see a darkhaired man hold up a wriggling red squalling baby say hello to matthew james mira grandma hello matthew he has your nose anthony hes gorgeous ill come by to see you all as soon as i can i cant wait to hold him have you called your father hes next well be over tonight she ran a finger over the screen as if stroking the babys head tell deborah we love her and were so proud of her hey how about me and you she kissed her fingertips laid them on the screen ill see you all soon ill call dad you have a good cry i will she dug out a handkerchief even as she ended transmission sorry a new grandchild congratulations he looked like a red wrinkled fish with limbs eve thought but figured that wasnt the thing people wanted to hear at such moments healthy yes mira sighed dabbed at her eyes theres nothing like a new life coming into the world to remind us why were here the hope and the possibilities eight pounds was all eve could think it must be like passing an arena ball with limbs she got to her feet youll want to get out of here ill just her communicator signaled dallas sir peabodys face sober and stern filled the little screen we have another homicide same mo private residence in this case upper east side meet me in the garage im on my way yes sir i ran the address through the residence is owned by elite real estate a roarke industries division chapter eight it was a lovely brownstone in a neighborhood known for its high rents swank restaurants and fancy specialized markets sumptuous white flowers shimmered on long pink stems in a trio of slim stone pots on the front steps a few blocks south and those pots would have been lucky to stay put and intact overnight but here people lived comfortably privately and didnt stoop to vandalizing their neighbors homes security was ensured by the addition at residents expense of private droids who patrolled on foot in snappy navy blue uniforms this precaution tended to keep the riff and raff from outside the area from sneaking in and soiling the sidewalks jonah talbot had enjoyed that comfortable security in his twostory home where he had lived alone and there he had died but it hadnt been comfortable eve stood over him hed been a wellbuilt male in his early thirties hed been beaten as had darlene french primarily around the face there was additional bruising around the kidney area and the ribs he wore only a gray tshirt the matching athletic shorts were tossed into a corner hed been sodomized his killer had left him facedown with the silver wire crossed at the back of his neck curled up into loops at the edges looks like he was working at home did you run his data yet yes sir its coming through now eve took the gauge out of her field kit to establish time of death jonah talbot peabody read off male single age thirtythree vice president and deputy publisher starline incorporated residing this address since november parents divorced one sibling one halfsibling through mother no children hold the rest of the personal whats starline peabody keyed in the request for data they publish discs books too emags holojournals the whole shot of written and electronic material peabody read on then cleared her throat and lowered her ppc they were established in then purchased in by roarke industries closer eve murmured and felt the chill dance up her spine taking a step closer he took him in here this guys no hundredpound girl but he still didnt put up much of a fight gently she lifted one of talbots hands saw the raw and broken skin of his knuckles got a few hits in why not more hes not as big as yost but hes in good shape weve got one table turned over two guys like this square off theyd tear up the room she had reason to know as not long before shed had the experience of watching two furious and welltoned men try to pound each other into meat in her home office weve got enough on record from this angle lets turn him she sat back on her heels as peabody bent down to help with the job as they turned him eve felt the jags and swelling of broken ribs he waited awhile to kill him she said when she lifted the shirt and examined the vicious discolorations over the torso and he fights dirty the son of a bitch goggles peabody handed over the microgoggles through their powerful lenses eve studied the body just here just under the left armpit pressure syringe he pulled a tranq when he got too much resistance when talbot went down he wailed on him awhile did he wait until he was coming out of it to rape him i bet he did whats the point in rape if the victim doesnt know the violation the humiliation her father had done that she remembered if hed hit her just a little too hard and knocked her out hed waited hed always waited until she knew until she could feel until she broke enough to beg yeah wake up she whispered wake up hows a guy supposed to get off if you just lie there little bitch sir he waited she said shaking it off kept him alive long enough for the blood to gather into bruises long enough for him to struggle with whatever energy he had left then he slips the wire over the head finishes the job she pushed the goggles back ill take over the record check with feeney and mcnab see what theyve got off the security cameras yes sir you got some hits in she murmured carefully sealing the injured hand so had darlene french she remembered and the others was that cut or bruise yost took away from the job another kind of souvenir a war wound something to admire later what little trinket did he take from jonah talbot with the microgoggles back in place she examined the body for any sign of piercing she found what she was looking for on the left scrotum she shuddered remembering the quick shocking sting of her recent ear piercing jesus whats up with people for the record piercing mark in left scrotum indicates victim wore or had worn some body ornamentation in this area she took off the goggles rose and standing over the dead began to slowly scan the room when she heard the footsteps she spoke with her back to the door peabody tell the sweepers to keep an eye out for a small body ornament the kind guys hook on their balls for reasons i dont care to explore our guy likes souvenirs and the victims missing his genital bauble i cant help you with that lieutenant she turned looked at roarke instinctively she moved forward stepping between him and the body i dont want you in here you cant always have what you want they both stepped forward and she lifted a hand pressed it firmly to his chest this is my crime scene im fully aware of what it is move aside i wont go any farther the tone of his voice answered the question shed yet to ask with a little jerk around her heart she stepped to the side you knew him yes anger stirred with pity as he studied the body you have his data by now but ill tell you he was a smart ambitious man who moved up the publishing ranks quickly he liked books real books the kind you hold in your hand so you can turn the pages she said nothing but knew roarke also liked real books that would have been a link between him and the dead that enjoyment of turning the page he would have been editing today roarke told her and now guilt sneaky and slick slid in with the anger and pity he took one day a week at home for editing though he could easily have passed that job on to his admin or any number of editors as i recall he liked to sail and kept a small boat in a marina on long island he talked of buying a weekend place there he was seeing someone recently the girlfriend found him i have her in another room with a uniform none of the things ive just told you have anything to do with why hes dead hes dead because he worked for me his eyes shifted back to eves and the heat in them was brutal thats a line of inquiry i intend to pursue below the range of the recorder she put a hand on his and under her fingers she could feel the vibration of violence ruthlessly restrained i need you to wait outside i need you to let me take care of him there was a moment a bad one where she feared he would do something say something she would have to expunge from the record then his eyes cooled a change so abrupt it brought a chill he stepped back ill wait was all he said and left her it was a relief that talbots current girlfriend dana had apparently cried herself out by the time eve sat down to get her statement her eyes were red and she continually sipped water as if the bout of tears had dehydrated her but she was steady enough and she was clear we were supposed to have a late lunch date he said hed be ready for a break about two it was jonahs turn to pay her lips quivered and she bit down on the bottom one hard we took turns with who paid for lunch theres a restaurant polos just over on eightysecond we both like i dont live far from there and we both take wednesdays to work at home im a literary agent with creative outlet thats how we met at an industry function a few months ago i was late didnt get there until about twenty after she paused sipped closed her eyes briefly she had a strong face with more character than beauty long link call from a client who needed some stroking jonah always jokes about me being late for everything he calls it dana time so when i got there and he hadnt shown up i was feeling pretty smug planned to rib him about it oh god just a minute okay take your time this time she pressed the glass to her forehead rolled it slowly back and forth about twothirty i thought i should give him a call see what was going on he didnt answer so i waited another fifteen minutes he could walk from here to there in five i was halfpissed off and halfworried do you know what i mean yeah yeah i do i decided to walk over to his place kept thinking wed run into each other on the way and hed be running have all these excuses i was deciding whether id be mad or let him weasel out then when i got here did you have a key to the door what her swollen eyes had glazed now they focused again good eve thought youre doing good youll get through did you have a key or code to the door no no i didnt have his key or code we hadnt taken it quite that far yet we both wanted to keep it loose the modern american dating couple each cautiously guarding his own space a tear leaked out now and she ignored it let it trail down her cheek the door wasnt closed not all the way thats when i was more worried than pissed i pushed the door open and called out i kept telling myself hed gotten involved in the book he was editing and lost track but i started feeling scared i nearly turned around and walked out but i couldnt seem to do it i kept calling kept going back toward his office then i was at the door and i saw him saw jonah i saw him on the floor and the blood around his head sorry she said and quickly lowered her own between her knees as the dizziness passed she saw the book on the floor with a choked sound she picked up the battered paperback and straightening again smoothed the covers jonah was a story junkie any form books discs audio visual youd find them all over his house and office even on his boat can i do you think i could keep this were going to need to keep everything on the premises for now when were done ill see that it gets to you thanks thanks for that okay she took a breath and held onto the book as if it steadied her after i found him i ran outside i think i was going to keep running but i saw one of the patrol droids and i called it i sat down on the steps and started to cry did jonah always take wednesdays off to work at home yes except when he was traveling or there was a meeting scheduled he couldnt miss did you routinely have lunch with him on wednesdays in the last two two and a half months we tried for a late afternoon lunch i guess it was a routine we both pretended we werent in any sort of routine keeping it loose she said again and pressed tears out of her eyes you were intimate we had sex routinely she nearly managed a smile we shied away from words like intimate but neither one of us was seeing anyone else not for weeks now i know its very personal but could you tell me if mr talbot was in the habit of wearing body ornamentation a little silver hoop left ball very silly very sexy at the end of the interview dana had drained a second glass of water when she got to her feet she swayed and eve reached out to take her arm why dont you sit down until youre steadier im all right i really want to go home i just want to go home a uniformed officer will take you id rather walk if its allowed its only a few blocks and i i need to walk thats fine we may have to talk to you again just no more today please she walked to the door stopped i think i might have been falling in love with him ill never know ill just never know now that makes me so sad over this horrible wrench of what happened to jonah that makes me so sad eve sat for a moment just sat there was too much going on inside her head and she needed to streamline she had a body on its way to the morgue a killer methodically working his way through a job two fbi agents who wanted to snag her case a houseguest she couldnt quite trust and a husband who could very well be in severe jeopardy and was certainly going to cause her considerable trouble when feeney walked in she was still sitting her eyes halfclosed and her mouth in a grim line judging her mood he pursed his lips then walked over to sit on the low table in front of her he pulled out a bag of nuts offered it you want the good news or the bad news start with the bad why change the rhythm now bad is he walked right in the front door guys got himself a master and that aint good a police master that or a good simulation we can enhance that sector of the disc back at edd see if we can clean it up enough to tell for sure point is dallas he walked right up to the door like he belonged here slid in a master code and strolled inside no question it was yost even without the dna the sweepersll pick up dressed spiffy new wig dark hair long enough to tie back in a stub at the nape sort of an arty look guess it fits in with the neighborhood he knows how to blend carried a briefcase took the time to put the master into an outside pocket secure it knew the house too walked right back to the office eve leaned forward feeney are you telling me the house cams were activated yeah thats my good news he gave her a fierce smile either yost didnt consider that or didnt give a rats ass but the house cams were up i gotta figure the victim didnt remember to shut them down when he got up this morning we got a lot of him poking around doing usual morning stuff before he settled down to work audio too its a solid system she got to her feet he didnt think of it nobody keeps inside security on when theyre working at home who wants their every fart and scratch on record yost missed a step feeney yeah could be he did we got the murder on disc dallas all of it where are you set up i want to she broke off remembering roarke she made some sound that might have been frustration might have been pity or a combination of both ill look at it at central can you set us up in a conference room i got something to take care of before i head in yeah hes outside feeney shifted his feet rattled the bag of nuts stuffed it in his pocket i dont like to poke my nose in i know i like that about you feeney yeah well i just want to say hes going to be feeling some weight got to you can tell him he shouldnt but it wont matter after a bit hes going to find his mad probably be pretty hot at first then hes the type to chill it down seems to me thats not such a bad thing all around we might be able to use roarke in a cold temper youre a regular philosopher today feeney im just saying is all maybe youre thinking itd be better to keep him out of the loop he nodded seeing those exact thoughts mirrored in her eyes that would be from the gut and not the head you use your head youre going to figure out sometimes the targets the best weapon you can try to stand in front of this particular target dallas but this onell knock you out of the way anyhow is this your roundabout way of suggesting i bring him in on this officially its your case maybe im saying you should think about using all the resources available thats all im saying deciding that was more than enough feeney gave a little shrug and left her alone she started out selecting uniforms to do a neighborhood canvass and knock on doors out of the corner of her eye she watched roarke he leaned against the rear fender of a sharplooking sedan watching me she thought waiting but there was nothing of patience in the stance give me a minute here eve murmured to peabody then crossed to him i thought you were going to use the limo and driver i was have been i didnt choose to wait for them when i got the call about jonah who informed you i have sources are we going into interview lieutenant when she said nothing he swore softly viciously under his breath sorry do yourself a favor and go home for a while kick something down in the gym he nearly smiled thats your way it usually works i need to go into the office i have a meeting will you be informing next of kin yes he looked away from her toward the lovely little brownstone and thought about what had been done inside i want to talk to his family myself ill make sure youre contacted after the official notification his eyes shifted back to hers feeney had been right she thought he was carrying the weight but he was also finding his mad she could see both in his eyes tell me what you know of this eve dont make me go around you for it im going into central after notification of next of kin and my prelim report i will together with my team study and analyze all available evidence meanwhile the me and the lab will do their jobs dr mira is working up a profile other leads which im not prepared to stand here outside a crime scene and talk about are being actively pursued while all this is going on im fending off an fbi takeover attempt and will no doubt be ordered to release a statement to the media what leads he would she thought latch onto that one statement i said im not prepared to discuss them at this time give me some space here give me time to think im not as good as you are at balancing worry over somebody i love and the work then ill answer that with something that should sound very familiar to you as its forever coming out of your mouth i can take care of myself she expected to feel anger resentment or at the least impatience instead there was only concern he a man who rarely lost control was on the edge of rage and mired in grief she did something she had never done in public never done while on the job with other cops looking on she put her arms around him drew him close and held him with her cheek pressed gently to his im sorry she murmured it wishing she knew more of the art of comforting im so damn sorry the rage that had been spitting into his throat the burn scorching the rim of his heart eased he closed his eyes and let himself lean through all the other miseries in his life thered been no one to offer him the simple soothing of understanding it swamped him washed away the worst edge of grief and left him steadier for it i cant get a handle on it he said quietly and i cant see through the murk of it to any answers you will she eased back skimmed her fingers through his hair try to put it aside for a little while and you will i need you with me tonight ill be with you tonight he took her hand pressed his lips to her knuckles and let her go thanks she waited until hed gotten into his car until hed pulled away from the curb she was tempted to send a blackandwhite out to follow him back to midtown but hed make a tail and be just annoyed enough to lose it instead she let him go as well when she turned around she noted a number of cops get very busy looking in other directions she refused to waste time being embarrassed she signaled to peabody lets get to work o o in his midtown base roarke rode the private elevator to his suite of offices he could feel the anger building inside of him again he couldnt permit it not until he had time alone time to find an outlet he knew how to strap it down it was a hardlearned skill that had kept him alive during the bad years and the building years a skill that had helped him create what he had now and who he was now and what was he now he wondered as he ordered the elevator to stop so he could have another moment to find a grip on that fine skill a man who could buy whatever he chose to buy so he could fill his world with all the things hed once starved for beauty decency comfort style a man who could command what he chose to command so that he would never by god never again feel helpless power the power to amuse himself to challenge himself to indulge himself one who reigned over what some called an empire and had countless people dependent on him for their livelihoods livelihoods lives now two had lost theirs there was nothing he could do to change it to fix it nothing he could do but hunt down the one who had done it and the one who had paid for it to be done and balance the scales rage he thought clouded the mind he would keep his clear and see it through he ordered the elevator to resume and when he stepped off his eyes were grim but cool his receptionist popped up from her console immediately but still wasnt quite quick enough to ward off mick who strolled over from the waiting area well now boyo its a hell of a place youve got here isnt it it does me hold my calls for a bit would you roarke ordered the receptionist unless its from my wife come on back mick that i will im hoping for the grand tour though from the size of this place of yours that might take the next several weeks youll have to make due with my office for now im between meetings busy boy as he followed roarke down a glass breezeway snaking over manhattan and through a wide artfilled corridor he looked around his eyes bright and scanning jesus man is any of this stuff real roarke paused at the black double doors that led to his personal domain managed a halfsmile not still dealing in art that finds its way into your hands are you mick grinned i deal with whatever comes but im not looking toward yours christ do you remember that time we hit the national museum in dublin perfectly but id as soon members of my staff arent entertained with the story he opened the door stepped back so mick could precede him im forgetting youre a lawabiding soul these days holy mother of god just over the threshold mick stopped he had heard of course and had seen enough for himself already to know the reports and rumors of just what roarke had accomplished werent exaggerated hed been dazzled by the home but unprepared he realized for the sleek and rich lushness of the workspace it was huge and the view out the threesided window was as grand as the art chosen to enhance the atmosphere the equipment alone and he knew his electronics was worth a fortune and all of it from the ocean of carpet the acres of real wood the glint of glass new and antique to the streamlined efficiency of the communication and information centers belonged to the childhood friend hed once run with down the stinking alleyways of dublin want a drink coffee mick blew out a breath coffee my ass for me then as im working but ill stand you to a glass of irish roarke moved to a polished cabinet and opened it to reveal a full bar he poured mick a drink before programming the autochef for a single cup of coffee strong and black to larceny mick lifted his glass it may not be what keeps you here these days but by christ its what got you here true enough whatve you been up to today oh this and that seeing a bit of the town mick wandered as he answered poked his head through a doorway and whistled at the enormous bathroom all this is missing is a naked woman dont suppose you could be ordering one of those up for an old friend i never dealt in the sex trade roarke sat sipped his coffee even i had my standards that you did course you never needed to buy a night of affection either as us mortals did from time to time mick came back made himself at home in the chair across from roarkes it came to him fully came that there was much more than years and miles between them the man who could command all roarke commanded was far away from the boy whod plotted thievery with him you dont mind me dropping in this way do you no it occurs to me that its a bit like having a poor relation land on your threshold an annoying embarrassment a man hopes to sweep outside and away again at the first opportunity roarke thought he heard a faint edge of bitterness in the tone i have no relations mick poor or otherwise im pleased to find an old friend mick nodded good and im sorry for thinking it might be otherwise im dazzled and in truth not a little envious of what youve managed here you could say ive had a good run of luck if you really want a tour i can arrange one while im taking the meeting give you a lift home after i wouldnt mind but i have to say you look more like you could use a couple pints in a pub youve got trouble on you i lost a friend today he was killed this afternoon im sorry to hear that its a violent city a violent world come to that why dont you cancel your meeting and well find a pub and wake him proper i cant but thanks for the thought mick nodded and sensing it wasnt the time for old stories drained his glass tell you what ill have that tour if you dont mind then ive business of me own ive been neglecting im going to try to swing it into a dinner meeting if that doesnt inconvenience you any whatever works for you then ill plan on that and likely not be back to your place till late will that be a problem with your security summerset will see to it the mans a wonder mick got to his feet ill stop by st pats in my travels today and light a candle for your friend chapter nine eve sat in the conference room and watched jonah talbot die she watched and she listened to every detail again and again the concentration of an attractive young man at his desk reading a story on his screen making notes with the quick fingers of one hand on a spiffy little pc unit while something classical played on the speakers hed played the music loud hed never heard his killer come in the house walk through it step into the home office she watched yet again saw yet again the instant talbot had sensed something someone that instinctive brace of the body that quick whip of the head his eyes had widened there had been fear in them not full panic but alarm shock nothing on yosts face his eyes were dead as a dolls his movements precise as a droids as hed set his briefcase aside who the hell are you what do you want kneejerk eve thought as she listened to talbots angry demand people so often asked the name and business of an attacker when the first hardly mattered and the second was all too obvious yost hadnt bothered to respond hed simply started across the room graceful for a man with his bulk as if she thought hed had dancing lessons along the way talbot had come around the desk and come around fast not to flee but to fight and there in that little blip of time eve saw those dead eyes light the dawn of pleasure in the job hed let talbot strike the first blow spill first blood and with the corner of his lip spurting yost moved in grunts the crunch of bone on bone played under the soaring music but only briefly yost was too efficient to toy with his target for long to indulge himself by taking more time than hed allowed hed let talbot take him down knocking over the table letting him think just for one heady instant that he might win then the pressure syringe was out of yosts pocket into his hand and its rounded tip pressed just under talbots armpit still talbot had struggled even with his eyes rolling back hed tried to land a disabling blow the drug would have blurred his vision clouded his brain slowed his reflexes until he was limp helpless then unconscious thats when yost had beaten him slowly methodically no wasted motions or energy his mouth moved a bit as he worked after the music was cleaned out of the disc she would know that hed been humming when he finished with the face he stood and began to kick in the ribs the sound was vile hes not even winded eve murmured but hes excited he enjoyed it he likes his work now leaving talbot broken and bleeding on the floor he wandered over ordered a glass of mineral water from the autochef he checked his wrist unit before sitting down and sipping the glass dry checked it again when he rose to go to his briefcase he took the silver wire out of it tested its strength by snapping it between his hands once twice when he smiled as now he smiled she understood why the clerk in the jewelry store had trembled he looped the wire around his own throat crossed the ends to hold it in place snugly she could see that while it wasnt tight enough to bring blood it was secure enough to cut down on the flow of oxygen on the floor talbot stirred moaned on his feet yost removed his suit jacket folded it neatly on a chair removed his shoes then tucked his socks into them he stepped out of his trousers aligning the center pleats precisely before he laid them aside he went to talbot stripped off the mans shorts nodded in approval as he squeezed as if checking muscle tone he wasnt yet fully aroused he tightened the wire around his neck slightly using the autoerotic method to enhance his mood as he stroked himself hard then he knelt between talbots legs leaned over tapping the battered cheek lightly are you in there jonah you dont want to miss this come on out now ive got a lovely parting gift for you talbots bloody eye fluttered open blind with confusion and pain thats the way do you know the movement thats playing mozart from his symphony number in d major allegro assai its one of my favorites im so pleased we can share it take what you want talbot managed between broken teeth just take what you want oh thats very kind of you i intend to up you go he lifted talbots hips in his big hands the rape was long and brutal eve made herself watch as she had made herself watch each time despite her stomach wanting to heave despite the whimpered pleas that straggled to rise into her own throat she watched and she saw the moment that yost lost himself when he threw his big head back so the wire around his throat glinted in the light he cried out a roar of triumph that smothered the music smothered talbots helpless weeping the orgasm bucked through him his face gleamed with it his eyes shone he shuddered shuddered sucked in air then braced himself with a hand between talbots shoulder blades until he came back to himself his eyes were as bright now as the wire he slid from around his own neck and looped around talbots they stayed bright dark and bright as a birds as he crossed the ends and pulled talbots body jerked his fingers scrabbled at the wire his feet drummed the floor but it was quickly done at least it was quick and when it was done the killers eyes were as dead as his victims he calmly turned talbot over examined the body then with some delicacy removed the tiny body ornament with it cupped in his palm he used his foot to shove the body facedown again naked gleaming with sweat he turned away gathered his clothes and briefcase he would walk into the firstfloor bath where the house cams didnt reach in precisely eight minutes he would come out again scrubbed neatly dressed the briefcase in his hand he would leave the house without looking back end disc as eve gave the order and rose she heard peabodys sigh a broken sound that was relief and pity he checked his wrist unit a number of times eve began he was on a timetable since it appears from his movements he knew the house either from a previous breakin or through blueprints i believe he knew about talbots usual lunch date according to the time print on the disc he entered the premises at thirteen hundred almost on the dot he left the scene fifty minutes later ten minutes before the lunch date and well before anyone expecting the victim would bother to check on him he left the door unlatched so talbot could be found quickly theres no reason for him to wish to postpone the knowledge of the crime whoever hired him wants it out as soon as possible she walked over to the board used for the investigation and where stills of darlene french and now jonah talbot held prominence more than forty known or suspected hits in his career but talbot gives us the first visual of the act this breakin pattern indicates yost was unaware the house cams were activated even so he could and should have checked hes getting sloppy mcnab put in sooner or later they get sloppy sloppy maybe but factor in his profile arrogance he didnt bother to check didnt put it on his todo list he isnt worried about us he pinches us off like fleas before we ever get the first bite he bought four lengths of wire four potential victims this is the biggest job done separately for a single client we can find in yosts case history hes flirting with exposure almost daring it i say he feels protected maybe invulnerable his take from this job would be at his suspected minimal fee ten to twelve million feeney scratched his chin hes moving through them fast and at this pace would finish the contract in a week or so thats a hefty paycheck none of his data indicates a previous with this number at this speed eve confirmed maybe hes planning on retiring after this one or at least taking himself a long vacation he can get himself a new face and live the high life somewhere a vacation eve considered it as she studied yosts image posted on the board hes never hit four in close geographic proximity before never spread out connected hits in the same area over different dates and locations she let it filter through hes been at this twentyfive years or more thinks of it as a job twentyfive thirty years then retirement could play certainly a vacation after a big important job is something a lot of execs go for the arrangements would have already been made hes a planner where would roarke go eve turned her head to frown at peabody what do you mean well the profile indicates he sees himself as a highly successful businessman one of impeccable taste he likes fine things and he can afford the best the only person i know who falls in that slot is roarke so if he were going to take a break after a big job where would he go thats good thinking eve nodded tried to focus on her husbands pattern he owns places all over hell and back it would depend on whether he wanted to be alone solitude and a couple house droids not a city because he wants relaxation at first not stimulation from the profile and pattern yost is more of a loner than roarke hes booked or bought himself an estate somewhere with a good wine cellar and all the trimmings finding that on the data we have would be like looking for a ripple in a pool then her scowl began to turn into a slow smile but i think thats a damn good lead to feed the feds one for us is music he knew the mozart thing playing called it by name hummed along with it peabody i want you to start checking out the highdollar season tickets to the symphony the ballet the opera all the highbrow stuff single ticket holders hed go alone mcnab you concentrate on purchases cash purchases of recorded discs for the same kind of music hes a collector she paced the room as she spoke because the steps and the thoughts were lining up for her now we need the lab results ill hound dickhead there i want to see what the sweepers got out of the bathroom drain he took a shower but the guest soap was dry our fastidious sociopath probably carries his own soap shampoo and so on in his briefcase when hes on a job like this one it wont be an ordinary brand so we could have another line to tug there feeney can you go back to following the wire talk to those cousins while i kick at dickhead can do even as he agreed his communicator beeped hold on he rose pulling it out and stepped away as he answered lieutenant mcnab called for her attention i was thinking about the cant be delicate about this i was thinking how yost used the wire to help him get off during the rape so even if the guy goes for mozart and fine wine hes got some experience with porn or licensed companions wholl skirt the sexually deviant line if hes a loner its most likely he gets into it at home with vr or video or holo you gotta have programs or discs you can get some through legitimate sources and the darker versions right down to snuff porn which it strikes me hed go for through the black market you sure seem to know a lot about it peabody commented i worked in vice awhile and stuff still he squirmed a little under her stare and gave his attention to eve i could start hunting in that venue like you said hes a collector they even got some of this stuff that leans toward the art film side i could start with that mcnab sometimes you surprise me do it want to watch some dirty discs shebody he whispered and eve pretended mostly for her own sake she didnt hear son of a bitch feeney pocketed his communicator we got a break ive been running the like crimes couldnt find any in london or england for the time frame you wanted i put a man on it to run variations of the pattern just in case he got a hit where its a place in cornwall along the coast cops found some bodies out in the moor they were in pretty bad shape exposure and theyve still got you know wild life around there thing was they were garroted but there was no wire so i didnt get the pop plus the locals there hadnt hooked it into the network until two months after the crime why do you tag it as yost timing fits once they were able to determine time of death kill pattern fits both victims male and female were beaten badly especially around the face both tranqued both raped my man brought up the dead shots and compared the neck wounds what could be made of them and that fits hiker who called it in didnt hang around for the cops could be he took the wires did they id the victims they did couple of badass smugglers who kept a base in a cottage up there i can follow up on this get more data talk to the primary yeah and pass it all through to my home unit im going to feed this one to the feds too it might get them off my back and better yet off my turf for a while with that in mind lets pick this up at eight hundred tomorrow my home office anybody gets anything between now and then contact me o o she hit dickie the chief lab tech and hit him hard he whined but it was almost casually she threatened him then bribed him with a bottle of jamaican rum which completed their relationship dynamic he agreed to put her bathroom drains on top of his workload next she reported to whitney got his goahead to feed her selected data to jacoby and stowe and as expected was told she would be needed at a press conference scheduled for fourteenthirty the following afternoon she brooded about that all the way back down to her office where she settled down and contacted stowe the agent came on screen her attractive face showing annoyance lieutenant why did i have to hear on a public news report of a murder that most certainly appears to be perpetrated by sylvester yost because news travels agent stowe and ive been busy im contacting you now to bring you uptodate on this latest incident but if youd rather break my balls youre just wasting my time you should have informed me or my partner before you left the scene and had it sealed i dont recall seeing that directive written down anywhere this is a courtesy call and im starting to feel pretty discourteous cooperation you want cooperation then shut up and listen eve paused saw stowe simmer then swallow her wrath i have some data that might be of help to your investigation and to mine and which i believe your agency can track more quickly than mine you want to deal lets deal im going to be at a downtown club the down and dirty in twenty minutes bring something to trade she cut transmission before stowe could respond and she made certain she got to the d and d in fifteen just in case an enormous black man with tattoos and feathers and a head as bald and shiny as a bowling ball grinned wide enough to split his remarkably ugly face when she walked in hey there white girl hey back black boy it was too early for the bulk of the clientele an allnude club like the down and dirty appealed to still there was a scatter of customers hulking at tables and a single bored dancer working up just enough energy to shake her impressive breasts to the beat of recorded music crack all seven feet of him ran the club but would concentrate on bouncing the more irritating of the customers out on their heads when the action heated up hed gotten his name for the sounds those heads made as they met concrete for now he loitered behind the bar and came up with a nastylooking cup of black coffee he slid it over to eve dont see your skinny ass in here awhile i get to missing it golly crack youre making me all misty one sip of the coffee took care of that she hoped her throat lining would regenerate eventually i got a couple of federal types meeting me here he looked so pained even the grinning skull tattooed on his cheek drooped now why you wanna do that thing sweet lips you bring federal heat to my place i wanted to show them a highlight of our wonderful city she laughed and i wanted to make their cleancut east washington selves see what its like in the real world the female half of the team may be all right under it all but the guys a butt pain squared you want me to maybe give them some grief no maybe just one of your hard looks the kind theyll remember long after theyre safe back in their little field office oh and you could make sure they get this coffee his teeth gleamed like marble columns you got you a mean streak a mile wide pal anything in here you dont want the feds sniffing we clean right now his eyes skimmed past her mmmmmm more white meat whiter than white they ever hire color in the effingbee of eye sure but working federal probably turns them white give me a little room here crack she murmured then shifted on her stool agents you sure pick the nicest places lieutenant with a wrinkle of the nose jacoby inspected a stool before gingerly sliding on this is my little home away from home want some coffee my treat i guess thats as safe a bet as youd get in a dump like this you calling my place a dump crack leaned over the bar stuck his huge face into jacobys hes just being a moron karen stowe stepped gamely between them its genetic so he cant help it id love some coffee thank you then youre welcome with surprising dignity crack stepped back and worked on the coffee under the bar his gaze slid up briefly met eves gleamed good humor you got a trade eve demanded the bureau is not in the habit of bartering with the locals jacoby for gods sake fall in or shut up stowe turned to eve can we get a table sure eve picked up her coffee waited until they had theirs then strolled away to a table in the far corner stowe led off i picked up some information on a hit that looks like yost a supreme court judge went down two years ago a supreme court justice gets raped and garroted it makes the media wild i dont remember hearing anything on this and none of my searches picked it up politics they covered it because the justice wasnt alone he was with an underage female dead no im still picking out the pieces but what i get is the kid was drugged then bound and locked in an adjoining room i cant get a name on her cant get past the seals but it looks as if she was whisked away by the government im guessing witness protection they dont want her talking about the judges bad habit of boinking youngsters official word is he died of a heart attack and was beyond resuscitation by the time medical aid arrived thats not bad your turn eve nodded and managed to conceal a smile of satisfaction when jacoby took a gulp of coffee and turned nearly the same peagreen tone as her city vehicle while his eyes watered and he gasped she gave stowe the appropriate data i can get the files from the brits within the hour stowe said we should be able to track down the hiker the vacation or retirement propertys a good line my data runs with yours hes never hit more than two at a time in the same location if hes planning on four here he might want a break ill put some drones on that to start and well see what they come up with im going to want to talk to your husband i already gave you two for one dont push it marginally recovered jacoby leaned forward we can pull him in dallas we dont need your permission try it hell eat you for lunch listen to me she said turning to stowe if he had any answers if he had a goddamn clue whats driving this hed tell me he knew jonah talbot he liked him and he feels responsible you get in roarkes face on this youll just make it worse for him and get nothing for yourself ive got personal reasons for wanting this guy so does roarke hell work with me on this hell work with the nypsd but he wont work with you he would if you asked him to maybe but i wont take what ive given you and see where it takes you its more than you had when you came in here she pushed away from the table got to her feet then she took a good hard look at both of them let me make this clear you make a move toward him youll have to get through me if by some miracle you get through me in one piece hell slice you in half without breaking a sweat and youll spend the rest of your life wondering what the hell happened to your promising career work with me and well take this murdering son of a bitch down you can have the credit i dont give a shit about that you try an end run around me toward roarke ill burn you she turned on her heel strode to the bar and slapped down credits for the coffee kicking ass white girl crack said with a wink i havent even started stowe blew out a breath when eve stalked out well didnt that go well local heat jacoby said in disgust who the hell does she think she is dicking with us a good cop stowe snapped back christ she was tired of playing with jacoby but he was her ticket to the yost investigation one wholl protect her personal and professional territory good cops dont marry criminals for one long moment stowe just stared at him you really are an idiot ignoring that supercilious and ridiculous statement whatever the suspicions are about roarkes former activities nobody nobody in any law enforcement agency on or off planet has any documentation any proof not even any they could cook up out of steam that links him to any crime and the point here jacoby is in this matter hes a victim he knows it she knows it and we know it so cut the crap he was annoyed enough to take another gulp of coffee before he remembered whose side are you on im trying to remember im pretty sure it was law and order i dont think that local heat has any trouble remembering that like hell she was holding out on us shes got more well gee jacoby you think sarcasm dripped frigid as icicles of course she was holding out on us in her place wed do exactly the same thing but the point is she told the truth she gave us straight leads as far as they went and when she said she didnt care who got the credit for taking yost down she meant it she shoved her untouched coffee aside and got to her feet i wish i could say the same i wish i knew i could say i didnt care and mean it chapter ten eves intention was to go straight to her home office run more data gather whatever fresh information the rest of her team had shot over then follow up on the nibble the feds had passed her way plans changed the minute she was through the front door she wasnt surprised to see summerset in the foyer the fact was it no longer seemed her day was complete if she didnt exchange a few pithy words with him every evening but even as she opened her mouth for the first serve he was cutting her off roarkes upstairs so he lives here hes disturbed her stomach sank neither of them noticed that when she started to strip off her jacket summerset not only helped her out of it but laid it neatly over his arm what about mick hes out for the evening okay no help with a distraction there then how long has he been home nearly half an hour hes made calls but has yet to go into his office hes in the master bedroom she nodded started up the stairs ill take care of it i believe you will summerset murmured she found him in the bedroom he was taking a call on his headset rather than the link and stood looking out one of the tall windows to the gardens that were wild with spring if theres anything i can do to help you with the arrangements or anything at all as he listened he threw up the window leaned out as if eve thought desperate for air well all miss him and very much mrs talbot i hope its some comfort to you to know how much jonah was liked and respected no he said after a moment there are no answers to the why thats true yes will you let me do that for you and your family he said nothing for quite some time and eve had been on this side of enough victim survivor calls to know how much grief and confusion were pouring out of talbots mother and into roarke yes of course he said at length please contact me if theres anything else i can do for you no no its not i will goodbye mrs talbot he drew the headset off but stayed at the window his back to the room saying nothing eve crossed to him slipped her arms around his waist pressed her cheek to his back she felt his body already tensed brace jonahs mother yeah she held on i heard shes grateful to me for offering to help for taking the time to offer my personal condolences his voice was quiet too quiet and violent with sarcasm of course i didnt mention hed be alive if he hadnt worked for me maybe youre right but fuck maybe he snapped the headset in two heaved it out the window the abrupt movement knocked eve back a step but she had her feet planted and was ready to face him when he whirled hed done nothing nothing but be mine just like that young maid and for that alone theyre beaten and raped and their lives ended im responsible for those who work for me how many more how many will be betrayed to death simply because theyre mine this is what he wants you questioning yourself blaming yourself the mad that feeney had predicted was there now ripened to bursting well he can have it ill take a bloody ad out give him what he wants she said evenly let him know he got to you hell want more then what he lifted his hands and they were fists i can fight what comes at me one way or the other i can take it on but how do i fight this do you know how many work for me no neither did i but i ran figures today im a wonder with figures there are millions ive given him millions to pluck from no she moved forward wrapped her fingers firmly around his forearms you know better youve given him nothing he takes your mistake will be to give him part of you to let him know he has it if i let him know maybe hell come at me maybe ive thought of that and it worries me but she ran her hands up his arms down again in an unconscious effort to soothe thats mostly when im thinking with my heart when i use my head it doesnt play he doesnt want you dead he wants you wounded do you understand what i mean he wants you broken or in turmoil or he wants you like this for what purpose thats for us to figure out we will figure it out sit down i dont want to sit down sit she repeated using the cool unbending tone he often used with her when his eyes flashed she turned away to pour out a snifter of brandy briefly she considered slipping a soother into it but hed know she could attempt to pour it down his throat as hed done to her but she didnt think she could pull it off then theyd both be mad have you eaten too distracted to be amused by the sudden role reversal he let out an impatient breath no why dont you go to work why dont you stop being so stubborn she set the brandy on the low table in the sitting area put her hands on her hips now you can sit down or i can take you down a little hand to hand might make you feel better so im up for that im not in the mood for a fight and because he wasnt but in the mood to brood he walked over and sat screen on he ordered screen off she countermanded no media now his eyes glinted screen on if you dont want to watch go away screen off lieutenant youre treading a thin line temper rerouted outward toward her just as shed intended it wasnt iced yet no not yet she thought but that would come i have good balance pal then put it to use elsewhere i dont want your brandy or your company or your professional advice right at the moment fine ill drink the brandy she hated brandy ill stow the professional advice but she said as she sat and curled herself into his lap im not going anywhere he took her by the shoulders to set her aside then i will she simply locked her arms around his neck no you wont am i this much trouble when im in a mood he let out a sigh then defeated lowered his forehead to hers youre a constant annoyance to me i dont know why i keep you me either except she brushed her lips over his this maybe this is pretty good and skimming her fingers through his hair tipping his head back kissed him long and slow and deep eve he murmured it mouth against mouth let me her lips traced over his cheeks soft tender just let me i love you and couldnt bear to see him hurt couldnt bear to see him weary they would work and work together they would fight and fight together but for now she only wanted to give him peace he was so strong that strength both appealed to her and challenged her now those muscles were taut and knotted with a tension that so rarely showed she stroked letting her hands soothe while her mouth seduced so controlled she thought shifting to scrape her teeth lightly over his jaw she found both frustration and security in his control now it wavered and she would exploit the weakness channel anger into lust her busy hands moved to his shirt slowly opened buttons her lips followed down the trail of exposed flesh to his heart where the beat was strong but still too steady i love the taste of you she ran her hands up his chest over his shoulders flicked her tongue over that warming skin everywhere again she shifted straddling him now and when she saw his eyes the dark smoke of need over the wild blue the beat of her own blood quickened shed been wrong she realized the rage in him wasnt ready to cool and wouldnt be quenched with gentle strokes and quiet sighs it was heat that would smother heat watching him she hit the release on her weapon harness let it slide to the floor behind her watching him she unbuttoned her shirt shrugged it off beneath she wore a thin cotton tank dipping low she saw his gaze shift down felt her nipples throb as if his mouth had already claimed them but he didnt touch her knew the moment he did the chain would break and hed ravish devour he thought furious with himself when she was offering him comfort he gathered himself touched a hand lightly to her cheek let me take you to bed she smiled and there was nothing comforting about it lets take each other she stretched up stripping the tank over her head and tossing it aside right here she fisted her hands in his hair curved her body to his sliding flesh to flesh put your hands on me she demanded then crushed her mouth to his his control snapped in one violent move she was under him pinned he fed on her filling himself swallowing each ragged breath he put his hands on her taking greedily recklessly driving her to that first frantic peak and when she cried out he took more his mouth closed over her breast teeth nipping tiny delicious pains into sensitive flesh the thrill of it drummed through her so that she arched up urging him on digging her nails into his back she twisted under him her hands searching her mouth seeking their needs matched desperation for desperation and their limbs tangled as they fought with clothes sweatsleeked flesh with that savage rage whipping through him he could think of nothing but her of mate the long agile length of her the curves and dips of her that miraculously fit against him the pale beautifully delicate skin that rode so smoothly over hard muscle the taste of that skin when the heat of passion bloomed over it more all was all he could think while his blood burned she was hot so hot and wet when his fingers stroked into her smooth and tight as her hips pumped he wanted needed to see her come needed to feel it to know when her system exploded everything she was was his her body arched a tight little bridge of sensation her breath tore out into a sob she poured into his hand still he couldnt stop gave her no chance to slide gently down again instead he drove her ruthlessly rushing up her body with teeth and tongue when his mouth was on hers when he could feel her about to shatter yet again he plunged into her knocking her over the edge with that first rough stroke and still he thought more even as she shuddered he shoved her knees up and went deeper inside her his vision blurred but through the red haze of lust he could see her eyes deep dark glazed like glass to throw his own reflection back at him im inside you he panted it out as he pushed them both to madness everything i am body heart mind she struggled through layers of pleasure to say the one thing he needed her hands wrapped around his wrists to hold the beat of his blood let go ill stay with you he pressed his face to her hair let both heart and mind go and let body rule them both o o eve wasnt sure how much time had passed before her brain cleared enough to allow a clear thought through but when she managed to remember her name roarke was still pinning her to the cushions his heart continued to gallop against hers but his body was very still she stroked her hand down his back gave him an affectionate pat on the butt i think im probably going to need to breathe sometime within the next ten or fifteen minutes he lifted his head then considerately propped himself on his elbows her face was flushed her lips slightly curved her eyes halfclosed you look pretty pleased with yourself why shouldnt i im pretty pleased with you too he leaned down just enough to touch his lips to the dent in her chin thank you you dont have to thank me for sex were married not for the sex though that was worthy of a few cheers for understanding me for lets say tending to me ive had a lot of practice on the other side of it she reached up brushed the hair from his brow feeling better yes he shifted and as he sat up drew her with him let me just hold this for a minute he murmured nuzzling her in his lap keep that up well end up horizontal and sweaty again mmm and its tempting the rage was still inside him but chilled now calculated but theres work do i have to argue with you lieutenant about letting me work with you on this and spoil the nice place were in she said nothing a moment i dont want you to no dont start let me finish she turned her face into the curve of his throat the part that doesnt want you to is personal that parts afraid for you and worried about you the professional part knows the more involved you are the more help you can be the quicker we close this thing the personal side doesnt have a chance against the cop and you pushing together would it help if i tell you ill handle all this better if im involved in the work it wont eat at me in the same way yeah she held on another moment then drew back yeah i guess i know that too lets get a shower some fuel then ill lay out the ground rules ive never liked that phrase he said as she rose ground rules she let out a short laugh theres something else i know o o when they were dressed and sharing a meal of seafood pasta she set out her stipulations with whitneys approval youll come onboard this investigation officially as an expert consultant civilian with this appointment there are privileges and limitations and a moderate fee how moderate she speared a scallop with her fork less she said as she popped it in her mouth then i imagine you paid for any one pair of your six hundred shoes you will be issued id a badge she spared him a withering look dont be ridiculous standard photo and print id you will not be issued a weapon thats all right ive plenty of my own shut up you will be privy to data relating to this investigation at the discretion of the primary that happens to be me handy you will be expected to obey orders or this appointment can and will be terminated again at the discretion of the primary we run this by the book ive always wondered how many pages are in that book of yours and smart mouthing to the primary can result in disciplinary action darling you know how that excites me she sneered even though she wanted to celebrate that he was himself again during the course of the investigation the primary and investigative team will require access to some of your files thats understood okay she scooped up one last forkful of pasta lets go to work thats it for ground rules well hit them as we go my office i want to bring you up to date o o the advantage of working with roarke was that he understood cop the fact that this had more to do she suspected with him spending most of his life outwitting them than it did with being married to one was irrelevant she didnt have to spell things out for him and that saved time you didnt give the fbi everything youve put together but theyll know that right and theyll live with it theyll also suspect or at least wonder if youve put more salient data together on yost in less than a week than they have in years that wont sit well yeah and that just breaks my heart your competitive streaks showing lieutenant maybe when it comes down to it the feebs can have the glory yost will know who brought him down that does the job for me they didnt pay enough attention to the wire the exactness of it their profile gives a strong indication of pattern his obsessiveness with detail and still they missed subtleties dont they you think as a bureau tend to concentrate more on the overview and depend too heavily on pure data rather than instinct and possibilities he smiled easily when she frowned at him not that ive had any personal dealing with them that id want to take up your time discussing just now is that so well well have to make time later mmm but my point is while youre one to use your data to see the overview and quite clearly you trust your gut and you never forget possibilities maybe then again most feebs arent hooked to a guy who can buy a case of fancy shampoo at five thousand a pop so they dont look at that angle at the rich selfindulgent guy angle i never buy shampoo by the case for personal use and youd have looked there in any event you dont miss details still i know more about highend products than you which is why im an expert consultant civilian she added and youre not until tomorrow after whitneys approval in anticipation of that i need to see the security disc run from jonahs murder no i need to see what yost was wearing how he wore it ive reviewed the hotel disc in that he prefers british designers how the hell do you recognize a designer from looking at somebodys suit jacket on a disc run darling eve with a faint smile he skimmed a ringer over the shoulder of her ancient and faded nypsd tshirt fashion is more a priority for some of us than it is for others you think thats a dig but it doesnt hit the mark with me ace anyway i shouldve figured one clothes snob would recognize another she pulled the disc out of her file bag you get a good look at him as hes coming to the door that should do it for you and that she thought as she loaded it into her desk unit was as much as she intended to show roarke computer run current disc file point mark zero to point mark fifteen on wall screen working begin segment run they both looked onscreen both watched yost stroll casually up the steps to jonah talbots door and there the image froze definitely british roarke confirmed as are the shoes i need a closer look at the briefcase okay computer enhance segment twelve through twentytwo ten power working the image shifted with the hand and the briefcase it held separating and magnifying so he sticks with the brits thats a whitford bag made exclusively in london i own the bloody factory this is good we concentrate on sales in london british designers the conservative ones roarke added her forehead knitted i thought it was more the arty type of look hes added the wig and scarf for that but under it its straight arrow the suit looks like a marley but smythe and wexville make that same sharply angular style the shoes are canterburys almost certainly she frowned at them they looked like shoes to her simple black slipontothefeet shoes okay well follow it up eject disc computer disregard ill see the rest no theres no point in it ill see the rest he said would you prefer i access it and view at another time and place im telling you theres no point in putting yourself through that i spoke to his mother i listened to her weep computer continue run eve cursed under her breath and stalked away she did her best to get her temper under control and poured out two glasses of wine he hadnt touched the brandy earlier she didnt need to watch the tape to live it again she could close her eyes and see every movement every horror and she feared when she closed her eyes that night to sleep she would see it again or worse see herself as a child bleeding and broken in a filthy room where a red light blinked over and over and over again she bore down and with mozart soaring walked back to finish the nasty job of watching it again beside her husband freeze image roarke ordered and his voice cut like sharpened ice he stared at the screen where jonah talbot lay unconscious and the man who would kill him stood in the act of unbuttoning his shirt enhance image segment thirty to fortytwo and when the computer complied roarke nodded the little design on the cuff the shirts handmade on bond street london finwycks computer resume he saw it through saying nothing showing nothing if eve had been a fanciful woman shed have said she could feel the heat pumping off him the rage of it and how that rage cooled chilled iced until the air in the room crackled with it when it was done he walked to the computer ejected the disc laid it on her desk he took a moment a moment only to gather himself in again im sorry i insisted on viewing that now so that you felt obliged to watch it again ill never fully understand how you stand it how you cope with it day after day death after death by telling myself ill stop him that ill see to it hes put somewhere so that he can never do it again it cant be enough it never could be he sipped the wine now burying his grief and pity deep so that the cold fury held control his wrist unit was swiss which is to be expected a multitask rolex i have one myself as do thousands of others who insist on dependable accuracy in such matters i can help you with that as you own the factory and several of the major outlets that sell that model he finished and with the briefcase and the shoes the rest of the wardrobe will take more time i assume as theyll insist on proper paperwork and warrants and what have you to release any customer data londons closed at this hour ill get on that in the morning get me what you can on the rest im going to see what i can dig out on the supreme court judge he nodded but stayed where he was drinking his wine you have mcnab checking on season tickets for the symphony and so on if he runs into any snags i can have that for you and through proper channels with a simple link call ill let you know as far as the black market on the porn and snuff discs i still have contacts in that murky arena meaning i know people who know people and so on no it gets out youre looking in that muck it could alert whoevers supplying him that im looking i can cover that easily enough but well see how lan does if youd rather my other equipment could cut through a great many layers without anyone being aware he reminded her not this round roarke i use unregistered here even to tickle out some data and ive got no way to justify it to myself no way to explain to the rest of the team how i came by it by the book youre the boss so saying he carried his wine through the doorway into his own office o o several blocks south in his crowded disordered downtown apartment mcnab huddled over his computer beside him peabody down to her shirt and uniform pants worked on one of his miniunits the man she often thought collects computers the way some men collect sport holos working her way through the porn sites for names had begun to give her a headache but she continued doggedly concentrating on the titles and comeon and the screen names of potential customers who took advantage of the thirtysecond preview mcnabs theory was that yost might cruise the labyrinth of sex sites available online make his selections through previews it was possible he ordered them onscreen and that would be the luckiest of breaks as hed have to use an id and credit number to do so but even if he simply scanned the previews hed have logged on under a screen name most were laughable and obvious bigkok cumlvr hornydog she didnt think sylvester yost would go for the crude or the foolish she sat back rubbed her gritty eyes then began to root through her bag for a pain blocker absently mcnab reached over and rubbed her neck want to take a break i just need to ditch the headache maybe stretch my legs she rose rolling her shoulders as she went to the kitchen for water he knew shed broken a date with charles monroe to work with him that night mcnab was darkly pleased that the suave lc had gotten the boot even if it was for work what he really wanted was to plant his own boot right in monroes pretty face and one of these days the action on the screen scrambled his thoughts he goggled as two men and two women began to roll and writhe on the floor in a mass of naked bodies and impossibly flexible limbs holy jesus what what did you hit on something peabody rushed back leaned down to the screen then with an oath rapped mcnab over the head with the flat of her hand damn it stop jerking off i thought youd found she trailed off stupefied wow was the best she could do following the action both of them tilted their heads to the side she must be doublejointed triple mcnab decided and its obvious nobody in this group has a spine otherwise they couldnt get in that position they turned their heads again this time toward each other and their eyes met with identical gleams of lust and challenge we cant let a bunch of porn actors outdo us mcnab was already pulling at the hook of her trousers damn right we cant but its probably going to hurt cops feel no pain oh yeah try this she was laughing as she pulled him to the floor o o in another part of town sylvester yost finished his afterdinner brandy and cigar hed activated his single server droid for precisely twelve minutes to deal with the disarray of his kitchen and dining room of course he would check on the job himself even wellprogrammed droids usually failed to see that all was in the perfect order yost demanded hed prepared himself a delightful veal picatta for dinner often after a job he liked to putter around his kitchen enjoying the scents and textures of cooking sipping an appropriate wine as his sauces thickened but an indulgence like that dirtied pots and pans and so on the droid came in handy there as yost preferred to relax with his brandy and cigar rather than loading the dishwasher with his eyes halfclosed and his big muscular body draped in a long robe of black silk he listened to the swelling strains of beethoven such moments he believed were a mans right after a successful days work and soon very soon such moments would stretch to days and days to weeks as he moved into quiet retirement oh he would miss the work he supposed now and then of course if he missed it enough he could certainly take the occasional contract interesting ones just to slay any dragons of tedium but for the most part he was certain he would be quite content with his music and his art his leisure and his solitude when this contract had been offered yost had taken it as a sign it was the perfect end to his career never before had he had occasion to come so close to a man of roarkes stature or capabilities because of that hed been able to demand and receive three times his usual fee for three targets the fourth was to be acted on only at his discretion if he saw his way clear to assassinating roarke himself within two months after the initial contract was fulfilled he would receive a lovely bonus of twentyfive million dollars such a pretty retirement nest yost thought he had no doubt he would see his way clear quite clear it would be the most brilliant act of his career and one he looked forward to with relish chapter eleven eve methodically picked her way through the first reel of red tape to access personal data on justice thomas werner according to official data werner had suffered a fatal heart attack and died at his home in an exclusive suburb of east washington it had taken a little time to identify the judge from the scanty data shed been given but shed run through the archives of the screen news bulletins for the previous winter and had finally hit on werners death now it was a matter of winding her way around and through the privacy act that shielded a man of werners standing from curiosity seekers and even with proper identification hampered an official inquiry you stupid son of a bitch she muttered im a cop youve got my badge number my case file code my voice print what do you want now blood problem lieutenant she didnt bother to glance over at roarkes question east washington bureaucracy bullshit it wants me to submit my request again during working hours well im working arent i perhaps i could she snarled at him hunched protectively over her unit you just want to show off would i be that small to cut me down on this youd shrink to microscopic just to show how big i really am im going to overlook that insult why dont you take a look at the purchase list ive printed out for you and ill see if i can unravel some of your red tape your request the computer announced in dulcet tones for personal medical records concerning justice thomas werner cannot be processed at this time please submit request through this agency between the hours of eight am and three pm est monday through friday requests of this nature must be submitted in triplicate and accompanied by the attached form with all questions answered thereon an incomplete or missing form will delay processing no requests will be considered other than those made by properly authorized persons identification must be included and verified normal processing time for record requests is three working days warning any attempts made to access records without proper request proper identification and verification of same is a federal violation and will result in arrest a fine no less than five thousand us dollars and possible imprisonment not very friendly is it roarke murmured she said nothing merely pushed to her feet stalked around the desk and picked up the hard copy hed brought with him deliberately she took it with her to the kitchen on the pretext of getting coffee when he took her place damned if shed watch how easily he cut through the tape she stood scanning the lists as she reached in the autochef for her mug of coffee hed already done the work there she noted highlighting the range of cash purchases made on a single date in february it fits yosts style she thought another little shopping spree new briefcase new shoes six pairs new wallet four leather belts several pairs of socks silk or cashmere hed ordered two shirts tailored to his measurements from the fancy shop roarke had identified from the talbot disc in only two stores two stops hed dropped over thirty thousand euro dollars roarke had added the data from the jeweler in london the new york clerks cooperative cousin had confirmed that yost had purchased for cash two twofoot lengths of silver wire no backup tool she thought that was his arrogance again he was confident in his skill and according to the best estimate on time of death of the smugglers in cornwall hed done his shopping two days three at most before hed headed north and killed two people hed had to get north she thought did he keep a car in london a house did he stay at some swank hotel then rent transpo take the train fly since it was a good bet he hadnt walked she might be able to track his movements question eve said as she stepped back into her office do you have a house in london yes though i rarely use it i generally prefer my suite at the new savoy the service is impeccable got a car there two garaged how long a drive to cornwall ive never done it so id have to check he spared her a glance now turning in the chair and looking she thought entirely too comfortable at her work station if i were going that far north id likely save time and take the jetcopter from one of my offices unless i was in the mood to see the countryside if you wanted to keep a low profile id probably rent a discreet wellbuilt vehicle thats what i think because if you took the train or an air shuttle youd have to arrange for transpo on the other end that adds an unnecessary step he doesnt like unnecessary steps the new savoys the top digs in london i like to think so yours mmmm do you want to see this data are we going to be arrested fined and imprisoned we can insist on adjoining cells gee thats real funny she walked to the desk leaned over his shoulder and scanned the data this just confirms the heart attack if the feebies info was right theres got to be something under it accessing private hospital records he clucked his tongue and since it was there he turned his head a fraction to nip her jaw im quite sure theres a law against it if its good enough for the feds its good enough for me dig them out i love when you say that he simply executed one keystroke and had the files hed already accessed popping onscreen you did that before i told you to i dont know what youre talking about i merely followed the orders of the primary investigator in my capacity as expert consultant civilian but if you feel you must discipline me she leaned over just a little more and bit his ear oh thank you lieutenant she stifled the laugh but stayed where she was broken nose fractured jaw separated eye socket four broken ribs two broken fingers subdural this and hemorrhaging that a lot of damage for a bad heart sodomized as well but alive through it cause of deaths the strangulation the feds fed me straight on this while were in here lets see if they brought the girl in for exam and treatment look on this date same time frame for a female under eighteen probably examined for sexual molestation for shock maybe minor bruises and lacerations possible illegals consumption he set the scan then picked up her coffee what does finding her matter you know who killed werner it ties an end and theres a possibility she helped set him up for the hit there she is roarke murmured when the data popped mollie newman female age sixteen you hit it down the line even to the traces of exotica and zoner in her system shes the only one we know of whos seen yost on the job and lived zoner she thought that wouldnt have come from werner why screw around with a kid whos zoned that would have been yosts addition to the mix i want to find mollie she should have parents or guardians listed here freda newman mother well run her see what we get lieutenant your federal friends already have this data and in all likelihood know where she is they tossed you this to bog you down i know it but i still want to run it down and i want to find where he bought the wire in east washington habitually he buys it near the hit lets see where she broke off turned to the signaling link yeah dallas lieutenant i think weve got something from the porn sites peabody what the hell are you wearing her aide flushed looked down at herself and the wildly flowered ankleskimmer shed installed in mcnabs closet for convenience um its a robe type thing and quite fetching roarke put in peabodys flush turned into a glow as she fiddled with the bright pink lapels oh well thanks its just for comfort really i save it eve ordered what have you got ive run through the sites pulling screen names and hits until my eyes fell out you wouldnt believe some of the handles these jerks use anyhow going by profile i figured this guy would use something classier i started picking up hits on sterling just sterling you know like silver i get it did you trace source location well we she was bumped rudely aside as mcnab came onscreen he wasnt wearing a robe or eve noticed with a scowl a shirt either thats when the excitement started now some of these pervs use some cloaking especially the ones with families or highpowered jobs dont want people to know theyre getting off watching sex discs but when i started running sterling the beam bounces all over hell and back nobody goes to that much trouble especially on legal sites i got him zipping transmission from hong kong to prague from prague to chicago from there to vegas ii and on give me bottom line here mcnab i cant even come close to true source especially on my home units im going to take it into edd better toys there i might be able to smoke him out i cant tell you how long but ill head in now and get started no youve already put in fifteen sixteen hours today though it was a good bet some of the activities hadnt been of a professional nature ill do it from here ah no offense lieutenant but you need pretty sharp tech skills to get through the primary layers and after that you gotta have magic roarke simply shifted again so that he came onscreen mcnab was all he said oh well if youre doing it frigid ill shoot what ive got going over like i said the hits we got with this sterling are on legal sites a couple of them are on the edge but hold up nothings popped on the real nasty stuff yet but weve got a long way to go good work take a break we already did he couldnt help but grin were pretty recharged now thank you for sharing eve said dryly send the data to roarkes home office unit she broke transmission wandered away to let her mind clear ill leave the tracking to you you can pass it at whatever stage you might be in to feeney and mcnab in the morning i know youve got other stuff going on ill deal with it i should have told you i have a press conference tomorrow you might want to squeeze in one of your own already scheduled dont worry about me eve who said i was she heard the beep from his office thats your data coming in o o she tracked the wire now that she knew where and how to look it was remarkably simple one length cash purchase the day before werner had his heart attack the store silverworks carried a georgetown address its ad page boasted of seventyfive years in business serving the discerning she imagined she would find that yost had dropped in on several other shops that day treating himself to a few gifts she did a travel search requesting the top five hotels in the east washington area then switched to transpo picking out companies who offered rentals on highend vehicles she ordered her computer to crossreference and list any names that appeared on both scans while it processed she got more coffee and decided to give her overworked eyes a rest she didnt know how the drones in edd managed it she kicked back in her sleep chair closed her eyes and went through her mental list of priorities for the morning contact the silver shops the hotels and vehicle rentals in east washington and london request proper authority to locate freda and mollie newman wont get it but ask anyway prep for stupid damn press conference check miras progress on profile and feeneys on the wire real estate holdings private estates shed ask roarke about that the lab pound dickhead the morgue check if remains of jonah talbot are ready to be released to next of kin better see how roarkes doing now check on that in just a minute she thought and it was her last thought before she dropped into sleep into the dark shivering in the dark but not from the cold fear was like a skin of ice over her small and fragile bones rattling them together so she could almost hear the helpless hollow sound of them no place to hide there was never anywhere to hide not from him he was coming she could hear the heavy deliberate footsteps growing louder outside her door she glanced toward the window and wondered what it would be like if she just leaped from the bed threw herself through the glass and let herself fall fall free freedom in death but she was too afraid even with what would walk into her room she was more afraid of the leap she was only eight the door opened nightmare within nightmare dark against dark with only the faintest of light washing behind the shadow of him giving her his shape without a face daddys home and he sees you little girl please dont please dont the plea was a scream in her head but she didnt say it saying it wouldnt stop him could make it worse if it could be worse his hands were on her now creeping under the blanket like spiders skittering along her icy skin it was worse horribly worse when he took time to touch her before she closed her eyes tight tried to go somewhere else in her mind anywhere else in her mind but that he wouldnt allow it wasnt enough just to defile just to abuse so he hurt her he knew how fingers squeezing invading until she began to weep when she wept his breath thickened the filthy excitement of it clogging the air in the room such a bad little girl she tried to push him away tried to make her body somehow smaller small enough that even he couldnt get inside it and now she begged too desperate too terrified to stop herself and she screamed a long broken cry of pain of despair when he pushed himself into her and began to plunge her eyes swollen with tears opened she couldnt stop them and she watched frozen with horror as her fathers face changed as the features melted and reformed it was yost who raped her now yost who slipped a silver wire around her throat and though she was no longer a child but a woman a cop she couldnt stop him no air no breath the cold trickle of blood on her skin where the shining wire cut into fragile flesh a roar in her head a torrent of sound like the world screaming she flailed out using her fists her nails her teeth and was pinned eve come back eve it was roarke who held her now but she was trapped in the dream he could see her eyes wild and blind feel the frantic thunder of her heart and she was cold so cold he said her name over and over pressing her close as if that alone would bring the warmth back to her body her fear had him by the throat like a mad dog that refused to release either of them she fought him gasping for air like a woman drowning until in desperation he pressed his mouth to hers as if to give her breath she went limp youre all right youre safe he rocked comforting them both youre home baby youre so cold but he could not bear to leave her even to get a blanket hold onto me im okay im all right but she wasnt not yet hold onto me anyway i need it she wrapped her still unsteady arms around him let her face burrow into his shoulder i smelled you then i heard you but i couldnt find you im right here it ripped at him he couldnt begin to tell her what it did inside him every time she went back to the horrors of her childhood in dreams right here he murmured pressing his lips to her hair it was a bad one yeah as bad as they get its over now she drew back as far as he would allow and tipped her face up to his his eyes were dark emotions burning in them bad for you too as bad as it gets eve he pulled her against him again heart against heart until the worst of it ebbed ill get you some water thanks when he walked to the kitchen she let her head fall into her hands shed get past it she told herself she could always get past it shed swallow back the bitter dregs of the fear and get on with things shed remember who she was now and not what shed been a victim always a victim work she drew a deep breath and lifted her head shed get back to work where she had control and power and direction she was steadier when he came back with the water and crouched at her feet steady enough for suspicion to worm its way through relief and gratitude did you put a soother in this drink it damn it roarke damn it eve he said mildly and drank half the glass himself drink the rest she frowned and sipping slowly studied him over the rim he looked a little frazzled which was a rare thing for him a little weary which was even more rare it wasnt work he needed she realized but rest rest he wouldnt take even if she put the work aside for the night hed just wait until shed run down until she slept then hed keep going but he wasnt die only one who knew how to press the right buttons she set the empty glass aside satisfied more or less you should leave this until morning and get some sleep perfect she thought but made sure her nod was reluctant i guess i cant keep my mind focused anyway but but what would you stay here with me she reached for his hand i know its stupid but no its not he got into the sleep chair with her stroking her hair as her arms came tightly around him just turn it off until morning i will just as shed keep her arms around him to make sure he did the same dont go away okay i wont and knowing he wouldnt leave her would rest she closed her eyes and let herself drift into dreamless sleep after a while a long while so did he o o she woke first still wrapped around him when the dark began to soften and thin she stayed very still so as not to lose the rare opportunity to watch him sleep love struck her as it did often and without warning not the steady daytoday feeling shed grown used to but the hot wild spurt of it that geysered up and filled her with so many feelings they couldnt be separated delight confusion possessiveness lust and a kind of smugness that butted right up against wonder he was so ridiculously beautiful she doubted shed ever fully comprehend how he could be hers hed wanted her out of all the women in the world hed wanted her wanted hell she thought grinning now pursued demanded taken and while she could admit all of that was exciting hed gone one step further he cherished shed never believed anyone would or could and had never believed there was enough inside her to give all of those things back so here they were the cop and the billionaire squished together in an office sleep chair like a couple of overworked drones it was just fucking great she was still grinning when those fabulous eyes of his opened clear as blue crystal alert and ever so mildly amused good morning lieutenant i never get how you can come awake like that from sleep to full alert and without coffee annoying isnt it yeah he was warm he was beautiful he was hers she could have lapped him up like cream and why not she thought why the hell not but since youre awake she slid her hand down his body found him hard and ready all the way awake ive got a little job for you do you her mouth was already roaming over his face just missing his lips in teasing little bites to his considerable surprise and considerable pleasure her fingers got very busy they closed around him not teasing at all as her tongue laved thirstily along his throat well then he managed anything for the nypsd christ he could all but feel his eyes roll back in his head am i on the clock o o sometime later feeling loose and limber she came out of the kitchen with two mugs of coffee it surprised her that roarke still sat in the halfdark the cat was on his lap now and with the faintest of smiles on his face roarke stroked galahads back i think for an expert consultant civilian youve loafed long enough mmmhmm he took the coffee she offered shutting down early to sleep morning sex bringing me coffee youre very wifely these days are you taking care of me eve hey if you dont want the coffee ill drink it myself and so what if i am and dont call me wifely it pisses me off i do want the coffee thank you very much im touched and grateful youd take care of me and pissing you off by calling you wifely is one of my small pleasures great now that weve got all that settled get your ass up so we can do some work chapter twelve she made the first calls and reached the detective sergeant working the homicides in cornwall during their fifteenminute conversation she was given the facts of the case in a broad north country accent the names of the two victims who had been identified by fingerprint and dna matches through feeneys love child ircca ds fortique was cheerful and forthcoming and told her that after considerable tracking and backtracking they had finally tagged the identity of the hiker who had allegedly found the bodies and made the emergency call fortique was perfectly willing to save eve time and trouble by hauling the witness in and grilling him over a pair of twofoot silver wires eve decided the british police were a great deal more cooperative than her own federal agents she gave him back in kind by passing along the data on yosts shopping adventures in london they ended transmission on good terms her call to the silver shop netted her a full description of sylvester yost who was fondly remembered for his discriminating taste impeccable manners and extensive cash purchases another knot tied off eve thought and shifted her search to hotels the new savoy wasnt quite as cooperative as the police or the merchants in london she was passed from desk clerk to supervisor from supervisor to hotel manager and it seemed there she would stall the manager was a woman in her mid to late fifties with hair the color of polished steel pulled ruthlessly away from a scrawny face that ended on a pointed chin her eyes were a surprising baby blue and her voice while remaining scrupulously polite droned on and on over the same notes im afraid i cant accommodate you lieutenant dallas it is the policy the firm policy of the new savoy to ensure its guests privacy as well as their comfort when your guests start raping and murdering they lose some of that privacy dont you think be that as it may im unable to give you any information on a guest its entirely possible youre mistaken and i would have breached the code of the new savoy and insulted a guest until you have the proper documentation as well as international authorization that requires i make information available to you my hands are tied id like to tie your hands eve thought then kick your skinny butt out the window of the top floor of your stupid hotel ms clydesboro if im forced to wake up my commanding officer and an international liaison advocate at fivefifty in the morning theyre going to be very displeased im afraid thats a difficulty youll have to surmount please feel free to contact me if you now listen sister one moment roarke whod stood in the adjoining doorway and had listened to the last thirty seconds of the exchange crossed the room and took over the link ms clydesboro at least eve had the satisfaction of watching the womans pruney face go pale and those milky blue eyes bulge sir give lieutenant dallas any and all data she requires yes sir of course sir i beg your pardon i had no idea that you had authorized the release of this information how could you he said pleasantly but now that you do get it done ill see to it personally lieutenant dallas if you would forward the description of the man you believe stayed at our hotel i will instruct the staff to confirm or deny im sending you a visual image the dates we believe the individual was in london and a written description instruct the staff that this man may have been wearing a disguise hair and eye color and some facial features may vary he would have booked one of your best suites would have been traveling alone and would likely have had private transportation ill have an answer for you within an hour of receiving your transmission good she cut transmission scowled tightassed bat shes only doing her job youll find the same policy will hold true for any of the top hotels in london would you like me to smooth the way she gave a badtempered shrug and got up why the hell not getting anywhere on the location search yes i believe i am i believe were going to find they were sent and received from here in the city the rest is shadows echoes how close can you pinpoint given a bit more time i can take you to his doorstep how much time until its done yeah but how long until lieutenant impatience wont speed the process he glanced over as mick came to the doorway sorry interrupting not at all but eve noticed roarke saved data and blanked her screen manually your business must have gone well if youre just getting in mick grinned i can say with truth it went better than any man has a right to expect is that coffee i smell it is yes though he could almost hear eve grinding her teeth in frustration roarke got to his feet would you like some i like it fine especially if a good drop of irish found its way into it i think that can be arranged mick smiled at eve as roarke walked back to the kitchen with the cat sensing the possibility of breakfast jogging behind him the man sleeps less than is human he must be pleased to have found a woman who can start the day before dawn as he does himself you look pretty perky for a guy whos been up all night yourself certain activities energize a man so you work here at home from time to time do you from time to time he nodded and anxious i imagine to get back to what you were doing ill be out of your way in just a moment i hope youll pardon me for saying so but its an odd sight to see the man working hip to hip with a cop odd all around she looked over her shoulder as roarke came back with a thick working mans mug steaming with coffee and whiskey the answer to a prayer thanks ill just take it off to my room and let it lull me off to sleep a moment first eve do you have the name of the couple in cornwall what i have or dont have is police business mick might know them he shifted his eyes to eves face and their competitors it was a good point a potential weasel was a useful tool even when he was a houseguest britt and joseph hague hmm well mick gave his attention to his laced coffee its possible of course that i may have heard the names somewhere in my travels i couldnt say he gave roarke a hard meaningful look i couldnt say he repeated because youve done business with them eve shot back the kind customs frowns on i do business with a great many people he spoke coolly evenly and im not in the habit of discussing them or their affairs with cops im surprised you would ask me to he said to roarke surprised and disappointed that youd expect me to roll on friends and associates your friends and associates are dead eve said flatly murdered britt and joe his green eyes widened clouded and he slowly lowered himself into a chair i hadnt heard that i never heard that their bodies were found in cornwall roarke told him apparently they werent found for some time and it took longer yet to identify them good christ god rest their souls a lovely couple they were how did it happen who would have wanted them dead eve countered who would have paid a great deal of money to take them out of the equation i dont know for sure theyd been having considerable luck running prime liquor and highgrade illegals into london and dispersing them from there into paris athens rome stepped on some toes i imagine along the way theyd only been in business in a serious way for a couple years god im sick about this he drank from the mug made an obvious effort to settle himself you wouldnt have known them he said to roarke as i said theyd only been exporting for a few years and stuck to europe they had a little cottage on the moors liked the country life christ knows why whose profits were they cutting into roarke asked him oh a little here a little there id say always room for another smuggler isnt there with all the goods in the world to be moved francolini maybe aye hes a vicious bastard and theyd have cut into him a bit he wouldnt think twice about sending one of his men up to cut them out permanently he doesnt use a paid assassin roarke remembered francolini well he has enough men to let blood when blood needs to be let he wouldnt go outside his own family paid assassin no not francolini then lafarge maybe or hornbecker hornbeckers more likely to pay for blood but hed need good reason for it enough to balance his ledgers franz hornbecker frankfort roarke told eve he was smalltime when i was exporting hes had a good run of luck in the last few years mick sighed i dont know what else to tell you britt and joe i cant imagine it why can i ask should a new york city cop be interested in the fate of two up and coming smugglers out of england it may tie to a case here if it does i hope you catch the murdering bastard who did them he rose i dont know what sort of work they might have been up to at the end of it but i can do some asking on the quiet id appreciate any information you can give me well well see what we see he bent down and picked up the cat who was rubbing against his legs im for bed oh roarke he said when he reached the door if youve time later id like to discuss the business i mentioned to you before ill have my admin work it in god listen to the man admin working it in he said to galahad as he carried cat and coffee away did you ever hear the like of it other business perfume roarke said and legal whatever else he might be up to ive told him im not interested as it would displease my cop ill make those calls for you why is your unit beeping in there is it he shifted his thoughts heard the signal grinned i think im about to land you on yosts doorstep she was on his heels as he walked into his office then leaning over his shoulder as he studied the data skimming over the monitor hmmm on wall screen he ordered and shifting his stance studied the run of numbers and slashing lines what are they coordinates yes exactly this is very interesting computer display new york city street map screen two he did a bit of bouncing right here in the city as well a good cloak a smart move because it tends to skew the directional search when it becomes that finite what do you mean east side to west side that kind of thing she tried to decipher the numbers and ended up frustrated more or less but he shoots back and forth up and down a little side trip to long island and back it gives us a couple of possibilities but the most likely computer enhance grid upper west side ah yes now decode directional formula to street location and match do you see roarke asked eve laying a hand on her neck as the computer screens flashed and changed it appears yost is a neighbor thats four blocks away four fucking blocks yes obviously you and i dont stroll through the neighborhood often enough we never stroll through the neighborhood how sure are you ninety percent sure enough okay i need a description of that building the layout the tenant list security setup that should be simple enough actually i think i own that building think one does lose track occasionally computer who owns the property currently displayed on screen two working property is owned and maintained by roarke industries ah there we are just let me take a look at my real estate files ill have the data for you in a moment lose track occasionally she repeated staring at him of an entire building i do a bit of buying and selling of property particularly in my own backyard he smiled at her everyone needs a hobby he sat down settled in and brought up the tenant list first thats lovely isnt it fully occupied i do hate seeing nice apartments vacant cut out the families the couples those with roommates and all single women the computer acknowledged her directive making her jolt a bit before she realized roarke had it programmed to accept her voice commands the list narrowed to ten bring up application for rent data she skimmed down the new information mentally discarding men over sixty or under forty and now there were two jacob hawthorne computer analyst age fiftythree single estimated annual income two point six million he has the penthouse right yost would want the best digs agreed several years shaved off the age but i like hawthorne do a run on both these single males lets be sure damn sure im calling it in o o within two hours eve had her team assembled in her home office added to the investigative team were twenty special tactics officers and ten handselected uniforms some might call it overkill but she wasnt going to risk yost slipping through a hole while she waited for the warrant for search and seize to come through she ran over the plan yet again there are fiftysix units in the building they are all occupied civilian safety remains a priority the buildings blueprints were up onscreen eve used a laser pointer to highlight each section as she spoke our information indicates that the subject occupies the top floor there are no other units on that floor all elevators and glides will be inoperable stair access will be blocked off we dont want him getting off that floor and taking any hostages this unit has four exits two men from team b will be stationed at each exit team a will handle building exits on command blackandwhites will move in here and here closing off the street to all outgoing and incoming traffic subject is not to be terminated all weapons on stun medium setting she glanced away from the screen to scan faces to judge and measure this is a professional assassin and hes managed to elude and evade authorities for more than forty years confirmed and suspected kills top forty during that time period hes smart and hes fast and hes dangerous containing and capturing him within the building is our top objective if those efforts fail the second line will take him down fullbody armor is required for all team members she turned back used a remote to split the screen and bring up yosts face this is our man you all have printouts of this image be aware that he uses disguises captain feeney will explain edds function in this operation feeney sniffed pulled on his nose got to his feet security cams on that floor will be adjusted to relay direct to base one we have verified the subject is in target area as of thirty minutes ago we will reverify before moving in all the subject will see if he checks his monitor is an empty hallway we cant stop him from scratching his ass and looking out his windows so all team members and uniformed backups will keep to their stations until ordered otherwise ill run base one and with lieutenant dallas will coordinate all movements communicators are to be set on channel three for straight interteam communications theres to be no chatter and bullshit during the operation lets get it done and put this guy away eve nodded detective mcnab and officer peabody along with lieutenant marks and myself will move in on the subject using this entrance all movements will be transmitted to base one and to each team leader any questions she waited again watching faces these were hard men and hard women they knew their job go down to your units and suit up well begin the op as soon as the warrant comes through and what the hell was taking it so long she wondered as the room emptied shed called in the data and request nearly two hours before shed need to tag the judge again give him a goose then she looked at feeney he outranked her and had considerably more tact it was likely the judge would respond to him more quickly feeney theyre dicking with this warrant want to see what you can do to expedite politics he might have grumbled but he walked to her desk link to make the call while he worked she moved over to roarke we appreciate your help with the security cams and the layout this should go off fast and smooth should he thought was a disturbing word as owner of the building i can insist on accompanying you to the penthouse thats bullshit and you know it keep it up and ill change my mind about letting you hang with feeney at base one i know how to apprehend a suspect roarke so dont distract me wheres your body armor peabodys got it its hot and its heavy so im not suiting up until i have to she glanced back her brow creasing as she heard feeneys squawk somethings up she muttered and had just started across the room when commander whitney walked in lieutenant your operation is aborted aborted what the hell is this weve got his hole we can have him in custody within the hour feeney was on his feet now cursing at the link goddamn double cross fucking political double fucking cross thats right whitneys voice was clipped and cold but his dark eyes burned with fury thats exactly right his own outrage and frustration were why he was there in person instead of informing eve of the abort order over communications the feds got wind of the operation i dont care if they got wind of the second coming eve began then with a vicious effort yanked herself back this operation is a result of my investigation commander of data i accessed the suspect killed two people on my turf im primary do you think i didnt argue those very points lieutenant ive just spent the last half hour exchanging insults with assistant director sooner fbi bitching to two judges and threatening anyone i could tag the feebs managed to get your warrant delayed and slip one of their own through ahead of it when i find out who leaked your request to them ill happily kick someones ass but the fact is were out theyre in eves hands were fisted at her sides deliberately she relaxed them later she promised herself later shed beat the hell out of something they didnt pull this off by sticking with chain of command or going through channels when this is over i want to file an official protest get in line whitney told her politics is a dirty business dallas but its my turf believe me ill deal with this agents jacoby and stowe might think this bust will make their careers theyre in for a hell of a surprise respectfully sir i dont give a rats red ass about jacoby and stowe as long as they bring yost in i want to interview him on the french and talbot homicides i want to talk to him before the feds make him any deals im already working on that i have some powerful connections and chief tibble has even more youll get your interview dallas she didnt quite trust herself to speak at least not reasonably so only nodded then walked to the window there were cops down there waiting to do their job now they had no job to do ill tell the team feeney said no it was my command ill tell them feeney whitney said when eve strode from the room i want you to put the best man you can spare to work on plugging that leak someone in communications on our end or on judge beesleys end notified jacoby of the warrant request i want to know who it is ill get started on it he slid his eyes to roarke lifted his eyebrow in question roarke inclined his head oh yes he thought id be delighted to assist edd in plugging this particular leak roarke if hed seen the exchange whitney pretended not to regardless of how this particular event has panned out the nypsd would like to offer its official appreciation for your help and cooperation in this investigation then youre officially welcome may i ask how much you know about these two agents not as much as i will know very shortly they have no idea no possible idea who theyve pissed off i recall you can get down and dirty when youre riled jack whitney turned to give roarke a thin and fierce smile thats true and i will but i was talking about dallas shell skin them and i intend to do whatever i can to provide her with the room to do so when his communicator signaled he stepped out of the room before slipping it out of his pocket this was her collar feeney paced around the room a wiryhaired rooster defending his favorite chick the feds knew it she got within blocks of yost inside a week one goddamn week and shes on top of him they had years and never got close i bet that burns their spongy federal butts i bet thats why they pulled this stinking stunt undoubtedly feeney would certain classified data on agents stowe and jacoby be of any use to you should it fall into your hands unexpectedly and from an anonymous source feeney stopped pacing to eye roarke speculatively might be useful of course doing an unofficial run on federal agents is a dicey business federal offense really as a lawabiding citizen im glad to know such matters are treated seriously now he walked to the window looked down this is hard for her roarke murmured facing her team telling them basically that all her work all theirs gets them nothing that cops have just been kicked aside and told to stand down so the federals can have the glory shes never worn a badge for the glory roarke looked back over his shoulder this is the man whod taught her he thought the one who had helped mold her into the kind of cop she was youre right of course the satisfaction then of knowing youve done your job seen it through and made what justice you can for the dead you know how difficult sexual homicides of this nature are for her yeah feeney looked down at his shoes yeah i guess i know that i woke her from a nightmare last night brought on by this a vicious and violent nightmare he said as feeney lifted his head again yet we both watched her stand here this morning in command of herself and her team prepared to do what needed to be done you understand what that takes and ive come to theres one thing those two fucking federals will never understand her courage he looked back out the window again watching her walk back toward the house her absolute and unwavering courage the dead dont matter a damn to them theyre names and data statistics on discs for her theyre faces theyre people no theyll never understand the guts and the heart in her that make her what she is youre right feeney blew out a breath youre right and thats something to think about theres something else that can be said and will be because ill say it to her myself and to everyone else wholl listen the feds may bring him in but shes the one who brought him down nobodys bringing him in his face set like rock whitney stepped back into the room hes gone chapter thirteen feeney erupted it was a vicious feral and inventive tirade that was peculiarly irish in tone it was that brilliant and blue rant eve heard as she walked back up the stairs down the hall and into the room and she knew they were screwed not bad enough theyre bastards feeney continued but theyre fucking stupid turnipbrained bastards with it tipped him tipped the bloody murdering son of a bitch off with their greedy gloryhunting federal maneuvering so now hes gone rabbit and none of us have a flaming thing to show for it we cant be certain he got wind of the bust whitney began and feeney forgetting rank seared his commander with one violent look bullocks thats bullocks jack and you know it theyve a leak and screwing with our op gave it time to spring wed have him now wed by christ have him now if they hadnt wagged their governmentissue cocks around hes gone eve didnt feel rage oddly feeneys ripe temper kept her own in check she simply felt hollow the government bust was a wash whatever bitter rage bubbled inside whitney didnt show they moved on yost minutes ago he wasnt there did they check the security cams confirm with the doorman or building guards if he was in residence i dont have the details the word is the suspect has fled the apprehension operation failed she only nodded i would like to confirm personally sir so would i whitney scanned her face then feeneys lets move o o the federals werent particularly friendly there was an air of gloom and resentment that spilled through the elegant lobby and glossy hallways of the target building the looks shot toward local badges dripped with both eve imagined shed have engaged in a few pissing contests but whitneys rank his bulk and his cold control cleared the way knowing feeney was still simmering she gestured to mcnab see if you can use some boyish charm to pry some information from the federal eguys theyll have checked or will be checking the security discs i want to know when yost left the premises which exit he used and what he had with him you got it he sauntered off hands in the pockets of his strawberrycolored slacks peabody see if you can knock on some doors without alerting any federals lets see what his neighbors have to say if you can manage to dig up a maintenance or guard droid all the better eve stepped into the elevator with whitney and feeney and rode up in silence she wanted to think the timing had been close and slick yost had solid connections through the fbi through the nypsd probably both he moved fast and he moved well but he wasnt finished in new york fast and well but not far then a hotel possibly she was more inclined to believe he or his current employer had a private hole for him to burrow in until the job was done with this much heat how long would he wait to make the next target because she was focused on yost and his pattern she stepped off the elevator ahead of her commander and found herself facetoface with jacoby his eyes went instantly hot and he shifted to the balls of his feet like a boxer prepping for the next round this is an fbi operation this whitney said moving in before eve could speak is an fbi screwup of major proportions you want to explain to me agent how you and your team managed to lose the suspect my officers had located jacoby knew just where the ax was going to fall he intended to do everything in his power to deflect it onto locals necks and save his own this operation this federal operation has been ongoing for a considerable length of time i dont have to explain thats right whitney interrupted youve been trying to catch a whiff of yost for years my lieutenant managed to pin him down in a matter of days you not only took advantage of the careful successful investigation through my house but then botched it if you dont think youre going to have to explain that agent jacoby to me to my chief to my lieutenant and to your own superiors youre sadly mistaken now he shifted his bulk subtly signaling eve to move on why dont you start with me there were a halfdozen men and women milling around all still in riot gear with the initials of their agency emblazoned on the back in bright yellow eve walked through them and into the penthouse it was already being picked apart by sweepers by other agents but there was enough to give her what shed wanted a chance to see for herself how yost lived richly she thought with deep carpets and thick cushions a wall of glass opened onto the city and boasted a wide stone terrace where artfully arranged plants spilled lavishly out of glossy pots tastefully she noted with blending pastels that soothed the eye and carefully arranged paintings in sleek gold frames the furniture was wood and old she knew how to recognize the quiet extravagance of antiques now and he lived efficiently the disarray was minimal in the living area and was the result she was sure of the sweepers polish gleamed under the dust already spread on a low table with carved and curved feet there was an arrangement of fresh flowers in cut crystal on a pedestal stand stood a single nude in white marble all long lines and flowing hair there were entertainment and communications centers built into paneled cabinets and already being dismantled he wouldnt have worked here she thought no not in his living space amused himself here perhaps but not serious work still she turned a slow circle recording the room on her miniunit she imagined roarke would be able to make the paintings maybe the sculptures and the furniture as well the busy onscene unit took no notice of her as she wandered through a wide archway led her to a formal dining area with a multitiered crystal chandelier and heavy somehow masculine furniture more flowers here a low spill of color and shape in the center of the dining table candlesticks of silver with long white tapers the kitchen was directly off to the right and polished to a gleam she pursed her lips as she poked into the tanksized refrigerator and found it fully stocked as was the autochef both ran to expensive food heavy on the red meat there were cooking utensils in the drawers neatly filed in slots jars and bottles of oils and spices and the various ingredients needed if someone made a habit of actually cooking interesting she thought and imagined yost standing over the huge stove delicately sauteing something listening to music classical music or opera as he worked wearing the snowwhite butchers apron she found hanging pressed and pristine in a narrow closet hed cook for himself an efficient and selfsufficient man or order up one of his choices on the autochef hed set his table with the fancy china in his cupboard light his candles and savor his solitary meal a man of refined tastes who liked to kill she backtracked moved into the room hed remodeled into a hightech gym the walls were mirrored the ceiling high the floor a gleaming solid wood here was a treadmill with vr capabilities a personal aqua tank a resistance center gravity bench and boots and a wall of mirrors with a viewer to record workout roarkes athome gym was better equipped she thought but what was here was top of the line yost kept himself in shape and liked to watch himself doing so she found his bedroom next and here hed indulged himself slick materials sensual colors a gel bed the size of a lake flowing under a canopy of blue satin a mirrored canopy she noted another viewer yost liked to watch himself doing more than working out the master bath followed the scheme of efficient indulgence and there she found his horde of soaps and lotions and oils from exclusive hotels around the world and off it travelsize she mused tuck them into your job bag do you yost so you can clean up after work rape and murder were a messy business but with these handy containers of the best hygiene products around you can be fresh as a daisy in no time the containers were arranged in a tall cupboard according to purpose the gaps between told her hed taken some with him waste not want not the walkin closet if a room that size and complex could be called a closet was sheer genius she imagined hed left in somewhat of a hurry and yet there was no untidiness several slots were empty in the revolving cabinet a number of the stone gray wig stands were now bald but every inch was ruthlessly organized there were a lot of inches forests of suits ranging from blue to gray to black a parade of shirts in tones of white or the most delicate pastels hung in precise order on a twolevel set of bars more casual wear skinsuits workout apparel lounging robes were meticulously arranged across the wide room a waterfall of ties scarves belts hung rulerstraight in their individual areas shoes mountains of them were displayed in clear boxes that were not only stacked but numbered she counted six missing pairs a long and spotless white counter was nestled between the wardrobe bars and buildins over it spread a wide triple mirror ringed by fancy round lights there was a padded seat and kneehole room in the cabinet below it boasted two dozen drawers she opened them at random and saw enhancements that would have made her friend maviss heart swell with joy she scanned labels even as she recorded she knew less about enhancements than she did about paintings she walked out over carpet through archways and found what she was looking for the hub of activity yosts workspace where karen stowe and two other feebs were currently running discs on yosts desk unit he was in a hurry stowe said as she stood hands on hips staring at the scrolling data he couldnt have gotten everything he got everything he wanted to get eve said from the doorway and stowes head snapped up as if shed taken an uppercut to the jaw her mouth thinned let me know if anything clicks she ordered then moved to the doorway through she gave a comewithme signal to eve and was ignored he packed his bags eve continued tucked in whatever he felt most necessary went through his data discs his files wouldnt take a lot of time if youre as anal and organized as he is hed have a notebook a portable a number of nice convenient travelsized units theyd have gone with him too all in all id say he was out the door in thirty minutes on the outside after his source tipped him about your operation i dont want to discuss this here too bad my team ran him down while yours was racing in circles you wouldnt be standing this close to him if it hadnt been for the work my team put into this if youd cooperated like you did eve shot back yeah youre full of cooperation whod you pay off to get the information on my warrant what favors did you call in to get yours bumped in front of it so you could screw this up federal takes precedence bullshit stowe justice takes precedence and if id gotten my warrant in a timely fashion sylvester yost would be in a cage now instead of setting up shop somewhere else she knew it goddamn it she knew it you cant be sure of that i can be sure of one thing and so can you hes gone you fucked up and hes gone hows that going to sit with you when we stand over the next body stowe closed her eyes a moment drew in a breath can we go somewhere private and discuss no fine on a snap of temper stowe pulled the door closed so the agents inside were deprived of the gossip look youre steamed and youve got a right to be but i did my job jacoby came to me with the data on the warrant and hed already done the dance i had a chance to bring yost down to bring him in and i took it youd have done the same you dont know me pal i dont play games and i dont try to rack up points on someone elses work you wanted a big bust and you didnt care how you got it now were both empty and odds are someone else is going to die eve paused seeing the quick wince in stowes eyes yeah youve figured that much out havent you as much as ill enjoy seeing you and your partners butts fry over this foul up it doesnt make up for another hit nothing does all right stowe said as eve turned away she reached out grabbed eves arm her voice was low her eyes miserable youre right youre right straight down the line being right doesnt mean shit just now does it keep away from me stowe you and that moron you work with keep away from me my team and my investigation otherwise neither of you will have enough ass left to fry when im finished with you she strode out heading for the door before she could pass through jacoby stepped in front of her did you have that recorder on he demanded get out of my way you arent authorized to record this scene he began and made a grab for her lapel unit fast and vicious as a snake she snatched his wrist pushing her thumb into the pulse point and twisting keep your hand off me you dont ill snap it off at the wrist and make you eat it pain radiated up his arm paralyzing him but his other hand bunched into a fist lifted youre assaulting and threatening a federal officer funny i thought i was assaulting and threatening a federal asshole you want to take a shot at me jacoby she tilted her chin up in invitation go ahead right here in front of all your friends and associates lets see which one of us walks out on two feet lieutenant sir she acknowledged whitney but kept her eyes on jacobys his were starting to water your presence is required at central to finalize the formal complaint against agents jacoby and stowe let that idiot go he said mildly hes not worth it affirmative eve murmured then released jacobys wrist and stepped back perhaps it was embarrassment or perhaps he was simply a moron but he lunged at her she didnt think she didnt hesitate with a halfpivot she shot her elbow up caught him just under the chin she heard his teeth snap together an instant before he went down she had a moment to hope hed bitten off a chunk of his tongue before he scrambled to his feet eyes dazed she finished the pivot planted her feet and supposed it was probably for the best when whitney stepped between them im filing charges blood trickled out of jacobys mouth as he fumbled for his communicator i wouldnt advise that agent you came at my officer a violent action when her back was turned she defended herself thats on record with a fierce grin he patted his own lapel recorder make that call and ill have you up before your own disciplinary committee before your tongue stops bleeding youre not just taking on my officer youre taking me on and my whole goddamn department so back off before i see that whats left of your career is flushed down the toilet he held jacobys eyes another testing moment signaled to eve to go then followed as they walked toward the elevator feeney examined his fingernails shoulda followed through with a knee to the balls i would have but he doesnt have any then she sobered straightened commander i apologize for dont spoil it he stepped into the elevator rolled his shoulders i have to get out in the field more often i forgot how much fun it could be i want your observations and analysis of the scene on disc as soon as possible lieutenant run a probability on his still being in or near the city and if that comes through positive run one on where he might hole up contact he broke off looked down into her face you show admirable restraint dallas in not telling me you know how to do your job the thought never crossed my mind sir since decking jacoby had brightened her mood she worked up a smile hardly since you do know ill let you get on with it he walked off the elevator i have a number of calls to make a number of ears to burn hes revved up feeney murmured when whitney left them is he yeah you didnt know him when he worked the streets got cold blood jack does headsll be rolling by end of shift and he wont have broken a sweat feeney pulled his bag of nuts from his pocket ill gather up mcnab you taking this into central for now she pulled out her communicator intending to tag peabody when her aide stepped off the elevator across the wide lobby youre with me eve waited until they were out the doors and inside her unit report kept to himself very polite if aloof always perfectly dressed always alone i talked to a dozen neighbors and two guards none had ever seen him with anyone but he had a server droid one of the guards told me the feebs carried out what was left of it he claimed it looked like a selfdestruct covered his ass there a woman on the fifteenth floor one of those societytype matrons said shed spoken to him occasionally in the lobby and a number of times at the ballet and opera you hit that one she said he had season tickets to both box seat stage right he always went solo well put some men on that but hes not going to risk it now no matter how much he gets into that stuff hell know weve blown his cover in this building talked to neighbors hell bypass his usual haunts at least for the time being ive gone to the opera with charles a few times ive been trying to pull it in get a visual on that box but its not clicking i could ask him he goes a lot could have noticed eve drummed her fingers on the wheel weighed considered and ruthlessly cut off a rapid cab run it by him but dont fill him in weve got too many fingers in this pie already without adding another civilian speaking of pie peabody said and looked longingly toward a corner glidecart its not even noon you cant be hungry can too i bet you didnt have breakfast missing the most essential meal of the day can make you cranky and logy and seriously affect your mental and emotional wellbeing studies oh christ eve whipped to the curb cut off yet another cab then gave peabody a steely glare youve got sixty seconds watch me rock she was out of the car like a laser flash whipping out her badge to clear her path toward the scoop of soy fries her stomach was yearning for she popped back in the car seconds to spare and offered eve a beaming smile and a second scoop of fries the smile wobbled only slightly when eve took the scoop and tucked it between her thighs i didnt think you were hungry then whyd you buy me a scoop just to be nice peabody said with some dignity as her hopes for two scoops after all she wouldnt have felt right about letting them go to waste were dashed i guess you want this too yeah thanks eve snagged the tube of pepsi plucked out some fries and shot back into traffic record on my collar eve gestured to it with her chin upload onto hard drive and disc get me your knockondoors report within the hour and contact charles monroe peabody plucked off the recorder slipped it onto her own jacket yes sir you know more about girl stuff than i do scan the record the segment in yosts dressing room deal give me a rundown on the enhancements if its out of your scope im going to pass it to mavis she knows everything anything above discount counter is out of my scope enhancementwise i might recognize some of the brands though make another copy of that segment ill tag mavis o o she finished the fries on the way up to her office pitched the empty container then closed herself in her office she had one step to take before she hunkered down to paperwork and she wanted to take it in private as an extra precaution she used her personal palmlink roarke answered on the second beep hello lieutenant how did it go it went i got to deck jacoby with no official flak coming down on me so thats something i hope you got it on record id love to watch har actually i did which is why i had to deck him and why im calling i got she trailed off as she managed to look beyond his face and recognized the room what are you doing in there she demanded i told you i didnt want any data accessed on your unregistered who said i was accessing data for you listen i do have other business i have no intention of passing you data accessed in other than official and legal means hed simply filter it through feeney first by the way youve had the return transmission from the new savoy confirmation of yosts stay there ive sent the pertinents to you now what else can i do for you she studied him through narrowed and suspicious eyes are you lying about yosts stay in london dont be a wiseass about what youre doing in that room right now if i were id simply compound it by lying again i suppose youll just have to trust me wont you he smiled at her now as much as id love to while away the day chatting with you darling i do have work what do you want all right she hissed out a breath i got yosts place on record fancy stuff youd like most of it i can run it down or try to piece by piece but i figured if you took a look you might be able to tag it faster paintings sculptures antiques youd know if theyre the real thing by looking at a disc i would most likely i cant guarantee as good copies need to be examined in person i dont peg him as the good copy kind of guy hes vain about that stuff like somebody else i know youre insulting your expert consultant civilian gotta get the digs in where i can anyway maybe you can narrow down the sources for the artwork and the jazzy furniture shoot it over ill take a look appreciate it see that you do goodbye lieutenant he disconnected leaned back and examined the data on his wall screen jacoby special agent james the date and place of birth the family data werent of particular interest but he noted jacoby hadnt precisely excelled in his studies hed gotten through by staying nearly dead average with minute peaks and valleys his social skills were the deepest valleys his analytical talents the highest peaks hed barely skimmed by the minimal requirements for fbi training but had excelled in the areas of weapons training electronics and tactics his sealed profile indicated a difficulty with authority and coworkers a tendency to ignore or circumvent procedure and a marginal ability for teamwork hed been cited three times for insubordination and had faced an internal investigation for suspicion of tampering with evidence he was single heterosexual and appeared to prefer the company and services of licensed companions to a personal relationship with a woman he had no criminal record even as a juvenile no questionable vices that made roarke shake his head he didnt doubt the fbi file they were usually every bit as thorough and covert as he could be himself a man without vices was either a dangerous man or a terminally tedious one he bought his clothes off the rack lived in a small modest apartment and had no particular friends small wonder roarke mused and since hed gone that far set his computer to work picking through jacobys case files as it searched he switched the screen to karen stowes data she was the stronger of the team roarke thought and the smarter graduated cum laude american university where shed doublemajored in criminal justice and electronics shed been recruited straight out of college and had completed her training precisely on schedule and in the top five of her class the personality profile on her found her driven focused intense with a tendency to overwork and take personal and physical risks she followed the rules but could find ways to bend them to her needs her weakness was a difficulty with objectivity she often became too involved in a case projecting personalities rather than law she was roarke thought so much like eve in this area he was surprised the two of them had yet to come to blows ambition skill and tenacity were pushing her steadily up the ranks and interestingly he noted she had requested and campaigned for her current assignment on a personal level shed had four lovers all at different times all male the first had been in high school the second her third year of college shed spaced them out meticulously with only one relationship during her first year in training lasting more than six months she had a close circle of friends liked to paint in her spare time and had no reprimands or cautions on file he ran a search on her cases as well then began to skim through jacobys an hour later he broke for coffee noted his incoming data light blinking the lieutenant he thought had transmitted her visual he nearly postponed stowes case files just for a change of pace but even as he began to issue the command to save and close something caught his eye not one of her cases but a request to review a request made nearly six months before shed been assigned to the yost investigation just why he wondered had special agent karen stowe wanted to read and study the details of a murder in paris yost was the prime suspect but nothing had been proven no motive established for the rape and strangulation of one winifred c gates age twentysix employed as a speech writer and special assistant to the american ambassador in paris it was the method not the motive nor any ties to the victim that had popped yosts name onto the top of the suspect list maybe you werent looking so hard at him then roarke murmured but at the victim computer search for personal data on victim cates winifred c working he sipped his coffee listened to the machine hum gates winifred carole female mixed race dob february savannah georgia parents marlo barrons and john cates divorced no siblings visual onscreen is physical description desired no move on affirmative educational background is follows elementary education home study program full scholarship to mossriley secondary education facility honors program in language and in political science

university same dates gates graduated magna cum laude stowe summa cum laude same graduating class ranked first and second respectively hold knew her didnt you roarke murmured this isnt just a case its personal chapter fourteen peabody hustled off the glide rounded the corner toward her squad room and ran straight into mcnab there you are he beamed at her like a boy whod just found his lost puppy after a long whistling search no there you are i was looking for you i just got word the fbis going to hold a media conference theyre pushing to have dallas attend and fall into the spin oh yeah thatll happen have you heard the one about the easter bunny too there was a door beside him never one to miss an opportunity mcnab bumped the handle so far i havent heard if whitneys going to toss her in but if he does i think we should all be there the one our guys had on for this afternoons on hold as he nudged her into the narrow empty maintenance room he nodded just tag me and let me know when and where if it comes down meanwhile he already had her up against the wall so he could chew on her neck jeez mcnab but she wasnt putting up much of a struggle get a grip gonna with one hand he fumbled down engaged the lock with the other he began disengaging the buttons on her uniform jacket mmm shebody you are so female whats a guy supposed to do his teeth were nibbling their way down over oh yeah i think youre doing it she flipped open the hook of his trousers after all if she couldnt spare a few minutes for a fellow officer what kind of cop was she he was hard as rock how do you guys walk around with this thing kicking between your thighs practice the smell of her the feel of her was driving him crazy when her firm capable hand wrapped around him he decided he was the happiest madman on or off planet jesus peabody his mouth found hers all but gulped her down i need her pocketlink rang shrill and insistent dont answer it he tugged at her trousers in a rage to get inside her dont have to she couldnt breathe and her knees were trembling but duty was duty just wait she wiggled away sucked in air then blew it out explosively her cheeks were flushed her breasts achy and exposed she had the wit to block video as she opened transmission peabody delia you sound so official and out of breath very sexy charles she willed away the fog over her brain and didnt notice mcnab go rigid and sliteyed beside her thanks for getting back to me one of my favorite things to do is getting back to you that made her smile a little foolishly he always said the sweetest things i know youre busy but i thought you might be able to help me out on a detail in an investigation never too busy for you what can i do furious mcnab turned to stare at a line of industrialsized cleaners and disinfectants couldnt she hear the snake oil in his voice didnt she know if hed been busy it was because hed been collecting a fat fee after doing the naked tango with some rich and bored society chick im trying to confirm an identification peabody went on a man mixed race middle fifties opera buff he takes the front box seat stage right at the met front box stage right sure i know who you mean never misses an opening performance comes alone thats him can you describe him other than what youve already said hes big more like an arena ball tackle than an opera fan cleanshaven head and face designer blacktie always perfectly groomed doesnt mingle during intermission i had a client recognize him once recognize him yeah she pointed him out mentioned that he was an entrepreneur which could mean anything did she tell you his name probably give me a second roles martin k roles im nearly positive can i have her name delia his voice was pained now you know how awkward that is for me okay how about this could you contact her casually ask how she knows this man that might be enough that i can do why dont i relay whatever information i get to you over drinks later i have a ten oclock appointment but that leaves plenty of time i could meet you at the palace hotel the royal bar say about eight the royal bar she thought it was so lush and gorgeous and they served olives the size of doves eggs in pretty silver dishes when you sat down for a drink plus you never knew which celebrity might drop in for a glass of champagne she could wear her blue dress with the long skirt that slimmed down her hips or id really like that i just dont know if ill be working or not a cops life i miss seeing you really pleasure shimmered through her and had her smiling again me too why dont we do this ill leave the early evening open if you can spare time for a drink any time between six and nine well get together otherwise ill take a rain check and just pass on what i find out great ill let you know as soon as i can thanks charles always my pleasure later beautiful she disengaged glowing a bit beautiful wasnt a term she heard applied to herself often that might be a break she began briskly and after pocketing her link began to hook her bra and button her shirt if he can what the hell do you take me for she blinked that raw and dangerous edge in mcnabs voice was something else rarely heard and when she focused on his face she saw his eyes were glittering sharp as shards of green glass huh what do you take yourself for he tossed out you let me put my hands on you one minute and id have been inside you in another then youre flirting on the link and making a goddamn date with a goddamn lc she nearly said huh again because her mind wasnt quite computing the words but the tone the basic and nasty meaning of them rang through loud and clear i wasnt flirting you idiot or hardly she thought despising the quick vicious tug of guilt i was doing a followup as ordered by my lieutenant and its none of your business it isnt he had her by the shoulders had her shoved back against the wall again but there was nothing sexual now nothing playful nerves jittered up to dance with guilt whats the matter with you let go or ill knock you down normally she would have been sure she could do just that but this wasnt normally and her belly was quivering the matter with me you want to know whats the matter with me fury exploded out of him im sick and tired of having you roll out of my bed and prance on over to roll in monroes thats whats the matter with me what she goggled what you think im going to keep playing backup fuck to some hired dick youre wrong peabody you are way wrong her color flashed then faded it was nothing like that nothing like that as her relationship with charles was purely platonic but shed be damned if shed say so now thats a stupid and a horrible thing to say get off me you son of a bitch she shoved and was as angry as she was uneasy when she didnt budge him yeah well thats what im saying how would you feel if id taken a call from some skirt while my hands were still on you how the hell would you take that she didnt know it had never occurred to her so she swung back hard to anger it seemed to be her only defense look mcnab you can talk to anybody skirts included any time you damn well want and you better crawl back out of my throat over who i talk to and what i do we work together we have sex together but were not exclusive and youve got no right taking pops at me for talking to a source and if i want to dance naked on charless tabletop while i do it its none of your damn business not that she ever had shed never been naked with charles but that was beside the point thats the way you want it hurt was fighting to slice through temper he couldnt allow it so he nodded stepped back that flows with me just fine well good yeah great he yanked at the door cursed because hed forgotten to unlock it and had spoiled his exit he sent her one last fulminating look and got out closing the door smartly behind him she snarled hastily buttoned her uniform jacket smoothed it sniffled heard herself oh no she thought straightening her shoulders she was not going to cry in the maintenance closet and she was certainly not going to waste perfectly good tears over a moron like ian mcnab o o eve was adding the results of her probability scans to her updated report when nadine furst walked into her office the first thing eve did was swear the second was to save and dump onscreen data before the slick reporter could get a look at it over her shoulder what was eves greeting nice to see you too looking good why yes id love some coffee at home nadine strolled to the autochef programmed for two cups she was a lovely woman with perfectly styled dark blonde hair that flattered her somewhat foxy face her suit was poppy red and tailored to flatter a curvy figure and really good legs all of that was part of the requirement for being one of the top onair reporters in the city added to it nadine had a few more advantages a sharp and clever brain and a sensitive nose that could sniff out a story even when it was buried under two tons of bullshit busy here nadine see you later yes i imagine so unmoved unoffended nadine set a fresh cup of coffee on eves desk and settled down in the creaky and uncomfortable chair beside it media conference in about an hour with the fbi on that botched bust uptown so why arent you prepping for it oh with a feline smile nadine sipped her coffee i am i get word about the conference then get a whiff that youre to be involved even as i begin to ponder on that i get word youre out and the previously scheduled media conference with the nypsd is now washed so comments lieutenant dallas none shed spent twenty minutes strategizing with whitney over just that it was a federal operation not mine or my departments but you were there after the fact i got a whiff of that too why were you there i was in the neighborhood come on dallas nadine leaned forward its just you and me no camera no recorder give me an edge youre edgy enough all by yourself im swamped here nadine yeah swamped in homicides two same method which points to one killer if youre so swamped with them and the social obligation of the upcoming magda lane auction why are you poking into a failed federal bust i dont poke thats right dallas you dont pleased nadine sat back again whats the connection between your homicides and the fbi operation now eve smiled kicked back sipped coffee why dont you ask special agent jacoby that question why dont you ask him and or special agent stowe why they took an entire team at taxpayers expense into a privately owned building without first assuring that their target was in residence and you might ask how they feel about the fact that tromping their fbi asses into that building without first pinpointing their target has now alerted that target who remains at large well well i might not be getting answers but im getting some very nice questions did they screw with you off the record they undermined my investigation jumped over my bust then mucked it up and yet they live you disappoint me eve merely showed her teeth i think theyll be bleeding after the media conference i doubt youll disappoint me ah im being used i feel so satisfied nadine finished off her coffee toyed with the empty cup since im being so nice and cooperative how about a favor ive given you all youre going to get on another topic on the auction my media pass will get me in but if i use it im not allowed to bid i really want to bid dallas im a huge fan how about finding me an extra ticket thats it eve shrugged sure i should be able to lay my hands on one tilting her head putting a pretty plea in her eye nadine slowly held up two fingers two it would be more fun if i could bring a date be a pal being a pal can be a real pain in the butt ill see what i can do thanks she hopped up i have to get over to the federal field office stake out my turf tune in and watch them bleed i just might hey peabody distracted nadine flipped her a wave as she dashed out peabody i may not be able to catch the screen for the media conference see that its recorded yes sir then you wont be required to attend no the feebs are on their own she brought her report back onscreen i want a briefing with the team lets make it for sixteen hundred if that suits feeney and mcnab book a conference room inwardly peabody winced but she simply nodded yes sir i spoke with charles monroe though her mind was elsewhere the crackle of ice in peabodys voice had eve glancing over problem no sir he tagged yost and confirms hes a regular patron at the opera prefers opening night of a new performance a client pointed yost out to charles and stated he was an entrepreneur named roles martin k thats a fresh alias good ill run it now whats the clients name charles was hesitant to give me that information hes agreed to contact the client and ask how she knows roles if she cleared her throat because something was burning inside it if that information isnt complete or satisfactory ill press that works for now eves stomach began to clench and jitter there were tears swimming in her aides eyes peabodys lips were quivering what are you doing she demanded nothing sir how come youre going to cry you know how i feel about crying on the job im not crying and it appalled her that she was on the edge of it i just dont feel very well thats all i wonder sir if i could be excused from the briefing at sixteen hundred too many soy fries eve said relieved if youre sick go by the infirmary and get them to fix you up get horizontal for thirty she glanced at her wrist unit to check the time and heard a soft and muffled sob her head snapped up relief vanished and comprehension hammered through damn it damn it damn it you went a round with mcnab didnt you id appreciate if you wouldnt mention that name in my presence peabody said with watery dignity i knew this was going to happen knew it knew it she sprang to her feet and kicked her desk he said i was no eve threw up her arms as if warding off an incoming meteorite no uhuh forget it you are not dumping it on me i dont want to hear about it dont want to know about it dont want to think about it this is a cop shop a cop shop and you are a cop she said it fast and she said it clear terrified as those tears shimmered in peabodys dark eyes yes sir oh man eve pressed the heels of her hands to the sides of her head so her brain would stay in place okay heres what i want you to do go to the infirmary and take something lie down then you pull yourself together and get your butt to that briefing ill set it up and you behave like a cop you save personal business for after shift yes sir with another sniffle peabody turned officer do you want him to see you all blubbery that stopped her peabodys shoulders stiffened straightened no she swiped a hand under her nose no she said again and marched out wasnt that just perfect eve muttered then sat down to do her aides job o o in another section of cop central the corridors were wide and the floors scrupulously clean cubicles were jammed with the best equipment the budget could bear and manned by cops in snazzy suits or in casual chic the hums and buzzes and beeps were constant like music wall screens flashed with images and data in neverending reels there were three holorooms designed for simulations and reenactments they were used for these purposes and nearly as often for personal fantasies romantic interludes and naps the electronic detectives division was never quiet always crowded and painted a brainstimulating red when roarke stepped in he scanned the room the equipment he noted with an experts eye was reasonably good and would be outmoded within six months he happened to know this as one of his research and development companies had just finished a new prototype laser computer that would outpace and outperform everything currently on the market he made a note to himself to have one of his marketing directors contact the nypsds acquisitions liaison he imagined he could make his wifes home away from home a very good deal he spotted mcnab in one of those clear threesided cubes and made his way through the forest of them a number of the edetectives paced the room wearing headsets while calling out data and punching codes into palm pcs but mcnab sprawled at his desk with a brooding look in his eye ian mcnab jumped rapped his knee on the underside of his desk after the obligatory oath he looked at roarke hey whatre you doing here id hoped to see feeney for a moment sure hes back in his office through there he said pointing at an opening in the wall and to the right his doors usually open fine something wrong mcnab jerked his bony shoulders women ah what else can be said theyre not worth it that can be said trouble with peabody not anymore its time i got back to spreading out my talents ive got a date with a redhead tonight with the best manmade breasts money can buy and an affection for black leather i see and because he did very well roarke gave mcnabs shoulder a pat im sorry hey mcnab brushed it off and pretended his belly wasnt full of lead weights ill get by the redheads got a sister were going to see if we can make it a trio his link beeped got work then ill let you get to it roarke passed the cubicles and the pacers and slipped into the short corridor that led to feeneys office the door was indeed open and feeney sat at his desk his hair standing on end his eyes blurry as they scanned data flashing like lightning on three wall screens he held up a hand as he caught the movement at the door eyes still tracking then he blinked save compile and crossreference current data with file ab hold results until command now he sat back focused on roarke didnt expect to see you sorry to interrupt need a minute to process anyway roarke smiled you or your equipment both im doing search and scans looking for probables and likelies on yosts employers on various hits maybe we find one to pigeonhole and we can get enough data to crawl up his back again he reached into his bowl of nuts hard on the eyes hours of this going to need them fixed again roarke tipped his head so he could study feeneys equipment thats a nice unit took me six weeks to hound them to budget it in for me captain of edd and i gotta beg for the top of the line its pitiful your top of the lines going to be a poor second in a few months feeney sniffed i know about your t and m and the upgrade on the tms not that ive seen them anywhere but your and dallass inhome offices guess its taken you so long to get them on the market youve run into a few snags i wouldnt call them snags what would you think of a track and monitoring unit running on a system boosting up to five hundred simultaneous functions there is no system there isnt a chip or combo of chips that can sustain that many functions no laser power that can reach that speed roarke merely smiled there is now feeney went pale laid a hand over his heart dont toy with me lad jokes like that could bring a man to tears how would you like to test one of the prototypes for me put it through its paces give me your opinion my firstborn son is as old as you are yourself so i dont think youd have much use for him what do you want your weight when it comes to negotiating a contract for roarke industries to provide electronic equipment including this new model to the nypsd and after them as many other police and security departments nationwide to start as can be managed ill use every ounce of weight thats in me if she does what you say when can i have her within the week ill let you know he started toward the door thats what you came in for that and to see my wife before i go ive some appointments he turned back met feeneys eyes good hunting with a shake of his head and a sigh of lust at the thought of a t and m system feeney turned back to his own unit and saw the disc beside it the one he mused as he lifted it that hadnt been there before roarke had come in his eyes might have been tired feeney admitted but they were still sharp enough damned if hed seen the boy plant the disc slick as they came he turned the disc over then with a chuckle loaded it theyd just see what one slick irishman had slipped to another on the sly o o in a lovely detached town house of three stories sylvester yost enjoyed the soaring final aria from aida while he finished a light lunch of veggie pasta in tarragon vinaigrette topped off with a glass of excellent fume blanc he rarely indulged in wine at lunch but felt he had earned it he had passed the fbis bumbling tactical team on their way to his building had smiled at them through the privacytinted glass of the long black limo minutes literally minutes before theyd arrived at his building he didnt care for such close calls but they did add some stimulation to routine still he was not pleased the wine had helped mellow him he ordered the music lower by several notches then made his call both he and the receiver kept video blocked and voices electronically altered as agreed even fully secured and encoded palm units could be hacked if one knew where to start ive settled in yost said good i hope you have everything you need im comfortable enough for the moment i lost a great deal this morning the art alone was worth several million and ill have to replace a considerable amount of wardrobe and enhancements im aware of that i believe we can retrieve most if not all of your possessions given time if not ill agree to pay half your losses i cannot and will not assume full responsibility yost might have argued but he considered himself a fair man in business the detection and the resulting losses were partially his fault though he had yet to determine where and when hed made mistakes agreed since your transmission this morning was timely and your piedaterre quite adequate for my temporary needs do i proceed on schedule you do hit the next target tomorrow thats your decision yost sipped his afterlunch coffee at this point however i feel obliged to tell you i intend to dispose of lieutenant dallas in my own time and fashion shes inconvenienced me and beyond that shes come too close im not paying you for dallas oh no this is a bonus i told you from the beginning why she wasnt chosen for this project hit her and roarke will never stop hunting just keep her busy otherwise until the job is completed as i said dallas is for me in my time and in my way you arent contracting for her therefore you arent involved and have no say in the matter ill complete your contract on the table over the spotless white linen yosts fist bunched and began to pound softly rhythmically she owes me and she will pay consider this with her death roarke will only be more distracted and make your job that much easier she is not your target i know my target the pounding increased until he caught himself flexed his big hand no he realized with some annoyance he wasnt as mellow as hed believed there was a terrible anger inside him and something he hadnt felt in so long hed forgotten the taste of it fear hell be terminated tomorrow on schedule and there wont be any cause for concern about roarke hunting either of us after i deal with the cop i intend to eliminate him for that you will pay you succeed with deleting roarke within the time agreed upon in our addendum youll collect your fee when have i ever failed to pay off a contract then were i you id begin making arrangements to transfer funds he cut transmission abruptly pushed from the table paced when he felt the worst of the rage ebbing he made himself go upstairs into the attractive office where hed set up his portables sitting ordering his mind to clear he brought up the public data on eve and for some time he sat studying her image and her information chapter fifteen roarke didnt quite make it to eves office he found her down the corridor in front of one of the vending machines she and the machine appeared to be in the middle of a vicious argument i put the proper credits in you bloodsucking moneygrubbing son of a bitch eve punctuated this by slamming her fist where the machines heart would be if it had one any attempt to vandalize deface or damage this unit is a criminal offense the machine spoke in a prissy singsong voice roarke was certain was sending his wifes blood pressure through the roof this unit is equipped with scaneye and has recorded your badge number dallas lieutenant eve please insert proper credit in coin or credit code for your selection and refrain from attempting to vandalize deface or damage this unit okay ill stop attempting to vandalize deface or damage you you electronic street thief ill just do it she swung back her right foot which roarke had cause to know could deliver a paralyzing kick from a standing position but before she could follow through he stepped up and nudged her off balance please allow me lieutenant dont put any more credits in that thieving bastard she began then hissed when roarke did just that candy bar i assume did you have any lunch yeah yeah yeah you know its just going to keep stealing if people like you pander to it eve darling its a machine it does not think ever hear of artificial intelligence ace not in a vending machine that dispenses chocolate bars he made the selection for her you have selected the eightounce royal chocolate dream bar this food produce contains sixtyeight calories and two point one grams of fat its ingredients include soy and soy byproducts nondairy milk substitute the chemical sweetner trademarked as sweett and the trademarked chocolate substitute chocolike sounds just yummy roarke said and retrieved the bar this product has no known nutritional value and may cause irritability or wakefulness in some individuals please enjoy your selection and your day up yours was eves suggestion as she ripped off the wrapper they stole my candy again i taped it on the back of my autochef two bars of the real stuff not this chemimix crapola they tagged it im going to catch them sooner or later and peel the skin off their face slowly still the first bite perked her up what are you doing here adoring you absolutely unable to help himself he took her face in his hands and kissed her hard my god what did i ever do before you were there jeez cut it out even as the thrill whipped through her she scanned the corridor for eavesdroppers and peeping toms shed be razzed for a week if anyone had spotted them my office happy to he walked with her moved through the door just behind her then yanked her back to indulge in a deeper longer kiss im on duty she murmured it against his mouth as her brain went to fizzle i know just a minute one day he thought he might actually get used to the way the love for her the need for her could leap up and grab him by the throat but in the meantime hed just enjoy the ride okay he drew back ran his hands from her shoulders to her wrists that should hold me you blow the top of my head off she shook it clear pow a lot better than fake chocolate darling eve im touched yeah and this was fun but ive got a briefing coming up why are you here i wanted to buy you a candy bar by the way did you know peabody and mcnab have had a spat i hate that word theyve had something just like i told you they would and its your fault for giving mcnab advice i sent peabody off to take a soother or something and lie down did you talk to her about it no no i didnt and im not going to eve the way he said it with just a hint of censure put her back up were working here you know murder and mayhem law and order little stuff like that what am i supposed to do when she comes moping in here all tearyeyed listen he said simply and took the wind out of her sails oh man in any case he continued amused i came by to let you know i have a dinner meeting with magda and her people she wanted you to come but ive explained youre booked i shouldnt be late she choked back a little sigh if you let me know where the meeting is and when ill try to swing by if i get loose i dont expect you to squeeze it in i know i guess thats why ill try to swing by top of new york eightthirty thank you if im not there by ninefifteen im not going to make it thats fine is there any progress i should know about in my capacity as consultant not much but you can sit in on the briefing i cant im due in midtown shortly you can give me a private briefing tonight he lifted her hand kissed the knuckles shed bruised punching the vending machine try to get through the rest of the day without fighting with another inanimate object haha she said when he walked out then because she could she moved to the door and watched him go the man has a great ass she thought as she nibbled on her candy bar a truly great ass she pulled herself back gathered the files and discs she needed for the briefing and headed off to the reserved conference room to set up shed barely begun when peabody came in ill do that lieutenant her eyes were dry eve noted with relief her voice steady and her spine straight eve opened her mouth nearly asked peabody if she felt better before she realized the danger of that like quicksand that sort of comment or inquiry would suck you right down into the muck of dialogue about a subject you prefer to pretend didnt exist in the first place so she stood back and kept her mouth shut firmly while peabody loaded discs and stacked hard copies of the updates on chairs i also have the record of the media conference lieutenant do you want me to load it no that goes home with me for my personal viewing pleasure did you catch it yeah they danced and they dodged then nadine pinned them with a question on operational procedure like duh you moved on the building without verifying the target was in place so jacoby juggled around with that trying to pull we cant comment on operational procedure and blah blah then she pinned them again with the fact that the target a known professional assassin slipped through their fingers and is now at large even after a complex and expensive operation was put into effect and why did he think that happened good old nadine yeah she asked it really polite too with a sympathetic expression and everything before he could recover other reporters had picked up the hammer they smashed right through and all the spinning in the known universe couldnt get them back on rhythm they called the conference ten minutes ahead of schedule media one feebs zero subzero i guess its not fair to blame the whole bureau over the idiocy of two agents maybe not but its working for me right now she glanced over as feeney burst in he was showing his teeth in what might have been a grin and waving a disc got some data here he all but sang it primo data lets see the feebs try to muscle us off our own turf again we got the arm now special agent stowe knew one of the victims personally how went to college together took some of the same classes belonged to the same clubs and roomed together for three months before the victim went overseas they were pals howd i miss that in the profiles because stowe didnt mention the connection in her profiles she buried it eve felt the comfortable warmth of a fresh weapon in her hand then stopped backtracked eyed the disc feeney was busy loading where did you get the data he knew shed ask which was one reason hed copied the disc onto one out of his own stash anonymous source her eyes narrowed roarke youve suddenly got a weasel who can access fbi files and personal data on its agents looks like he said cheerfully its a mystery to me the disc just showed up on my desk nothing to stop us from using data accessed from an anonymous source for all i know it came from a mole in the fbi she could have argued she could have pressed but the fact was even if he knew the data had come from roarke feeney would never admit it lets have a look youre late she said when mcnab strolled in sorry lieutenant unavoidably detained he sauntered over took a chair and made it clear to everyone in the room that he wasnt so much as looking at peabody she made it equally clear she wasnt so much as looking at him the result was the temperature in the room plummeted the air went frosty and eve and feeney exchanged pained glances you have the hard copy of my updated report we have a fresh alias to hang on sylvester yost she gestured toward the board where yosts various images and names were posted alongside his known victims the location of each murder and the physical evidence found on scene i did a run she continued computer data on roles martin k onscreen youll note he developed this alter ego carefully he has full identification credit line residence but the address is bogus he filed taxes under this name maintained a health card carried a passport we have some of these activities under other aliases but none that we have verified to date maintain and employ all these activities this at my guess is his retirement identity the one hes keeping clean and normal so it sends up no flags via compuguard or any security agency if hes a skilled hacker he may have adjusted the data here and there to suit mcnab put in agreed he is unaware that weve made this match this is the identity we focus on and we make sure we dont send up flags all search and scan on this individual will be level three hell own property under this name find it ill start the search right after the briefing said mcnab ive been trying a scattershot scan on known victims getting probabilities on who might have contracted the hits ive got a couple of possibles but nothing solid enough to move on yet taking a page out of the book ignored by our pals in the fbi we dont move until we know a man as experienced and as efficient as this has solid backup id we spook him he could ditch roles and go with something we dont have a tag on lets keep him confident now for captain feeneys big surprise she gestured and turned the briefing over feeney rubbed his hands together got to his feet and ran through the data roarke had passed on to him mcnab nearly bounced in his seat this is hot stuff peabody spared a look for mcnab now a withering one like youd know hot he was so pleased shed been the first to break the insult barely registered i was born hot howd you get into the files feeney looked down his pug nose accessing official data or the attempt to access is illegal this data was given to me by an anonymous source as its gone deep into confidentials without sending flags i have to assume the source is federal and pigs fly eve said under her breath however the information came into our hands we have it its a tool not a hammer she said scanning faces and watching disappointment form a pry bar feeney id like to arrange a private meet with stowe use this her records spotless and if this data proving she lied and or falsified her official documents got back to the bureau drones shed have a big ugly mark on it along with a reprimand shed be kicked off this investigation and likely assigned at least temporarily to some field office in bumfuck she doesnt want that i say she doesnt want it bad enough to trade as long as you squeeze till it stings thatll do for me youll note our dear friend special agent jacoby while not exactly a birdbrain does not go to the head of the class his profile shows average intelligence offset by arrogance ambition and a resentment for authority you add that all up spit it out and you got a dangerous individual if anybodys going to fuck this up its going to be him i wouldnt mind asking mira to take a look at him give us her take the data came to you eve told him your call now probability results she ordered them onscreen you can see weve got a ninetyeight point eight percent that hell attempt to complete the job he has a rep he wont want it marred hell go for the next target and hell try to stay on schedule the first two came close together i believe the third attempt will be within the next twentyfour probability again goes to ninetythree point six that subject is in the city or within easy transpo distance but thats qualified by the assumption his target is also in the city or its environs theres no way we can be sure of that single fact and due to it no way we can begin to protect whoever he intends to hit next she looked back at the screen so we work on it and we wait on it she closed the briefing detailing assignments scheduling a morning briefing for eight weve got an hour till end of shift if nothing pops by then well call it for the night get some sleep and well start pushing tomorrow works for me but i might have to pass on the sleep ive got a date mcnab had waited through the briefing just for the chance to say it and he resisted through enormous will looking around for peabodys reaction but eve saw it the jerk of shock the initial hurt that burned cleanly toward fury then iced into dismissal iced she thought if you didnt know her well enough to see through the shield to the wound damn it im sure were all thrilled for you mcnab eve said coolly eight hundred this conference room dismissed she kept her eyes on his as she spoke had the nasty pleasure of seeing him shrink a little then he was up and swaggering out the door feeney rolled his eyes and followed followed just close enough to smack his detective smartly on the side of the head with the flat of his hand ow what the hell you know what the hell oh fine great she can rumba off with some sexforhire sleazebag and nobody says a thing i have a date and i get blindsided because he recognized misery when it was staring him in the face feeney scowled drilled a finger into mcnabs skinny chest im not talking about it neither am i mcnab hunched his shoulders and steamed off in a sulk peabody eve jumped in before her aide had the chance to speak unload and file all discs book this room for the scheduled time yes sir she had to swallow hated the fact that the simple act was audible and painful check in with monroe see if he has any more information on roles then stand by in your work area until i contact you yes sir eve waited until peabody had finished gathering what she needed and had moved out of the room like a droid this is really going to suck she decided just listen he says a lot he knows about it doing her best to push peabody out of her mind eve sat down and made the call to the federal building stowe dallas i need a meet just you and me tonight im busy and have no interest in meeting you tonight or anytime do you think im an idiot do you think i couldnt figure out who fed that reporter she eats just fine on her own eve waited a beat winifred c gates was all she said and watched stowe go pale what about her she returned with admirable composure shes one of yosts likelies tonight stowe unless you want me to go into detail over the link i cant get away until seven nineteenthirty hours the blue squirrel im sure a smart federal agent can find the address stowe lowered her voice moved closer to the screen just you thats right for the moment seventhirty agent stowe dont keep me waiting she broke transmission checked her wrist unit and did her best to gauge her time feeling slightly less apprehensive than she might have if going in to face a team of chemiheads armed with laser scalpels she walked down to the squad room detoured into her office for her jacket then out to peabodys cubicle you tag charles yes sir his client met the man purporting to be roles at a sothebys auction last winter he outbid her on a painting a masterfield landscape circa she believes it went for two million four sothebys its after five theyd be closed okay youre with me she started out waited for peabody to fall in step did she have impressions charles said she found roles impeccably mannered knowledgeable about art and elegantly aloof she admitted shed tried to wrangle an invitation to see the painting once he had his displayed but he didnt even nibble charles says shes a stunner a real babe midthirties and fallingdown rich since most men would have jumped at the chance she figured he was into men but when she tried out the chatter you know who they might know what club he patronized and all that he evaded and slipped away from her if shes such a babe why does she need to hire an lc i guess because charles is a babe and there isnt any danger of strings hell do whatever she wants during the scheduled time peabody sighed as they stepped out into the garage people hire or hang with lcs for a lot of reasons it isnt always about sex okay okay well see what we can dig up in sothebys tomorrow that she thought might be something to tap roarke about yes sir where are we going now up to you eve opened her car door stood looking at peabody over the roof want to go get drunk sir i had a big messup with roarke not that long ago that was my choice its a pretty good temporary cure peabodys eyes filled not just with tears but with gratitude id rather have ice cream yeah most of the time given the choice so would i lets go get some ice cream o o eve stared down at the hot fudge supreme in the dish in front of her with a combination of greed and nausea she would no doubt eat it all she would no doubt be ill after the things you had to do for a pal she dug in for the first spoonful okay spill it sir lets hear what happened peabody stared more dazzled now by eves statement than by her own banana boat surprise you want me to tell you about it no i dont want you to tell me about it im telling you to tell me about it because thats how this friendship thing is supposed to work i hear so she dug for more ice cream with one hand waved a goahead with the other thats so nice of you peabody got misty again and soothed herself with nondairy whipped topping we were in one of the maintenance closets sort of fooling around and mouth full eve held up a hand swallowed excuse me you and detective mcnab were engaged in some sexual activity on departmental property while on duty peabody pokered up im not going to tell you if youre going to start citing regulations anyway we hadnt gotten to the actual sex part yet we were fooling around oh well then thats different cops are always fooling around in maintenance closets jesus peabody she shut her eyes shoveled in more fudge breathed out okay im over it move on i dont know what it is theres this thing this primal sort of thing oh ick maybe it was having kickass dallas say ick maybe it was the pained way it was said but the response made peabody grin and didnt bruise her feelings a bit i wouldve thought so myself until we did it the first time was in an elevator peabody im trying here but do we have to go back that far and discuss you and mcnab doing it it puts really weird pictures in my head well it all sort of goes together anyway its not like im thinking about sex with him all the time or even the fooling around part but then something happens and were just you know doing it again so we were fooling around she continued quickly afraid of losing her audience in the maintenance closet right and charles called on my link about the case i was getting the information from him and stuff and when i was finished mcnab got really ugly she filled her mouth with banana and cream and gooey caramel sauce he yelled at me and was like what do you take me for and he said nasty things about charles who was just doing me a favor and in an official capacity then he grabbed me he got physical with you yes well no not really but he looked like he wanted to punch me and you know what he said she wagged her spoon heating up again you know what he said i wasnt there remember he said he was sick and tired of playing backup fuck to a hired dick she stabbed her spoon back into the rapidly dwindling banana boat surprise he said that to my face and how i wasnt going to be popping out of his bed and into charless i thought you werent having sex with charles im not thats beside the point actually eve thought it was the point then remembered her role mcnabs an asshole damn straight i dont suppose you told him you and charles werent doing it hell no eve nodded i dont guess i would have either id have been too pissed off what did you say i said how we werent exclusive and i could see anybody i wanted and so could he then then the bastard makes a date with some bimbo since that seemed perfectly reasonable eve dug deep for something supportive to say pig im never speaking to him again you work together okay im never speaking to him again except in an official capacity i hope he gets a suspicious rash on his gonads thats a happy thought they pondered it and ate more ice cream peabody eve had a feeling she was going to hate this part of the whole support thing the most im not good at this relationship business how can you say that you and roarke are like perfect no nobodys perfect were making it work actually hes done most of the work on that but im sort of catching up hes the only man ive ever had a real relationship with peabodys eyes popped no kidding yep eve thought quicksand okay were not getting into all that im just saying this isnt my field but if i stand back and look at this like a case weve got three players you mcnab charles she outlined a triangle with her spoon in what was left of her sundae youre the connection so each of the other points reaction to each other springs out of their relationship with you mcnabs jealous nuhuh he was just being a pig his classification as pig is verified however peabody youre dating charles right sort of youre having sex with mcnab was mcnab assumes youre having sex with charles she held up her finger before peabody could speak its a wrong assumption and its probably stupid of him not to just ask you whats up and even if you were sleeping with charles youre a free agent but this is his assumption you she tapped the tip of her spoon on one point of the triangle sex both guys so there you are playing wheres the soy sausage in the closet then you break it off with one guy to talk on the link with the other it was police business i bet you werent in full uniform but regardless mcnabs there all hot and worked up and suddenly youre talking to his competition knowing charles he didnt stick to just giving you data he flirted so while youre talking to charles mcnabs growing fangs im not saying hes not a moron obviously hes a moron but well even moronic pigs have feelings probably peabody sat back you think its my fault no i think its roarkes fault at peabodys blank look eve shook her head never mind that its not a fault thing look you start a personal deal with a guy you work with theres going to be trouble i dont think hes got any right to tell you who you can see or sleep with or whatever but i dont think its real smart to push his face in it either i figure you both screwed up peabody considered but he screwed up more absolutely okay okay she repeated after a moments thought i guess youre right about the triangle stuff and the reaction business but hes the one who jumped right on some redhead so if mcnab thinks im going to get whacked out because he managed to talk some stupid female into going out with him hes more stupid than he looks thats the spirit thanks dallas i feel a lot better eve stared into her empty dish put a hand on her uneasy and overfull stomach glad one of us does chapter sixteen the one good thing about setting the meet at the blue squirrel after an icecream binge was eve wouldnt be tempted to actually eat or drink anything in the club club was a lofty word for a joint like the squirrel where the best thing that could be said about the music was that it was there and it was loud as far as the menu the only positive recommendation eve could make was that as far as she knew no one had died from eating the food there was no reliable data on hospitalizations still even this early in the evening the place was jammed spoolsized tables were crowded with orders from the afteroffice crowd who liked to live dangerously the band consisted of two men wearing neon body paint and towering blue hair who appeared to be howling about bleeding for love while they pounded with long rubber sticks on dueling keyboards the crowd howled right back that was one of the things eve loved about the squirrel since she wanted a table in the back she pushed her way through doing a room scan in case stowe had beat her there the table she staked out was currently occupied by a couple who were busy seeing who could stick whose tongue farther down whose throat eve broke up the contest by slapping her badge down on the table and jerking her thumb out of the corner of her eye she saw the group at the table to the left hurriedly stuff their party packs of illegals into all available pockets everyone slunk off the power of the badge she thought and sat down got comfortable in her single days shed dropped into the club on and off most often when mavis had been performing but her friend had moved on to bigger and better gigs and was now one of the hottest rising singers in the business hey hot lips wanna get down eve glanced up eyed the gangly club cruiser with his smirky grin and optimistically bulging crotch when he saw where her gaze landed he patted his pride and joy big sammy wants to come out and play big sammy was probably fifty percent padding minimum and assisted by a strong dose of stayup eve simply took her badge out again laid it on the table and said blow he blew and with the badge in full view she was left alone to enjoy the howling and the color until stowe came in youre late couldnt be helped stowe squeezed around the table and sat she nodded toward eves badge do you have to advertise pays to in here keeps the scum from surfacing stowe glanced around shed ditched the tie eve noted and had even gone crazy and unbuttoned the collar of her shirt the federal governments employees version of casual wear you sure pick interesting spots is it safe to drink in here alcohol kills off the germs their zoners arent halfbad stowe ordered one from the automated menu bolted to the side of the table how did you find out about winifred im not here to answer questions stowe you are you can start by telling me why i shouldnt take your connection to your superiors and get you and possibly jacoby out of my hair why havent you done that already youre asking questions again stowe bit back what eve imagined was a sarcastic remark she had to admire the control i have to assume youre looking to deal assume anything you want we wont get past point one until you convince me i shouldnt make a call to east washington and the assistant director of the bureau stowe said nothing but reached for the glass of pale blue liquid that slid through the serving slot she studied it but didnt drink im an overachiever compulsive competitive when i went into college i had one specific goal to graduate first in my class winifred gates was the obstacle i studied her as hard as i studied anything else looking for flaws weak spots vulnerabilities she was pretty friendly popular and brilliant i hated her guts she paused sipped then let out an explosive breath holy jesus christ shocked she stared at the drink in her hand is this legal just cautious she set it down again she made overtures to me friendly ones i rebuffed them i wasnt going to fraternize with the enemy we pulled through the first semester then the second neckinneck i spent the summer buried in data studying as if my life depended on it i learned later shed spent hers hanging out at the beach and working parttime as an interpreter for her state senator she was a hell of a linguist of course that burned my ass anyway we got through half the semester that way then one of the professors assigned us both to the same project a team deal now i wasnt just competing with her i had to work with her steamed me something crashed behind them as a table was bumped stowe didnt look around but she began to slide her drink around the table at geometric angles i dont know how to explain it she was irresistible and everything i wasnt warm open funny oh god grief horribly fresh still spurted through her stowe closed her eyes tight grabbed for control she took her time now sipped the potent liquor in her glass she made me her friend i still dont think i had a damn thing to say about it she just was it changed me she changed me opened me up to things fun and foolishness i could talk to her about anything or not talk at all she was the turning point in my life and so much more than that she was my best friend finally stowe lifted her gaze met eves eyes my best friend do you understand what that means yeah i understand what it means stowe nodded closed her eyes again steadied herself after graduation she moved to paris to work she wanted to make a difference and she wanted to experience while she was at it i visited her there a few times she had this pretty flat in the city and knew everyone in the building she had a little goofylooking dog she called jacques and a dozen men in love with her she lived huge and she worked hard she loved her job the glamour and the politics whenever her work brought her to east washington wed get together we could go months without seeing each other then when we did it was like wed never been apart just that easy we were both doing what we wanted both moving up in our careers it was perfect about a week before before it ended she called me i was on a field assignment and didnt get the message for a few days she didnt say a lot just that something was going on something odd and she needed to talk to me she looked and sounded angry with a little worry at the edges told me not to contact her at work and not on her home link she gave me a portable number a new one i thought that was weird but i wasnt really concerned it was late when i got in so i decided to get back to her the next day and went to bed i just went to bed and slept like a goddamn baby fuck she lifted her glass again drank deeper this time i got an early buzz in the morning some complication with the case i was handling i had to go in and i didnt take the time to get in touch with winnie before i left it wasnt until the next day i even remembered about it i took a minute to call the number shed given me but i didnt get a response and i didnt follow through i was busy so i shrugged it off and told myself id try later i never got the chance she was already dead eve filled in yeah she was already dead they found her beaten and raped and strangled and dumped on the side of a road outside the city she died two days after i got her message two days when i might have helped her i never called her back she would have gotten back to me no matter what she would never have been too busy to help me so you accessed her case file and buried your connection to her the bureau frowns on personal involvement theyd never have put me on yost if theyd known why i wanted him does your partner know jacobys the last person id tell what are you going to do eve studied stowes face i have a friend met her when i busted her for grifting i never had a friend before her if anyone hurt her id hunt them down if it took the rest of my life stowe drew in a shaky breath had to look away okay she managed okay but understanding where youre coming from doesnt mean you get off free your partners a jerk and a fuckup im betting youre not and im betting youre smart enough to have thought it through now and admit that if you hadnt gotten in the way that son of a bitch yost would be in a cage now it was hard almost painful to look back and face it i know it and thats on me as much as jacoby i wanted to be the one to take him and i wanted it enough to risk losing him i wont make the same mistake again then show me your cards your friend worked at the embassy what did you find out there next to nothing its hard enough to dig under the walls of politics and protocol in your own country try it as a foreigner initially the french authorities put her death on a lovers quarrel like i said she had a lot of men but that was a wash i looked into that myself when they ran for like crimes they hit on yost but after they looked around they put it down to copycat why first place she was clean squeaky no connections with anything that would have drawn down a contract on her and none of the men shed been involved with could have afforded his fee and if they could have they just werent the type she didnt leave lovers bleeding it wasnt winnies style she was upset when she called and didnt want me contacting her at work so i tried poking around there and the best lead i got was that winnied been assigned to interpret for the ambassadors son in some diplomatic deal with the germans and the americans on a multinational off planet project new communications station it involved a lot of meetings a lot of travel and was virtually all shed been doing for three weeks before she died i got the names of the main players but when i tried to slide through and do a deep search i sent up a million flags these are important rich and protected individuals i had to back off i push there too hard and ive got no chance to work on the yost investigation give me the names im telling you you cant dig there just give me the names ill worry about when and how i dig shrugging stowe dug a memo out of her bag and coded the names in jacobys fixated on you she said as she handed the ememo to eve he has been since before we got here if he can give you a few professional bruises while he brings yost down itll make his life complete now youre scaring me eve said with a wide smile as she pocketed the memo hes got contacts hes got sources deep ones you ought to take him seriously i take parasites very seriously now heres the way its going to be whatever data youve got whatever leads whatever angles you send to my home unit tonight for christs sake all of it eve said edging forward hold out on me and ill bury you before its done you keep me fully apprised of every move made every source tapped every thread tied you know i was actually starting to believe you just wanted him stopped but its the kick isnt it its the glory at the end of the bust i havent finished eve said mildly you play that straight with me and if i get to him first ill tag you ill do everything i can to make sure youre in on the takedown and that youre the one to bring him in stowes lips trembled open then firmed winnie would have liked you she stretched her arm across the little table offered her hand deal o o eve got back in her vehicle checked the time it was nearly nine which meant she couldnt manage to get all the way uptown change into appropriate clothes for a fancy dinner get back to midtown and join roarkes party by the deadline shed given herself that left her two choices she could do what she really wanted to do ditch it go home take a hot shower and wait for whatever data stowe sent her to come through or she could go to the top of new york with its silver tables and staggering view of the city in her work clothes sit with a bunch of people she had nothing much in common with get home late potentially cranky and work until her eyes fell out of her head she struggled between desire and guilt heaved a sigh and headed to midtown at least she could do something with the lag time she put through a call to maviss palmlink noise erupted floods and spikes of it that had eves ears ringing even before she saw maviss face onscreen there was a new temp tattoo decorating maviss left cheekbone it might have been a green cockroach hey dallas wait wait you in your car hold on and check this out mavis but the indash screen went blank a few seconds later her friend popped onto or partially into the passengers seat jesus christ iced huh im in the holoroom at the recording studio we use it for video effects and stuff mavis looked down at herself noticed her butt was in the seat rather than on it and hooted with laughter hey i lost my ass and most of your clothes from the looks of it mavis freestone was a tiny woman and her designer lover had obviously spared the material when hed decked her out in what appeared to be three hot pink starbursts they were placed precisely where the law demanded and connected with thin silver chains it really rocks huh theres another on my ass but you cant see it since im sitting down you caught me between sets at the studio whats up where are we going ive got one of roarkes dinner things midtown i need a favor sure ive got video of a large collection of enhancements top of the line junk can you take a look at it and put me onto the retail sources and possibly wholesale too most likely theyre going to need to be replaced is it like for a case i just love doing detective stuff i just need the sources no problem but you should really ask trina she knows everything about beauty products and since shes in the business shed know retail and wholesale right off eve winced shed thought of trina but well look this is hard for me to admit and if it goes outside of this vehicle ill have to kill you but she scares me oh get off planet if i tag her shell get that look in her eye and tell me i have to have my hair cut then shell start glopping stuff on my face and start on that breast cream shes always pushing it comes in kiwi now whoopee and you really need a trim youre starting to go shaggy again and i bet you havent had your nails done since the last time we tied you down give me a break be a pal mavis heaved a longsuffering sigh tell you what send the video over and ill take a look ill get trina over to my place to like whatdoyoucallit collaborate or corroborate either works thanks solid she glanced over her shoulder waved toward the empty rear seat gotcha two minutes i gotta go she said to eve theyre ready with the next setup ill send the image to you tonight the sooner you can get back to me the better ill catch you tomorrow what are friends for eve thought of stowe and winnie and wished she could reach over and touch mavis just make that genuine contact mavis yeah um i love you maviss eyes widened sparkled grinned wow frigid i love you back see you and she was gone o o roarke had decided against the private dining room at the top he preferred the less formal atmosphere of the main restaurant their table was beside the glass wall that circled the room and as the night was warm and clear the roof had been opened to provide that alfresco feeling occasionally tourist trams crept just a little closer than the city ordinances allowed close enough so you could see the recorders and cams busily capturing a scene of glamour and privilege but when and if they became too much of a nuisance air security whipped out in their oneman copters and buzzed them firmly back otherwise such matters were easily ignored the restaurant revolved slowly offering panoramic views of the city from seventy stories up while a twoman orchestra played silky background music from the stationary central core roarke had chosen that venue to entertain his guests because he hadnt expected eve to join them she disliked heights it was the same group whod dined at his home a few nights earlier including mick his friend was enjoying himself and keeping the rest of the party lively with stories and lies if he drank a bit more of the wine than roarke considered wise no one could accuse michael connelly of not having a good head for spirits oh you cant make me believe you jumped overboard and swam the rest of the way across the channel laughing magda shook a finger at mick you said it was february youd have frozen its true as your bora darling fear that my associates would realize id jumped ship and harpoon me in the ass kept me warm so that i arrived safe if a bit waterlogged on the other shore do you remember roarke when we were barely old enough to shave and we relieved that vessel on its way out of dublin of its cargo of illegal whiskey your memorys considerably more flexible than mine though he did remember and well ah im forgetting himselfs a solid citizen these days he winked across the table at magda and will you look at this heres one of the reasons why eve strode across the circling room boots leather and badge with the tuxedoclad maitre d scurrying after her and wringing his hands madam he continued to say if you please madam lieutenant she snapped back struggling to ignore both height and movement the ground for her peace of mind was entirely too far away she stopped just long enough to turn and drill her finger into the maitre ds chest and i do please so go away before i arrest you for being a public nuisance good lord roarke magda watched the show in awe shes magnificent yes isnt she he got to his feet anton he spoke softly but his voice carried and the maitre d snapped to attention would you see we have another chair and place setting for my wife wife anton nearly turned white which wasnt an easy process with his dark olive complexion yes sir immediately he began snapping his fingers as eve stepped to the table deliberately she looked at faces any faces and ignored the view sorry im late after some necessary shuffling and her waving away the waiter by saying shed just have some of roarkes dinner she was able to sit as far away from the glass shield as possible this put her between magdas son vince and carlton mince so she resigned herself to being bored brainless for the rest of the evening i assume youve been on a case vince went back to his appetizer as he spoke ive always been fascinated with the criminal mind what can you tell us about your current quarry hes good at his work but then so are you or you wouldnt be where you are do you have he waggled his fingers as if trying to pluck the word out of the air leads vince magda smiled across the table im sure eve doesnt want to talk about her work over dinner sorry ive always been interested in crime from a safe distance since ive been somewhat involved with the security arrangements for the display and auction ive become more curious how the whole process works eve picked up the wine one of the waiters had with some ceremony put in front of her you go after the bad guy until you catch him then you put him in a cage and hope the courts keep him there ah carlton scooped up some creamy seafood dish and nodded that would be frustrating id think having done your job then having the next phase circumvent it it would feel like failure wouldnt it he studied her kindly does it happen often it happens yet another waiter slid a plate under her nose on it was a lovely little pinwheel of grilled prawns one of her favorites she glanced at roarke caught his smile he had a way of making such small miracles happen you have solid security she said as tight as it gets under the circumstances id prefer youd selected a more private venue one with less access carlton nodded enthusiastically i tried to argue for that lieutenant and my arguments fell on deaf ears he sent magda an affectionate look i cant bear to think just now of the costs of security and insurance or id spoil my appetite old fogey magda winked at him the venue is part of the package the elegant palace hotel the very fact that the display can be viewed by the public before the auction just adds to the buzz weve generated invaluable media attention not only for the auction itself but for the foundation and an impressive display it is mick commented i wandered over there today and had a look at it oh i wish youd told me you wanted to see it id have taken you through personally i wouldnt want to impose on your time nonsense magda waved that away as the first course was cleared i do hope you plan to be in town for the auction i hadnt been to tell you the truth but after meeting you and seeing it all myself im determined to go and to bid while his guests chatted roarke signaled to the sommelier as he shifted to order another bottle of wine he felt a bare foot a small narrow bare foot slide suggestively up his calf without a flicker he finished his request shifted back he knew eves foot it was narrow but long and she was just a bit too far away to be able to play with him under the table one casual glance gave him the angle and his lifted eyebrow was his only reaction as he noted the secret catlike smile on liza trents face as she began to nibble on her second course he debated ignoring the overture or being amused by it before he could decide she looked up the gleam in her gaze wasnt for him but for mick she had roarke realized simply missed her mark interesting he thought as those bare toes tried to work their way under his cuff and complicated liza he said and had the pleasure of feeling her foot jerk like a spring when he looked at her coolly he could see understanding and a faint embarrassment cross her features her foot slid away how is everything he asked pleasantly lovely thanks o o roarke waited until the meal was done the dessert champagne consumed and he was driving home with mick he took out a cigarette offered the case for a moment they smoked in companionable silence do you remember when we boosted that lorryload of smokes christ what were we ten pleased with the memory mick stretched out his legs we went through near a carton between us that same afternoon you me brian kelly and jack bodine and jack bless him got sick as six dogs from it and the rest we sold to sixfingers logan for the prettiest of profits i remember it and that a few years later logan was found floating in the liffey missing all his digits including the extra one ah well mick what are you thinking of fucking vince lanes woman mick acted shocked what are you talking about why i barely know he trailed off shook his head and laughed christ trying to lie to yous a waste of energy you never bought a con in your bloody life howd you figure it she gave me a lovely little leg massage on her way to you she has good feet but poor aim women not a discretionary bone in their beautiful little bodies well now the fact of it is i bumped into her today in your palatial hotel when i went to see the display one thing led to another and the another eventually led up to her suite whats a man to do after all youre poaching mick only grinned and your point would be lad try to keep it inbounds until my business with them is finished first time ive ever heard you make a fuss about a little side of sex but ill do that for you for old times sake im grateful its not so much of a thing a womans just a woman after all surprises me you havent taken a nibble of liza yourself shes a tasty one i have a woman a wife mick gave a careless burst of laughter well when has that ever stopped a man from taking a sample here and there hurts no one does it roarke watched the gates of his home open a graceful silent motion once i recall the lot of us you and bri and jack tommy and shawn as well got halfpissed on home brew and as we sat around the question came up as to what the one thing in the world would be wed want and need most the one thing we would give up anything else to keep do you remember that mick aye the brew put us in a philosophical state of mind on that occasion i said id be more than satisfied by a great sea of money for then i could buy all the rest couldnt i it seems to me shawn being shawn wanted a dick big as an elephants but he was more pissed than the rest of us and wasnt considering the logistics of it he turned his head studied his friend now that im thinking of it i dont recall you said anything made that selection of the one thing i didnt no because i couldnt see what it might be freedom money power going one bloody week without having the old man pound on me i couldnt decide so i didnt say but i know it now eve shes my one thing chapter seventeen since eve arrived home first she made up what she could of lost time by heading straight to her office and sending the transmission to mavis her incoming data light was on she booted it up and began to scan the files standing behind her desk with her palms pressed on its top stowe matched her profile eve mused the woman was thorough and she was efficient the official data was less than shed hoped for but the agents side notations were illuminating been copying the files for personal use all along havent you eve decided id have done the same it appeared that stowe had begun to take feeneys tact of crossreferencing the victims by friends family business associates all of those individuals had been questioned a select few had been taken into an official interview as suspects nobody played out eve shifted documents read on then smiled thinly it looked as though the fbi had run into some of the same tangled tape with interpol as she had with the bureau nobody wanted to share one of the many reasons he keeps sliding through she sat back considered he knows something about law enforcement she thought knows about the bumps and the ruts and the paperwork the politics and the grandstanding he counted on it do a job in one place bounce to another and work there or take a nice holiday until things chilled out again hit paris zip back to new york take in the opera do some shopping contemplate the view from your penthouse terrace while the french cops are chasing their own tails a quick trip to vegas ii a little gambling to amuse yourself hit your target and take a luxury shuttle back home before interplanetary gets the data up she glanced up as roarke walked in maybe he can pilot hmmm you cant always depend on public transpo even premier class you got delays equipment failures cancellations rerouting why risk it private plane or private shuttle maybe both yeah i can put mcnab on that be like picking a needle out of a a hill of needles but we could get lucky how come the cat didnt follow you in deserted me for mick theyre fast mates now he wrapped his arm around her from behind nuzzled her neck shall i tell you how you looked striding across that restaurant tonight like a cop sorry i didnt have time to change a very sexy cop long legs and lots of attitude i appreciate you taking the time yeah she turned i guess you owe me one at the very least i might have a way for you to pay up darling his hands began to roam happy to not that way youre always good for sex why thank you so she nudged him back before his hands got too busy then sat on the desk i had a couple of meets after the briefing first was with peabody that was good of you no it wasnt i cant count on her to focus if shes moping around can i dont grin at me itll piss me off she blew out a breath mcnab gave her a hard shot by talking about his hot date tonight a standard and unimaginative ploy i dont know anything about ploys it hit the mark left her all sad and shaky so i fed her ice cream and let her dump on me now you get to hear it do i get ice cream i dont want to see anything from the icecream food group for at least two weeks she filled him in mostly because she wanted assurance shed made the right moves said the right things he knew more about the lending a shoulder deal than she did hes jealous of monroe understandably jealousy is a small ugly emotion and a human one at this point id say that his feelings for her are stronger or at least clearer than hers for him it would be frustrating is frustrating he corrected skimming his fingers along her jaw as i remember very well you got your way didnt you anyway im hoping it blows over and they go back to sniping at each other like they used to instead of groping in maintenance closets you really should try to rein in that wild romantic streak im not going to say i told you so he laughed at her at both of them yes you are okay i did tell you were in the middle of a messy investigation and theyre trying to score off each other and sulking theyre cops damn it thats right but theyre not droids okay okay she threw up her hands but they better table it until we close this moving on whitney used his arm and got me some additional data on mollie newman ah the justices minor entertainment entertainment for him maybe upshot is she was his niece through marriage a nice impressionable kid who did well in her classes and wanted to be a lawyer the justice was going to help her out there and apparently just helped himself im leaving her out of it at least for now you might get closer after a little chat with her i might but its not worth it shed worked those angles everywhere they would fit and had decided they simply didnt fit at all yost doesnt worry about id so her seeing him means nothing i dont think he touched her not his style he wasnt being paid to exactly and her medical indicates illegals and sexual molestation id hang exotica and the molestation on the judge the zoner on yost to put her down while he did the job i dont need her to build a case so unless it looks like there was some connection through her or her mother to yost im leaving her alone shes got enough to get over no one would understand better roarke thought then well leave her be meanwhile feeney popped into the briefing with some very interesting data right out of jacobys and stowes sealed profiles if theyd been playing poker his mildly interested expression would have pulled in the pot with a hand full of trash is that so dont give me that it had your fingerprints all over it lieutenant ive told you before i never leave fingerprints i told you before i didnt want you veering off the regulations to get me information and i havent no you just used feeney as a bridge did he say that when she hissed he smiled apparently not i can only assume this data received from some unidentified source proved useful she scowled at him pushed off the desk to pace away paced back then gave up and told him about her meeting with karen stowe losing a friend is never easy he murmured losing one when you feel you might have done something to stop it leaves a hole because she knew he lived with that she laid her hands on his shoulders and going back to what you might have done helps no one but youre helping her close it just as you helped me close mine what do you want me to do she gave me the names of three men i want to know about these men without sending up flags its not illegal to look at them looking from an angle that wont alert their personal security is a trickier area but its not against the law unless you break sealeds i dont want that i just want a discreet search if you generate it the feebs arent likely to hit on it if i do they will and if you take more than a standard scan officially on winifreds case file jacoby might clue in might look at it closer himself that potentially exposes stowe exactly can you do it without breaking the law yes but i might have to bruise it slightly nothing that would generate more than a knuckle rap and a small fine if i were the clumsy type and got caught at it i cant risk asking for a warrant again to keep it all aboveboard we havent plugged the leak what are the names she took out the memo handed it over well now as it happens i know these men and we may be able to avoid too much hacking you know them i know hinrick the german and know of naples the american i believe hes set up a more or less permanent residence in london gerade the ambassadors son is also known by reputation on the surface hes a diplomat a devoted husband and father and a spotless civil servant his fathers paid a considerable amount of money to maintain that veneer whats under it a spoiled rather nasty young man from what ive heard with a demanding temperament a taste for group sex and a distressing illegals addiction hes been through private rehab a few times at his fathers insistence doesnt seem to stick how do you know all this he lives high when he can manage it and that addiction and sex are expensive hes been known to arrange for certain valuable articles in certain households to which he had access to change hands lets say he arranged for you to steal property no indeed i always arranged that quite well on my own when i was into such regrettable activities i simply assisted another associate with the transportation a number of years ago lieutenant i wouldnt be surprised if the statute of limitations is in effect then ill sleep easy tonight before she was killed winifred gates was acting as interpreter for these men on what was supposed to be a multinational communications station no he frowned considering no id have known if that had been in the works and certainly if it had gone through with those players i might be out of certain areas of activities but communications isnt one of them is that ego or fact darling eve my ego is fact he patted her arm when she snorted you can trust me on this it was a cover naples is successful in communications but at the base hes a smuggler illegals contraband and people in particular hinrick diversifies but smuggling is one of his favored pastimes and you say naples lives in england now those smugglers hit in the countryside the hagues might have been on him he said nothing for a moment yes he murmured quite possibly its not much of a stretch to draw the scenario that winifred heard or witnessed something she shouldnt have something that rang enough bells with her that she contacted her pal in the fbi for help she needs to be taken out of the mix yost is hired when a couple of independentminded smugglers get a little too big for their britches yost is hired if we can tie one or all of these men into either hit im one step closer to yost she paused frowned why didnt any of their criminal activities pop for the feds roarke nearly smiled some of us lieutenant know how to be careful are they as good as you delete that she said before he could answer no one is okay which one of the three is most likely to have hired yost to off a civil servant i dont know enough about gerade if its between naples and hinrick naples hinrick is a gentleman hed have found another way to deal with her killing her well hed have considered that rude nice to know i may be dealing with a polite criminal o o while roarke used his office to dig for data eve settled down in her own she correlated stowes files with her own ran probables and studied all possible matches yost wasnt going to wait much longer she had no clue as to his target and was still several layers away from shaking off his current cover someone is going to die she thought probably within hours and she couldnt stop it she pulled up her victim files again darlene french an ordinary young woman with a simple life who should have had a long uncomplicated future site of murder the palace hotel connection roarke jonah talbot a bright successful man upwardly mobile who should have continued to rise site of murder rented home connection roarke both had worked for him both had died while on property he owned french had been a stranger to roarke a faceless employee but talbot had been a friend of sorts the third would be closer yet would he come after her she would have preferred that but thought it was too large a leap another employee if the pattern held but one he worked with more closely one he knew well caro his admin that was a good bet and precisely why eve had called in some favors and had the efficient woman under surveillance but she couldnt cover every member of his toplevel teams in the city and if yost jumped to another location to one of the countless offices plants organizations roarke had all over the planet and through the developed solar system the potential targets were astronomical couldnt compute still she tried to level the field to connect the dots through the mountain of data roarke had given her the primary result was a wicked little headache how could the man own so much why would anyone want to and how the hell did he keep track of it all she pushed that aside it wasnt the way if roarke himself couldnt hazard an educated guess on potential targets how could she she went for coffee using the short walk to the kitchen and back to clear her mind a personal vendetta if that was the motive why not go after the man himself or at least those in his inner circle business it was business what were roarkes most pressing projects she went back to his data rubbed her throbbing temples it looked as though he was juggling several dozen greenlighted deals even now it was enough to make you dizzy olympus that was his baby she thought a kind of pet fantasy and as complicated as they came he was building a goddamn world there hotels casinos homes resorts parks and all of it lavish homes she thought vacation and retirement homes villas mansions sleek penthouses presidential suites something for the man who had and could afford everything right up yosts alley she turned toward roarkes office then stopped at the doorway he was at his console captain of his ship hed drawn his hair back so it lay on his neck in a short gleaming black tail his eyes were cool cool blue the way they were when his mind was fully occupied hed taken off his dinner jacket his shirt was loose at the collar the sleeves rolled up there was something just something about that look that always and forever grabbed her in the gut she could look at him for hours and at the end of it still marvel that he belonged to her someone wants to hurt you she thought im not going to let them he lifted his head hed scented her or sensed her he always did their eyes locked and for a moment stayed locked a thousand messages passed between them in absolute silence worrying about me wont help you get your job done who says im worried he stayed where he was simply held out his hand she crossed to him took it gripped hard when i met you she said carefully i didnt want you in my life you were one big complication every time i looked at you or heard your voice or so much as thought about you the complication got bigger and now now you are my life she gave his hand one last squeeze then released okay enough mushy stuff olympus what about it youre selling property up there big fancy houses snazzy apartments and like that marketing describes them with a bit more panache but yes ah he clicked in before she spoke sylvester yost might enjoy the advantages of a comfortable off planet home in a selfcontained community you could check it out his pace of contracts in the past two years is up twelve percent could very well be a push for a nice fat retirement nest best guess would be his roles alias its not an answer but its another link enough links you make a chain now she walked around the console sat on the edge of it to face him youve got partners multinational in the olympus thing investors anybody unhappy annoyed because you get the big slice of the pie there are occasionally bumps but no the projects moving smoothly and on schedule i took the biggest financial risk and therefore will reap the largest profits but the consortiums satisfied returns on investments are already exceeding initial projections she nodded all right heres how it seems to me if this is a business hit the business is likely in new york im thinking if it was business in say australia the hits would be in australia to draw you down there yes ive considered that first hits at your hotel when its public knowledge youll be onsite second hit is in one of your rentals and youre in town and working minutes away give me a connection between darlene french and jonah talbot i dont have one no you do youre just not seeing it neither am i in her mind sheswitched to interview mode and roarke to witness darlene french was a maid at your hotel you had no personal contact with her none who hired her shed have submitted an application through the human resources department and ultimately hired by hilo you dont supervise the hiring and firing id spend all my time doing so but its your hotel your organization i have departments he said with some impatience and the departments have heads those heads operate with the required autonomy my organization lieutenant is designed to run smoothly on its particular internal wheels so that did talbot have any tasks that involved the palace none frustration slipped into his eyes he knew what she was doing sliding him into the witness slot so that he would answer instinctively and she did it well he never even stayed there i checked certainly he would have had authors who did and certainly hed have entertained authors or business associates there for dinner or for lunch but that hardly makes one of your links maybe he hosted parties there you know professional spreads maybe he had one planned no he might have attended some the publicity department at the publishing house generally arranges that sort of function theres nothing on the slate im aware of magdas display and auction are the showcase through the month okay did he have anything to do with that the publishing house isnt involved in the auction jonah acquired edited and published manuscripts the hotel and its functions are entirely separate from she all but heard the click what im an idiot he murmured and got to his feet manuscripts well publish a disc a new biography of magda next month there will also be a publication detailing the auction each piece its history and significance jonah would have been involved in those projects i think its one of his authors who wrote the bio hed have edited it magda connections possibilities began to run through her brain shes a link thats a solid link maybe youre not the target at all maybe she is maybe we both are the auction she held up a hand pushing off the console so she could think on her feet magda lane in residence at the palace your hotel holding one of the biggest events of her professional life there not at one of her own homes not at one of the auction houses but your hotel whose idea was that hers at least she contacted me with it its a media hook he added and its working how long has it been in the planning stage she contacted me over a year ago with the concept you dont put something of this scope together quickly thats a lot of time for someone who wanted to mess up one or both of you to lay things out and winifred case had died in paris eight months before the smugglers in cornwall two months after that then your publishing house is putting out discs what else is there security who are you closest to on the security team for the hotel and auction think it through i want names your publicity wheel too and jesus what goes into this sort of thing ill run it down by department and function on her end we have her son her business manager and his wife shed have others i have those as well well start there do what can be done to protect those individuals she stopped turned back but the pattern is the targets work for you so they get priority he was nodding and already calling up his files on the auction roarke what happens to you personally if this auction is a failure or some sort of scandal rises out of it depends on what the failure or scandal might be if its a financial disaster i lose some money how much money mmm conservative projections estimate the take at over five hundred million add sentiment and rabid fans of magdas the media attention and you may easily double that over and above the fee for the hotel and security i get ten percent of the gross but im donating that back to her foundation so in actuality the money isnt an issue not to you she murmured he shrugged that off ill transfer these names to your unit i intend to arrange for my own security for my people and for magdas ive got no problem with that her eyes were narrowed but she wasnt seeing the data that whizzed by on the wall screen roarke youve got potentially a billion dollars of merchandise displayed in a public hotel just how much would that merchandise go for fenced he was ahead of her there his mind had already shifted modes and taken him back to his past it would be a fine exciting heist the take of a lifetime a bit less than half that five hundred million is a hell of a paycheck could be more if you hooked to particular collectors still the securitys solid youve seen it yourself yeah ive seen it myself how would you do it he ordered the data transferred to eves unit went back to his own to begin the run on olympus property at least one inside man in each area preferably two best to have a plant on my team and another on magdas youd need all data security codes failsafes timing i wouldnt do it with less than six people ten would be better id have a couple in the hotel as staff or guests he turned to check his incoming on the three names eve had given him earlier youd need an onground transfer vehicle id use a hotel delivery lorry sorry truck i wouldnt be greedy as id want the entire operation over in under thirty minutes twenty would be best so id have earmarked the most valuable pieces those i had researched and already had buyers for he moved away poured a brandy id have a distraction but not in the hotel anything out of the ordinary in the hotel would automatically tighten security id have something in one of the neighboring buildings or in the park a small explosion an interesting vehicular accident something that would draw people out even pull in some cops with cops outside the building going about their business people feel safe and secure aye id want cops about jesus she thought listen to him when would you hit it oh the night before the auction absolutely alls gone well hasnt it what an exciting day tomorrow will be everythings all buffed and polished and already celebrities and vips are in the hotel the staffs busy seeing to them asking for autographs discussing whos who and the like its prime time for it could you pull it off could i he looked back at her then his eyes wildly blue circumstances being other than they are id be hellbent to try and id damn well do it if my mind was set on it which is why i dont believe anyone else could because all this ive anticipated already and maybe someone knows you well enough knows your pattern well enough to have anticipated that and so youve been distracted what are you doing and what has your mind been on for the past several days youre not spending the evening checking your security going over the steps supervising your hotel team theres a point he said quietly it hasnt had my full attention but its still solid who do you know who could pull this off besides yourself not many i was the best applause applause who why dont you come sit over here he sat himself patted his knee im sure ill think better that way what do i look like the bimbo secretary no not at the moment but that might be fun ill be the horny executive cheating on his longsuffering wife lets hear you say oh mr montegue i couldnt possibly and make it breathy that concludes the comic relief portion of our program who two that might have gotten close to it are dead proving my previous point as youll note im not there may be one or two others ill do some checking i want names his eyes cooled im not a weasel lieutenant even for you ill do the checking if theres a chance either of the ones im thinking of might be involved ill tell you but not before i see for myself she strode over to him lives are on the line so you can eject your thiefs code of honor im aware lives are on the line there was a day all i had to my name was that code of honor battered as it might be ill see to this and give you what there is as soon as i do for now i can tell you that gerade here wouldnt be able to plan out such a complex and intricate operation hes not a thief even a poor one naples yes he could generate the talent and hes plenty of his own hes a topline smuggler with excellent connections no honor atall and a fine transpo system in the illegal export business if youre looking for links to yost hes my current bet she bit back on impatience reminding herself her first order of business wasnt to catch a thief but to stop a killer all right ill get on him in the morning you need a break you have a headache i dont have a headache her mouth moved to sulk hardly in a lightning move he kicked her left foot out from under her snagged her by the waist and caught her in his lap on her way down i know just the thing for hardly a headache she tried to get an elbow into his gut but he already had her arms pinned besides he smelled fabulous im not calling you mr montegue youre such a spoilsport he bit her ear just for that i dont want you in my lap fine then ill just the next thing she knew she was flat on her back on the floor and under him do you know how many beds are in this house she asked when she got her breath back not off the top of my head but i can look it up never mind she said and pulled the leather tie from his hair chapter eighteen naples dominic j eve began when her team was assembled for the morning briefing age fiftysix married two children current residence london england with alternate residences in rome sardinia new la east washington rio and caspian bay delta colony like her team she studied the image onscreen of a handsome darkeyed man with sharp features and a carefully styled mane of deep brown hair the naples organization of which he is ceo deals primarily in communication systems with the main area handling off planet work hes known for his charitable work particularly in the education sphere and has strong political connections she paused ordered a second image on split screen his son dominic ii is the us liaison to delta colony and is reputed to have aspirations for a higher office dominic ii also happens to be old friends with michel gerade the son of the french ambassador she added the image of a man with lustrous waves of gold hair a fulllipped mouth and in her opinion a soft chin on record she continued naples is dingy but unsoiled there have been in the past some speculations some questions some minor investigations into activities of some of the arms of naples org but nothing that stuck or made a smear my source however reports that naples is and has been involved in various criminal activities illegals smuggling efraud theft extortion and very likely murder hes also our most solid connection to yost she shifted images ordered up a new set of triples onscreen these three men naples hinrick and gerade met in paris eight months ago ostensibly to discuss plans for a multinational com system hinrick is a successful smuggler and though his official record isnt quite as clean as naples it passes winifred gates acted as interpreter for these men during their meetings this com system never developed and winifred gates was murdered her case remains open and she is listed as one of sylvester yosts victims she shifted images again britt and joseph hague deceased known smugglers they were murdered six months ago and are listed as victims of yosts this has been confirmed by the recovery of two lengths of silver wire yesterday by the local authorities their bodies were found in cornwall yost spent a few days in london prior to their deaths napless main base is now london these smugglers are reputed to have trespassed on the turf of a bigger more powerful organization its suspected that they were hit to remove them from competition and to make a point to others who might be tempted to infringe she picked up her coffee shed had less than three hours of sleep and needed the jolt three years ago in paris a female entertainer was beaten raped garroted with a silver wire monique rue she continued as she brought the womans face onscreen twentyfive single mixedrace female was found in an alleyway a few blocks from the club where she worked she had been according to statements made by friends and coworkers involved in an affair with michel gerade she was becoming dissatisfied with mistress status gerade good friend of dominic ii clung to his diplomatic status and issued a single statement through a representative eve picked up the hard copy of the statement and read off the gist he and miss rue were friendly he admired her talent there had been no sexual relationship and tossed the paper down again the french cops knew that was bullshit or whatever the french word for bullshit is but their hands were tied in addition gerade had a solid alibi as he was vacationing with his wife on the riviera when rue was murdered no direct link between yost and gerade was established until now feeney muttered under his breath lastly we have nigel luca and his sheets as long as my left leg weapons running primarily eight years ago he was beaten raped and found with a silver wire around his neck outside a dive in seoul my source reports that luca was at that time employed by one naples dominic j and had likely been as was his habit doing a bit of skimming off the top it looks like yost is one of napless favorite toys feeney put in how do we get him we need a hell of a lot more before we try to extradite this guy is well protected i can and will pass my data onto interpol and onto global you think they dont have some of this feeney asked yeah i think theyve got some of this and arent sharing i also think they havent clicked all the links so we will and meanwhile we dig i need edd to push for more to find every little thread thats out there that may tie naples to our man my gut tells me gerade is the weak link here but we cant touch the greasy little bastard same goes for dominic ii but the second generation here doesnt seem to be as smart or as careful as the first sooner or later theyll make the right mistake long goal is to be ready when they do but unless they make it on our turf its interpol or global well set up flags in edd anything comes through well document it and pass it on good all this applies to our current agenda in that it gives us a potential motive for the two killings under investigation she brought up the chart shed worked out the night before the palace hotel darlene french roarke magda lane the brownstone uptown jonah talbot roarke magda lane the victim was involved in publication projects on lane the merchandise currently displayed the palace hotel and about to go on the block is potentially worth upwards of one billion naples is a thief with a widespread com network behind him hinrick is a smuggler with what is reputed to be one of the best transfer and transpo organizations gerade just strikes me as greedy its the greedy ones you gotta watch feeney commented agreed speculation what if the business in paris between these three men had to do with a plan to heist the auction merchandise winifred sees or hears something off she was a smart woman she attempted to contact her friend in the fbi but was killed before that connection was made why hire yost to kill a couple of bystanders in new york mcnab crossed his legs it was the first sentence hed uttered during the briefing across the room peabody remained silent you do somebody on the site you plan to hit its going to beef up security but wed be looking for a killer not a thief shake up the staff by killing one of them in a brutal fashion right in a guest room frustrate security by sliding right through them takes the mind and energy off the auction puts it elsewhere then you hit again where does the investigation center on who might have some kind of vendetta against roarke that was the motive we focused on but what if its not a vendetta or not that on the primary level what if its just profit its got potential feeney pursed his lips but why bring gerade into the mix i dont see as hes got anything to offer her smile was thin and sharp as she brought up her adjusted chart one shed finished compiling at three am that morning look who happens to be one of dominic iis and gerades playmates vincent lane magdas son theyve been running around together since their early twenties son of a bitch feeney punched the uncharacteristically silent mcnab on the shoulder son of a bitch yeah i got a nice thrill out of it too eve said and did her best to block out the deliberate way the young edetective and her aide were ignoring each other lane contributed to dominics liaison campaign and often visits delta colony both dominic ii and gerade invested in lanes shortlived production company link by link eve said i think weve got a real chain going here to pull off a heist of this size and complexity you need a man on the inside vince lanes as inside as they come hes going to steal from his own mother peabody spoke now mildly outraged and kill to do it hes a financial fuckup eve told her over the years hes put together and begun to put together dozens of schemes and projects hes pissed away his trust fund run through the setup costs his mother gave him twice for businesses hes borrowed from her to pay off loans and i imagine a few spinecrackers too but for the past fourteen months hes been a very good boy working for mama she pays him a ridiculous salary according to their financials but hes all but dead broke his expenses go directly to carlton mince her financial advisor i intend to talk to him and to lane carefully i dont want lane alerting anyone magda included that im looking at him on this she stopped coming to attention when whitney came in shed already sent a full update and all data to him earlier that morning he glanced at the wall screen judged where she was in her briefing then took a seat continue lieutenant yes sir peabody and i will do a dropby on mince and lane at the hotel feeney if you could use your connections through the ircca as weve said its probable the other agencies already have this data on naples and they may have more if they do no matter how speculative do what you can to convince them to reach out mcnab see the head of the events security at the palace roarke will have already alerted him but i want you to follow up youre his general dogsbody until this is over youll be provided with complete dossiers on everyone involved in the security get to know and love them i want the nypsd and this team aware and apprised of every change every step every function of security at the hotel a door guard has a butt rash i want to know what kind understood yes sir now she drew a breath commander he had the faintest of smiles on his face lieutenant id like to request that you use whatever weight you might deem appropriate with your connections in the fbi and east washington i want some elbow room and jacobys not going to give it to me unless she trailed off before she finished the thought which had to do with her shoving his head up his ass without some directive if i can have the room and the cooperation to bring sylvester yost down im willing to give the feds the collar what what feeney was out of his chair his face a furious red his arms waving what the hell are you talking about you dont give them dick you hear youve busted your balls on this done all the work got closer than anyone ever has to this bastard wouldve had him too if it wasnt for those assholes screwing us over if you put in eight hours this week on this one case youve put in eighty you got circles under your eyes i could swim laps in feeney uhuh shut up he jabbed a finger at her you may be primary but i still outrank you you think im just going to stand back and let you pass the baton to the feebs after you ran the damn race do you know what this collar could mean to you every agency on and off planets been after this bastard for twentyfive years you bring him down you bring him in and youre heading toward pinning on your captains bars and dont you stand there and tell me you dont want them i want him more she wasnt sure if she was touched embarrassed or annoyed by his outburst on her behalf but she knew she had to clear the decks you got the anonymous source tip she reminded him keeping her eyes steady on his so hed understand she knew where it had come from without that i wouldnt have had the winifred angle or at least not this soon and without that i wouldnt have had a tool to use on stowe to move onto that paris triad agent stowe put in a lot of hours and grief on her investigation too she gave me useful data i promised her the collar thats the deal feeney i made it and ill keep it well your deal sucks commander whitney held up his hand no point in appealing to me on this one however much i agree with you lieutenant dallas heads this team ill give you what weight i can lieutenant thank you sir excuse me she said when her communicator beeped she pulled it out stepping aside to take the transmission jack feeney said in undertones she deserves the collar at this point we dont have a collar lets just see what we see however it comes down the department is fully aware of the work dallas and the rest of you he broke off when eve swore what the hell do you mean you lost him how could you lose one skinny ugly man with a stick up his ass o o easily when the skinny ugly man also had eyes in the back of his head summerset had survived the urban wars had worked the streets run all kinds of cons and though those times were past he could still smell cop at a fiveblock radius he also knew when he was being tailed ditching that tail was a matter of principle and had given him a nice warm glow of satisfaction though he imagined eve had set the cops on him possibly with roarkes approval that didnt mean he was obliged to comply he might have been out of the game but he certainly wasnt out of shape to assume he couldnt handle himself defend himself on a public street was insulting as it was his halfday off he intended to stroll along madison avenue do a bit of personal shopping perhaps have a light lunch alfresco at one of his favored bistros then if his mood held visit a gallery before returning home and to his duties a civilized few hours he thought that would not be disrupted by the hulking presence of the nosy and pitifully inefficient police the fact that he could imagine with some glee eves fury and frustration when it was reported to her that the target had vanished barely entered into it still his thin face held a mildly smug expression as he nipped out a thirdstory window of a small luxury hotel engaged the emergency escape rode quietly down to street level and strode purposefully to the neighboring building to take the people glide back over to madison imagine he thought anyone believing a couple of clumsyfooted badges could keep up with me he paused at a neighborhood market perused the sidewalk display of fresh fruit and finding it woefully substandard made a mental note to order some peaches from one of roarkes agridomes there would be peach melba for dessert that evening still the grapes looked reasonably promising and he was aware roarke liked to support local merchants perhaps a pound of the mixed green and red he mused plucking one of each color from their varitoned stems the merchant a small barrel of a man plugged onto two short legs scurried out yipping like a terrier he was asian a fourthgeneration grocer his family had run that same market in that same spot for nearly a century for the past several years he and summerset had gone a round or two once a week to their mutual satisfaction you eat it brother you buy it my good man i am not your brother nor do i buy pigs in pokes what pig where do you see a pig two grapes he stuck out his hand twenty credits ten credits a grape summerset sniffed with his long nose im amazed you can make such a statement with a straight face you ate my grapes you pay for my grapes twenty credits enjoying himself summerset gave a weary sigh i may be persuaded to buy a pound of your mediocre grapes for display purposes only consumption is out of the question i will pay in dollars one pound eight dollars ha youre trying to rob me as usual an event the grocer looked forward to every week ill call the beat droid one pound twelve dollars if i paid such an exorbitant amount i would either require psychiatric treatment or i would be forced to sue you for extortion then your lovely wife and children would be obliged to visit you in prison as i dont want such a responsibility i will pay you ten dollars and no more ten dollars for a pound of my beautiful grapes its a crime but ill take it because then youll go away before your sour face spoils my fruit the grapes were bagged the money taken and both men turned away well satisfied summerset tucked the bag in the crook of his arm and continued his stroll new york he thought such a city such marvelous characters everywhere you look of all the places hed traveled and there had been many this american city so full of energy and life and irritability was by far his favorite as he neared the corner he watched a glidecart operator argue with a customer the operators bornandbredinbrooklyn accent flattened the english language like a sweaty heavyweight flattened an opponent a maxibus rumbled to the curb braked with a wheeze and a belch and disgorged a flurry of passengers they came in all sizes and shapes in a cacophony of languages and a hodgepodge of purposes and all of course were in a hurry to get somewhere else immediately he stepped back so as not to be jostled and kept mindful of his pockets street thieves were known to pay the bus fare for its easy plucking opportunities as he turned he felt a faint prickle on the back of his neck cop he wondered had they picked up his trail again he shifted slightly angling himself so that he could use a shop window as a dull mirror to scan the street and sidewalk behind him he saw nothing but the busy and the annoyed and the small flood of tourists who enjoyed gawking at the display of wares on madison but his antenna continued to quiver casually he shifted his bag of grapes slipped a hand in his pocket and slid into the crowd the glidecart vendor was still fighting with the language and his customer passengers were still pushing their way on or off the maxibus out of the corner of his eye he saw his grocer friend hyping his produce to passersby there was a soft whirl overhead as a traffic copter made its rounds he nearly relaxed nearly told himself hed allowed the police tag to make him edgy and foolish then he caught the quick flash of movement instinct kicked in he pivoted his hand came out of his pocket and his body was braced and set for an instant he was facetoface with sylvester yost the pressure syringe skimmed over his ribs missing its true mark as summerset continued his pivot his hand shot up and the stunner in it scraped along yosts shoulder as yosts arm went dead the syringe dropped to the sidewalk to be crushed under the feet of rushing commuters the men were shoved hard together held there a moment like longlost lovers then pushed roughly apart by the stream fighting to pour onto the bus before the doors slammed shut summersets vision blurred at the edges tried to narrow down to a slit he fought to clear it to keep his balance and would certainly have gone down if the press of bodies hadnt kept him upright on rubbery knees he tried to lunge forward the faint buzzing in his ears was like an awakening nest of hornets his body moved too slowly as through syrup and his hand still gripping the stunner missed yost took down a shocked and innocent tourist from utah and had his terrified wife screaming for the police as summerset stumbled clear he could do nothing but watch yost one arm dangling uselessly rush for the corner and disappear he managed two steps in pursuit before the world went gray and he went down hard on his knees when he was hauled to his feet he struggled weakly sick are you sick the grocer dragged him clear quickly stuffing the illegal stunner back in summersets pocket you need to sit down walk you need to walk with me through the wash of noise in his head summerset recognized the familiar voice yes his tongue was thick and the words slurred like a drunks yes thank you the next thing he remembered clearly was sitting in a small room crowded with crates and boxes and smelling like ripe bananas the grocers wife a pretty woman with smooth golden cheeks was holding a glass of water to his lips he shook his head tried to take stock of his reaction and pinpoint the kind of tranq yost had managed to get into him a small dose he thought but powerful enough to cause dizziness mild nausea and weakening of the limbs i beg your pardon he said as clearly as he could manage could i trouble you for some wakeup or one of the generic brands of its kind i require a stimulant you look very ill she said kindly ill call for the mts no no i dont require the medical technicians i have some training i simply need a stimulant the grocer spoke softly in korean to his wife she sighed passed him the water and left the room she will get you what you need the grocer crouched so that he could study summersets glassy eyes i saw the man you fought with you got him but not too good he got you better i think i dispute that then on an oath summerset was forced to lower his head between his knees you got the bystander best of all hes out flat amusement filtered through his voice the copsll be looking for you and you ruined my lovely grapes my grapes i paid for them o o eve shrugged into her jacket kicked her desk and tried to decide if she should alert roarke that summerset had as roarke had predicted shaken her police tag the hell with it she thought she had to get into the field she was dumping the problem of summerset into roarkes lap even as she stepped toward the link the problem walked into her office what the hell are you doing here believe me lieutenant this visit is every bit as distasteful for me as it is for you summerset glanced around her cramped office skimmed his elegant gaze over her stingy window her lumpy chair sniffed no i see it could never be as distasteful for you she walked around him shut her door with a badtempered slam you ditched my men i may have to live under the same roof as a cop but i certainly am not obliged to have them following me around on my free time he sneered feeling much more like himself again they were inept and obvious if you were going to insult me the least you could have done was engage adequately trained individuals she wasnt going to argue shed plucked two of the best available trackers and both of them had already taken a lashing from the sharpest edge of her tongue if youre here to file a citizens complaint see the desk sergeant im busy im here against my best judgment to give a statement i prefer discussing this with you under the circumstances i dont wish to trouble roarke trouble him her gut clenched what happened he glanced at the choice of seats again sighed then opted to give his statement standing he had to give her credit after one explosive oath she fell silent she listened her eyes narrowed flat as a sharks and just as ruthless when he was done giving what he felt was an admirably concise and thorough statement she hammered him with questions over points hed never considered yes he habitually stopped at that market at that time on his halfday he most often observed the maxibus stop there as he enjoyed the rough ballet so to speak of passengers yost had come up behind him slightly to the left side yes he himself was righthanded yost had been wearing a sandy wig a brush cut military style and a pearl gray overcoat light material though it had been warm enough to go without a topcoat the stunner had brushed yost on his right shoulder causing him to drop the syringe before the full dose could be administered it had apparently caught the bystander midchest but he was recovering well from that and the minor scrapes and bruises received on his trip down to the sidewalk does anyone know you were carrying an illegal weapon the grocer otherwise i told the beat droid yost had the stunner and had attempted to attack me with it and hit the unfortunate man from utah instead i did however give the mans wife my card so that all medical expenses could be sent to me it was the least i could do the least you could have done was let me and my men do our jobs if you hadnt ditched the tag we might have nabbed him when he went for you perhaps summerset said evenly if you had been courteous enough to discuss your plans that involved me with me rather than sneak behind my back i might have cooperated my ass quite correct but we never explored the possibility as it is i managed to defend myself quite satisfactorily made him extremely uncomfortable it cost me some minor embarrassment and ten dollars worth of overpriced grapes you think this is a joke is this a fucking joke his jaw tightened no lieutenant i dont if i found it even marginally amusing i would not be in a police station but i am here voluntarily and have given you a statement in the hopes this information may in some way assist you in your investigation you can assist me in my investigation by sitting your tight ass down until i arrange for a blackandwhite to take you home i will not ride in a police vehicle you damn well will youre a known target ive got enough to worry about without having you dance around the city with a bullseye on your butt from this moment on youll do exactly what i tell you or ill she broke off as her door opened and roarke came in oh yeah come right in dont bother to knock its old home week eve was all he said brushing a hand over her arm but his eyes were riveted to summersets face are you all right yes of course should have known summerset thought with a vicious tug of guilt he should have known roarke would learn of the incident almost before it was over ive just given the lieutenant my statement of the events i intended to contact you when i returned home did you roarke murmured one of the mts called to the scene recognized you when you checked on an injured man he managed to pass the word up to me before you did im sorry i had hoped to reassure you that there was no harm done as you can see i was unhurt do you think im going to tolerate this roarke spoke softly in a tone that warned eve the teeth of temper were ready to snap and bite theres nothing to tolerate its done and over her eyebrows went up it was the voice of a patient father chastising a son her gaze cut to roarke saw the temper shimmer all right over and done ive made arrangements for you to have a holiday you have the next two weeks off i suggest you use the chalet in switzerland its one of your favorites its not convenient for me to holiday at the moment thank you all the same pack what you need your transpo will be ready in two hours im not leaving i want you out of the city and now if the chalet doesnt suit you go where you like but you will go i have no intention of going anywhere fuck it youre fired very well i will remove my belongings and book a hotel until oh shut up both of you shut the hell up she fisted her hands in her hair yanked fiercely just my luck you finally say the words ive been waiting over a year to hear and i cant do my happy dance you expect him to put his tail between his skinny legs and hide she demanded of roarke you think when youre in the middle of this kind of mess hes just going to bop over to switzerland and yodel or whatever the hell they do there you of all people should understand why its necessary to remove him from immediate danger yost missed hell be angry his pride in his work will be damaged hell come in again and harder which is why summerset will be escorted home to that fortress we live in and stay there in protective custody until i say different i will not agree to such i said shut up she rounded on summerset taking one step that put her directly between both furious men she could all but feel the bullets of heat and rage shooting out of each of them do you want him sick with worry over you do you want him grieving if you make a mistake and something happens to you maybe your prides too big for you to swallow comfortably pal but its not too big for me to shove down your throat youre both going to do what i tell you or im charging you she drilled a finger into summersets chest with carrying a concealed and you she whipped around to roarke and gave him the same treatment with interfering with a police procedure ill toss you in a cage together and let you fight it out while i finish the damn job but what i wont do is stand here and listen to the pair of you bicker like a couple of kids roarke gripped her arm fingers digging in like vises before he found some tattered threads of control saying nothing he turned and walked out well wasnt that fun lieutenant shut up just shut the hell up a minute she stalked to her window stared out hard youre the only thing he brought with him from the past that he values emotion wavered over summersets face suddenly even his bones felt weary he lowered himself into her chair ill give you my full cooperation lieutenant shall i wait here while you arrange my transportation heres fine lieutenant he said before she reached the door their eyes met it isnt just pride i cant leave him hes hes mine i know it she let out a sigh ill get a couple of guys in soft clothes in an unmarked to take you home that should take some of the sting out of it she opened the door and turned back with a sneer to steady them both next time he fires you pal im doing laps in champagne chapter nineteen eve dealt with the transportation assigned a couple of uniforms to head over to madison and interview shopkeepers who might have seen yost flee the scene though she didnt put out much hope it would lead to anything she ordered them to hunt up the maxibus driver for a statement then she gathered up peabody and went down to the garage hell stay put summerset yeah hell stay put if i doubted it id lock him up right now im more worried about well hmmm she finished when she saw the object of her concern leaning against the side of her vehicle i have a feeling im going to need a minute here peabody god he looks so sexy when hes pissed can i watch stand a minimum of five parking slots away back turned she took one step forward record off she added and heard her aide mutter party pooper youre loitering ace eve said to roarke get moving or ill call garage security i want him out of the country his voice was a whip slashing clean even you cant always have what you want and youre the last person id have expected to stand in my way on this yeah and im not real thrilled about it summerset is now a material witness he stays in the city in protective custody end of story fuck your protective custody your cops couldnt manage to stay on him for six blocks do you think id trust them with him now dont you mean trust me apparently it comes to the same that slash hurt cutting deep across the belly youre right it does and i let you down im sorry emotion violent and hot sprang into his eyes she braced for them prepared to let him blast at her until hed cleared out the turmoil instead he turned away rested his hands on the roof of her vehicle god would you stand there and let me slap at you have i gone that far over youve done it for me plenty of times point is i picked the men to trail him and they lost him so its on me thats bullshit no thats chain of command just like you figuring because hes yours what almost happened to him is on you once we both swallow that we move to the next stage roarke she started to touch his shoulder then stuck her hand in her pocket dont ask or expect him to do what you wouldnt do yourself im not happy about what happened this morning but when it comes down to it he handled himself lets give him credit for it and get back on track they would know hes important to me what the loss of him in that way would do for the money and the thrill well ive done my share of dirty deeds for the money and the thrill she waited a moment is that an irish thing deciding maybe bad stuff happens because youve been bad he gave a halflaugh turned back to her more a catholic one i suppose it springs up at the most unexpected moments no matter how far you stray no i dont think this is payment for my past but i do think its crept in from it and has to be dealt with and deal with it he would no matter how hurtful that might be what arent you telling me when i know for certain i will tell you eve you didnt let me down i had no right to make you think otherwise its all right at least i got to be there when you fired summerset maybe you could wait a couple of weeks then do it again for real he smiled trailed his fingertips over the ends of her hair then his gaze shifted up and over as the elevator opened summerset stepped out between two plainclothes cops eve gave a little sigh as she watched the men lock eyes there were things between them she would never fully understand but i guess right now youd better go talk to him and do that manly makeup deal lieutenant yeah what give me a kiss why should i because i need it she rolled her eyes for form but rose onto her toes and touched her mouth to his they got security cams in here so thats all you get ive got places to go peabody still she waited until roarke had crossed the garage walked up the line of unmarked vehicles to summerset theyre like family huh peabody said as she got into the car hey that makes you sort of like summersets daughterinlaw horror drained all color from eves cheeks all she could do was press a hand to her stomach jesus i feel sick o o the minces were staying in what the hotel called their executive suite luxury level this meant the room was large airy and separated into sitting room and bedrooms by a fancy latticed screen that bloomed with flowering vines a corner of the sitting room was efficiently arranged into a minioffice area with a communication and data system built into a trim console so those executives fortunate enough to be able to afford the accommodations could work in style mince had obviously been doing just that when eve interrupted him the console was humming discreetly and there was a pot of coffee sitting on the refreshment extension oh lieutenant id forgotten you were coming i appreciate you agreeing to speak with me of course of course its not a problem at all he gave the suite a distracted look seemed mildly surprised to find all in place im afraid i tend to bury myself in work once i begin poor minnie despairs of me i think she said she was going out to shop or was it the beauty salon did you want to speak to her as well i can always arrange for that another time let me get you something the coffees probably fresh i think minnie plunked it down for me before she left thanks she agreed because it would keep things informal then sat on one of the pretty chairs while he fussed with cups and for you officer if its no trouble not at all not at all such a wonderful hotel everything you could possibly need or want right at your fingertips i have to admit when magda had the brainstorm to hold the event here i wasnt happy ive certainly changed my mind she was set on it ummm she wanted the auction in new york she had her first professional role onstage here though she made her true mark in film shes never forgotten it was broadway that gave her the first break youve been together you and magda a long time longer than either of us would like to remember like family eve said remembering peabodys statement oh yes very much like family all the ups and downs and the byways he said as he brought over the coffee weve stood up for each other at weddings held onto each other at funerals paced the floors for each other at births im godfather to her son shes a magnificent woman im honored to be her friend eve said nothing while he took his seat friends can be protective of friends sometimes too protective he gave her a puzzled expression i dont follow you does she know just how big a financial hole vincent lane is in this time i dont discuss the personal lives of my friends lieutenant and as magdas manager would hardly discuss her finances or those of her son with the police even if discussing it might save her considerable grief im not a reporter mr mince im not here for gossip im concerned with the security of your friend and her belongings i hardly see what vinces financial position has to do with security youve bailed him out before havent you one or the other of you and you keep bailing him out he sinks again consider this his main meal ticket his mother is about to give away upwards of a billion dollars how does that sit with him she caught the flicker in his gaze before he looked away i hardly see what mr mince i can get warrants i can oblige you to come into interview and ask these questions on the record i dont want to do that for a number of reasons one of those reasons is my husband has a great deal of admiration and affection for your friend im thinking of him and of her and what it could mean to both of them if theres any scandal with this auction surely you dont think vince means to cause any trouble he wouldnt dare does she know his current financial situation mince seemed to sink in his chair worry creased his forehead as he set his coffee aside no i havent told her this time she thinks hes turned over a new leaf shes so thrilled that hes taken such a personal interest in her foundation in the auction he trailed off looked back at eve horrified then he shook his head but no no theres nothing he can do at this point to stop the event from going through its done as far as the end result all the paperwork is filed the proceeds go to the foundation thats locked in he cant stop it it doesnt matter that he was against it initially he tried to stop it mince rose paced the room his palms pressed together as he tried to think it through yes yes he argued bitterly against it she was giving away his inheritance his birthright they had a terrible row over it shed reached the end of her rope with him told him it was time he worked for a living and that she would not again sail to his rescue with money to plug the holes he kept digging in his life she said one of the benefits of the foundation would be that she couldnt just pass him the money she was setting it up that way for him for herself and for those who needed a helping hand what happened to turn him around i dont know he lifted his hands spread his fingers he walked out on her furious brought her to tears and she doesnt shed them lightly he was out of contact for over two weeks none of us knew where he was then he came back head bowed full of contrition he said she was right of course that he was sorry and ashamed and wanted to do everything he could to make her proud of him you didnt believe him did you he opened his mouth then let out a sigh not for a minute but she did she adores vince even as she despairs of him she was so thrilled when he asked to work on the event and it seemed for a time hed meant everything he said then the bills began coming in again i had them transferred to me directly to try to spare her i talked to him paid them talked to him paid them then i threatened to go to magda he broke down begged me not to promised it would be the last time when was that just before we came out east he has been on his best behavior since but he glanced back toward the data center a number of new bills have just come in today im at my wits end have any of the bills youve paid since his confrontation with his mother included transportation fees to delta colony or to paris mince folded his lips into a tight line both he has friends in those places i cant say i completely approve though they do come from good families theres a wildness to them a carelessness vinces debts always go deeper when hes in contact with dominic ii naples or michel gerade mr mince can i have your permission to see the bills that came due this morning lieutenant i dont even share such matters with my wife youre asking me to breach a trust no im asking to help you keep one she got to her feet would vince lane hurt his mother for financial gain physically harm magda no no of course not thats completely out of the question there are other ways beyond the physical minces lips trembled yes yes there are and yes im afraid he would he loves her in his way he loves her very much but he ill bring up the data for you it took eve less than thirty seconds to spot what she was looking for naples communications one million dollars horrible mince said from behind her vince has no need for a system of that complexity i cant imagine what he was thinking i can eve murmured o o you think hell stick to his word about not telling magda or lane about this peabody asked as they took the elevator up to lanes floor yeah at least for the time being long enough anyway to give us a shot at him and his pals screwing over his own mother thats the lowest i think murder beats that out they walked down the quiet hall rang the bell beside one of the glossy double doors lane opened the door himself he was dressed casually in a spring sweater and trousers his feet were bare and he wore a trendy sports wrist unit he had a wide perfect smile eve how nice to see you again or if youre here to discuss police business perhaps i should call you lieutenant since im here to talk over some points about the auction you decide he laughed gestured her inside i cant tell you how glad i am that youre taking an interest it really settles my mothers mind please sit be comfortable liza company lanes suite was several snazzy steps up from the minces suite the living area flowed in a wide curve toward a formal dining area chandeliers glimmered overhead a snowwhite piano held court in a corner a winding gold ribbon of open stairs led to a second level and down them brilliantly beautiful in a skinsuit as white as the piano glided liza eve didnt think the glitters at her ears her wrists her neck and her ankles were manmade how much did those set you back vinnie old pal she wondered hello liza gave a pouty little smile and fluffed her hair sorry to interrupt your day eve said pleasantly id hoped to confer with vince over a few auction details the nypsd wants to be certain ms lanes event goes smoothly liza stifled a yawn ill be glad when its over its all anyone wants to talk about it must be tedious for you well it is if thats all youre going to talk about i think ill go out and do some shopping sorry to chase you off this shouldnt take very long eve said why dont i meet you obviously anxious to placate vince moved to her ran his hands up her arms lets say twelvethirty at rendezvous well have lunch maybe the corners of her mouth turned up and she trailed a finger down the middle of his chest you know how i love to be with you baby doll dont be late i wont she picked up a handbag from the table by the door blew lane kisses and strolled out all the business and security and publicity work over the past few days has been boring for her lane said shes been awfully patient yeah a real trooper eve wandered to one of the three antique sofas sat on an arm of silk youre very involved with the auction and your mothers foundation takes up a lot of your time that it does but its worth it no problem seeing her chuck a billion dollars out the window all for a good cause he said cheerfully i couldnt be more proud of her really even when youre flat broke and siphoning off loans for debts from her friends she waited a beat while his body jerked wow vince youre a hell of a sport i dont know what youre talking about and i find your comments in very bad taste i find plots to steal from family and charity in very bad taste i find little skunks whore too lazy to work for a living in very bad taste but most of all i find murder in very bad taste your guy missed his target this morning by the way you want to make sure he doesnt collect the rest of his fee on that portion of the contract i want you to leave he pointed a finger at the door in what would have been a dramatic gesture if his arm hadnt trembled i want you to get out i intend to report this behavior to your superiors i intend to consult my attorney i intend why dont you shut up you miserable excuse for a humanoid peabody record on yes sir vincent lane eve began you have the right to remain silent youre arresting me the color that had drained from his cheeks bloomed back violently you think you can arrest me you have no cause you have no case you have nothing on me whatsoever do you know who i am yeah i know who you are youre scum now youre going to sit down while i read you the rest of your rights and obligations then youre going to sit there and answer my questions because if you dont im going to haul you downtown into interview and somehow along the way the medias going to get wind of it by the time youre supposed to be meeting your girlfriend for lunch itll be all over the screen how vince lane has been arrested for suspicion of conspiracy to commit grand larceny conspiracy to transfer stolen goods and a whole bunch of other fun little conspiracies too topped off with the whopper conspiracy to commit murder murder youre crazy youve lost your mind i never killed anyone im calling my lawyer you do that eve spoke mildly and stretched out her legs you go right on and do that wonder how long itll take your friends gerade and naples to find out youre hiring a rep to defend you in a murder case wonder how long after that theyll sic yost on you to cover their own hides or maybe they wont have to hire him she paused studying her nails as lane stood frozen by his link yeah im thinking hell do this one for free hes got his own hide to protect you know what he does to his victims vinnie she lifted her eyes then locked on his without an ounce of pity he breaks them to pieces then he makes sure theyre conscious when he rapes them ive got a video i can show you of how hed take on a man like you snap your arm like a twig pound your face into mush so even your mother wouldnt know you then when you think it cant get worse hed buttfuck you and the pain of all of that is so huge so impossible you cant believe its real its like some horrible nightmare some personal hell that opened up and swallowed you whole and you wont be able to get out of it get away from it not until he slips that wire around your neck and pulls it tighter and your feet hammer on the floor you die pissing yourself she got up come to think of it thats just about the perfect end for you go ahead and call your lawyer lets get it started no one was supposed to get hurt tears spurted from his eyes spilled down his face its not my fault it never is with people like you she pointed to the sofa sit down and tell me why youre not to blame o o i needed money he rubbed his eyes then glugged the water peabody had brought to him mother got this insane idea to auction off her things so many of her things and just give it away this damn foundation idea of hers im her son he shot her a glance that begged for pity why should she give all that money to strangers when i need it so you needed to figure a way to keep it in the family we argued she said she was cutting me off shed said that before but i thought this time she might have meant it i was so angry shes my mother he said looking to eve for understanding you went to see your friends needed to blow off steam i went to see dom you wouldnt catch his father shoveling money to strangers like this dom never has to worry how hes going to pay a fucking bill we were just talking having a few drinks i said something like i should just take the stuff sell it myself and see how she liked it we were just talking about how it could be done just talk then it started looking like maybe it could be done hundreds of millions of dollars id never have to worry again i could live the way i chose with no one to answer to i guess i got pretty drunk i passed out and the next thing i know its morning and doms talked to his old man it just started rolling we got michel went down to see him and talk about it it still seemed unreal you know just like a game but doms old man he said we could do it he knew how to set it up wed each take a percentage after expenses it was business thats all nobody said anything about murder just business when did yost come into the mix i dont know i swear to god we had it planned out i was to go back make it up with my mother and ask to help out get involved in the setup so i could pass on information thats when i found out shed hooked up with roarke i didnt like that part of it you hear things about roarke but naples he liked it a lot said it added spice he brought in another partner the german guy and because dom and i were tied up with other business they met with michel in paris he licked his lips searching eves face for support for understanding for mercy and saw nothing but the cold clear eyes of cop i think they must i dont know they must have cooked up bringing yost in during those meetings all i knew then was that the german had pulled out naples called him a fish belly but it left more for us and naples was going to arrange the transpo personally he hired on a couple more guys it was starting to make me nervous all those expenses but when i complained it got nasty dom said how it was best for me to let him deal with his father direct from then on hed pass instructions to me all i had to do was give them the details the timing pass along the security scheme and keep my mother happy they said they had a way to keep roarke occupied and off my back he rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand you can see cant you you can see that i was in too deep to back out you can see how it wasnt my fault and now im cooperating right that makes a big difference oh yeah you want to keep cooperating vince you want to keep going yeah ill tell you everything i know see just a few weeks ago dom gets in touch he says i have to come up with a million for a consult fee thats my share of it its to go into naples communications and theyll fix the books so itll look like ive bought some swank new system i went nuts a fucking million i dont have that kind to outlay i wasnt looking at that kind of an expense what the hell kind of consult runs a million for just my share he buried his head in his hands and he told me he told me about yost he told me about the contract the murders and he said there was no backing out now we were in it all the way so i should beg borrow or steal my part of the fee because once the contract was complete yost was going to want his money i didnt know what to do what was i supposed to do she started it cutting me out of what was mine its not my fault yeah i can see how your mothers to blame for all this you want to live vince you want me to make sure yost doesnt come hunting you start filling in details give me names i dont have much he lifted his head again i figured out they were leaving me out of the loop using me theyre the ones who should pay for all this theyre the ones you should go after oh dont worry about that theyre going to pay o o while eve was working to draw a more concise and thorough statement from lane roarke walked into his home he checked the security panel noted that mick was enjoying a dip in the pool he took the long way around to give himself time the pool house smelled of hot flowers and cool water there was the musical sound of a fountain spraying and tumbling playing under the blast of the irish rebel songs mick had chosen to keep him company while he did laps roarke walked over chose one of the thick blue towels from the stack and went to wait by the side of the pool mick slapped a hand on the edge shook his hair out of his eyes and peered up at roarke ya coming in no youre coming out that i am mick stood up let the water stream off him for a moment then walked up the steps christ thats the kind of small pleasure a man could grow used to thanks he added taking the towel roarke handed him and rubbing it briskly over his face there were guest robes hanging nearby mick selected one bundled in dont expect a man of your means and responsibilities to pop home middle of the day i had an interruption this morning you know mick in all the times weve had good and bad all weve done together and apart you were the last id have expected to come at a friend from the back slowly mick lowered the towel whats your meaning does friendship come so much cheaper these days than it did when we were lads nothing comes cheaper these days god knows he looked baffled come out straight with it roarke youve put me in the dark you want it straight aye then here it is he rammed his fist into micks face and watched his childhood friend topple backward into the pool weighed down by the sopping robe blood streaming from his mouth mick surfaced there was blood in his eye as well as he lunged for the side of the pool but it had faded nearly turned into a glint of humor as he hauled himself out again fuck it youve still got a fist like a brick he wiggled his jaw stripped off the wet robe howd you figure it out he began then lifted a hand no if you dont mind id rather have some pants on and a whiskey in my hand when you tell me all right roarke nodded coolly well go upstairs together he strode toward the elevator summersets fine by the way why wouldnt he be mick asked easily and stepped in with roarke chapter twenty roarke waited standing by the south window while mick put on trousers he kept his hands in his pockets his eyes on the trees and the high stone wall beyond them hed used the trees the lavish roll of lawn the flowers and that stone to build a place his place a spot of beauty and comfort in a world that held too much pain hed used it he knew to prove to himself that the slums and miseries of dublin were far behind him too far behind to pant hot breath on his neck and so he had invited into that place that home a reminder of what had never really stopped chasing him hed invited in a friend of his childhood who had become a betrayer of his present was it only for the money mick was it only for the profit sure its easy for you to say that in a deriding voice your highness when youre rolling in the stuff of course it was for the money jesus my take will top twentyfive million at a coast and it was for the fun have you really forgotten how much bloody fun it is have you forgotten mick that however shaky the code might be it sticks when it comes to betraying a friend well for gods sake roarke its not like it was your money im after putting in my pocket mick sighed and buttoning his shirt walked over to fetch the decanter of whiskey he poured two glasses and when roarke still didnt turn at the sound of striking glass shrugged and sipped his own all right i admit it was a fine line and maybe ive stomped over to the other side of it ive a bit of envy in me for what youve managed to accumulate over the years since we parted ways a fine line thinking of brutal and senseless murder roarke did turn is that what it is to you listen impatient now and a little embarrassed by it all mick gestured with his glass i was approached about the job the actresss son started the ball rolling and it gathered some steam by the time it got to me it was wellformed the truth is i didnt think youd mind so much over the past few days ive come to see i miscalculated that end of it considerably but i was too far into the matter to back out now of course he shrugged again casting off millions as he might a missed meal how the devil do you figure it howd you know a heist was in the works and pin it down to me connections mick studying his friends face roarke began to do fresh calculations magdas son to napless son to hinrick to gerade i found it odd you never mentioned naples as a possible when eve asked you about the hagues in cornwall name sort of stuck in my throat seeing the position i was in as for hinrick he stepped out even before i was in it mick told him pissed naples off royal im told so you knew about the boy pitiful little weasel that gorgeous example of female managed to birth if youre asking me had every advantage all of his useless life and still whines for more didnt make his own like you and me mick glanced around the room hed enjoyed his stay on a great many levels but it looked like hed be packing his bags sooner than later so what do we do now you arent going to turn me over to your lovely wife the cop are you after all ive not done anything as yet in actuality i want naples ah now roarke youre putting my ass in a sling there and yost what in gods green earth have i to do with the likes of sylvester yost youre napless man and so is he and hes killed two of my people so that the lot of you can get closer to the money youre talking gibberish yosts not in this true enough naples mightve put him on britt and joe god rest them but thats nothing to do with my dealings with the man ive never met yost thank the saints never had truck with him you know thats not my style it hasnt been but its been a long time between for us mick naples set me up and hes used two of my people like pawns today yost went for summerset summerset the liquor left in micks glass sloshed youre trying to tell me naples set yost on summerset youve got to be mistaken what purpose would there be in his eyes never left roarkes but they went wide as his color drained he reached out blindly for the back of a chair levering himself around it he sat oh jesus oh christ jesus because his hands shook he vised them around the glass downed the rest of the whiskey are you sure of this are you without a doubt sure of this i am after a moment roarke crossed over picked up the bottle he brought it back and filled micks glass again hes killed two people who work for me the second being a friend as well it scatters the focus draws the police in the name of my lovely wife off any scent there might be around the auction no no thats why im here to keep you occupied to get close that and me being one of the few around who could set a workable scheme for a job like this i was to whet your interest in a deal or two if your cop wasnt busy on her own i was to keep the two of you bustling around me on a personal level charm her so to speak and being right inside the house id know you see of any changes youd be making for the security in addition to that i could keep the arm on magdas boy if he waffled liza has him under control but ah i wondered about her my cop has been busy on her own hasnt she mick and myself as well if theyd succeeded with summerset today just how much of my attention do you think id have left to give to the auction i didnt know of this mick squared his shoulders looked roarke dead in the eye i swear that to you on my life i would never have done this it was a big job an exciting one and it gave me the added boost of finally being able to best you in something i never could and always wanted to you were never like the rest of us you know you always had something extra i wanted that id have stolen from you roarke and enjoyed it id have laughed about it bragged on it the rest of my days but not this id never have taken part in murder that was the part i couldnt get to fit naples took out britt and joe theres no question of that none and tried for summerset as well mick nodded i see how it is then he drew a long breath there are two men inside one in your special security one in the hotel monroe and billick the jobs set for tomorrow two in the morning precisely at that time a maxibus and a car will have an accident at the east corner near the hotel the bus will turn over slide into the jewelry shop theyve hired a hell of a driver do you remember kilcher i do this is his son and hes even better than his old man therell be a small fire and an enormous mess the cops the security even the fire department will be out there dealing with it handling the looters and so forth at the same moment a delivery van will pull into the proper entrance of the hotel well be six and armed with tranqs well take out those of your staff we must ill be handling your security ive worked it to jam to give us a twelveminute window couldnt widen it more than that and that alone took me six months of hideous work your securitys a marvel and thats a fact id never have made a crack in it without the men on the inside thats little satisfaction at the moment i suppose thats true still im likely the only one live and kicking who could have widened that crack on you so each team member has assigned goods to pluck every one of them must get it done and be out of the room within ten minutes gives them two to get back to the exit point anyone not there gets left behind he rose set his glass aside ill get my equipment and discs so you can see how its meant to be he hesitated i should have known better than to tie myself up with the likes of naples ive no excuses for that mistake and youve my word ill do what i can to make up for it will you give me over to the cops then roarke met his eyes held them and saw all the miseries no o o eve burst into the house all but choking on her own rage she swung toward the stairs even as summerset slid into the hall where are they she demanded roarke is in his private office lieutenant later goddamn it she pounded up the stairs streaked down the hall she had a hand on her weapon when she coded herself into roarkes private room he wasnt behind the console but leaning back against it his eyes tracking the data and diagrams on his wall screens his unregistered equipment hummed softly wheres connelly roarke continued to study to access hed nearly come to the conclusion theyd have managed to pull it off son of a bitch he isnt here i need to find him now the bastards part of this yes i know his comment was so mild she was two beats behind before it sank in you know how long have you known she marched up to him blocking his view of the screens what the hell kind of game are you playing here no game at all no she saw that now his voice might have been calm but his eyes werent when did you clue into him i suspected when we realized the auction items were the target i told you there are only a few who could handle a job of this nature hes one of them and you didnt bother to tell me that no i didnt tell you because i had to be sure now i am and youre sure because i asked him roarke said simply and he told me i have his notes and job plans here they might have done it he added with a glimmer of admiration leaking through if everything had gone perfectly if thered been absolutely no mistakes no unknowns they might have done it you asked him eve repeated fine great where is he i dont know i let him go you now she did choke it wasnt just fury but shock and outrage and not a little betrayal you just let him walk hes a key player in my investigation hes a fucking thief who was about to stab you in the back and you let him go yes i have everything he knows about your investigation about what was done and whats planned it wont be much help to you regarding yost mick didnt know yost had been brought in theres a lot of ididntknow going around you had no right to let him go no right to interfere in police business and no goddamn sense to toss him back out on the street eve goddamn it roarke goddamn it two people are dead summerset might have been ive just finished sweating vincent lane for two hours to get details to get closer and to scare him into keeping his mouth shut so the rest of the players arent alerted i had to get the pa to deal him down to a single charge and offer witness protection to get him to agree to fake a medical emergency the assholes in a posh room at the hospital zoned out on drugs so he cant talk to anyone that was clever of you he certainly wouldnt have managed to maintain his role unless he was drugged and since liza is part of this its best hes out of her bed she lifted her hands felt them clench then whirled away before she could do something violent yeah real clever and now you set connelly loose hell spring to naples and theyll abort the job your reputation will be safe and sound and ive lost another link to yost he wont go to naples bullshit hell he wont roarke repeated if i believed that or if i had any doubt he was out of the loop on yost id have done worse than turn him over to you but i have none i couldnt give him to you eve i dont expect you to understand oh thats real considerate of you lets hope you understand the next time we find a silver wire on a body that your skewed sense of loyalty cost someone their life he didnt speak but his eyes hot and blue held hers for a long moment in them she saw her lance had found its mark oh yeah she thought miserably i got some great aim he turned back to the console i have all the data on the plans ive made copies for you forewarned my security will be able to handle it but i assume youll want to be there with your team youll have naples and the rest within thirtysix hours and if someone died before then he thought if ive cost a friends life to save a friend if you have any questions he began then simply stopped i cant be other than what i am he said quietly whatever ive done to distance myself i cant be other than what i am computer copy all data on disc she waited while the computer completed the task then took the discs from roarke when he offered them i hope to god he was worth it she said and left him alone she called her team first requested they convene at her home office then headed to micks room to toss it in hopes shed find some clue where hed gone she was ripping through the bureau when summerset came in and froze in absolute horror lieutenant that is a chippendale a valuable antique that must be treated with respect a lot of things need to be treated with respect and dont get it she dumped the empty drawer aside and turned to drag the bedspread and sheets off the bed stop it stop it at once he snagged the duvet tugged this is antique irish lace over silk look ace im in the mood to bash someones face in and yours is looking pretty good to me she yanked he yanked and they snarled at each other over the tugofwar she let go abruptly and had the satisfaction of watching him stumble back three steps before coming up hard against the wall when did he leave connelly what did he take with him what was his transpo summerset merely sucked air through his nose look you know what he did what he planned to do roarke would have filled you in by now you she thought with some bitterness but not me you want him to get away with it its not my decision hell with that they sent yost after you mick would not have had a part in that arrangement she threw up her hands kicked the bed hard enough to make summerset leap forward to check for damage what is wrong with you people connelly is involved up to his teeth you had no business roarke had no damn right to let him walk out of this house what choice did he have satisfied the antique footboard had sustained no damage he turned to study her do you understand him so little after all does he understand me so little she shot back after all summerset laid the nowwrinkled duvet on the bed he owed her something he thought for the morning you feel he betrayed you by standing for his friend a friend doesnt plot to steal from a friend summerset smiled mick wouldnt have thought of it that way neither at the bottom of it would roarke you do youre angry and you have a right to your anger but it will burn off roarke suffers and that will fester is that what you want for him he stepped out of the room tired frustrated eve sat on the bed the cat padded in leaped up he turned three tight circles kneaded the silk and lace duvet with some enthusiasm then curled up and stared directly into her face dont you start on me you slept with the guy for gods sake what does that make you o o she put out an allpoints on michael connelly though she expected he would be well into the wind her only hope was that word didnt spread from mick to naples to yost before she closed in but even if the heist was aborted she believed yost would stick hed contracted for summerset and he wasnt the type to leave a job unfinished it would give her time and if she was lucky very lucky she could use yost to hook naples her case would not be closed in her mind until she had them both we proceed on the assumption that the hotel will be the target she told her team everything is set for it even if connelly has bolted naples can still implement he has all the data and has gone to considerable expense hell want to make good on his investment if connelly goes to him feeney put in they may still try for it but theyll shift strategy they may hit sooner or wait come at it from another angle agreed we put our counterplan into place expecting adjustments and expecting them to hit at any time well need roarke and his top security team mcnab commented im aware of that feeney would you discuss that level with roarke she gestured to the adjoining door he got up knocked and passed through study the connelly data until you know it backwards eve ordered then went into the kitchen for coffee and a moment alone peabody slid her eyes toward mcnab away then back again she was getting damn sick of the silent treatment she hadnt done anything he was the one who had jumped right on some redhead oh yeah shed gotten the word on that minor orgy through the grapevine little prick have a good time on your date oh yeah it rocked you bite is that an invitation she sniffed i dont go around with jerks who bounce on bimbos i dont go around with jerkettes who bounce on lcs he tossed back at least an lc knows how to treat a woman sure if you pay him enough he crossed his legs examined the toes of his new airstream boots whats the matter peabody charless calendar too full you sound like a woman who isnt getting any screw you any time peabody you can even have it for free she leaped up so did he i wouldnt let you touch me again if you paid me fine i dont have time on some stiffassed cornbread uniform break it up eve ordered now if she wasnt mistaken her aide was on the verge of tears and mcnab didnt look far behind they were both giving her a bitch of a headache private business on your own time damn it the two of you will work together through this around this or under this i dont give a damn how you manage it but when youre on my watch you stand up and do the job is that clear yes sir it came from both of them at a mumble and would have to satisfy peabody check on lane at the hospital and see that the tag on liza is still in place i want an update on both mcnab run a full analysis of connellys data i want all possible adjustment scenarios on my desk within two hours sir roarke did i give you an order detective or ask for a discussion an order lieutenant then follow it she marched to roarkes door pushed it open both he and feeney were behind the console both looked up feeney ive started mcnab on an analysis will you see he gets started no problem she waited until the door shut after him im tired she said i have a headache and im pissed off at you well that should about cover it no it doesnt i dont have the time or the energy to waste having a sniping match with you like the one i just had the misfortune to overhear between peabody and mcnab you were wrong to let connelly go but thats from where i stand from where you stand you did what you had to we cant come together on that but we need each other to finish this job when its finished well have to deal with the fact that were standing on opposite sides of a line until then its tabled she turned for the door gave it a shove and found it locked unlock this door dont mess with me now id prefer you shouted and got this done but since its not the anger so much thats driving you you wont ill need a few moments of your time ive done all the personal business im going to do right now i hurt you you see it as me choosing him over you it wasnt youre wrong she turned around now faced him across the room he hurt you and you wont let me stand for you you took it out of my hands and gave me no way to make it right youd have put him in a cage darling eve that wouldnt have made it right for me you know some of what i was and where i came from but not all no not all he wasnt sure he himself knew or understood the all but he could give her another part of it your past comes to you in nightmares that try to eat you up from the inside mine it lives in me in corners of me do you know how many years it was before i ever went back to ireland after id left i dont and it was some time after that before i ever stepped on a dublin street it wasnt until you went back with me to bury my friend that i went again to that part of dublin that birthed me he looked down at his hands i used these and my brain and whatever else i could find to claw and steal and cheat my way out of that and i left behind those whod come through it all with me just as much as i left behind the dead bastard whod made my life a misery he damaged me eve and might have made me what he was no she came forward then oh yes he could have without the friends i made and those pockets of escape i had with them he would have i was able to go my own way because there were those i could count on in the worst of times when i took you with me to dublin last year so i could wake and bury jenny i realized id never paid that back i couldnt have turned him over eve not even to you and lived with it she hissed out a breath swore i know it im not calling off the allpoints on him i wouldnt expect it neither would he i was to give you his apologies for the trouble hes caused and his not saying his goodbyes in person oh please she replied he left something for you he pulled a small vial out of his pocket handed it to her dirt soil he claimed dug from the hill of tara that place of irish kings long dead knowing mick it likely came out of our own gardens but its the thought after all its for luck he said as you were the most regal of cops hed ever had the pleasure of meeting regal my ass well as i said its the thought she jammed the vial in her pocket this regal cop hopes to have the pleasure of meeting him again very soon but meanwhile we need our expert consultant civilian on this data analysis i need to focus on yost and leave you compudroids to the tech work absolutely lieutenant he came around the console took her hand one other thing i think youll be in the mood for i dont have time for sex theres always time for sex but that wasnt what i meant just now yost as roles holds the deed to beachfront property and the house just completed on it in the tropics sector of olympus son of a bitch if you dont get him here youll get him there hes contracted one of our own site decorators to outfit the place and has a consult set four days from now hes reserved a suite at the main casino hotel in three days time ive a line on private craft booked into the transpo station there theres only one scheduled in from new york ive transferred all the information to your home unit im on it o o they separated into two teams with mcnab working with roarke in his office on the security analysis eve kept peabody with her as she outlined the best strategy for moving in on yost feeney moved between the teams the timing makes it clear yost is waiting to go off planet until after the heist feeney ask roarke if yost would be entitled to a share of the take over and above the assassins fee since one hooked to the other if he found anything odd about her consulting roarke on that sort of criminal ethics he didnt mention it says yost could be entitled to a bonus based on the take but that would be transferred to him after the merchandise was transported and fenced okay so whys he hanging probably wants to be certain it goes off smooth and hes not required for any more work and theres still summerset on his slate hell be tuned to the media for news of the theft i need to bring in nadine they worked straight through until her team threatened to revolt without proper nourishment eve ate half a sandwich while working at her computer she refused to budge until shed read everything through one last time lieutenant your eyes are going to bleed computer save and hold data then roarke swung her chair around before she could countermand his order its after eight youre exhausted and the mind will only hold so much at a go send your team home and take a break they can go there are just a few more things i want to look over is nadine still here no she had to be onair you covered it with her and shell plant your story youve covered everything twice over and more maybe where is everybody mcnabs down in the kitchen talking summerset out of a second dessert before he heads to the hotel peabodys taking a swim at my suggestion to clear her head and feeneys in my office working because his heads very nearly as hard as your own theres nothing more you can do tonight if theres not its because ive overlooked it i want to get some men up to olympus into the transpo station in case yost gets by us here ill let agent stowe decide which end she wants to take when i fill her in which wont be until tomorrow as you dont want her filled in too soon feeney he called out and began to knead his wifes knotted shoulders go home in a minute dallas we ought to alert space traffic control in case yost detours on his way to olympus we alert stc its one more tongue to wag she called back you got any secure contacts with them ill work on it i used to have this he trailed off as he stepped in and saw roarke bent over eve rubbing her shoulders ah well you know i think ill head out now i can give peabody a lift shes in the pool roarke told him not so gently holding his wife down when she tried to rise yeah feeneys face brightened wouldnt mind a quick dip myself go right ahead youre going to eat roarke said to eve i did a halfsandwich isnt sufficient he glanced over as he heard voices fine we have company you can have some soup while mavis entertains you i dont have time for she broke off sighed mavis was already whirling into the room on sixinch platform slides that exploded with colored lights at every bouncing step hey dallas hey roarke just ran into feeney and he said you were wrapped for the day not really i still have some stuff why dont you play with roarke while i finish up her pleasure at the inspiration fractured when another woman this one with twelveinch coils shooting out of her head in screaming red strolled in trina eve managed and her stomach clutched with dread we came by to give you the scoop and poop up close and personal mavis announced trina got the line on the products and all like you asked me right trina right and right down the line thats great its going to be okay eve thought its just business what have you got tell her trina oh wine roarke you are total she plunked her pretty butt in its crotchshot skirt on eves desk and beamed at him as he handed around glasses of wine okay trina began you got your youth supercover foundation burnt honey tone your mocha same product you can get them at any highend department store or salon then you got your unisex powder in both loose and compact he went for deloren there thats mostly sold in salons and spa centers cause its too pricey for the regulars how many spots in new york oh two three dozen easy hes got fine taste in enhancements cheek colors are deloren youth and a nice rose quartz from salina the eye stuff trina i appreciate all this but can you fine it down to whichever products you tagged that have limited distribution any stuff in there only sold wholesale maybe im getting to it trina curled her lips currently painted vampire black heres a guy who likes to experiment with enhancements and isnt afraid to pay top dollar gotta admire that from the looks of the video he took the basics and a few fancies he keeps them all organized so i could deduce she held on to that word a moment savoring it i could deduce he favors youth and natural bliss nbs hypoallergenic all natural and costs two left arms cant buy it overthecounter cant get it unless youre a licensed consultant salon use only not for resale so this guy either has a license or a source cause hes got some of those salonuseonlys in his drawer as did she trina thought smugly happens i get it from carnegy enhancement supplies on second avenue when ive got a client who can pay the fee she paused sipped and it happens i took the trouble to call my pal there and ask her on the quiet about her customers for the products your guy had or i figured were missing from the drawer she said it was funny i should ask cause she just got in an order for those exact products from one of her regulars a big bald guy who comes in once or twice a year and picks up a supply pays in cash says hes got a salon in south jersey eve got slowly to her feet did he pick up the order nope coming in for it tomorrow before noon told her to have it all put together as he was pressed for time ordered twice his usual too roarke get this woman some more wine we did good mavis asked bouncing you did fantastic trina i need the name of your pal i need her cooperation fine by me but i got a question how come you insult me insult you i was about to kiss you how come you dont take care of my work look at you trina aimed a finger tipped by a oneinch sapphire nail you look like something dragged under a maxibus skins all tired circles under your eyes ive been working whats that got to do with it you cant take five minutes twice a day to show some respect for my work whens the last time you used that exfoliant i gave you or the pump lotion or the stress repair ah bet you havent had time to rub on the breast cream either she turned on roarke some reason you cant slap some on your hands before you feel her up i do try he said throwing eve to the wolves without a qualm shes a difficult woman let me see your feet trina demanded rounding the desk eve dallas who had faced death and spit in its eye went into full retreat no my feet are fine havent used the pediacare kit have you then trinas eyes with their rainbow lids and gold lashes widened in shock did you cut your hair no eve grabbed it with a protective hand nearly stumbled over the chair dont you lie to me girlfriend you took the scissors to it didnt you no not exactly hardly at all i had to do it it was getting in my eyes i barely touched it damn it she decided it was time to plant her feet its my hair it is not your hair not once ive had my hands in it do i come down to your police station and strut around with a badge on my tit or go out on the streets and hunt up bad guys so i can kick their ass no and this is what you do not do you do not ever in this lifetime or the next mess with my work trina heaved a breath now im going down and getting my kit so i can deal with the mess youve made of yourself thats nice really but i dont have time for eve winced as trina fisted her hands on her hips that would be great thanks when trina strode out eve stepped up to mavis gave her a hard look and took her wine she downed it then scowled at her friend and her husband the first one who smirks eats this glass chapter twentyone she was up by six and dove into the shower she intended to round up her troops by eight report to whitney then contact karen stowe she intended for yost to hear the cage door clang behind him by noon youre looking pleased with yourself lieutenant roarke said as he stepped under the spray behind her i will be in a few hours perhaps we can make it sooner he moved in slid his hands up her body over her breasts wanna play water games hot shot ill spot you ten points to the goal he offered and nipped her shoulder keep your handicap she reached around to run a hand down his flank then felt a hard pull in her belly as his fingers slid over and tugged her nipples you got that gunk on your hands trina assures me hot water only enhances the benefits god knows youve got it hot enough and i was here first so dont even think about changing the temp she breathed deep let her system relax i have to admit it feels better when you put that stuff on than when she does its flavored he turned her around dipped his head sucked her in apricot yeah eve let her head fall back you definitely have the superior technique keep going her blood hummed and her mind which had been razorsharp on wakening clouded steam billowed around them thickening the air until her lungs clogged with it then his hands were on her face and his mouth crushed to hers he wanted to fill her had to fight back the urge to take quickly and sate that need that had woken with him that morning she was wrapped around him her mouth open and avid her hips moved against his a steady invitation yes he wanted to fill her and instead let her fill him long slim sleeked with wet she aroused him he could live on the taste of her the sharp heat of it and when he used his fingertips to urge her up to nudge her over he swallowed that heat and the strangled cry of pleasure that rode on it every inch of her body throbbed he could bring her that did bring her that time and again and she could feel his muscles quiver and know she brought the same to him damaged hed said hed been and god knew so had she yet somehow they continually managed to heal each other there was no past when they came together swamped with love aroused beyond reason she roped her arms around his neck now now now he drove into her drove hard as they both seemed to need it she cried out again fisted her hands in the wet silk of his hair when he lifted her hips she hooked a leg around his waist and watched him watched him as he watched her tasted his breath as he tasted hers slowly long slow and deep until her eyes began to swim with the pleasure of it endless unspeakable pleasure that rolled inside her belly and up to the heart on a moan she found his mouth with hers and poured herself into him and taking her loving her he emptied himself into her eve it was all he said all he thought as he held her close under the torrent of water she stroked his back and hoped his heart was soothed handicap my butt it made him chuckle as shed hoped next time you can spot me christ he sniffed at her shoulder you smell fabulous i ought to with all that stuff trina poured rubbed and dumped all over me last night and a lot of help you were she remembered pulling back where were you when she was threatening me with one of her temp tattoos otherwise engaged if youd give her an hour once a month she wouldnt be annoyed enough to ambush you he decided it was best if he told her rather than letting her find out on her own and eve about the tattoo what shed started out of the shower stopped dead with a look of such horror he had to fight back a laugh she didnt ill kill her she raced to the mirror and knowing trinas favorite spot twisted around to look at her own ass goddamn it she got me what the hell is it a pony why did she paint a pony on my butt i believe if you look closer youll see its a small donkey or what might be referred to as a jackass oh great oh very funny i suppose we can conclude she wanted to make a point i bet she didnt leave any remover around either you tell anybody my lips are sealed its kind of cute actually the way its kicking up its back legs shut up roarke just shut up and to make sure of it she slammed into the drying tube o o by nine eve had a tactics team placed in strategic spots on second avenue they had orders to observe and report only unless flagged trinas friend who turned out to be a reasonably sensible woman manned the main counter at the wholesale shop peabody in soft clothes replaced the scheduled clerk at another and mcnab dressed as only he could stood in as a customer eve would have bought his cover in a heartbeat if anyone looked less like a cop than mcnab in a puce skinsuit and chartreuse knee boots shed like to see him she set up in the storeroom watching the store on monitor with stowe before this goes down i want to thank you for coming through on your promise lets just get it done eve glanced at the longbarreled blaster holstered on stowes hip i need him alive yeah stowe drew the weapon turned it to show eve it was set on medium stun i thought about doing it otherwise thought hard about it imagined it she holstered the blaster again but it wouldnt bring winnie back well take him breathing in the sales area peabody bore down and stepped to where mcnab loitered at the end of her station im going to apologize for starting that argument yesterday it was an inappropriate comment made at an inappropriate time yeah he had brooded over it all night brooded over her and did she have to look so pretty today did she have to be wearing a softlooking dress and pink lip dye was she trying to kill him forget it if we forget it well do it again youre feeneys man and im dallass that means well be working together a lot maybe we made a mistake and started doing more than working together but theres no point in having that screw up both of us on the job you figure it was a mistake just like that his tone made her want to snipe back but she reined herself in no not really i dont think it was a mistake it just worked around to one one she wished she could fix more than shed expected how could she have known shed miss the skinny jerk id like to try to get past it and go back to where we can be professional hed have liked to go back too back to that storeroom so that he could make it all come out different okay fine i can chill with that good thats good but it didnt feel all that good look maybe we could she trailed off as a customer walked in mcnab took a moment to swear under his breath then straightened to begin the practiced rap about a new hair reconstructive serum o o eve checked her wrist unit eleven thirtyeight the civilian clerk was holding up well apparently peabody and mcnab had negotiated a truce she hoped things were going as smoothly for feeney and roarke at the hotel she pulled out her communicator to check on the status there and it beeped in her hand dallas lieutenant subject approaching target area on foot heading south on second avenue crossing on twentyfourth subject is alone wearing a light brown overcoat dark brown trousers positive id thats affirmative we have him in view approaching twentythird should be in your target thirty seconds stand by do not move in unless ordered peabody mcnab you copy thats affirmative all teams keep communications open saddle up stowe eve said and lets take this bastard im going out the back to circle cut off his second avenue exit wait until hes in the shop well back you up i owe you she kept an eye on the monitor and a hand on the door eve darted out the back jogged around to the corner she came up half a block from yost matched her pace to his brisk stroll when he reached for the shop door she slid her hand inside her jacket and saw jacoby race across the street weapon drawn fbi freeze she didnt have time to swear she kicked in closed the distance and was still three feet away when yost whirled and met jacoby headon it was like watching a unibike plowed down by an airbus down police get down she mowed through pedestrians her weapon snapping into her hand she saw jacoby hit the pavement heard her communicator go wild with no chance for a clear shot she ran in pursuit as yost surged south knocking bystanders aside dodging his way into the street and into traffic hold fire hold fire one illaimed blast and civilians would be hit for a big man he moved fast and he moved smooth he swung west at the next corner dragging a glidecart over with brute strength it tumbled into eves path spilling its guts over street and sidewalk and causing its operator to shriek rather than skirting it she jumped on took one running step over its side and using it as a springboard leaped the momentum bought her half the distance crossing to third vehicular backup give me vehicular backup i am in pursuit of suspect and crossing third at twentysecond to free her hand she jammed the communicator in her pocket bore down and made another leap she caught yost midbody it was like hitting a slab of reinforced steel shed have sworn her bones rattled but the tackle took him down to one knee before he could shove her aside and scramble up she had her weapon pressed to the pulse in his throat where it was lethal do you want to die she asked want to die on the street like a sidewalk sleeper even as yost raised his hands she heard feet pounding behind her mcnab sweat streaming down his face chest heaving moved into position his weapon aimed at yosts head hes covered lieutenant on your face sly spread them there seems to be some mistake yost began my name is giovanni on the ground she pushed up with her weapon belly down or my fingers going to slip he spread himself out on the sidewalk arms twitching as she yanked them back to cuff his wrists it couldnt be was all he could think it couldnt end for him like this facedown on the street like a common criminal i want an attorney yeah im real worried about your rights and obligations right now she dug in his pockets came out with an empty pressure syringe and a length of slim silver wire well well look what i found an attorney he repeated in his high voice i insist on being treated with respect yeah she stood up planted her boot on his thick neck you be sure to tell the guards and your fellow inmates at penal station omega you insist on respect they dont get a lot of laughs up there call for a cooler mcnab i want this guy on ice yes sir dallas your nose is bleeding bashed it into him with the tackle she swiped at it with the back of her hand looked down at the bright red in disgust jacoby i dont know i had to jump over him to pursue i think stowe stayed back with him its her collar mcnab aw jeez dallas thats how it is youre out of shape detective start spending some time in the gym so you dont pant like a dog when you run a few blocks she nodded as blackandwhites screamed to the curb and members of the tactical team streamed down the sidewalk heres your ride sly he looked up saw her face saw the faces of onlookers who tried to crowd in and stare i should have killed you first yeah theres that hindsight thing hold this asshole for special agent karen stowe hes hers im mirandizing him on her behalf she crouched down waited until yost looked into her eyes winifred gates was a friend of agent stowes im doing this for her youre under arrest for assault battery sexual assault and the murder by contract of various individuals whose names will be listed at the time of your booking and thats just in this state im tossing in resisting arrest assault on a federal officer destruction of property and fleeing the scene of a crime interpol and global will be right behind me with their party favors you have the right you miserable son of a bitch to remain silent o o eve walked back toward second avenue favoring her left shoulder shed jammed it hard against yosts kidney area and it ached like a bad tooth her nose was throbbing in counterpoint and felt as if it had spread across her face and into her ears shed have plunked down a hundred dollars for a bag of ice sir peabody sprinted to the corner took one look at eves face and winced ow am i messed up eve lifted hesitant fingers to her nose hissed just a little swollen itd be worse if youd broke it looks like it bled really good which explains why small children ran screaming when i passed by wheres stowe inside we got the word you brought yost down sir i would have pursued as backup but mcnab ordered me to stay and agent jacoby was down you did right so did mcnab whats the status on jacoby i dont know stowes in contact with the mts yost caught him with a pressure syringe heavy barbs dead in the heart dallas he went down like a tree under the ax by the time stowe and i got to him his heart had stopped we administered cpr and the mts response was fast they zapped him got a rhythm he was still unconscious when they took him offscene even blind ambition and gross stupidity dont deserve a stopped heart stand by peabody keep this area clear no statements to the media at this time eve swung inside trinas helpful friend was sitting on the floor her head back and what looked like about ten ounces of red wine in a water glass she gave eve a wavery smile and kept sipping steadily are you all right do you need medical attention she held up the glass this is all the medical attention i need im going to drink this go home and sleep for eight hours ill arrange your transportation you know its essential you speak to no one about what happened here this morning until youre cleared to do so yeah you drilled me she studied eves face i got some products thatll help with that swelling and bruising its great for after major face and body sculpting work you want some free samples im okay wheres agent stowe in the back dont go anywhere eve told her then pushed through into the storeroom stowe paced a line through the boxes as she talked on her pocketlink keep me apprised of his status you can reach me at this number at all times thanks jacoby eve asked in a coma stowe shoved the link in her pocket critical his heart they may have to try to replace it he took a direct hit clicked him off like a switch i should have gone with him hes my partner i wanted to see you needed to tell you i didnt tip jacoby he must have sensed something was up and tailed me i didnt tell him about this i didnt break faith with you if i thought you had i wouldnt have yost on ice waiting for you to book and interview stowe turned and faced eve you tracked him set up the op and you took him down its your collar dallas we made a deal you stuck to yours i stuck to mine hes at central maximum holding theyre expecting you stowe nodded you ever need a favor from the bureau its yours ill keep it in mind youve got to stall him on the lawyer keep him incommunicado until after oh two hundred hours you have a little delay getting to central the paperwork gets lost for his transfer to your authority if i cant delay for fourteen hours give or take i shouldnt be working for the government he wont tip anybody about your op whenever you want to interview him about your two homicides ill clear it he give you that she asked jerking her chin toward eves face i got it on the tackle bringing him down you ought to put some ice on it tell me its been a pleasure stowe held out her hand lieutenant likewise agent o o she ordered peabody to find the closest and buy some ice in direct violation of orders peabody hit the closest pharmacy and brought back a cold patch with antiinflammatories and a bottle of pain blockers wheres my ice this is better than ice officer lieutenant if you use this patch correctly your face will not be swollen up like a beatup ad blimp when you check in at the hotel to recon with security which means roarke wont haul you off to the mts or administer first aid himself since you particularly dislike both of these eventualities i suggest you take what i got you and avoid this future annoyance that was good peabody really good i hate you but it was good eve snatched the box scowled at the instructions for the patch how the hell does this thing work ill do it just hold still so peabody opened the box activated the antiinflammatory and affixed the patch over eves aching nose the relief was considerable and it was quick but one look in the mirror had eve swearing i look like an idiot yes you do peabody agreed studying the result of the white strip over eves face but you looked like an idiot without it too sir got your sun shades no i can never keep track of them take mine generously peabody pulled hers out of her pocket handed them over better she said when eve slipped the dark glasses on a little better want some water to down the blocker i dont want a blocker itll give the patch a boost make it work faster though she suspected that was a lie eve took the tiny blue pill swallowed snarled there do you think i could get back to work now nurse peabody yes sir i think thats the best we can do for you right now o o she stopped by the hospital first to check on lane he was in a gentle twilight sleep with his condition listed as satisfactory the cover of allergic reaction was holding kept quarantined he was allowed no visitors eve was informed his mother had been to the hospital twice and had watched him through the view glass liza trent had signed in once and had stayed for under five minutes if any other friends or associates had come by theyd evaded the log eve had come armed with a warrant and was able to access copies of the security discs for lanes floor with only half the usual hassle michel gerade she said when she played the disc back in her office he stood frowning at lane through the viewing glass nice of him to visit his sick pal he doesnt look concerned so much as pissed yeah and he didnt bring a getwell present did he this confirms gerades presence in new york if he participates in this attempted heist we may link him solid to yost diplomatic immunity wont cover his sorry ass on conspiracy to commit murder neither one of the naples men showed up on disc no im betting gerade there drew the straw for errand boy make sure lane is hospitalized as advertised see here he goes to the nurses station tries to pump for information concerned friend charm charm she bends enough to look up the chart and give him exactly what we want him to have severe allergic reaction resulting in seizure complete bed rest and mild sedation in quarantine for fortyeight hours while tested eve watched gerade walk toward the elevator they wont like it but theyre not going to abort a plan this longterm and complex because one of their groups in lala land as far as theyre concerned hed already done his job she ejected the disc filed it now lets go do ours chapter twentytwo it was seventeen hundred hours when eve walked into the palace hotel she used the main lobby entrance she wanted to do a walkthrough using her own eyes and ears and instincts to map out the hotel and gauge its rhythm before she went up to base control the twotier lobby was a sea of marble and mosaic the kind of rich and regal colors and designs shed seen on one of her trips with roarke to italy exotic arrangements of flowers speared and spilled out of urns taller than a man the staff was dressed in royal red or blue depending on their function the guests dressed rich she watched a sixfoot woman wrapped in what looked like filmy scarves from neck to knee lead a trio of tiny white dogs on a triple leash augusta what augusta peabody repeated in eves ear nodding toward the whipthin woman and her furballs this years primo model god id kill to have legs like that and thats beesting over there lead singer for crash and bum and oh jeez just coming off the elevator left bank is mont tyler screen queen magazine voted him sexiest man of the decade it sure is fun working with you dallas if youve finished gawking peabody if we have time i could gawk a little longer and her head did swivel seesawing back and forth up and down as she followed eve across the lobby eve was doing some scanning herself she measured distances to exits to elevator banks she spotted two of the undercovers pulling bell staff duty she rechecked security cam positions she looked for holes and as she climbed the three flights to the ballroom level she checked out every floor between security human and droid were on duty flanking the entrances to the magda lane display discreetly rounding the perimeter people queued up wandered through to sigh and gasp over sparkling gowns glittering jewels the photographs the holoprints the small mementos and grand costumes each display or bank of displays was ringed inside red velvet rope that was for show the sensor shields ringing those same displays were invisible those were for security auction catalogues disc or commemorative hard copy were on sale to those who wanted to shell out over twelve hundred dollars a sampling of the catalogue could be accessed onscreen in hotel guest rooms at no charge theyre shoes eve finally said pausing by a pair of silver pumps somebody elses shoes you want to wear somebody elses shoes you go to a recycle mart but sir its like buying magic its like buying somebody elses shoes eve corrected and satisfied for the moment started out magda and her entourage stepped off the elevator eve im so glad ive ran into you magda hurried forward both hands outstretched her waterfall of hair was scooped up at the neck and her eyes were tired my son yes i know im sorry hes ill hows he doing they tell me hell be fine some silly reaction but theyre keeping him sedated and quarantined i cant even let him know im there now magda of course he knows mince patted her arm but his gaze skipped uneasily to eves magdas worrying herself sick over that boy he said and his eyes said clearly make it stop hes being well taken care of eve gave magdas hands a reassuring squeeze well i hope in any case im told you were there with him when he became ill yeah thats right id dropped by to see him to go over some of the security details he was fine when i left liza gave eve a piercing look just fine he certainly seemed to be so he didnt complain earlier about being a little queasy dizzy back to you sweetheart eve thought no he was fine he probably didnt want to worry you he mentioned hed been feeling a little off but that was after he started to look pale and clammy and i asked him if he was okay he got shaky fast after that said he was sorry but he needed to lie down my aide suggested we call the house doctor yes sir peabody confirmed i didnt like his color he didnt want the fuss i was about to send peabody to get him some water when he started to seize we called for medical assistance there was a rash spreading just under the neck of his sweater they clicked on allergic reaction right off thank god you were there i hate to think what might have happened if hed been alone and unable to call for help you could have let me know liza interrupted i waited and waited for him at rendezvous i was worried sick about vinnie sorry didnt think of it at the time he was my priority of course and breathing a little easier magda smiled the important thing is vince got treatment quickly she glanced toward the ballroom hes going to hate missing all this after all his hard work yeah eve said bad break o o man dallas you were so good peabody beamed as they rode the private elevator to base control maybe you should have thought about becoming an actor yeah that was a big mistake on my part magdas going to have to take it on the chin tomorrow when it comes out about her son im sorry for that she stepped out of the elevator and into roarkes conception of base control oh oh dallas peabody whispered overcome by the sheer glamour of the owners suite dont drool peabody its unattractive and try to remember were here to work the living area was a long sweep of warm color plush fabrics thick rugs in gracious patterns over acres of blond wood a gleaming copper sculpture sleeked down one wall spilling deep blue water in a gentle arch into a small freeform pool decked with flowers and ferns tumbling from the dome ceiling was a chandelier formed of hundreds of slim globes in that same deep blue the tone was repeated in the grand piano and the marble hearth and mantel of a cozy fireplace a spiral of copper led up to a second level on its landing pots trailed tangled vine roses the atmosphere was so rarefied even the presence of cops stacked equipment and a halfdozen portable surveillance monitors couldnt lower it it was embarrassing when she heard a burst of laughter eve strode through the luxury rounded a curve and stared hard at the scene in the dining room the long table was loaded with food the banquet she thought had been going on for some time from the looks of it plates and platters and bowls had been scavenged for their contents the air still hung with the scents of roasted meat spices sauces and melting chocolate ranged around the scene of the crime were mcnab a pair of uniforms including the young and promising officer trueheart whom shed assumed would know better feeney roarkes head of security and the culprit himself what the hell is this at her voice mcnab quickly swallowed what was in his mouth started to choke and turn beetred while feeney pounded him helpfully on the back the two uniforms came to rigid attention roarkes man looked elsewhere and roarke greeted her warmly hello lieutenant can i fix you a plate you you she jabbed her finger at the uniforms at your stations mcnab youre a disgrace wipe that mustard off your chin its cream sauce sir you she aimed the finger at roarke with me always he strolled out behind her through a pretty den where another cop was snacking on cocktail shrimp and studying yet another monitor eve gave him a hard look but kept going until shed reached the relative privacy of the master bedroom suite then she whirled this is not a goddamn party certainly not what are you doing ordering up half the food in new york for my men providing them with fuel most people require it at fairly regular intervals a plate of sandwiches a couple of pizzas okay but youve provided them with enough damn fuel to make them logy and stupid lieutenant we have hours yet without an occasional break from the stress tedium and monotony well all be logy and stupid he lifted her rigid chin turned her face right and left nodded not bad he decided but youll want a blocker boost and another hit of antiinflammatory mcnab she hissed and made him laugh you impressed the bloody hell out of him taking that minor mountain down with one tackle but did you have to use your face im very fond of it apparently youve been brought uptodate apparently when will you get your shot at yost ill wait for tomorrow hell pay roarke between local and federal charges covering two decades hell never see the light of day again hell get maximum solitary concrete cage and he knows it he nodded again yes ive thought of that and im content that his life from now on will be worse than death for a man of his tastes and habits okay she drew a breath you may have to be satisfied with that taking yost out was my priority and i couldnt risk any delay in doing so but removing him may screw up this op i dont see him as directly involved hes an assassin not a thief and his type wouldnt soil themselves by participating in a heist but in the past few days weve eliminated lane yost and connelly from the mix naples isnt stupid even with the time and investment hes put in he may very well abort mick wont tip him she wasnt going to argue that whether he does or doesnt hes out with napless main security tool running for cover a key inside man in the hospital and his assassin on ice its dicey maybe well get yost to roll on him maybe were not going to be able to offer him much in return so itll be a matter of pressure instead of trade we may both have to be satisfied that weve prevented a crime and magdas auction goes off as scheduled will you be satisfied no i want the bastard giving yost to stowe was it just was but naples and the rest of them would be mine i also know that the job doesnt always give satisfaction one way or the other we proceed as outlined o o by midnight shed odd on coffee and had studied on monitor every inch of every public area in the hotel with feeney and roarkes man she had reviewed stage by minute stage every variable in the security system when her commander came in she rose and prepared to give him a full status report a moment of your time lieutenant he gestured her across the room near the whispering waterfall his eyes were dark and tired yost selfterminated sir he was remanded to federal custody two hours ago they were checking him into maximum holding in their facility the clerk had a cup of coffee on his desk the son of a bitch managed to grab it smash it and still cuffed slit his own throat with a shard so he got the easy way after all she murmured and cost me my link to naples im sorry lieutenant yes sir thank you for telling me agent jacobys condition is promising his medical team believes his heart is responding to treatment hes currently stable thats good and at least he wont be around to screw this up if theres anything to screw up id like to see this end with you you remain in command he glanced around the suite looks like theres plenty of room for one more check out the dinner buffet eve said sourly we might still have egg rolls o o she stationed herself at the main bank of monitors in the living area from there she could scan and search the target areas both interior and exterior the night staff of the hotel went about its business such as it was room service delivered or removed the occasional tray from guest rooms a few guests returned from a night on the town while others strolled out to begin one like the city the building would never be completely quiet business and pleasure were twentyfourhour activities she made an lc in short red satin crossing the lower lobby toward the exit the woman looked smug and gave her little silver bag a pat a nice fat tip eve assumed then sharpened her focus as liza passed the lc on her way in liza glanced lazily around a bit too lazily a bit too thoroughly eve decided feeney take a look id say our girl there has a recorder on shes giving her pals an inside look enhance and magnify feeney ordered sector eighteen through thirtysix he made grunting noises as the image popped up then ordered higher magnification on a smaller sector eve was treated to a very close view of lizas cleavage now thats beautiful jesus feeney he blinked flushed i aint talking about her you know the neck thing shes playing with the dangle theres a microrecorder stateofthefuckingart too shes probably transmitting a threesixty right now and full audio the doorman breaks wind that babyll pick it up can you jam it oh yeah i could jam a transmission from the moon with the equipment roarke brought in he looked so delighted by the idea eve had to wave him off not now let her do the recon for them let them see everything nice and quiet and in order goddamn feeney theyre going for it after all she checked her wrist unit fortyfive minutes to mark keep her monitored she ordered then rose to rally her troops o o at mark minus fifteen eve moved to the ready station a meeting room one floor below ballroom level liza had already reconned the ballroom area strolling past the target and giving her associates a shot of the secured doors and warning lights now she was tucked in her room and feeney would wait for the signal to jam two uniforms with a master were on hold to move into her room and take her into custody eve was going to be sorry to miss it she fixed on her lapel recorder feeney you read gotcha she ran through her other team leaders checking them on audio and on the monitors she checked her weapon rolled her shoulder and was pleased it had loosened up then she scowled as roarke slipped into the room off limits to civilians upstairs as its my hotel nothing is off limits i have clearance from your commander im in on this lieutenant she didnt doubt he could handle himself though in his black sweater and trousers he looked more like the type whod do the breaking in than the type to frown on such activities are you armed he glanced meaningfully at her recorder letting her know he was fully aware everything he said was being transmitted expert consultants civilian arent authorized to carry weapons which meant he was carrying since she preferred that to him going naked into a bust she let it pass when we move we move fast she said to the men and women gathered in the room we contain quickly and completely you have your teams cover each others backs these people will have no place to go and are likely to resist our intelligence indicates theyll be armed with tranqs but we cant be sure they wont carry something more lethal restrain and disarm be aware that jamming their transmissions will also jam ours from the target area until we have it contained lets keep that time frame to a minimum lenick get the civilian some body armor and a recorder at mark minus five she was glued to the monitor glanced up only when roarke came up beside her wheres your body armor she asked wheres yours i have the option of wearing it and you opt not to because its bulky and hampers quick movements lets not waste time arguing theres monroe moving into position at the delivery entrance hell find out shortly how much i disapprove of moonlighting he goes down with the rest of them but ill make sure youre given a minute to fire him appreciate it heres the maxibus right on schedule switching op to yellow light be ready she watched the bus swerve clip the front fender of the oncoming car it tipped on its six side wheels shivered then toppled like a turtle to slide sparks showering into the neighboring building there was an impressive smashing of glass a nice little poof of smoke on cue cars stopped and people began to run toward or away from the accident the shrill scream of the jewelers alarm system was a muffled buzz over her audio on the next monitor she watched the delivery truck glide smoothly into place at the hotels rear and monroe step out of the shadows like roarke the six figures who leaped out of the truck were dressed in black with the addition of caps that fit snugly over heads and thin gloves that protected the hands and kept the fingers nimble micks with them roarke murmured hes seeing it through i didnt give him credit for it thats for later eve thought seven repeat seven subjects entering building from the west delivery level wait eve laid a hand on his arm gaze steady on the monitor theres three in the lorry roarke continued how do you micks telling me its an old code three in the lorry all with eyes and ears hand lasers copstyle one minilauncher heatseeking fully loaded when mick entered the building roarke shifted to the next monitor he watched as his friend went to work on the first security panel and listened with half an ear as eve relayed the incoming data to her teams the men inside are carrying too more than the tranqs previously reported two added basic policeissue lasers theres a woman third back handtohand expert she has a blade in her right boot roarke glanced to eve youll use this for him it wasnt a question he didnt doubt her sense of justice lets bring it down then ill do what i can there hes through the second level hes better than he was she watched mick jerk up his thumb then pound with the others up the service stairs they moved fast and orderly telling her theyd drilled well and drilled often but so had she her mind stayed cool and focused as mick stopped at the fire door on the ballroom level took out a handheld unit and telescoped it out to elbowlength his fingers were quick and steady and made her wonder what was in his thoughts his unit beeped three times and its lights glowed green he went through the doors first heading for the target at a jog move out eve ordered feeney prepare to jam on my signal copy that his voice spoke in her ear theyre at the doors working on outer security second from the rears antsy hes sweating hey dallas i got an id on him looks like gerade wanted to be in on the kill beautiful and theyre through eguys adjusting his jammer its flipping through levels backtracking hes keying in another code manually mustve gotten it from one of the inside men hes got a thirtypercent clearance eve stepped onto ballroom level held up her hand from the other direction her secondary team leader mirrored her move at her nod they moved forward fast jam it she ordered and swung through the door police hands in the air up she shouted then sent out a warning blast that nipped the toes of the womans boots as she reached down return fire whizzed past her ear even as she pivoted she saw one of the figures in black jerk back from the stun shot out by one of her team someone shoved over a huge glass display it boomed and shattered like cannon fire through the shouts and scrambles for cover or escape she saw mick send roarke a sunny grin then she was too busy to be amused or baffled as the woman in black hurled a twofoot vase at her head and followed the toss with a screaming leap eve had a halfsecond to decide the undoubted satisfaction of a good bloody handtohand or with some regret she fired her weapon and dropped her opponent into an unconscious heap too bad roarke commented i would have enjoyed watching that he turned toward mick and since there was little left to do slipped the weapon he wasnt supposed to have back into his pocket id like a look at that jammer of yours well now i have a feeling itll be going into police custody a terrible waste mick glanced about as his former associates were rounded up in a slick move he palmed the jammer to roarke then stepped away raising his hands cooperatively in the air there would be times countless times later when roarke would look back and remember that moment how hed stood there amused exhilarated and unguarded hed remember the laughter in micks eyes and how it had switched over in a flash to alarm hed turned rounded on the balls of his feet one hand digging out the weapon fast christ hed always been fast but this time this one time not fast enough gerade had the knife at waist level the blade a hard glint in the brilliant lights his eyes were wild mad terrified roarke heard eve shout saw the stream from her weapon hit even that too late at the same instant mick leaped in front of him and took the knife in the belly well hell mick sent roarke a bemused look as he went down ah no roarke was on his knees pressing a hand to the wound kill blood deep and dark gushed through his fingers little fucker mick managed through hideous waves of pain i never gave him the guts for it never knew he was carrying how bad he get me not so bad damn you used to be handier with a lie i need an ambulance surgical mts eve rushed over took stock and continued to shout into her communicator ive got a man down knife wound to the belly get me medical assistance in here then she stripped off her shirt without a thought and tossed it to roarke so he could staunch the wound now that was a pretty thing to do micks face had already gone from white to gray am i forgiven then eve darling stay quiet she crouched down to check his pulse helps on the way i owed him that you know mick shifted his eyes to roarke i owed you that though i didnt expect to pay so dear christ doesnt anybody have any fucking drugs for a man he fumbled out gripped roarkes hand desperately hold onto me wont you theres a lad youll be all right roarke squeezed as if he could make it so by will alone youll come round you know im done a trickle of blood bubbled through his lips you got my signals didnt you yes i got them just like old times do you remember he moaned had to fight for a breath when we took the mayors house in london cleaning out his parlor while he was upstairs ramming it to his mistress while his wife was visiting her sister in bath he couldnt stop the blood couldnt hold back the stream of it he could smell death creeping close and could only pray mick could not i remember you snuck up the stairs and took videos of it with his own bloody camera and later we sold them back to him and fenced the camera as well aye aye those were good times happiest of my life jesus what a flaming shame it is that my mother bless her black heart should be right after all at least i got the knife in my belly in a fine hotel and not a secondrate pub quiet mick the mts are coming oh screw em he sighed hugely and for one moment his eyes were clear as crystal will you light a candle for me in st pats roarkes throat wanted to close his mind to reject but he nodded aye thats something then roarke you were ever a true friend to me its happy i am for you that you found that one thing see that you keep hold of it slan and turning his face to the side he was gone ah god helpless sorrow flooded over him into him he could do nothing but rock his bloody hand clinging to micks while the sorrow drowned him his eyes were stark naked with it when they lifted to eves while the business of law went on around them she rose signaled her men and the mts who rushed into the room back and went to her husband kneeling with him she put her arms around him drew him in roarke laid his head on his wifes breast and grieved o o he was alone with his thoughts when dawn broke from the window of his bedroom he watched day tremble into life and whisk away the dark layer by thin layer hed hoped for rage had searched for it but he hadnt found it he didnt turn when eve came in but the worst of the ache eased because she was home youve put in a long day lieutenant so have you shed worried all through the hours shed had to leave him to himself she opened her mouth shut it again no she couldnt offer the empty standard line and tell him she was sorry for his loss not to roarke not for this michel gerade has been charged with murder first degree he can scream diplomatic immunity until he chokes it wont save him when roarke didnt respond she dragged a hand through
