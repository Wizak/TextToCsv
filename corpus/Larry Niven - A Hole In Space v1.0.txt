 i once there was a dead man he had been waiting for two hundred years inside a coffin suitably labeled whose outer shell held liquid nitrogen there were frozen clumps of cancer all through his frozen body he had had it bad he was waiting for medical science to find him a cure he waited in vain most varieties of cancer could be cured now but no cure existed for the billions of cell walls ruptured by expanding crystals of ice he had known the risk he had gambled anyway why not hed been dying the vaults held over a million of these frozen bodies why not theyd been dying later there came a young criminal his name is forgotten and his crime is secret but it must have been a terrible one the state wiped his personality for it afterward he was a dead man still warm still breathing even reasonably healthybut empty the state had use for an empty man corbell woke on a hard table aching as if he had slept too long in one position he stared incuriously at a white ceiling memories floated up to him of a doublewailed coffin and sleep and pain the pain was gone he sat up at once and flapped his arms wildly for balance everything felt wrong his arms would not swing right his body was too light his head bobbed strangely on a thin neck he reached frantically for the nearest support which turned out to be a blond young man in a white jumpsuit corbell missed his grip his arms were shorter than he had expected he toppled on his side shook his head and sat up more carefully his arms scrawny knobbyand not his the man in the jumpsuit said are you all right yeah said corbell my god what have they done to me i thought i was ready for anything but this he fought rising panic his throat was rusty but that was all right this was certainly somebody elses body but it didnt seem to have cancer either whats the date how long has it been a quick recovery the checker gave him a plus twentyone ninety your dating you wont have to worry about our dating that sounded ominous cautiously corbell postponed the obvious next question whats happened to me and asked instead why not you wont be joining our society no what then several professions are open to youa limited choice if you dont qualify for any of them well try someone else corbell sat on the edge of the hard operating table his body seemed younger more limber definitely thinner not very clean he was acutely aware that his abdomen did not hurt no matter how he moved he asked and what happens to me ive never learned how to answer that question call it a problem in metaphysics said the checker let me detail whats happened to you so far and then you can decide for yourself there was an empty man still breathing and as healthy as most of society in the year but empty the electrical patterns in the brain the worn paths of nervous reflex the memories the person had all been wiped away as penalty for an unnamed crime and there was this frozen thing your newspapers called you people corpsicles said the blond man i never understood what the tapes meant by that it comes from popsicle frozen sherbet corbell had used the word himself before he became one of them one of the corpsicles the frozen dead frozen within a corpsicles frozen brain were electrical patterns that could be recorded the process would warm the brain and destroy most of the patterns but that hardly mattered because other things must be done too personality was not all in the brain memory rna was concentrated in the brain but it ran all through the nerves and the blood in corbells case the clumps of cancer had to be cut away then the rna could be leeched out of what was left the operation would have left nothing like a human being corbell gathered more like bloody mush whats been done to you is not the kind of thing that can be done twice the checker told him you get one chance and this is it if you dont work out well terminate and try someone else the vaults are full of corpsicles you mean youd wipe my personality corbell said unsteadily but i havent committed a crime dont i have any rights the checker looked stunned then he laughed i thought id explained the man you think you are is dead corbells will was probated long ago his widow damn it i left money to myself no good though the man still smiled his face was impersonal remote unreachable a vet smiles reassuringly at a cat due to be fixed a dead man cant own property that was settled in the courts long ago it wasnt fair to the heirs corbell jerked an unexpectedly bony thumb at his bony chest but im alive now not in law you can earn your new life the state will give you a new birth certificate and citizenship if you give the state good reason corbell sat for a moment absorbing that then he got off the table lets get started then what do you need to know about me your name jerome branch corbell call me pierce the checker did not offer to shake hands neither did corbell perhaps because he sensed the man would not respond perhaps because they were both noticeably overdue for a bath im your checker do you like people im just asking well test you in detail later i get along with the people around me but i like my privacy the checker frowned that narrows it more than you might think the isolationism you called privacy waswell a passing fad we dont have the room for it or the inclination either we cant send you to a colony world i might make a good colonist i like travel youd make terrible breeding stock remember the genes arent yours no you get one choice corbell rammer rammer im afraid so thats the first strange word youve used since i woke up in facthasnt the language changed at all you dont even have an accent part of my profession i learned your speech through rna training many years ago youll learn your trade the same way if you get that far youll be amazed how fast you learn with rna shots to help you along but youd better be right about liking your privacy corbell and about liking to travel too can you take orders i was in the army what does that mean means yes good do you like strange places and faraway people or vice versa both corbell smiled hopefully ive raised buildings all over the world can the world use another architect no do you feel that the state owes you something there could be but one answer to that no but you had yourself frozen you must have felt that the future owed you something not at all it was a good risk i was dying ah the checker looked him over thoughtfully if you had something to believe in perhaps dying wouldnt mean so much corbell said nothing they gave him a short wordassociation test in english that test made corbell suspect that a good many corpsicles must date from near his own death in they took a blood sample then exercised him to exhaustion and took another blood sample they tested his pain threshold by direct nerve stimulationexcruciatingly unpleasantthen took another blood sample they gave him a chinese puzzle and told him to take it apart pierce then informed him that the testing was over after all we already know the state of your health then why the blood samples the checker looked at him for a moment you tell me something about that look gave corbell the creepy feeling that he was on trial for his life the feeling might have been caused only by the checkers rather narrow features his icy blue gaze and abstracted smile still pierce had stayed with him all through the testing watching him as if corbells behavior was a reflection on pierces judgment corbell thought carefully before he spoke you have to know how far ill go before i quit you can analyze the blood samples for adrenalin and fatigue poisons to find out just how much i was hurting just how tired i really was thats right said the checker corbell had survived again he would have given up much earlier on the pain test but at some point pierce had mentioned that corbell was the fourth corpsicle personality to be tested in that empty body he remembered going to sleep that last time two hundred and twenty years ago his family and friends had been all around him acting like mourners he had chosen the coffin paid for vault space and made out his last will and testament but he had not thought of it as dying he had been given a shot the eternal pain had drifted away in a soft haze he had gone to sleep he had drifted off wondering about the future wondering what he would wake to a vault into the unknown world government interplanetary spacecraft clean fusion power strange clothing body paints nudism new principles of architecture floating houses arcologies or crowding poverty all the fuels used up power provided by cheap labor hed thought of those but they didnt worry him the world could not afford to wake him if it was that poor the world he dreamed of in those last moments was a rich world able to support such luxuries as jaybee corbell it looked like he wasnt going to see too damn much of it someone led him away after the testing the guard walked with a meaty hand wrapped around corbells thin upper arm leg irons would have been no more effective had corbell thought of escaping the guard took him up a narrow staircase to the roof the noon sun blazed in a blue sky that shaded to yellow then brown at the horizon green plants grew in closepacked rows on parts of the roof elsewhere many sheets of something glassy were exposed to the sunlight corbell caught one glimpse of the world from a bridge between two roofs it was a cityscape of closepacked buildings all of the same cold cubistic design and corbell was impossibly high on a narrow strip of concrete with no guardrails at all he froze he stopped breathing the guard did not speak he tugged at corbells arm not hard and watched to see what he would do corbell pulled himself together and went on the room was all bunks two walls of bunks with a gap between the light was cool and artificial but outside it was nearly noon could they be expecting him to sleep but jet lag had never bothered corbell the room was big a thousand bunks big most of the bunks were full a few occupants watched incuriously as the guard showed corbell which bunk was his it was the bottommost in a stack of six corbell had to drop to his knees and roll to get into it the bedclothes were strange silky and very smooth even slipperythe only touch of luxury about the place but there was no top sheet nothing to cover him he lay on his side looking out at the dormitory from near floor level now finally he could let himself think im alive earlier it might have been a fatal distraction hed been holding it back i made it im alive and young that wasnt even in the contract but he thought reluctantly because it would not stay buried who is it thats alive some kind of composite a criminal rehabilitated with the aid of some spare chemicals and an electric brainwashing device no jaybee corbell is alive and well if a trifle confused once he had had that rare ability he could go to sleep anywhere anytime but sleep was very far from him now he watched and tried to learn three things were shocking about that place one was the smell apparently perfumes and deodorants had been another passing fad pierce had been overdue for a bath so was the new improved corbell here the smell was rich the second was the loving bunks four of them in a vertical stack twice as wide as the singles and with thicker mattresses the doubles were for loving not sleeping what shocked corbell was that they were right out in the open not hidden by so much as a gauze curtain the same was true of the toilets how can they live like this corbell rubbed his nose and jumpedand cursed at himself for jumping his own nose had been big and fleshy and somewhat shapeless but the nose he now rubbed automatically when trying to think was small and narrow with a straight sharp edge he might very well get used to the smell and everything else before he got used to his own nose eventually he slept some time after dusk a man came for him a broad brawny type wearing a gray jumper and a broad expressionless face the guard was not one to waste words he found corbells bunk pulled corbell out by one arm and led him stumbling away corbell was facing pierce before he was fully awake in annoyance he asked doesnt anyone else speak english no said the checker pierce and the guard guided corbell to a comfortable armchair facing a wide curved screen they put padded earphones on him they set a plastic bottle of clear fluid on a shelf over his head corbell noticed a clear plastic tube tipped with a hypodermic needle breakfast pierce missed the sarcasm youll have one meal each dayafter learning period and exercise he inserted the needle into a vein in corbells arm he covered the wound with a blob of what might have been silly putty corbell watched it all without emotion if he had ever been afraid of needles the months of pain and cancer had worked it out of him a needle was surcease freedom from pain for a while learn now said pierce this knob controls speed the volume is set for your hearing you may replay any section once dont worry about your arm you cant pull the tube loose theres something i wanted to ask you only i couldnt remember the word whats a rammer starship pilot corbell studied the checkers face without profit youre kidding no learn now the checker turned on corbells screen and went away ii a rammer was the pilot of a starship the starships were bussard ramjets they caught interstellar hydrogen in immaterial nets of electromagnetic force compressed and guided it into a ring of pinched force fields and there burned it in fusion fire potentially there was no limit at all on the speed of a bussard ramjet the ships were enormously powerful enormously complex enormously expensive corbell thought it incredible that the state would trust so much value such devastating power and mass to one man to a man two centuries dead why corbell was an architect not an astronaut it was news to him that the concept of the bussard ramjet predated his own death he had watched the apollo xi and xiii flights on television and that had been the extent of his interest in space flight until now now his life depended on his rammer career he never doubted it that was what kept corbell in front of the screen with the earphones on his head for fourteen hours that first day he was afraid he might be tested he didnt understand all he was supposed to learn but he was not tested either the second day he began to get interested by the third day he was fascinated things he had never understoodrelativity and magnetic theory and abstract mathematicshe now grasped intuitively it was marvelous and he ceased to wonder why the state had chosen jerome corbell it was always done this way it made sense all kinds of sense the payload of a starship was small and its operating lifetime was more than a mans lifetime a reasonably safe lifesupport system for one man occupied an unreasonably high proportion of the payload the rest must go for biological package probes a crew of more than one was out of the question a good capable loyal citizen was not likely to be enough of a loner in any case why send a citizen the times would change drastically before a seeder ramship could return the state itself might change beyond recognition a returning rammer must adjust to a whole new culture there was no way to tell in advance what it might be like why not pick a man who had already chosen to adjust to a new culture a man whose own culture was already two centuries dead when the trip started and a man who already owed the state his life the rna was most effective corbell stopped wondering about pierces dispassionately possessive attitude he began to think of himself as property being programmed for a purpose and he learned he skimmed microtaped texts as if they were already familiar the process was heady he became convinced that he could rebuild a seeder ramship with his bare hands given the parts he had loved figures all his life but abstract math had been beyond him until now field theory monopole field equations circuitry design when to suspect the presence of a gravitational point source how to locate it use it avoid it the teaching chair was his life the rest of his timeexercise dinner sleepseemed vague uninteresting he exercised with about twenty others in a room too small for the purpose like corbell the others were lean and stringy in sharp contrast to the brawny wedgeshaped men who were their guards they followed the lead of a guard running in place because there was no room for real running forming in precise rows for scissors jumps pushups situps after fourteen hours in a teaching chair corbell usually enjoyed the jumping about he followed orders and he wondered about the stick in a holster at each guards waist it looked like a cops baton it might have been just thatexcept for the hole in one end corbell never tried to find out sometimes he saw pierce during the exercise periods pierce and the men who tended the teaching chairs were of a third type well fed in adequate condition but just on the verge of being overweight corbell thought of them as old american types from pierce he learned something of the other professions open to a revived corpsicle reprogrammed criminal stoop labor intensive hand cultivation of crops body servants handicrafts any easily taught repetitive work and the hours the corpsicles were expected to work fourteen hours a day and the crowding not that his own situation was much different fourteen hours to study an hour of heavy exercise an hour to eat and eight hours to sleep in a dorm that was two solid walls of people time to work time to eat time to sleep elbowtoelbow every minute the poor bastards he said to pierce what kind of a life is that it lets them repay their debt to the state as quickly as possible be reasonable corbell what would a corpsicle do with his off hours he has no social life he has to learn one by observing citizens many forms of felons labor involve proximity to citizens so they can look up at their betters while they work thats no way to learn it would take i get the feeling were talking about decades of this kind of thing thirty years labor generally earns a man his citizenship that gets him a right to work which then gets him a guaranteed base income he can use to buy education shots and tapes and the medical benefits are impressive we live longer than you used to corbell meanwhile its slave labor anyway none of this applies to me no of course not corbell youre wrong to call it slave labor a slave cant quit you can change jobs anytime you like theres a clear freedom of choice corbell shivered any slave can commit suicide suicide my ass the checker said distinctly if he had anything that could be called an accent it lay in the precision of his pronunciation jerome corbell is dead i could have given you his intact skeleton for a souvenir i dont doubt it corbell saw himself tenderly polishing his own white bones but where could he have kept such a thing in his bunk well then youre a brainwiped criminal justly brainwiped i might add your crime has cost you your citizenship but you still have the right to change professions you need only ask for another urn course of rehabilitation what slave can change jobs at will it would feel like dying nonsense you go to sleep only that when you wake up youve got a different set of memories the subject was an unpleasant one corbell avoided it from then on but he could not avoid talking to the checker pierce was the only man in the world he could talk to on the days pierce failed to show up he felt angry frustrated once he asked about gravitational point sources my time didnt know about those yes it did neutron stars and black holes you had a number of pulsars located by and the mathematics to describe how a pulsar decays the thing to watch for is a decayed pulsar directly in your path dont worry about black holes there are none near your course okay pierce regarded him in some amusement you really dont know much about your own time do you come on i was an architect what would i know about astrophysics we didnt have your learning techniques which reminded him of something pierce you said you learned english with rna injections where does the rna come from pierce smiled and walked away he had little time to remember for that he was almost grateful but very occasionally lying wakeful in his bunk listening to the shshsh of a thousand people breathing and the different sounds from the loving bunks he would remember someone it didnt matter who at first it had been mirabelle always mirabelle mirabelle at the tiller as they sailed out of san pedro harbor tanned square face laughing mouth extravagantly large dark glasses mirabelle older and marked by months of strain saying goodbye at his funeral mirabelle on their honeymoon in twentytwo years they had grown together like two touching limbs of a tree but now he thought of her when he thought of her as two hundred years dead and his niece was dead though he and mirabelle had barely made it to her confirmation the pains had been getting bad then and his daughter ann and all three of his grandchildren just infants they had been it didnt matter who it was that floated up into his mind everyone was dead everyone but him corbell did not want to die he was disgustingly healthy and twenty years younger than he had been at death he found his rammer education continually fascinating if only they would stop treating him like property corbell had been in the army but that was twenty years ago make that two hundred and forty he had learned to take orders but never to like it what had galled him then was the basic assumption of his inferiority but no army officer in corbells experience had believed in corbells inferiority as completely as did pierce and pierces guards the checker never repeated a command never seemed even to consider that corbell might refuse if corbell refused even once he knew what would happen pierce knew that he knew the atmosphere better fitted a death camp than an army they must think im a zombie corbell was careful not to pursue the thought he was a corpse brought back to lifebut not all the way what did they do with the skeleton cremate it the life was not pleasant his lastclass citizenship was galling there was nobody to talk tonobody but pierce whom he was learning to hate he was hungry much of the time the single daily meal filled his belly but it would not stay full no wonder he had wakened so lean more and more he lived in the teaching chair in the teaching chair he was a rammer his impotence was changed to omnipotence starman riding the fire that feeds the suns scooping fuel from interstellar space itself spreading electromagnetic fields like wings hundreds of miles out two weeks after the state had wakened him from the dead corbell was given his course he relaxed in a chair that was not quite a contour couch rna solution dripped into him he no longer noticed the needle the teaching screen held a map of his course in green lines in threespace corbell had stopped wondering how the threedimensional effect was achieved the scale was shrinking as he watched two tiny blobs and a glowing ball surrounded by a faintly glowing corona this part of the course he already knew a linear accelerator would launch him from the moon boost him to bussard ramjet speeds and hurl him at the sun solar gravity would increase his speed while his electromagnetic fields caught and burned the solar wind itself then out still accelerating in the teaching screen the scale shrank horrendously the distances between stars were awesome terrifying van maanans star was twelve lightyears away he would begin deceleration a bit past the midpoint the matching would be tricky he must slow enough to release the biological package probebut not enough to drop him below ram speeds in addition he must use the mass of van maanans star for a course change there was no room for error here then on to the next target which was even further away corbell watched and he absorbed and a part of him seemed to have known everything all along even while another part was gasping at the distances ten stars all yellow dwarfs of the sol type an average of fifteen lightyears apartthough he would cross one gap of fiftytwo lightyears he would almost touch lightspeed on that one oddly enough the bussard ramjet effect would improve at such speeds he could take advantage of the greater hydrogen flux to pull the fields closer to the ship to intensify them ten stars in a closed path a badly bent and battered ring leading him back to the solar system and earth he would benefit from the time he spent near lightspeed though three hundred years would have passed on earth corbel would only have lived through two hundred years of ships timewhich still implied some kind of suspendedanimation technique it didnt hit him the first time through nor the second but repetition had been built into the teaching program it didnt hit him until he was on his way to the exercise room three hundred years three hundred years iii it wasnt night not really outside it must be midafternoon indoors the dorm was always coolly lit barely bright enough to read by if there had been books there were no windows corbell should have been asleep he suffered every minute he spent gazing out into the dorm most of the others were asleep but a couple made noisy love on one of the loving bunks a few men lay on their backs with their eyes open two women talked in low voices corbell didnt know the language he had been unable to find anyone who spoke english corbell was desperately homesick the first few days had been the worst he had stopped noticing the smell if he thought of it he could sniff the traces of billions of human beings otherwise the odor was part of the background noise but the loving bunks bothered him when they were in use he watched when he forced himself not to watch he listened he couldnt help himself but he had turned down two signlanguage invitations from a small brunette with straggly hair and a pretty elfin face make love in public he couldnt he could avoid using the loving bunks but not the exposed toilets that was embarrassing the first time he was able to force himself only by staring rigidly at his feet when he pulled on his jumper and looked up a number of sleepers were watching him in obvious amusement the reason might have been his selfconsciousness or the way he dropped his jumper around his ankles or he may have been out of line a pecking order determined who might use the toilets before whom he still hadnt figured out the details corbell wanted to go home the idea was unreasonable his home was gone and he would have gone with it if it werent for the corpsicle crypts but reason was of no use in this instance he wanted to go home home to mirabelle home to anywhere rome san francisco kansas city brasiliahe had lived in all those places all different but all home corbell had been at home anywherebut he was not at home here and never would be now they would take here away from him even this world of four rooms and two roofs elbowtoelbow people and utter slavery this world which they would not even show him would have vanished when he returned from the stars corbell rolled over and buried his face in his arms if he didnt sleep he would be groggy tomorrow he might miss something essential they had never tested his training not yet not yet he dozed he came awake suddenly already up on one elbow groping for some elusive thought ah why havent i been wondering about the biological package probes a moment later he did wonder what are the biological package probes but the wonder was that he had never wondered he knew what and where they were heavy fat cylinders arranged around the waist of the starships hull ten of these each weighing almost as much as corbells own lifesupport system he knew their mass distribution he knew the clamp system that held them to the hull and he could operate and repair the clamps under various extremes of damage he almost knew where the probes went when released it was just on the tip of his tongue which meant that he had had the rna shot but had not yet seen the instructions but he didnt know what the probes were for it was like that with the ship he realized he knew everything there was to know about a seeder ramship but nothing at all about the other kinds of starships or interplanetary travel or groundtoorbit vehicles he knew that he would be launched by linear accelerator from the moon he knew the design of the acceleratorhe could see it three hundred and fifty kilometers of rings standing on end in a line across a level lunar mare he knew what to do if anything went wrong during launch and that was all he knew about the moon and lunar installations and lunar conquest barring what he had watched on television over two hundred years ago what was going on out there in the two weeks since his arrival he had seen four rooms and two rooftops glimpsed a rectilinear cityscape from a bridge and talked to one man who was not interested in telling him anything what had happened in two hundred years these men and women who slept around him who were they why were they here he didnt even know if they were corpsicle or contemporary contemporary probably not one of them was selfconscious about the facilities corbell had raised buildings in all sorts of strange places but he had never jumped blind he had always brushed up on the language and studied the customs before he went here he had no handle nowhere to start he was lost oh for someone to talk to he was learning in enormous gulps taking in volumes of knowledge so broad that he hadnt realized how rigidly bounded they were the state was teaching him only what he needed to know every bit of information was aimed straight at his profession rammer he could see the reasoning he would be gone for several centuries why should the state teach him anything at all about todays technology customs politics there would be trouble enough when he came back if hecome to that who had taught him to call the government the state how had he come to think of the state as all powerful he knew nothing of its power and extent it must be the rna training with data came attitudes below the conscious level where he couldnt get at them that made his skin crawl they were changing him around again sure why shouldnt the state trust him with a seeder ramship they were feeding him stateoriented patriotism through a silver needle he had lost his people he had lost his world he would lose this one according to pierce he had lost himself four times already a condemned criminal had had his personality wiped four times corbells goddamned skeleton had probably been ground up for phosphates but this was the worst that his beliefs and motivations were being lost bit by bit to the rna solution while the state made him over into a rammer there was nothing that was his he failed to see pierce at the next exercise period it was just as well he was somewhat groggy as usual he ate dinner like a starving man he returned to the dorm rolled into his bunk and was instantly asleep he looked up during study period the next day and found pierce watching him he blinked fighting free of a mass of data on the attitude jet system that bled plasma from the inboard fusion plant that was also the emergency electrical power source and asked pierce whats a biological package probe i would have thought they would teach you that you know what to do with the probes dont you the teaching widget gave me the procedures two days ago slow up for certain systems kill the fields turn a probe loose and speed up again you dont have to aim them no i gather they aim themselves but i have to get them down below a certain velocity or theyll fall right through the system amazing they must do all the rest of it themselves pierce shook his head i wouldnt have believed it well corbell the probes steer for an otherwise terrestrial world with a reducing atmosphere they outnumber oxygennitrogen worlds about three to one in this region of the galaxy and probably everywhere else tooas you may know if your age got that far but what do the probes do theyre biological packages a dozen different strains of algae the idea is to turn a reducing atmosphere into an oxygen atmosphere just the way photosynthetic life forms did for earth something like fifteenlimestentotheeighth years ago the checker smiled barely his small narrow mouth wasnt built to express any great emotion youre part of a big project good lord how long does it take we think about fifty thousand years obviously weve never had the chance to measure it but good lord do you really think the state will last that long does even the state think itll last that long thats not your affair corbell still pierce considered i dont suppose i do or the state does but humanity will last one day there will be men on those worlds its a cause corbell the immortality of the species a thing bigger than one mans life and youre part of it he looked at corbell expectantly corbell was deep in thought he was running a fingertip back and forth along the straight line of his nose presently he asked whats it like out there the stars youre no no no the city i catch just a glimpse of it twice a day cubistic buildings with elaborate carvings at the street level what the bleep is this corbell you dont need to know anything about selerdor by the time you come home the whole city will be changed i know i know thats why i hate to leave without seeing something of the world i could be going out to die corbell stopped he had seen that considering look before but he had never seen pierce actually angry the checkers voice was flat his mouth pinched tight you think of yourself as a tourist so would you if you found yourself two hundred years in the future if you didnt have that much curiosity you wouldnt be human granted that id want to look around i certainly wouldnt demand it as a right what were you thinking when you foisted yourself off on the future did you think the future owed you a debt its the other way around and time you realized it corbell was silent ill tell you something youre a rammer because youre a born tourist we tested you for that you like the unfamiliar it doesnt send you scuttling back to something safe and known thats rare the checkers eyes said and thats why ive decided not to wipe your personality yet his mouth said was there anything else corbell pushed his luck id like a chance to practice with a computer like the ships autopilotcomputer we dont have one but youll get your chance in two days youre leaving then iv the next day he received his instructions for entering the solar system he had been alive for seventeen days the instructions were understandably vague he was to try anything and everything to make contact with a drastically changed state up to and including flashing his attitude jets in binary code he was to start these procedures a good distance out it was not impossible that the state would be at war with something he should be signaling not a warship he found that he would not be utterly dependent on rescue ships he could slow the ramship by braking directly into the solar wind until the proton flux was too slow to help him then whip around sol and back out slowing on attitude jets using whatever hydrogen was left in the inboard tank that was emergency fuel given no previous emergencies a nearly full tank would actually get him to the moon and land him there the state would be through with him once he dropped his last probe it was good of the state to provide for his return corbell thoughtand then he shook himself the state was not altruistic it wanted the ship back now more than ever corbell wanted a chance at the autopilot computer he found one last opportunity to talk to the checker a threehundredyear round tripmaybe two hundred ships time corbell said i get some advantage from relativity but pierce you dont really expect me to live two hundred years do you with nobody to talk to the coldsleep treatment even so pierce frowned youve been briefed on the coldsleep procedure but you havent studied medicine im told that cold sleep has a rejuvenating effect over long periods youll spend perhaps twenty years awake and the rest in cold sleep the medical facilities are automatic youve been instructed how to use them do you think wed risk your dying out there between the stars where it would be impossible to replace you was there anything else you wanted to see me about yes he had decided not to broach the subject now he changed his mind id like to take a woman with me the lifesupport system would hold two of us i worked it out wed need another coldsleep chamber of course for two weeks this had been the only man corbell could talk to at first he had found pierce unfathomable unreadable almost inhuman since then he had learned to read the checkers face to some extent pierce was deciding whether to terminate jerome corbell and start over it was a close thing but the state had spent considerable time and effort on jerome corbell it was worth a try and so pierce said that would take up some space you would have to share the rest between you i do not think you would survive but what we can do is this we can put the mind of a woman in your computer the computer is voicecontrolled and her voice would be that of a woman any type of woman you choose a subplot enclosing the personality of a woman would leave plenty of circuitry for the computers vital functions i dont think you quite get the point of look here corbell we know you dont need a woman if you did you would have taken one by now and we would have wiped you and started over youve lived in the dormitory for two weeks and you have not used the mating facilities once damn it pierce do you expect me to make love in public i cant exactly but corbell you learned to use the toilet didnt you because you had to you know what to do with a woman but you are one of those men fortunate enough not to need one otherwise you could not be a rammer if corbell had hit the checker then he would have done it knowing that it meant his death and knowing that he would have killed pierce for forcing him to it something like ten seconds elapsed pierce watched him in frank curiosity when he saw corbell relax he said you leave tomorrow your training is finished goodbye corbell walked away clenching and unclenching his fists the dormitory had been a test he knew it now could he cross a narrow bridge with no handrails then he was not pathologically afraid of falling could he spend two hundred years alone in the cabin of a starship then the silent people around him five above his head hundreds to either side must make him markedly uncomfortable could he live twenty waking years without a woman surely he must be impotent he returned to the dorm after dinner they had replaced the bridge with a nearly invisible slab of glass corbell snarled and crossed ahead of the guard the guard had to hurry to keep up he stood between two walls of occupied bunks looking around him then he did a stupid thing he had already refrained from killing the checker he must have decided to live what he did then was stupid he knew it he looked about him until he found the slender darkhaired girl with the elfin face watching him curiously from near the ceiling he climbed the rungs between the bunks until his face was level with hers the gesture he needed was a quick formalized one but he didnt know it in english he asked come with me she nodded brightly and followed him down the ladder by then it seemed to corbell that the dorm was alive with barely audible voices the odd one the rammer trainee certainly a number of the wakeful turned on their sides to watch he felt their eyes on the back of his neck as he zipped open his gray jumpsuit and stepped out of it the dormitory had been a series of tests at least two of those eyes would record his doings for pierce but to corbell they were just like all the others all the eyes curiously watching to see how the speechless one would make out and sure enough he was impotent it was the eyes and he was naked the girl was at first concerned then pitying she stroked his cheek in apology or sympathy and then she went away and found someone else corbell lay listening to them gazing at the bunk above him he waited for eight hours finally a guard came to take him away by then he didnt care what they did with him v he didnt start to care until the guards floating jeep pulled up beneath an enormous cartridge standing on end then he began to wonder it was too small to be a rocket ship but it was they strapped him into a contour couch one of three in a cabin with a single window there were the guard and corbell and a man who might have been pierces second cousin once removed the pilot he had the window corbels heartbeat quickened he wondered how it would be it was as if he had suddenly become very heavy he heard no noise except right at the beginning a sound like landing gear being raised on an airplane not a rocket corbell thought possibly the ferry ships drive was electromagnetic in nature he remembered the tricks a bussard ramjet could play with magnetic fields he was heavy and he hadnt slept last night he went to sleep when he woke he was in freefall nobody had tried to tell him anything about freefall the guard and pilot were watching screw you said corbell it was another test he got the straps open and pushed himself over to the window the pilot laughed caught him and held him while he closed a protective cover over the instruments then he let go and corbell drifted in front of the window his belly was revolving eccentrically his inner ear was going crazy his testicles were tight up against his groin and that didnt feel good either he was falling falling corbell snarled within his mind and tried to concentrate on the window but the earth was not visible neither was the moon just a lot of stars bright enoughquite bright in facteven more brilliant than they had been above a small boat anchored off catalina island on many nights long ago he watched them for some time trying to keep his mind off that fallingelevator sensation he wasnt about to get himself disqualified now they ate aboard in freefall corbell copied the others picking chunks of meat and potatoes out of a plastic bag of stew pulling them through a membrane that sealed itself behind his pick of all the things im going to miss he told the broadfaced guard im going to enjoy missing you most you and your goddamn staring eyes the guard smiled placidly and waited to see if corbell would get sick they landed a day after takeoff on a broad plain where the earth sat nestled among sharp lunar peaks one day instead of three the state had expended extra power to get him here but an earthmoon flight must be a small thing these days the plain was black with blast pits it must have been a landing field for decades transparent bubbles clustered near the runway end of the linear accelerator there were buildings and groves of trees inside the bubbles spacecraft of various shapes and sizes were scattered about the plain the biggest was corbels ramship a silver skyscraper lying on its side the probes were in place giving the ship a thickwaisted appearance to corbells trained eye it looked ready for takeoff he was awed he was humbled he was proud he tried to sort out his own reactions from rnainspired emotions and probably failed corbell donned his suit first while the pilot and guard watched to see if he would make a mistake he took it slow the suit came in two pieces a skintight rubbery body stocking and a helmet attached to a heavy backpack on the chest was a white spiral with tapered ends the sign of the state an electric cart came for them apparently corbell was not expected to know how to walk on an airless world he thought to head for one of the domes but the guard steered straight for the ship it was a long way off it had become unnervingly large when the guard stopped underneath a fat cylinder the size of a house swelled above the jeep the lifesupport section bound to the main hull by a narrower neck the smaller dome at the nose must be the control room the guard said now you inspect your ship you can talk yes yesterday a quick course oh three things wrong with your ship you find all three you tell me i tell him him oh the pilot then what then you fix one of the things we fix the others then we launch you it was another test of course maybe the last corbell was furious he started immediately with the field generators and gradually he forgot the guard and the pilot and the sword still hanging over his head he knew this ship as it had been with the teaching chair so it was with the ship itself corbells impotence changed to omnipotence the power of the beast the intricacy the potential thethe hydrogen tank held far too much pressure that wouldnt wait ill slurry this now he told the guard get a tanker over there to top it off he bled hydrogen gas slowly through the valve lowering the fuels vapor pressure without letting fuel boil out the valve itself when he finished the liquid hydrogen would be slushy with frozen crystals under nearvacuum pressure he finished the external inspection without finding anything more it figured the banks of dials would hold vastly more information than a mans eyes could read through opaque titanalloy skin the airlock was a tripledoor type not so much to save air as to give him an airlock even if he lost a door somehow corbell shut the outer door used the others when green lights indicated he could he looked down at the telltales under his chin as he started to unclamp his helmet vacuum he stopped the ships gauges said air the suits said vacuum which was right come to that he hadnt heard any hissing just how soundproof was his helmet just like pierce to wait and see if he would take off his helmet in a vacuum well how to test hah corbell found the head turned on a water faucet the water splashed oddly in lunar gravity it did not boil did a flaw in his suit constitute a flaw in the ship corbell doffed his helmet and continued his inspection there was no way to test the ramfield generators without causing all kinds of havoc in the linear accelerator he checked out the telltales then concentrated on the lifesupport mechanisms the tailored plants in the air system were alive and well but the urea absorption mechanism was plugged somehow that would be a dirty job he postponed it he decided to finish his inspection the state might have missed something it was his ship his life the coldsleep chamber was like a great coffin a corpsicle coffin corbell shuddered remembering two hundred years spent waiting in liquid nitrogen he wondered again if jerome corbell were really deadand then he shook off the thought and went to work no flaws in the coldsleep system he went on the computer was acting vaguely funny he had a hell of a time tracing the problem there was a minute break in one superconducting circuit so small that some current was leaking through anyway by inductance bastards he donned his suit and went out to report the guard heard him out consulted with the other man then told corbell you did good now finish with the toppingoff procedure we fix the other things theres something wrong with my suit too new suit aboard now i want some time with the computer i want to be sure its all right now we fix it good when you top off fuel you leave that suddenly corbell felt a vast sinking sensation the whole moon was dropping away under him they launched him hard corbell saw red before his eyes felt his cheeks dragged far back toward his ears the ship would be all right it was built to stand electromagnetic eddy currents from any direction he survived he fumbled out of his couch in time to watch the moonscape flying under him receding a magnificent view there were days of freefall he was not yet moving at ramscoop speeds but the state had aimed him inside the orbit of mercury straight into the thickening solar wind protons thick fuel for the ram fields and a boost from the suns gravity meanwhile he had most of a day to play with the computer at one point it occurred to him that the state might monitor his computer work he shrugged it off probably it was too late for the state to stop him now in any case he had said too much already he finished his work with the computer and got answers that satisfied him at higher speeds the ram fields were selfreinforcing they would support themselves and the ship he could find no upper limit to the velocity of a seeder ramship with all the time in the world then he sat down at the control console and began to play with the fields they emerged like invisible wings he felt the buffeting of badly controlled bursts of fusing hydrogen he kept the fields close to the ship fearful of losing the balance here where the streaming of protons was so uneven he could feel how he was doing he could fly this ship by the seat of his pants with rna training to help him he felt like a giant this enormous phallic germinal flying thing of metal and fire carrying the seeds of life for worlds that had never known life he roared around the sun and out the thrust dropped a bit then because he and the solar wind were moving in the same direction but he was catching it in his nets like wind in a sail guiding it and burning it and throwing it behind him the ship moved faster every second this feeling of powerenormous masculine powerhad to be partly rna training at this point he didnt care part was him jerome corbell around the orbit of mars when he was sure that a glimpse of sunlight would not blind him he instructed the computer to give him a full view the walls of the spherical control room seemed to disappear the sky blazed around him there were no planets nearby all he saw of the sky was myriads of brilliant pinpoints mostly white some showing traces of color but there was more to see fusing hydrogen made a ghostly ring of light around his ship it would grow stronger so far his thrust was low somewhat more than enough to balance the thin pull of the sun he started his turn around the orbit of jupiter by adjusting the fields to channel the proton flow to the side that helped him thrust but it must have puzzled pierce and the faceless state they would assume he was playing with the fields testing his equipment maybe his curve was gradual it would take them a while to notice this was not according to plan originally he had intended to be halfway to van maanans star before he changed course that would have given him fifteen years head start in case he was wrong in case the state could do something to stop him even now that would have been wise but he couldnt do it pierce might die in thirty years pierce might never know what corbell had doneand that thought was intolerable his thrust dropped to almost nothing in the outer reaches of the system protons were thin out here but there were enough to push his velocity steadily higher and that was what counted the faster he went the greater the proton flux he was on his way he was beyond neptune when the voice of pierce the checker came to him saying this is peerssa for the state peerssa for the state answer corbell do you have a malfunction can we help we cannot send rescue but we can advise peerssa for the state peerssa for the state corbell smiled tightly peerssa the checkers name had changed pronunciation in two hundred years pierce had slipped back to an old habit rna lessons forgotten he must be upset about something corbell spent twenty minutes finding the moon base with his signal laser the beam was too narrow to permit sloppy handling when he had it adjusted he said this is corbel for himself corbell for himself im fine how are you he spent more time at the computer one thing had been bothering him the return to sol system he planned to be away longer than the state would have expected suppose there was nobody on the moon when he returned it was a problem he found if he could reach the moon on his remaining fuel he could reach the earths atmosphere the ship was durable it would stand a meteoric reentry but his attitude jets would not land him properly speaking unless he could cut away part of the ship the ramfield generators would no longer be needed then well he would work it out somehow plenty of time plenty of time the answer from the moon took nine hours peerssa for the state corbell we dont understand you are far off course your first target was to be van maanans star instead you seem to be curving around toward sagittarius there is no known earthlike world in that direction what the bleep do you think youre doing repeating peerssa for the state peerssa corbell tried to switch it off the teaching chair hadnt told him about an off switch finally and it should have been sooner he told the computer to switch the receiver off somewhat later he located the lunar base with his signal laser and began transmission this is corbel for himself corbell for himself im getting sick and tired of having to find you every damn time i want to say something so ill give you this all at once im not going to any of the stars on your list its occurred to me that the relativity equations work better for me the faster i go if i stop every fifteen lightyears to launch a probe the way you want me to i could spend two hundred years at it and never get anywhere whereas if i just aim the ship in one direction and keep it going i can build up a ferocious tau factor it works out that i can reach the galactic hub in twentyone years ships time if i hold myself down to one gravity acceleration and pierce i just cant resist the idea you were the one who called me a born tourist remember well the stars in the galactic hub arent like the stars in the arms and theyre packed a quarter to a half lightyear apart according to your own theories it must be passing strange in there so ill go exploring on my own maybe ill find some of your reducingatmosphere planets and drop the probes there maybe i wont ill see you in about seventy thousand years your time by then your precious state may have withered away or youll have colonies on the seeded planets and some of them may have broken loose from you ill join one of them or corbell thought it through rubbing the straight sharp line of his nose ill have to check it out on the computer he said but if i dont like any of your worlds when i get back there are always the clouds of magellan ill bet they arent more than twentyfive years away ships time the alibi machine mcallister left the party around eight oclock out of tobacco he told his host apologetically the police if they got that far would discover that that had been a little white lie there were other parties in greenwich village on a saturday night and he would be attending one in about he estimated twenty minutes he took the elevator down there was a displacement booth in the lobby he dropped a coin in the slot smiling fleetingly at himselfhe had almost forgotten to take coins and dialed a moment later he was outside his own penthouse door in queens he had saved himself the time to let himself in by leaving his briefcase under a potted plant earlier this evening he tipped the pot picked up the briefcase and stepped back into the booth his conservative paper business suit made him look as if he had just come from work and the briefcase completed the picture nicely he dialed three times the first number took him to kennedy international the second to los angeles international long distance flicks required the additional equipment available only at what had once been airports equipment to compensate for the difference in rotational velocity between different points on the earth the third number took him to lucas andersons home in the high sierras it was five oclock here and the summer sun was still high mcallister found himself gasping as he left the booth why would anderson want to live at eight thousand feet for the view he supposed and because anderson a freelance writer did not have to leave his home as often as normal people did but there was also his love of privacy and distrust of people he rang the bell andersons look was more surprised than welcoming it was tomorrow after lunch remember i know but mcallister hefted the briefcase your royalty accounts arrived this afternoon a day earlier than we expected i got to thinking why not have it out now why let you go on thinking youve been cheated a day longer than uh huh anderson had an imposing scowl he gave no indication that he was ready to change his mindand mcallister had nothing to change it with anyway publishing companies had always fudged a little on their royalty statements sometimes they took a bit too much and then a writer might rear back on his hind legs and demand an audit the difference here was that brace books didnt know what mcallister had been doing with lucas andersons accounts lets just go over these papers he said with a trace of impatience anderson nodded without enthusiasm and stepped back inviting him in did he have company a glance into the dining nook told mcallister that he did not a dinner setting for one laid out with mathematical precision by one or another of andersons machines andersons house was a display case of labor saving devices how to get him into the living room but anderson was leading him there it was not a big house and a hostile publishers assistant would not be invited into the semisacred writing room anderson stopped in the middle of the room spread it on the coffee table mcallister circled anderson as he reached into the briefcase his fingers brushed papers and then the gyrojet and suddenly his pulse was thundering in his ears he was afraid hed spent considerable time plotting this hed even typed outlines as for a mystery novel and burned them afterward he could produce the royalty statements they were there in his briefcase though they would not stand up or his hand unseen within the briefcase clenched into a fist he was between anderson and the picture window when he produced the gyrojet the gyrojet an ancient toy or weapon depending it was a rocket pistol made during the s then discontinued this one had been stolen from someones house and later sold to mcallister secretly a full twelve years ago a rocket pistol how could any former buck rogers fan have turned down a rocket pistol he had never shown it to anyone he had had the thought even then that it would be untraceable should he ever want to kill somebody the true weapon was the rocket slug the gun looked like a toy flimsy aluminum perforated down the barrel anderson might have thought it was a toybut anderson was bright he got the point immediately he turned to run mcallister shot him twice in the back he left by the front door he grinned as he passed the displacement booth fifteen years ago there had been people who put their displacement booths inside in the living room say but it made burglaries much too easy the alibi machine the newspapers had called it then they still did the advent of the displacement booths had produced one hell of a crime wave when a man in say hawaii could commit murder in chicago and be back in the time it would take him to visit the mens room it did make things a bit difficult for the police mcallister himself would be at a party in new york ten minutes from now but first he walked around to the back of the house and stood a moment looking into the picture window hed thrown a paper tablecloth over andersons body glass particles on the body would be a giveaway hed take the tablecloth with him and how were the police to know that it was the third bullet rather than the first that had shattered the picture window but if it was the first bullet then the killer must have been someone anderson would not let into the house mcallister fired into the picture window glass showered inward there was the scream of an alarm mcallister stood rooted it was a terrible sound and in these quiet hills it would carry forever he hadnt expected alarms there must be a secondary system continually in operationhell with it mcallister ran into the house picked up the tablecloth and ran out glass particles all over his shoes never mind his shoes and everything else he was wearing were paper and there was a change of clothing in the briefcase hed dump gun and all at the next number he dialed the altitude was getting to him he was panting like a bloodhound when he closed the booth door and dialed los angeles international then a lakeside resort in new mexico the police could hardly search every lake in the country nothing happened he dialed again and again while the alarm screamed to the hills help i am being robbed when his hand was shaking too badly to dial he backed out of the glass door and stood looking at the booth this hadnt been in any of the outlines the booth wouldnt let him out in all this vastness he was locked in locked in with the body it was two hours before the helicopter from fresno arrived even so they made good speed only a police organization could get a copter in the air that fast who else dealt with situations in which one could not simply flick in the copter landed in front of the anderson house after some trouble picking it out of the wild landscape police lieutenant richard donaho climbed out carefully as soon as the dust had stopped swirling for the benefit of the pilot his face was unnaturally blank the fear of death had taken him the instant the blades started whirling around and it was only now leaving him with the motor off the alarm from the house was an intolerable scream lieutenant donaho moved around to the side of the machine opened a hatch and switched in the portable jumpshift unit he stood back as men and equipment began pouring through uniformed men moved toward the house spreading out donaho didnt interfere he wasnt expecting anything startling it was going to be cold burglary the burglar vanished quite away it was a smallish onestory house in a wild and beautiful setting halfway up a mountain the sun was still bright though it had almost touched the western peaks the sky was dark blue almost lavender houses were scarce upslope and far scarcer downslope there were no roads no roads at all this place must have been uninhabited until twenty years ago when jumpshift inc had revolutionized transportation the shrill of the alarm stopped in the sudden silence a policeman walked briskly from around the side of the house lieutenant he called its not burglary its murder theres a dead man on the living room rug all right said donaho he called homicide captain hennessey flicked in with the hot summer air of fresno around him it puffed out when he opened the door and he felt the dry chill of the mountains his ears popped he stepped out of the belly of the copter looking for the nearest man donaho whats happening dopaho nodded at the uniformed man whose name was fisher fisher said its around in back picture window shattered man inside dead with two holes in his back thats as far as weve got want to come look sir in a minute what was wrong with the displacement booth never mind i see it it was obvious even from here the displacement booth was a standard model a glass cylinder rounded at the top with a dial system set in the side its curved door was blocked open by a chunk of granite so thats why you needed the copter said hennessey hmm he hadnt expected that it was an old trick any burglar knew enough to block the displacement booth door before trying to rob a house if he set off an alarm the police couldnt flick in and he could generally run next door and use the displacement booth there but here i wonder how he got out said hennessey he couldnt set the rock and then use the booth maybe he couldnt use the booth anyway some alarms lock the transmitter on the booth so people can still flick in but nobody can flick out donaho shifted impatiently this was a murder investigation and he had not yet so much as seen the body hennessey looked down a rocky wooded slope darkening with dusk hikers would call this legbreaker country he said but thats how he did it theres no other way he could get out when the booth wouldnt send him anywhere he blocked the door open and set out for hmm the nearest house was half a mile away it was bigger than andersons house with a pool and a stretch of lawn and a swing and a slide all clearly visible in miniature from this vantage point to there i think hed rather go down than up hed have to circle that stretch of chaparral captain do you really think so i wouldnt try walking through that youd stay here and wait for the fuzz its not that bad youd make two miles an hour without a backpack hell he might even have planned it this way i hope he left footprints well want to know if he wore hiking boots hennessey scowled not that itll do us any good he could have reached the nearest house a good hour ago that doesnt mean he could use the booth someone might have seen him hmm right or he might have broken an ankle anyway mightnt he donaho get that copter up and start searching the area well have someone in fresno question the neighbors with the alarm blaring like that they might have been more than usually alert lieutenant donaho had not greatly enjoyed his first helicopter flight which had ended twenty minutes ago now he was in the air again and the slender wings were beating round and round over his head and the ground was an uncomfortable distance below you dont like this much the pilot said perceptively he was a stocky man of about forty not much donaho agreed it would have been nice if he could close his eyes but he had to keep watching the scenery there were trees a man could hide in and a brook a man might have drunk from he watched for movement he watched for footprints the scenery was both too close and too far down and it wobbled dizzyingly youre too young said the pilot you young ones dont know anything about speed donaho was amused i can go anywhere in the world at the speed of light hell that isnt speed ever been on a motorcycle no i was using a chopper when they started putting up the jumpshift booths all over the place man it was wonderful it was like all the cars just evaporated it took years but it didnt seem that way they left all those wonderful freeways for just us you know what the most dangerous thing was about riding a chopper it was cars yah same with flying i dont own a plane god knows i havent got the money but ive got a friend who does its a lot more fun now that weve got the airfields to ourselves no more big planes no more problem refueling either we used to worry about running out of gas uh huh a thought struck donaho what do you know about offtheroad vehicles not that much theyre still made i cant think of one small enough to fit into a displacement booth if thats what youre thinking i was hennessey thinks the killer might have set off the alarm deliberately if he did he might have brought an offtheroad vehicle along are you sure he couldnt get one into a booth no im not the pilot looked down considering its too damn steep far a groundeffect vehicle hed leave tire tracks what would they look like oh god you mean it dont you look for two parallel lines say three to six feet apart most tires are corrugated and youd see that too there was nothing like that in sight then i know guys who might try to take a chopper across this might break their stupid necks too thatd leave a trail like a caterpillar track but corrugated i cant believe anyone would walk across this it looked like half a mile of bad stairs back there and how would he get through those bushes crawl not that id try it myself but they dont want me for the gas chamber the pilot laughed can you see the poor bastard standing in the booth dialing and dialing lucas anderson had been a big man he had left a big corpse sprawled across a sapphireblue rug his arms stretched way out big hands clutching andersons arms had been dragging a dead weight one of the holes in his back was high up just over the spine and men moved about him doing things that would not help him and probably would not catch his killer someone had come here expressly to kill lucas anderson he would have some connection with him in business or friendship or enmity he might have left traces of himself and if he had these men would find him but the alibi machine might have put him anywhere by now with a valid passport he could be in algiers or moscow andersons bookshelf of his own works showed some science fiction titles his killer could have been a spacemanand then he could be in mars orbit by now or moving toward jupiter at lightspeed as a kind of superneutrino yet they were learning things about him the cleaning machines had come on as soon as the alarm had been switched off an alert policeman had got to them before they could do anything about the mess there was no glass on the body there was no glass under the body either now thats not particularly odd the man in the white coat said to hennessey i mean the pattern of explosion might have done that but it means we cant say one way or another he could have been dead when the shot was fired sure or the other way around no glass on him could mean he came running in when he heard all the noise just a minute the man in the white coat said quickly and he stooped far down to examine andersons big shoes with a magnifying glass i was wrong no glass here hmm anderson must have let him in then he shot out the window to fox us and set off the alarm that wasnt too bright in a population of three hundred million americans you could usually find a dozen suspects for any given murder victim an intelligent killer would simply risk it someday hennessey thought when the black mood was on him someday murder would be an accepted thing it was that hard to stop but this one might not have escaped yet id like to get the body to the lab said the man in the white coat cant do an autopsy here i want to probe for the bullets theyd tell us how far away he was shot from if we can get a gun like it to do test firing if unusual gun the man laughed very the slug in the wail was a solidfuel rocket four nozzles the size of pinholes angled to spin the thing impact like a hmm hennessey asked of nobody in particular get any footprints someone answered yessir in the grass outside paper shoes small feet definitely not andersons paper shoes could he have planned to hike out brought a pair of hiking boots to change into but it began to look like the killer hadnt planned anything so elaborate the dining setup would indicate that anderson hadnt been expecting visitors if premeditated murder could be called casual this had been a casual murder except for the picture window police had searched the house and found no sign of theft later they could learn what enemies anderson had made in life for now for now the body should be moved to fresno call the copter back hennessey told someone theyd need the portable jumpshift unit in the side when the wind from the copter had died hennessey stepped forward with the rest with the team that carried the stretcher he asked of donaho any luck none said lieutenant donaho he climbed out stood a moment to feel solid ground beneath his feet no footprints no tracks nobody hiding where we could see him theres a lot of woods where he could be hiding though look its after sunset captain get us an infrared scanner and well go up again when it gets dark good more time for the killer to movebut there were only half a dozen houses be could try for hennessey thought he could get permission from the owners to turn off their booths for awhile maybe but i dont believe it donaho was saying nobody could travel a mile through that and the word from fresno is that the only unoccupied house is two miles off to the side never a boy scout were you no why we used to hike these hills with thirty pounds of backpack still hmm he seemed to be studying donahos face is andersons booth back in operation yes you were right captain it was hooked to the alarm then we can send the copter home and use that listen donaho i may have been going at this wrong let me ask you something most of the police were gone by ten the body was gone there was fingerprint powder on every polished surface and glass all over the living room hennessey and donabo and the uniformed man named fisher sat at the dining table drinking coffee made in the anderson kitchen guess ill be going home donaho said presently he made no reference to what they had planned they watched through the window as lieutenant donaho brilliantly lighted vanished within the glass booth after that they drank coffee and talked and watched the stars were very bright it was almost midnight before anything happened then i rustling soundand something burst into view from upslope a shadowy figure in full flight it was in the displacement booth before hennessey and fisher had even reached the front door the booth light showed every detail of a lean dark man in a rumpled paper business suit one hand holding a briefcase the other dialing frantically dialing again while one eye in a shyly averted face watched two armed men strolling up to the booth no use hennessey called pleasantly lieutenant donaho had it cut off as soon as he flicked out the man released a ragged sigh we want the gun the man considered then he handed out the briefcase the gun was in there the man came out after it he had a beaten look where were you hiding hennessey asked up there in the bushes where i could see you i knew youd turn the booth back on sooner or later why didnt you just walk down to the nearest house the lean man looked at him curiously then he looked down across a black slope to where a spark of light showed one window still glowing in a distant house oh my god i never thought of that the last days of the permanent floating riot club in its heyday the club had numbered around ninety and it was the most exclusive club in the world now a third of its members had quit and a third were in prison or awaiting trial and the remaining thirtyodd active members had lost a crucial something confidence enthusiasm esprit de corps call it what you will we always knew it was coming said benny sherman he was a thickset man short and broad made mostly of black hair and muscle he waved a big stubbyfingered hand at the south wall of the main room where a commentator was spreading news of the outside world across a wallsized screen it was all over that screen for years central riot control in nebraska pictures of the building going up they told us just how it was gonna work they gave us a completion date twenty of us quit that same day nobody said anything the voice of the commentator came through at low volume speaking of the rumor that the soviets had developed a selfteleporting spy cloak the teevee screen was never off in the permanent floating riot club that spy cloak james getitall said wistfully thatd be nice to have when a flash crowd goes sour i wonder what are the chances of stealing one sure said willie lordon he was a featherweight pinchfaced man all birdlike bones and acid sarcasm cops coming at you from all directions what do you do you roll yourself up in your spy cloak and as soon as it forms a closed surface its a displacement booth where are you now he paused for effect in a top secret headquarters in the kremlin you idiot better that than central riot control willie snorted ive been there said benny sherman inside its like a rose bowl without seats receiver booths all around the lip of the bowl you try to flick out of a place where the riot control is on and you wind up dropping out the bottom of the booth you slide all the way down to the bottom of the bowl and you wait there with everyone else till the cops get around to you i got out by the skin of my teeth by throwing away your take said willie lordon clearly the idea disgusted him it hurt too i had a diamond the size of an almond if it was real and a half dozen good watches and there wasnt any way to tell wed gone on riot control i just had to guess the flash crowd had gone on long enough youre a genius said willie im losing my nerve benny said mournfully six times this past year weve flicked into flash crowds and three times i threw away everything i had because it looked like the cops had time to put us under riot control once i was right twice i was wrong thats just not good enough he braced himself i think ill quit there hed said it shh said lou garcia waving them to silence he turned the volume control louder the teevee newscaster was saying flash crowd in downtown topeka seems to have developed due to a heavily advertised sale at bloomingdales shh hell i quit benny bellowed over the racket we made a lot of money the last ten years i want to stay outside to enjoy it most of the members were on their feet eyes on the screen a flash crowd meant business james getitall was at the computer terminal getting the numbers of displacement booths in the affected area an endless strip of paper ran from the slot thirtyodd copies of the list lou garcia favored benny with a sardonic look youre giving up your share of the treasury that was a low blow benny stood a moment considering then you can have it he said and walked out he turned for one last look at the club before going on it seemed likely that he would never see it again the club was a three story brick building of prestressed concrete made to look like old brick the brick concrete was chipped in spots and dark with age one among several blocks of older buildings the luxuries were inside luxuries bought with club dues now other members were filing out the entrance and dividing there heading for streetcorner displacement booths half a block away in each direction willie lordon was flexing his fingers as he walked he carried a small electric knife that would slice out the bottom of a citizens lock pocket without alerting him if there was sufficient noise and jostling to distract him james getitall jogged along with the tense serious look of a player who knows that his team depends on him lou garcia stood at the entrance grinning broadly as he watched them go they filed into glass cylinders with rounded tops dialed and disappeared one by one benny watched them wistfully he had helped to found the club and they didnt even know he was gone he remembered a september night ten years ago the night orrie black had proposed the idea he and orrie and lou garcia and some others who had gotten their start when the booths were new in those days you could get the booth number of a house and just flick into the living room or entrance hall you could make a strike just by dialing at random until you hit but the citizens had wised up and started putting their booths outside and now half a dozen exburglars had gathered at a topless beer and pool place think it out orrie black had said any time something interesting happens anywhere in the country some newstaper is going to report it if its interesting enough people are going to flick in to see it from all over the country now just think about that with these long distance booths you can get from anywhere to anywhere else just by dialing three numbers if the crowd gets big enough a lot more people flick in just to see a flash crowd plus more newstapers plus any kind of agitator looking to shove his sign in front of a camera plus looters and pickpockets and cops before anyone knows it youve got a riot going with everypne breaking windows and grabbing whats in them so why shouldnt we be the ones breaking windows the key the crucial thing is for there to be enough of us to help each other out we should all be flicking in at once and theyd tried it out in the third watts riot which had lasted a full day and a half these days you were lucky if a flash crowd lasted two hours and orrie black was in prison and the others had gone their waysall but benny and lou garcia the club dues not everyone had liked that idea benny included half your take but it had paid off and not just for the clubhouse the treasury had paid defense lawyers and hospital fees flicking into a riot was dangerous even for a pro there must be a lot of it left in lou garcias care quitting had cost benny his share of that stillhe shuddered remembering the last one despite previous experience he hadnt expected it to grow so big so fast something trivial had started it as usual a line of people waiting for tickets to a top game show had gotten out of hand too many people not enough seats somebody getting pushy and wham a pocket riot until it hit the news and then a few hundred more flicked in to see the damn fools fighting benny had flicked into the middle of it already looking around for the storesand the cops the cops had learned something in past years it wasnt that there were so many of them it was their deployment they tended to guard the most valuable store windows benny had spotted a furriers a small jewelry display a home appliance storeall guarded by cops he had seen clerks moving within the furriers window trying to get the goods out of harms way he had pushed his way out into the swarm newstapers with gyrostabilized cameras a scattering of handlettered signs held high and a hell of a lot of people caught up in it somehow unable to flick out because the displacement booths filled with incoming passengers before anyone could get in a lot of incoming passengers had been club members a normal enough crowd but so thick the crowd had surged suddenly downing the cops in front of van cleef and arpels benny had seen the small wiry man who smashed the window and scooped and began pushing his way frantically toward the nearest booth toward benny and he was not a club member as he passed benny benny had hit him in the stomach and rifled the mans pockets while he was still doubled over hed had to fight to keep his feet but the crowding was such that nobody had noticed what he was doing the crowd had surrounded the booth before he turned around benny had glimpsed a pair of cops holding back the crowd letting them into the booth one at a time the next nearest booth was a block away through an incredible sea of feet and elbows his squat massive body had been an advantage as he plowed through it long before he reached the booth benny had noticed that nobody was flicking in any more he had dropped the rings and watches then regretfully he remembered the sickening moment just after dialing when the hinged bottom dropped out of the booth and he was sliding downhill others were sliding after him all around the rim of the bowl and there were hundreds at the bottom picking themselves up some looking relieved some furious the cops had been on a raised railed platform at the center of the bowl a loudspeaker had been telling the crowd what they already knew that they were at united states central riot control that they would be processed as fast as possible and released the police had searched him photographed him and sent off the photos for comparison with records of previous riots his face was on record he had been in other flash crowds they had held him they had held quite a lot of people many of whom werent even club members just a coincidence he had told the police its funny how many flash crowds i run into never been hurt in one though i guess im lucky they couldnt prove different theyd had to let him go but they knew benny hunched his big shoulders remembering the contempt in their eyes they knew and his face and fingerprints had been caught in one more flash crowd theyd get him if he kept it up it was time to quit what about the treasury when most of the members had quit or been caught and sent up would it be divided by the last few lou garcia must think so that was why he had gone with the others that was why he was grinning benny couldnt bring himself to like the idea he had collected his share of the treasury but what could he do if he stayed in the club but avoided the flash crowds the others would get tired of collecting his share of the dues for him theyd beat him up and kick him out it had happened before club activities depended tm there being enough members in a flash crowd to help each other goldbricks were not tolerated he stood in a corner booth coin in hand wondering where he wanted to go where to go when a career has ended what difference does it make the flash crowd at bloomingdales was actually in walking distance and he was tempted to go watch the police barricades must be up by now he could look across them watch the club in action no flash crowd had ever happened this close to the club a good thing it hadnt happened nearer the idea came to him that suddenly for jerryberry jansen home was two rooms knocked together in what had once been a motel on the pacific coast highway the rooms sold as apartments now they were cheap and there was a swimming pool and access to the ocean the concrete walk between the two rows of doors still had fading white diagonal lines on it five oclock found jerryberry flopped bonelessly across the double bed for six years jerryberry had been one of cbas wandering newstapers whose profession it is to flick about los angeles without leaving the booths carrying a handheld camera in hope of finding something interesting to report he had developed legs like tree trunks these days he went out on assignment a step up but it still involved legwork some day he thought as he put his feet up on the pillows jumpshift inc would start putting seats in the booths but first theyd have to figure out how to flick the passenger out without flicking the seats out too the phone rang first he cursed then he heaved himself upright and put on a smile to answer the smile sagged when the screen remained blank a voice said barry jerome jansen speaking the newstaper right again whos this jerryberry wondered if it was a crank call the voice belonged on a bad actor playing the role of a tough it doesnt matter who i am how would you like the address of the permanent floating riot club jerryberry checked his first response which would have been id love it he said there isnt any such thing that response was justified too nobody had ever proved the existence of a permanent floating riot gang every flash crowd attracted a certain proportion of looters so what but he flipped a switch to record the call the voice had said club not gang there is too it said impatiently its at east lindon topeka youre not trying to sell it im giving it to you baby did you get it east lindon drive topeka kansas the caller hung up jerryberiy flopped back on the bed he was tired it could be a gag topeka kansas who would be telling jerryberry jansen about it jerryberrys beat was los angeles oh well he heaved himself upright and called the police the topeka police were spending all their time answering the phone we know said detective sergeant hirohito thats the same address he gave everyone thank you for calling were already on it he hung up another one los angeles he must have called every newscaster in the country god i hope not they wont all keep their mouths shut weve got to have time to check this out hirohito drummed his fingers on the desk theres only one way to get it well have to put the whole area under riot control what no if its a false alarm we could get sued for obstructing business there are a lot of mail order houses in the area not to mention a messenger service calm down jack now we both know this is going to hit the news sooner or later probably about now whats going to happen then jack shorter grinned sure flash crowd itll be the first time we ever put the riot control on before the riot started the newstapersll probably call it the riot club riot most of the news programs reported the incident along with a bulletin from the topeka police force we have not yet had time to erect barricades and the suspects could be armed we strongly advise citizens to stay out of the affected area they always say that cbas commentator wash evans told his audience but you never pay any attention this time they mean it theres no telling what kind of weaponry a looters club might have picked up in the last ten years we know theyve raided a few sporting goods stores in there and there have been a few shootouts do not go to see the riot you get a better view on teevee nobody paid any attention central riot control the theory was simple enough you divided all of the municipal areas in the united states into areas of approximately four blocks by four blocks outside the cities the areas were far bigger the flash crowds far less likely when a flash crowd gathered there were switches at the police stations that would affect all of the displacement booths in one or more riot control areas with riot control going the booths in the area would not admit incoming passengers except from the police stations they would send only to the huge central riot control building in nebraska the permanent floating riot club kept maps of most of the riot control areas in the country there were tens of thousands of them and they were stored in an expensive computer on the third floor of the club in simple curiosity benny had once looked up the area the club itself was situated in he had been amused to find that lou garciawho lived three blocks awaywas in the same riot control area lou may have done that deliberately if the club was ever put under riot control he could simply stroll home he was going to regret that bit of cleverness benny had not called every newscaster in the country it would have taken too long he had called about twenty of the most famous now he hung up and strolled out into the street this area hadnt changed much over the past decade in fact that was true of most municipal areas the new buildings were all going up in rural and desert areas where men could work and live with more elbow room and prettier scenery than their city cousins without sacrificing anything in the way of mobility here in the civic center the buildings just sat there growing older brick and concrete darkening with smog small buildings growing grimy the people were generally older too benny had once noticed that you could tell a citizens age further away than you could tell his sex by the tenacity with which he hugged the sidewalk instead of strolling down the center of the street or by whether he looked both ways for phantom cars before crossing as he crossed an intersection benny glimpsed the club building three blocks down nothing happening there and there were no barricades yet but there were people leaving nearby booths flicking in at a good rate it seemed and they all walked like young men he entered lou garcias apartment building and rang garcias bell in the lobby it seemed pretty well foolproof at this stage if garcia wasnt home then he was either at the club or elsewhere if lie was at the club theyd hold him if he was somewhere else he wouldnt be able to flick in the cops must have put this area under riot control by now in either case benny would have time to search his apartment he had been in garcias apartment many times there was a hall closet that garcia always kept locked yah the intercom benny can i see you hesitation then sure come on up the main door buzzed open well he was home and it was going to be a little sticky it would still work out lou couldnt flick out now even if he got past benny benny had a gun in his hand as the elevator opened there was nobody in the hall benny walked down to lous door and rapped just a minute lou garcia sang out from inside bennys mind flashed ahead suppose the money wasnt in lous apartment well that would be that but garcia wouldnt keep the money in a bank he wouldnt dare and there was that permanently locked closet and hed always had the money available when needed and well it was a gamble he mumbled words under his breath rehearsing what amounted to a speech someone blew the whistle on us he would say someone gave the cops the club address ill tell them it was you hell theyll probably figure that out for themselves youre the only one who had anything to gain ill tell them you were running off with the club treasury yost cant flick out he would say half the club must have been at the bloomingdales flash crowd when the riot control came on theyll come trickling in looking for you but if you give me half the treasury better settle for a third damn if lou had been out he could have searched the apartment and had it all he could still do that if he were to shoot garcia but hed known lou too long for that a third of the treasury and we just wait till riot control goes off then we flick out in separate directions dial at random settle wherever we land live on the money the rest of our lives who could find us it was taking garcia a long time benny kicked at the door open up lou he kicked harder and the door flew wide and benny ducked to the side just in case no bullets he went through fast but nothing happened lou garcia wasnt in sight he wasnt in either bathroom he wasnt in the kitchen or on the balcony benny tried the closets last the one that had always been locked opened easily and there was nothing inside at all so lou had gotten out which left benny to search the apartment in peace unless lou bad taken the treasury benny peered over the balcony lou could have reached the street by now but he wasnt in sight he might have been hidden by the milling crowd below the flash crowd was developing nicely as benny had expected they had come flicking in from all over arriving outside the affected riot control areas and strolling in to see the excitement if the cops found benny now hed claim he was one of them hed flicked in to watch the arrests but the same went for lou unless lou was carrying the treasury in which case he might have some explaining to do so it might still be here benny started his search and stopped bewildered there were other peculiarities things missing like the big reading chair was still here and the heavy coffee table but the little foldup chairs and the water bed were gone and the tall reading lamp benny looked around trying to puzzle it out it was as if lou were halfway through moving as if he had been taking only those things that would fit into a displacement booth benny saw it then and he ran for the closet the closet that had always been locked a closet like a cylinder with a rounded top the curve continued on the inside of the door and nothing at all inside it was a displacement booth benny started to laugh lou had thought of it first he was planning to disappear with the treasury but he didnt know the area was under riot control of course benny could search the apartment anyway but lou wouldnt have left the money behind not with benny standing on the other side of the door benny set the gun down on the remaining table where he expected to be going it was a danger to him he stepped into the closet and closed the door there was no dial in here it must have a preset destination light flashed in his eyes and the floor opened beneath him benny had been through this before he took the fall like an amusement park ride and stood up when it was over central riot control was crowded today citizens milled about the floor of the great bowl making angry noises hampered by the attempts of club members to look inconspicuous among them there were too many club members and not enough citizens it took benny only a moment to find lou lou was in a clump of people to one side of the big central platform where the cops waited he was trying to hold onto a sizeable metal attachй case and four members of the permanent floating riot club were trying to take it from him the cops on the platform watched with interest benny sighed it grieved him to see ten years of history ending but he still had fifty percent of ten years earnings and it had been worth a try a kind of murder you are constantly coming to my home he shouted you never think of calling first whatever im doing suddenly youre there and where the hell do you keep getting keys to my door alicia didnt answer her face which in recent years had taken on a faint resemblance to a bulldogs was set in infinite patience as she relaxed at the other end of the couch she had been through this before and she waited for jeff to get it over with he saw this and the dinner he had not quite finished settled like lead in his belly theres not a club i belong to that you arent a member too whoever im with you finagle me into introducing you if its a man you try to make him and if he isnt having any you get nasty if its a woman there you are like the ghost at the feast the discarded woman its a drag he said he wanted a more powerful word but he couldnt think of one that wouldnt sound overdramatic silly she said weve been divorced six years what do you care who i sleep with i dont like looking like your pimp she laughed the acid was rising in his throat listen he said why dont you give up one of the clubs we we belong to four give one up any of them give me a place of refuge he prayed theyre my clubs too she said with composure you change clubs hed joined the lucifer club four years ago for just that reason shed joined too and now the words clogged in his throat so that he gaped like a fish there were no words left he hit her hed never done that before it was a fullarm swing but awkward because they were trying to face each other on the couch she rode with the slap then sat facing him waiting it was as if he could read her mind weve been through this before and it never changes anything but its your tantrum he remembered later that shed said that to him once those same words and shed looked just like that patient implacable the call reached homicide at pm july the caller was a roundfaced man with straight black hair and a stutter my exwife he told the desk man shes dead i just got home and ffound her like this ssomeone seems to have hit her with a cccigarette box hennessey had just come on for the night shift he took over you just got home you called immediately thats right cccould you come right away well be there in ten seconds have you touched anything no not her and not the box have you called a hospital his voice rose no shes dead hennessey took down his namewalters and booth number and hung up line fisher come with me torrie will you call the city hospital and have them send a copter if walters hadnt touched her he could hardly be sure she was dead they went through the displacement booth one at a time dialing and vanishing for hennessey it was as if the homicide room vanished as he dialed the last digit and be was looking into a porch light jeffrey walters was waiting in the house he was medium sized a bit overweight his light brown hair going thin on top his paper business suit was wrinkled he wore an anxious fearful lookwhich figured either way hennessey thought and hed been right alicia walters was dead from her attitude she had been sitting sideways on the couch when something crashed into her head and she had sprawled forward a green cigarette box was sitting on the glass coffee table it was bloody along one edge and the blood had marked the glass the small bloody beautifully marked green malachite box could have done it it would have been held in the right hand swung fullarmed one of the detectives used chalk to mark its position on the table then nudged it into a plastic bag and tied the neck walters had sagged into a reading chair as if worn out hennessey approached him you said she was your exwife thats right she didnt give up using her married name what was she doing here then i dont know we had a fight earlier this evening i finally threw her out and went back to the sirius club i was half afraid shed just follow me back but she didnt i guess she let herself back in and waited for me here she had a key walters laugh was feeble she always had a key ive had the lock changed twice it didnt work id come home and find her here i just wanted to talk shed say he stopped abruptly that doesnt explain why shed let someone else in no she must have though mustnt she i dont know why she did that the ambulance helicopter landed in the street outside two men entered with a stretcher they shifted alicia walters dead body to the stretcher leaving a chalk outline fisher had drawn earlier walters watched through the picture window as they walked the stretcher into the portable jumpshift unit in the side of the copter they closed the hatch tapped buttons in a learned rhythm on a phone dial set in the hatch when they opened the hatch to check it was empty they closed it again and boarded the copter walters said youll do an autopsy immediately wont you of course why do you ask well its possible i might have an alibi for the time of the murder hennessey laughed before he could stop himself walters looked puzzled and affronted hennessey didnt explain but later as he was leaving the station house for home and bed he snorted alibi he said idiot the displacement booths had come suddenly one year a science fiction writers daydream the next ad an experimental reality teleportation instantaneous travel another year and they were being used for cargo transport two more and the passenger displacement booths were springing up everywhere in the world by luck and the laws of physics the world had had time to adjust teleportation obeyed the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum teleporting uphill took an energy input to match the gain in potential energy a cargo would lose potential energy going downhill and it was over a decade before jumpshift inc learned how to compensate for that effect teleportation over great distances was even more heavily restricted by the earths rotation let a passenger flick too far west and the difference between his momentum and the earths would smack him down against the floor of the booth too far east and he would be flung against the ceiling too far north or south and the earth would be rotating faster or sower he would flick in moving sideways unless he had crossed the equator but cargo and passengers could be displaced between points of equal longitude and opposite latitude smuggling had become impossible to stop there was a point in the south pacific to correspond to any point in the united states most of canada and parts of mexico smuggling via the displacement booths was a new crime the permanent floating riot gangs were another the booths would allow a crowd to gather with amazing rapidity practically any news broadcast could start a flash crowd and with the crowds the pickpockets and looters came flicking in when the booths were new many householders had taken to putting their booths in living rooms or entrance halls that had stopped fast after an astounding rash of burglaries these days only police stations and hospitals kept their booths indoors for twenty years the booths had not been feasible over distances greater than ten miles if the shortdistance booths had changed the nature of crime what of the long distance booths they had been in existence only four years most were at what had been airports being run by what had been airline companies dial three numbers and you could be anywhere on earth flash crowds were bigger and more frequent the alibi was as dead as the automobile smuggling was cheaper the expensive illegal transmission booths in the south pacific were no longer needed cutthroat competition had dropped the price of smack to something the mafia wouldnt touch and murder was easier but that was only part of the problem there was a new kind of murder going around hank lovejoy was a tall lanky man with a lantern jaw and a ready smile the police had found him at his officereal estateand be bad agreed to come immediately there were four of us at the sirius club before alicia showed up he said me and george larimer and jeff walters and jenniferwait a minutelewis jennifer was over at the bar and wed like asked her to join us for dinner you know how it is in a continuity club you can talk to anyone wed have picked up another girl sooner or later hennessey said not two oh george is a monogamist his wife is eight months pregnant and she didnt want to come but george just doesnt hes not fey or anything he just doesnt but jeff and i were both sort of trying to get jennifers attention she was loose and it looked likely shed go home with one or the other of us then alicia came in what time was that oh about six fifteen we were already eating she came up to the table and we all kind of waited for jeff to introduce her and ask her to sit down she being his exwife after all lovejoy laughed george doesnt really understand about jeff and alicia me i thought it was funny what do you mean well theyve been divorced about six years but it seems he just cant get away from her couldnt i mean he said remembering remembering that good old jeff had gotten away from her because someone had smashed her skull hennessey was afraid lovejoy would clam up he played stupid i dont get it a divorce is a divorce isnt it not when its a quote friendly divorce unquote jeffs a damn fool i dont think he gave up sleeping with her not right after the divorce he wouldnt live with her but every so often shed well shed seduce him i guess youd say he wasnt used to being alone and i guess he got lonely eventually he must have given that up but he still couldnt get her out of his hair see they belonged to all the same clubs and they knew all the same people and as a matter of fact they were both in routing and distribution software that was how they met so if she came on the scene while he was trying to do something else there she was and he had to introduce her she probably knew the people he was dealing with if it was business a lot of business gets done at the continuity clubs and she wouldnt go away i thought it was funny it worked out fine for me last night how well after twenty minutes or so it got through to us that alicia wasnt going to go away i mean we were eating dinner and she wasnt but she wanted to talk when she said something about waiting and joining us for dessert jeff stood up and suggested they go somewhere and talk she didnt look too pleased but she went what do you suppose be wanted to talk about lovejoy laughed do i read minds without permission he wanted to tell her to bug off of course but he was gone half an hour and by the time he came back jennifer and i had sort of reached a decision and george had this benign look he gets like bless you my children he doesnt play around himself but maybe he likes to think about other couples getting together maybe hes right maybe it brightens up the marriage bed jeff came back alone that he did he was nervous jumpy friendly enough i mean he didnt get obnoxious when he saw how it was with me and jennifer but he was sweating and i dont blame him what time was this seven twenty dead on yah why would you remember a thing like that well when jeff came back he wanted to know how long hed been gone so i looked at my watch anyway we stayed another fifteen minutes and then jennifer and i took off hennessey asked just how bad were things between jeff and alicia oh they didnt fight or anything it was just funny for one thing shes kind of let herself go since the divorce she used to be pretty now shes gone to seed not many men chase her these days so she has to do the chasing some men like that do you not particularly ive spent some nights with her if thats what youre asking i just like variety im not a heartbreaking man i run with girls who like variety too did alicia i think so the trouble was she slept with a lot of gays jeff introduced her to he didnt like that it made him look bad and once she played nasty to a guy who turned her down and it ruined a business deal but they didnt fight no jeff wasnt the type maybe thats why they got divorced she was just someone he couldnt avoid we all know people like that after he came back without alicia did be leave the table at any time i dont think so no he just sat there making small talk badly george larimer was a writer of articles one of the few who made good money at it he lived in arizona no he didnt mind a quick trip to the police station he said emphasizing the quick just let him finish this paragraphand he breezed in five minutes later sorry about that i just couldnt get the damn wording right this ones for viewers digest and i have to explain drop ship technology for morons without talking down to them or the minimal viewer wont buy it whats the problem hennessey told him his face took on an expression hennessey recognized like he ought to be feeling something and he was trying honest i just met her that night he said dead well he remembered that evening well enough sure jeff walters came back about the time we were finishing coffee we had brandy with the coffee and then hank and ah jennifer left jeff and i sat and played dominos over scotch and sodas you can do that at the sirius you know they keep game boxes there and theyll move up side tables at your elbows so you can have drinks or lunch how did you do i beat him something was bothering him he wasnt playing very well i thought he wanted to talk but he wouldnt talk about whatever was bugging him his exwife maybe maybe not id only just met her and she seemed nice enough and she seemed to like jeff yah now jeff left with alicia how long were they gone half an hour i guess and he came back without her what time quarter past seven or thereabouts ask hank i dont wear a watch he said this with a certain pride a writer doesnt need a watch he sets his own hours as i said we had dessert and coffee and then played dominos for an hour maybe a little less then i bad to go home to see how my wife was getting along while you were having dessert and coffee and playing dominos did jeff walters leave the table at any time well we switched tables to set up the game larimer shut his eyes to think he opened them no he didnt go to the bathroom or anything did you no we were together the whole time if thats what you want to know hennessey went out for lunch after larimer left returning he stepped out of the homicide room booth just ahead of officeri fisher who had spent the morning at alicia walters place alicia had lived in the mountains within shouting distance of lake arrowhead property in that area was far cheaper than property around the lake itself the high rent district in the mountains is near streams and lakes her own water supply had come from a storage tank kept filled by a small jumpshift unit fisher was hot and sweaty and breathing hard as if he had been working he dropped into a chair and wiped his forehead and neck there wasnt much point in going he said we found what was left of a bacon and tomato sandwich sitting on a placemat probably her last meal she wasnt much of a housekeeper probably wasnt making much money either how so all her gadgetry is old enough to be going to pieces her dustmaster skips corners and knocks things off tables her chairs and couches are all blowups inflated plastic cheap but they have to be replaced every so often and she didnt her displacement booth must be ten years old she should have replaced it living in the mountains no roads in that area not near her house anyway in remote areas like that they move the booths in by helicopter then bring the components for the house out through the booth if her booth broke down shed have had to hike out unless she could find a neighbor home and her neighbors arent close i like that area fisher said suddenly theres elbow room she should have made good money she was in routing and distribution software hennessey pondered maybe she spent all her time following her exhusband around the autopsy report was waiting on his desk he read through it alicia walters had indeed been killed by a single blow to the side of the head almost certainly by the malachite box its hard corner had crushed her skull around the temple malachite is a semiprecious stone hard enough that no part of it had broken off in the wound but there was blood and traces of bone and brain tissue on the box itself there was also a bruise on her cheek have to ask walters about that he thought she had died about pm given the state of her body including body temperature stomach contents indicated that she had eaten about pm a bacon and tomato sandwich hennessey shook his head i was right hes still thinking in terms of alibis fisher heard walters sure walters look he came back to the sirius club at seven twenty and he called attention to the time he stayed until around eight thirty to hear larimer tell it and he was always in someones company then he went home found the body and called us the woman was killed around eight which is right in the middle of his alibi time give or take fifteen minutes for the labs margin of error and its still an alibi then it clears him hennessey laughed suppose he did go to the bathroom do you think anyone would remember it nobody in the world has had an alibi for anything since the junipshift booths took over you can be at a party in near york and kill a man in the california sierras in the time it would take to go out for cigarettes you cant use displacement booths for an alibi you could be jumping to conclusinns fisher pointed out so hes not a cop so he reads detective stories so someone murdered his wife in his own living room naturally he wants to know if hes got an alibi hennessey shook his head she didnt bleed a lot said fisher maybe enough maybe not maybe she was moved i noticed that too someone who knew she had a key to walters house killed her and dumped her there he would have hit her with the cigarette box in the spot where hed already hit her with something else hennessey shook his head again its not just walters its a kind of murder we get more and more of these lately people kill each other because they cant move away from each other with the long distance booths everyone in the country lives next door to everyone else you live a block away from your exwife your motherinlaw the girl youre trying to drop the guy who lost money in your business deal and blames you any secretary lives next door to her boss and if he needs something done in a hurry shes right there cod help the doctor if his patients get his home number im not just pulling these out of the air i can name you an assault rap for every one of these situations most people get used to it said fisher my mother used to flick in to visit me at work remember hennessey grinned he did fortunately shed given it up it was worse for walters he said it didnt really sound that bad lovejoy said it was a friendly divorce so he was always running into her so what she took away his clubs fisher snorted but fisher was young he had grown up with the shortdistance booths for twenty years passenger teleportation had been restricted to short hops people had had time to get used to the booths and in those twenty years the continuity clubs had come into existence the continuity club was a guard against future shock its location was ubiquitous hundreds of buildings in hundreds of cities each building just like all the others inside and out wherever a member moved in this traveling society the club would be there today even some of the customers would be the same everyone used the long distance booths to some extent a man had to have some kind of stability in his life his church his marriage his home his club any man might need more or less stability than the next walters had belonged to four clubs and they were no use to him if he kept meeting alicia there and his marriage had broken up and he wasnt a churchgoer and a key to his house had been found in alicias purse she should at least have left him his clubs fisher spoke interrupting his train of thought youve been talking about impulse murders havent you six years of not being able to stand his exwife and not being able to get away from her so finally he hits her with a cigarette box most of them are impulse murders yes well this wasnt any impulse murder look at what h had to do to bring it about hed have had to ask her to wait at home for him then make some excuse to get away from larimer shift home kill her fast and get back to the sirius club before larimer wonders where hes gone then hes got to hope larimer will forget the whole thing thats not just coldblooded its also stupid yah so far its worked though worked hell the only evidence youve got against walter is that he had good reason to kill her listen if she got on his nerves that much she may have irritated some other people too hennessey nodded thats the problem all right but he didnt mean it the way fisher did walters had moved to a hotel until such time as the police were through with his house hennessey called him before going off duty you can move home he told him thats good said walters find out anything only that your wife was murdered with that selfsame cigarette box we found no sign of anyone in the house except her and you he paused but walters only nodded thoughtfully he asked did the box look familiar to you oh yes of course its mine alicia and i bought it on our honeymoon in switzerland we divided things during the divorce and that went to me all right now just how violent was that argument you had he flushed as usual i did a lot of shouting and she just sat there letting it go past her ears it never did any good did you strike her the flush deepened and he nodded ive never done that before did you by any chance hit her with a malachite box do i need a lawyer youre not under arrest mr walters but if you feel you need a lawyer by all means get one hennessey hung up he had asked to be put on the day shift today in order to follow up this case it was quitting time now but he was reluctant to leave officer fisher had been eavesdropping he said so he never mentioned the word alibi said hennessey smart hes not supposed to know when she was killed youre still sure he did it yah but getting a conviction is something else again well find more people with more motives and all weve got is the laboratory he ticked items off on his fingers no fingerprints on the box no blood on walters or any of his clothes unless he had paper clothes and ditched em no way of proving walters let her in or give her the key though i wonder if he really had that much trouble keeping her out of the house wed be asking a jury to believe that walters left the table and larimer forgot about it larimer says no walters is pretty sure to get the benefit of the doubt she didnt bleed much a good defense lawyer is bound to suggest that she was moved from somewhere else its possible she wasnt dead until she was hit nothing in the stomach but food no drugs or poisons in the bloodstream shed have had to be killed by someone who he ticked them off knew she hid walters key knew walters displacement booth number and knew walters wouldnt be home maybe how about larimer or lovejoy hennessey spread his hands in surrender its worth asking larimers alibi is as good as walters for all thats worth and weve still got to interview jennifer lewis then again a lot of people at the sirius club knew walter some of them must have been involved with alicia anyone who saw walters halfway through a domino game would know hed be stuck there for awhile true too true hennessey stood up guess ill be getting dinner hennessey came out of the restaurant feeling pleasantly stuffed and torpid he turned left toward the nearest booth a block away the walters case had haunted him all through dinner fisher had made a good deal of sense but what bugged him was something fisher hadnt said fisher hadnt said that hennessey might be looking for easy answers easy if walters had killed alicia during a game of dominos at the sirius club then there wouldnt be any case until larimer remembered aside from that walters would have been an idiot to try such a thing idiot or desperate but if someone else had killed her it opened up a bag of snakes restrict it to members of the siriusclub who were there that night and how many were left theyd both done business there how many of jeffrey walters acquaintances had shared alicias bed which one would have killed her for reason or no reason the trouble with sharing too many beds was thatones chance of running into a really bad situation was improved almost to certainty if walters had done it things became simpler but she hadnt bled much and walters couldnt have had reason to move the body to his home where could he have killed her that would be worse than that walters owned the murder weapon no forget that she could have been hit with anything and if she were in walters house fifteen seconds later she might still be breathing when the malachite box finished the job hennessey slowed to a stop in front of the booth something fisher had said something that had struck him funny what was it her displacement booth must be ten years old that was it the sight of the booth must have sparked that memory and it was funny how had he known jumpshift booths were all alike they had to be they all had to hold the same volume because the air in the receiver had to be flicked hack to the transmitter when jumpshift improved a booth it was the equipment they jmproved so that the older booths could still be used ten years old wasnt thatyes the altitude shift pumping energy into a cargo so that it could be flicked a mile or a hundred miles uphill had been an early improvement but a transmitter that could absorb the lost potential energy of a downhill shift had not become common until ten years ago hennessey stepped in and dialed the police station sergeant sobel was behind the desk oh fisher left an hour ago he said want his number yes no get me alicia walters number sobel got it for him whats up tell you in a minute said hennessey and he flicked out it was black night his ears registered the drop in pressure his eyes adjusted rapidly and he saw that there were lights in alicia walters house he stepped out of the booth whistling he walked a slow circle around it it was a jumpshiftbooth what more was there to say a glass cylinder with a rounded top big enough for a tall man to stand upright and a meager amount of baggage to stand with bluror for a man holding a dead woman in his arms clenching his teeth while he tried to free one finger for dialing the machinery that made the magic was buried beneath the booth the dial a simple pushbutton phone dial even the long distance booths looked just like this one though the auxiliary machinery was far more complex but he was sweating had lovejoy meant it literally hennessey was smiling ferociously as he stepped back into the booth the lights of the homicide room flashed in his eyes hennessey came out tearing at his collar sweat started from every pore living in the mountains like that alicia should certainly have had her booth replaced the room felt like a furnace but it was his own body temperature that had jumped seven degrees in a moment seven degrees of randomized energy to compensate for the drop in potential energy between here and lake arrowhead walters sat slumped staring straight ahead of him she didnt understand and she didnt care she was taking it like wed been all through this before but we had to do it again but lets get it over with he spoke in a monotone but the nervous stutter was gone finally i hit her i guess i was trying to get her attention she just took it and looked at me and waited for me to go on hennessey said where did the malachite box come in where do you think i hit her with it then it was hers not yours it was ours when we broke up she took it look i dont want you to think i wanted to kill her i wanted to scar her to scare her no to scar her his voice rose to leave a mark shed remember every time she looked in a mirror so shed know i meant it so shed leave me alone i wouldnt have cared if she sued whatever it cost it would have been worth it but i hit her too hard way too hard i felt the crunch why didnt you report it but i did at least i tried i picked her up in my arms and wrestled her out to the booth and dialed for the los angeles emergency hospital i dont know if theres anyplace closer and i wasnt thinking too dear listen maybe i can prove this maybe an intern saw me in the booth i flicked into the hospital and suddenly i was broiling then i remembered that alicia had an old booth the kind that cant absorb a difference in potential energy we guessed that much so i dialed quick and flicked right out again i had to go back to alicias for the malachite box and to wipe off the sofa and my own booth is a new one so i got the temperature shift again cod ft was hot i changed suits before i went back to the club i was still sweating you thought that raising her temperature would foul up our estimate of when she died thats right walters smile was wan listen i did try to get her to a hospital youll remember that wont you yah but you changed your mind all the bridges rusting take a point in space take a specific point near the star system alpha centaurus on the line linking the center of mass of that system with sol follow it as it moves toward sol system at lightspeed we presume a particle in this point men who deal in the physics of teleportation would speak of it as a transition particle but think of it as a kind of superneutrino clearly it must have a rest mass of zero like a neutrino like a neutrino it must be fearfully difficult to find or stop despite several decades in which teleportation has been in common use nobody has ever directly demonstrated the existence of a transition particle it must be taken on faith its internal structure would be fearfully complex in terms of energy states its relativistic mass would be twelve thousand two hundred tons one more property can be postulated its location in space is uncertain a probability density thousands of miles across as it passes proxima centauri and spreading the mass of the tiny red dwarf does not bend its path significantly as it approaches the solar system the particle may be found anywhere within a vaguely bounded wave front several hundred thousand miles across this vagueness of position is part of what makes teleportation work ones aim need not be so accurate near pluto the particle changes state its relativistic mass converts to rest mass within the receiver cage of a drop ship its structure is still fearfully complex for an elementary particle a twelvethousandtwohundredton spacecraft loaded with instruments its hull windowless and very smoothly contoured its presence here is the only evidence that a transition particle ever existed within the control cabin the pilots finger is still on the transmit button karin sagan was short and stocky her hands were large her feet were small and prone to foot trouble her face was square and cheerful her eyes were bright and direct and her voice was deep for a womans she bad been thirtysix years old when phoenix left the transmitter at pluto she was three months older now though nine years had passed on earth she had seen a trace of the elapsed years as phoenix left the pluto drop ship the shuttlecraft that had come to meet them was of a new design and its attitude tets showed the color of fusion flame she had wondered how they made fusion motors that small she saw more changes now among the gathered newstapers some of the women wore microskirts whose hems were cut at angles a few of the men wore assymetrical shirtsthe left sleeve long the right sleeve missing entirely she asked to see one mans left cuff her attention caught by the glowing red design sure enough it was a functional wristwatch but the material was soft as cloth its a bulova dali the man said he was letting his amusement show new to you things change in nine years doctor i thought they would she said lightly thats part of the fun but she remembered the shock of relief when the heat struck she had pushed the transmit button a lightmonth out from alpha centaurus b an instant later sweat was running from every pore of her body there had been no guarantee the probability density that physicists called a transition particle could have gone past the drop ship and out into the universe at large beyond rescue forever or a lot could happen in nine years the station might have been wrecked or abandoned but the heat meant that they had made it phoenix had lost potential energy entering sols gravitational field and had gained it back in heat the cabin felt like a furnace but it was their body temperature that had jumped from to all in an instant how was the trip the young man asked karin sagan returned to the present good but its good to be back are we recording no when the press conference starts youll know it thats the law shall we get it going fine she smiled around the room it was good to see strange faces again three months with three other people in a closed environment it was enough the young man led her to a dais cameras swiveled to face her and the conference started q how was the trip good successful i should say we learned everything we wanted to know about the centaurus systems in addition we learned that our systems work the dropship method is feasible we reached the nearest stars and we came back with no ill effects q what about the centaurus planets are they habitable no it hurt to say that she saw the disappointment around her q neither of them checked out thats right there are six known planets circling alpha centaurus b we may have missed a couple that were too small or too far out we had to do all our looking from a lightmonth away we had good hopes for b and b remember we knew they were there before we set outbut b turns out to be a venustype with too much atmosphere and bs got a reducing atmosphere something like earths atmosphere three billion years ago q the colonists arent going to like that are they i dont expect they will we messaged the drop ship lazarus ii to turn off its jumpshift unit for a year that means that the colony ships wont convert to rest mass when they reach the receiver theyll be reflected back to the solar system they should appear in the pluto drop ship about a month from now q having lost nine years thats right just like me and the rest of the crew of phoenix the colonists left the pluto transmitter two months after we did q what are the chances of terraforming b someday karin was glad to drop the subject of the colony ships somehow she felt that she had failed those first potential colonists of another star system she said pretty good someday im just talking off the top of my head you understand i imagine it would take thousands of years and would involve seeding the atmosphere with tailored bacteria and waiting for them to turn methane and ammonia and hydrocarbons into air at the moment itll pay us better to go on looking for worlds around other stars its so bloody easy with these interstellar drop ships them was nodding among the newstapers they knew about drop ships and they had been briefed in principle there was no difference between lazarus ii and the drop ships circling every planet and most of the interesting moons and asteroids in the solar system a drop ship need not be moving at the same velocity as its cargo the phoenix at rest with respect to sol and the centaurus suns had emerged from lazarus iis receiver cage at a third of lightspeed the point is that you can use a drop ship more than once karin went on by now lazarus ii is one and a third lightyears past centaurus we burned most of its fuel to get the ship up to speed but theres still a maneuver reserve its next target is an orangeyellow dwarf epsilon indi lazarus ii will be there in about twenty eight years then maybe well send another colony group q doctor sagan you were as far from sol as anyone in history has ever gotten what was it like out there karen giggled we were as far from any star as anyones ever gotten it was a long night maybe it was getting to us we had a bad moment when we thought there was an alien ship coming up behind us she sobered for that moment of relief had cost six people dearly it turned out to be lazarus im afraid thats more bad news lazarus should have been decelerating it wasnt were afraid somethings happened to their drive that caused some commotion it developed that many of the newstapers had never heard of the first lazarus karin started to explain and that turned out to be a mistake the first interstellar spacecraft had been launched in thirtyone years ago lazarus had been ten years in the building but far more than ten years of labor had gone into her her lifesupport systems ran in a clear line of development back to the first capsules to orbit earth the first fusionelectric power plants had much in common with her main drive and her hydrogen fuel tanks were the result of several decades of trial and error liquid hydrogen is tricky stuff centuries of medicine had produced suspendedanimation treatments that allowed lazarus to carry six crew members with lifesupport supplies sufficient for two the ship was lovelyat least her reentry system was lovely a swingwing streamlined exploration vehicle as big as any hypersonic passenger plane fully assembled she looked like a haphazard collection of junk but she was loved there had been displacement booths in the network of passenger teleportation had already replaced other forms of transportation over most of the world the cargo ships that lifted lazarus components into orbit had been fueled in flight by jumpshift units in the tanks it was a pity that lazarus could not take advantage of such a method but conservation of momentum held fuel droplets entering lazaruss tanks at a seventh of lightspeed would tear them apart so lazarus had left earth at the end of the corliss accelerator an improbably tall tower standing up from a flat asteroid a mile across the fuel tanksmost of lazaruss masshad been launched first then the ship itself with enough maneuvering reserve to run them down lazarus had left earth like a string of toy balloons and telescopes had watched as she assembled herself in deep space she had not been launched into the unknown the telescopes of ceres base had found planets orbiting alpha centaurus b two of these might be habitable failing that there might at least be seas from which hydrogen could be extracted for a return voyage the first drop ship was launched six years later karin told them we should have waited i was five when they launched lazarus but ive been told that everyone thought that teleportation couldnt possibly be used for space exploration because of velocity differences if wed waited we could have put a drop ship receiver cage on lazarus and taken out the lifesupport system as it was we didnt launch lazarus ii until she stopped to add up dates seventeen years ago q werent you expecting lazarus to pass you not so soon in fact we had this timed pretty well if everything had gone right the crew of lazarus i would have found a string of colony ships pouring out of lazarus ii as it fell across the system they could have joined up to explore the system and later joined the colony if that was feasible or come home on the colony return ship if it wasnt q as it is theyre in deep shit im afraid so can you really say that on teevee there were chuckles at her naivetй q what went wrong any idea they gave us a full report with their distress signal there was some trouble with the plasma pinch effect and no parts to do a full repair they tried running it anywaythey didnt have much choice after all the plasma stream went wrong and blew away part of the stem after that there wasnt anything they could do but set up their distress signal and go back into suspended animation q what are your plans for rescue karin made her second error i dont know we just got back two days ago and weve spent that time traveling its easy enough to pump energy into an incoming transition particle to compensate for a jump in potential energy but the only drop ship weve got that can absorb potential energy is at mercury we couldnt just flick in from pluto wed have been broiled we had to flick in to earth orbit by way of mercury then go down in a shuttlecraft she closed her eyes to think itll be difficult by now lazarus must be half a lightyear beyond alpha centaurus and lazarus ii more than twice that far we probably cant use lazarus ii in a rescue attempt q couldnt you drop a receiver cage from lazarus ii then wait until lazarus has almost caught up with it she smiled indulgently at least they were asking intelligent questions wont work lazarus ii must have changed course already for epsilon indi whatever happens is likely to take a long time teevee was mostly news these days the entertainment programs had been largely taken over by cassettes which could be sold devoid of advertisements and which could be aimed at more selective audiences and newspapers had died out but headlines had not the announcers were saying things like centaurus planets devoid of life colony ships to return failure of lazarus scout ship engines rescue attempts to begin details in a moment but first this word jerryberry jansen of cba smiled into the cameras the warmth he felt for his unseen audience was genuine he regarded himself as a combination of entertainer and teacher and his approximately twelve million students were the measure of his success the centaurus expedition was by no means a disaster he told them for one thing the colony fleet which cost you the taxpayer about six hundred and sixty million new dollars nine years agocan be reused as is once the un space authority finds a habitable world probably the colonists themselves will not want to wait that long a new group may have to be retrained as for the interstellar drop ship concept it works this has been the first real test and it went without a hitch probably the next use of drop ships will not be a colony expedition at all but an attempt to rescue the crew of lazarus the ship was sending its distress signal there is good reason to think that the crew is still alive doctor karin sagan has pointed out that any rescue attempt will take decades this is reasonable in that the distances to be covered are to be measured in lightyears but todays ships are considerably better than lazarus could ever have been you idiot said robin whyte phd he twisted a knob with angry force and the teevee screen went blank a few minutes later he made two phone calls karin was sightseeing on earth the un space authority had had a new credit card waiting for her a courtesy she appreciated otherwise she would have had to carry a sackful of chocolate dollars for the slots her hands quickly fell into the old routine insert the card dial pull it out and the displacement booth would send her somewhere else it was characteristic of karin that she had not been calling old friends the impulse was there and the worn black phone book with its string of nineyearold names and numbers but the people she had known must have changed she was reluctant to face them there had been a vindictive impulse to drop in on her exhusband here i am at thirtysix and youstupid ron knew where she had been for nine years so why bug the man she had cocktails at mr as in san diego lunch at scandia in los angeles and dessert and coffee at ondine in sausalito the sight of the golden gate bridge sparked her to flick in at various booths for various views of all the bridges in the bay area for karin as for most of humanity earth was represented by a small section of the planet there had been changes she got too close to the bay bridge and was horrified at the rust it had never occurred to her that the san francisco citizenry might let the bridges decay something could be done with them line them with shops a la london bridge or landscape them over for a park or run drag races they would make horribly obtrusive corpses they would ruin the scenery still that had happened before some things had not changed she walked for an hour in kings free park the landscaped section of what had been the san diego freeway the trees had grown a little taller but the crowds were the same always different yet always the same the shops and crowds in the santa monica mall hadnt changed except that the city had filled in the space between the curbs where people had had to step down into the empty streets she did some shopping in the mall to a saleslady in magnins west she said dress me that turned out to be a considerable project and it cost when she left her new clothes felt odd on her but they seemed to blend better with the crowds around her she did a lot of flicking around without ever leaving the booththe ubiquitous booth that seemed to be one instead of millions that seemed to move with her as she explored it took her longer to find the right numbers than it did to dial but she flicked clown the length of wilshire boulevard in jumps of four blocks from the coast to central los angeles by simply dialing four digits higher each time she stopped off at the country art museum in fresno and was intrigued by giant sculptures in plastic foam she was wandering through these shapes just feeling them not yet trying to decide whether she liked them when her wrist phone rang she could have taken the call then and there but she went to a wall phone in the lobby karin preferred to see who she was talking to she recognized him at once robin whyte was a round old man his face pink and soft and cherubic his scalp bare but for a fringe of white hair over his ears and a single tuft at the top of his head karin was surprised to see him now he was the last living member of the team that had first demonstrated teleportation in he had been president of jumpshift inc for several decades but he had retired just after the launching of lazarus ii karin sagan his frown gave him an almost petulant look my congratulations on your safe return thank you karins smile was sunny an impulse made her add congratulations to you too he did not respond in kind i need to see you urgently can you come immediately concerning what concerning the interview you gave this morning but the interview had gone so well what could be bothering the man she said all tight the number he gave her had a new york prefix it was evening in new york city whytes apartment was the penthouse floor of a halfempty building the city itself had lost half its population during the past forty years and it showed in the walls of dark windows visible through whytes picture windows the thing i want to emphasize said whyte is that i didnt call you here as a representative of jumpshift im retired but ive got a problem and pretty quick im going to have to take it up with someone in jumpshift i still own enough jumpshift stock to want to protect it his guests made no comment on his disclaimer they watched as he finished making their drinks and served them karin sagan was curious and a bit truculent at being summoned so abruptly jerryberry jansen had known whyte too long for that he was only curious youve put jumpshift in a sticky situation said whyte both of you and the rest of the news media too karin jerryberry how do you feel about the space program im for it you know that said jerryberry im in it said karin i feel no strong urge to quit and get an honest job is this a preliminary to firing me no i do want to know why you went into so much detail on lazarus they asked me if someone had asked me to keep my mouth shut on the subject i might have might not we cant rescue lazarus said whyte there was an uncomfortable silence perhaps it was in both their minds but it was jerryberry who said it cant or wont how long have you known me jerryberry stopped to count fourteen years on and off look im not saying youd leave a sixman crew in the lurch if it were feasible to rescue them but is it economically infeasible is that it no its impossible whyte glared at karin who glared back you should have figured it out even if he didnt he transferred the glare to jansen about that rescue mission you proposed on nationwide teevee did you have any details worked out jerryberry sipped at his screwdriver id think it would be obvious send a rescue ship our ships are infinitely better than anything they had in theyre moving at a seventh of lightspeed what kind of ship could get up the velocity to catch lazarus and still get back a drop ship of course a drop ship burns all its fuel getting up to speed lazarus ii is doing a third of lightspeed and it cost about a quarter of what lazarus costits so much simpler you send a drop ship when it passes lazarus you drop a rescue ship through uh huh and how fast is the rescue ship moving oh lazarus would flash past the rescue ship at a seventh of lightspeed weve got better ships than the best they could do in sure we do but censored dammit they dont travel the same way well yes but theres got to be youre cheating a little karin said a rescue ship of the lazarus type could get up to speed and still have the fuel to get home meanwhile you send a drop ship to intercept lazarus the rescue ship drops through the receiver cage picks them uphmm it would have to be selfteleporting wouldnt it like phoenix yah hmmm if you put a transmitter hull around something the size of lazarus fuel tanks included youd pretty near double the weight it couldnt get up to speed and then decelerate afterward youd need more fuel more weight a bigger hull maybe it couldnt be done at all but sure as hell were talking about something a lot bigger than lazarus there had never been another ship as big as lazarus karin said yah youd ditch a lot of fuel tanks getting up to speed but stillhmmm fuel to get home dammit whyte i left earth nine years ago youve had nine years to improve your space industry what have you done weve got lots better drop ships whyte said quietly then dont you understand were improving our ships but not in the direction of a bigger and better lazarus silence then theres the drop ship itself weve never built a receiver cage big enough to take another lazarus phoenix isnt big it doesnt have to go anywhere i wont swear its impossible to build a drop ship that size but i wouldnt doubt it either it doesnt matter we cant build the rescue ship we dont even have the technology to build lazarus again its gone junked when we started building drop ships like those damn big bridges in san francisco bay whispered karin sorry gentlemen i hadnt thought it out jerryberry said youve still got the corliss accelerator and we still use reaction drives sure for interplanetary speeds and drop ships jerryberry drained his screwdriver in three swallows with his minds eye he saw six coffins deathly still and six human beings frozen inside three men three women someone must have thought that a scout crew might just decide to colonize the centunrus system without waiting fat chance of that now three men three women frozen falling through interplanetary space forever they couldnt possibly have been expecting rescue could they so we dont get them back he said what are we holding a wake they knew the risks they were taking said whyte they knew and they fought for the chance we had over a thousand volunteers at the start of training and that was after the preliminary weedingout jerryberry i asked you before about how you felt about the space program i told you in fact he stopped publicity right i thought i was doing you some good public support for the space program isnt heavy right now and frankly doctor sagan your report didnt help much she flared up what were we supposed to do build a planet failure of the first expedition no planets a whole colony fleet on its way home without ever having so much as seen alpha centaurus i know its safer for them and better not to waste the time but dammit jerryberry was on his feet and pacing there was an odd glow in his eyes an intensity that could communicate even through a teevee screen i tried to emphasize the good points nowi damn near promised the world a rescue mission didnt i just about you werent the only one he paced im pretty good at explaining i have to be ill just have to tell themno lets do it right robin will you go on teevee whyte looked startled tell you what said jerryberry dont just tell them why we cant rescue lazarus show them set up a cost breakdown in dollars and years we all know i tell you it isnt cost it we both know that it could be done if we gave up the rest of the space industry and concentrated solely on rescuing lazarus for enough years r and d rebuilding old hardware censored dammit the research alone on a drop ship that size whyte cocked his head as if listening to an inner voice that is one way to put it it would cost us everything weve built up in the past thirty years jerryberry is this really the way to get it across i dont know its one way set up a cost estimate you can defend it wont end with just one broadcast youll be challenged whatever you say can you be ready in two days karin gave a short barking laugh whyte smiled indulgently are you out of your mind a valid cost estimate would take months assuming i can get anyone interested in doing a cost estimate of something nobody really wants built jerryberry paced suppose we do a cost estimate cba i mean then you wouldnt have anything to defend it wouldnt be very accurate but im sure we could get within a factor of two better give yourselves a week ill give you the names of some people at jumpshift you can go to them for details meanwhile ill have them issue a press release saying were not planning a rescue mission for lazarus at this time jumpshift experimental laboratory building one was a tremendous pressurized quonset hut on most of his previous visits jerryberry had found it nearly empty too many of jumpshifts projects are secret once he had come here with a camera team and on that occasion the polished smoothly curved hull of phoenix had nearly filled the building he had never known exactly where the laboratory was its summers and winters matched the northern hemisphere and the sun beyond the windows now stood near noon which put it on rocky mountain time gemini jones was jumpshifts senior research physicist an improbably tall and slender black woman made even taller by a head of hair like a great white dandelion we get this free she said rapping the schematic diagrams spread across the table the corliss accelerator robin wants to build another of these we dont have the money yet anyway we can use it for the initial boost on a flattish disk of asteroidal rock a mile across engineers of the past generation had raised a tower of metal rings the electromagnetic cannon had been firing ships from earth orbit since ad today it was used more than ever to accelerate the selftransmitting ships partway toward the orbital velocities of mars jupiter mercury jerryberry studied the tower of rings wider than any ship ever built is it wide enough for what weve got in mind i think so wed fire the rescue ship in sections then put it together in space but wed still have to put a transmitter hull around it okay weve got the accelerator and wed use standard tanks beyond that now hold up said gem theres an easier way to do this i thought of it this morning if we do it my way we wont need any research at all oh you interest me strangely see weve still got this problem of building a ship big enough to make the rescue and then decelerate and a drop cage big enough to take it but we already know we can build selftransmitting hulls the size of phoenix what we can do is put the deceleration fuel in phoenix hulls we wouldnt need an unreasonably big drop cage that way jerryberry whistled he knew what phoenix had cost putting a rescue ship together would be like building a fleet of phoenixes and yet robin was wrong we could do that weve got the hardware thats exactly right i figure maybe twenty phoenix hulls full of slurried hydrogen plus a phoenixtype ship for the rescue plus a couple more hulls to hold the drive and the rigging to string it all together youd have to assemble it after launch and accelerate it to a seventh of lightspeed using a couple hundred standard tanks then take it apart stow the rigging and send everything through a lazarus ii drop ship one hull at a time we could do it does robin know about this whos had time to call him i only just thought of this an hour ago ive been working out the math we could do it jerryberry said his eyes afire we could bring em back all it would take would be time and money she smiled indulgently down at him at least she always seemed to though her eyes were level with his own dont get too involved whos going to pay for all this you might talk your bemused public into it if you were extending mans dominion across the stars but to rescue six failures you dont really think of them that way nope but somebodys going to say it i dont know maybe we should go for it those selftrammitting hulls could be turned into ships afterward no youd drop them on the way back jerryberry ran a hand through his hair i guess youre right thanks gem youve done a lot of work for something that isnt ever going to get built good practice keeps my brain in shape said gem he was at home doggedly working out a timeandcosts schedule for the rescue of lazarus when karin sagan called she said ive been wondering if you need me for the broadcast good idea said jerryberry if youre willing we could tape an interview any time youre ready ill ask you to describe the circumstances under which you found lazarus and use that to introduce the topic good jerryberry was tired and depressed it took him a moment to see that karin was too whats wrong oh a lot of things we arent just going to forget about those six astronauts are we his laugh was brittle i think it unlikely they arent decently dead theyre in limbo falling across our sky forever thats what i mean we could wake them any time in the next thousand years if we could get to them thats my problem we can what but itd cost the moon so to speak come on over doctor ill show you lazarus cost n lazarus ii cost n phoenix cost n colony cost n support systems in solar system n total colony package in cluding colony and phoenix and support systems in solar system n twentytwo selftransmitting hulls cost n interstellar drop ship costs n phoenixtype rescue ship costs n r d costs nothing support systems in solar system n total cost of rescue n which is just comfortably more than it cost to build lazarus in the first place and a lot more than it cost us to not colonize alpha centaurus it wouldnt be impossible to go get them just inconvenient and expensive in spades said karin youd tie up the corliss accelerator for a week solid the whole trip would take about thirty four years starting from the launching of the drop ship and if it could be done now it could always be done we couldnt ever forget it until wed done it and it would get more difficult every year because lazarus would be getting further away itll nag us the rest of our lives karin leaned back in jerryberrys guest chair his apartment was not big three rooms with doors knocked between them in a complex that had been a motel on the pacific coast highway thirty years ago theres another thing what are we really doing if we do it whytes way were talking the public into not backing a space project suppose they got the habit i dont know about you i just plain like rocket ships said jerryberry okay can you really talk the public into this no lazarus didnt even cost this much and lazarus almost didnt get built they tell me and lazarus failed and so did the colony project so no but im not sure i can bring myself to talk them out of it jansen just how bad is public support for the space authority oh it isnt even that exactly the public is getting unhappy about jumpshift itself what what for cba runs a continuous string of public opinion polls the displacement booths did genuinely bring some unique problems with them they solved some too maybe you dont remember jerryberry smiled im not old enough neither are you slums traffic jams plane crashesnobodys that old except robin whyte and if you try to tell him the booths brought problems of their own he thinks youre an ungrateful bastard but they did you know they did like flash crowds sure any time anything interesting happens anywhere some newstaper is going to report it then people flick in to see it from all over the united states if it gets big enough you get people flicking in just to see the crowd plus pickpockets looters cops more newstapers anyone looking for publicity then theres the drug problem theres no way to stop smuggling you can pick a point in the south pacific with the same longitude and opposite latitude as any given point in the usa and most of canada and teleport from there without worrying about the earths rotational velocity all it takes is two booths you cant stop the drugs from coming in i remember one narcotics cop telling me to think of it as evolution in action god oh and the ecologists dont like the booths they make wilderness areas too available and the cops have their problems a man used to be off the hook if he could prove he was somewhere else when a crime happened these days you have to suspect anyone anywhere the real killer gets lost in the crowd but the real beef is something else there are people you have to get along with right not me said karin well youre unusual everyone in the world lives next door to his boss his motherinlaw the girl hes trying to drop the guy hes fighting for a promotion you cant move away from anyone it bugs people what can they do give up the booths no there arent any more cars or planes or railroads but they can give up space karin thought about that presently she gave her considered opinion idiots no theyre just like all of us they want something for nothing have you ever solved a problem without finding another problem just behind it sure my husband well no i was pretty lonely after we split up but i didnt sit down and cry about it when someone hands me a problem i solve it jansen were going at this wrong i feel it okay so were doing it wrong whats the right way i dont know weve got better ships than anyone dreamed of in thats fact define ship ship vehicle never mind i see the point dont push it so he didnt ask her what a circling the sinking titanic could have done to help or whether a greyhound bus could have crossed the continent in he said we know how to rescue lazarus whats the big decision we do or we dont well i dont know we watch the opinion polls i think i think well wind up neutral present the project as best we can finagle it up tell em the easiest way to do it tell em what itll cost and leave it at that the opinion polls were a sophisticated way to read mass minds over the years sampling techniques had improved enormously raising their accuracy and owering their cost public thinking generally came in blocks jumpshifts news release provoked no immediate waves but one block of thinking began to surface a significant segment of humanity was old enough to have watched teevee coverage of the launching of lazarus a smaller still significant segment had helped to pay for it with their taxes it had been the most expensive space project of all time lazarus had been loved nothing but love could have pushed the taxpayer into paying such a price even those who had fought the program thirtyone years ago now remembered lazarus with love the reaction came mainly from older men and women but it was worldwide save lazarus likewise there were those dedicated to saving the ecology from the intrusion of man for them the battle was neverending true industrial wastes were no longer dumped into the air and water the worst of these were flicked through a drop ship in close orbit around venus to disappear into the atmosphere of that otherwise useless world but the ultimate garbagemaker was himself the most dangerous of threats hardly a wilderness was left on earth that was not being settled by men with jumpshift booths they would have fought jumpshift on any level jumpshift proposed to leave three men and three women falling across the sky forever to hell with their profit margin save lazarus there were groups who would vote against anything done in space the returns from space exploration had been great admittedly but they all derived from satellites in close orbit around earth observatories weather satellites teevee transmitters solar power plants these were dirt cheap these days and their utility had surely been obvious to any moron since neanderthal times but what use were the worlds of other stars even the worlds of the solar system had given no benefit to man except for venus which made an excellent garbage dump better to spend the money on earth abandon lazarus but most of the public voted a straight insufficient data and of course they were right robin whyte was nervous he was trying not to show it but he paced too much and he smiled too much and he kept clasping his hands behind his back sit down for christs sake said jerryberry relax they cant throw tomatoes through their teevee screens whyte laughed were working on that in the research division are you almost ready an hour to broadcast ive already done the interview with doctor sagan its on tape lets see what youve got what cba had for this broadcast was a fully detailed rescue project complete with artists conceptions jerryberry spread the paintings along a wall using your artists whom we hired for a week with jumpshifts kind permission arent they beautiful we also have a definite price tag two billion three hundred million new dollars whytes laugh was still shaky thats right on the borderline barely feasible he was looking at an artists conception of the launching of the rescue mission a stream of spherical fuel tanks and larger sharkshaped phoenix hulls pouring up through the ringed tower of the corliss accelerator more components rested on flat rock at the launch end so gem thought of it first i must be getting old you dont expect to think of everything do you you once told me that your secretary thought of the freshwater tower gimmick during a drunken office party true too i paid her salary for thirty years hoping shed do it again but she never did do you think theyll buy it no i guess not whyte seemed to shake himself well maybe well use it some other time its a useful technique shipping fuel in phoenix hulls well probably need it to explore say barnards star which is moving pretty censored fast with respect to sol we dont have to tell them they cant do it just tell em the price tag and let them make up their own minds listen i had a hand in launching lazarus the launching boosters were fueled by jumpshift units i know whyte prowling restlessly was back in front of the launching scene i always thought they should have drilled right through the asteroid leave the corliss accelerator open at both ends activity in the sound studio had diminished against a white wall men had placed a small table and two chairs and a battery of teevee cameras and lights were aiming their muzzles into the scene jerryberry touched whytes arm lets go sit down over there whyte might freeze up if confronted by the cameras too suddenly give him a chance to get used to it whyte didnt move his head was cocked to one side and his lips moved silently whats the matter whyte made a shushing motion jerryberry waited presently whyte looked up youll have to scrap this how much time have we got but an hour less what do you mean scrap it whyte smiled i just thought of something get me to a telephone will you has gem still got the schematics of the corliss accelerator an hour to broadcast time and jerryberry began to shake robin are we going to have a broadcast or not whyte patted him on the arm count on it gen joness big whiteonblue schematic had been thumbtacked to the white wall over the table and chairs below it jerryberry jansen leaned back seemingly relaxed watching whyte move about with a piece of chalk a thumbtacked blueprint and a piece of chalk it was slipshod by professional standards robin whyte had not appeared on teevee in a couple of decades he made professional mistakes he turned his back on the audience he covered what he was drawing with the chalk but he didnt look nervous he grinned into the cameras as if he could see old friends out there the heart of it is the corliss accelerator he said and with the chalk he drew an arc underneath the towers launch cradle through the rock itself we excavate here carve out a space to get the room then he drew it in a jumpshift drop ship receiver cage the rescue ship is selftransmitting of course as it leaves the accelerator it transmits back to the launch end what we have then is an electromagnetic cannon of infinite length we spin it on its axis so it doesnt get out of alignment we give the ship an acceleration of one gee for a bit less than two months to boost it to the velocity of lazarus then we flick it out to the drop ship this turns out to be a relatively cheap operation whyte said we could put some extra couches in phoenix and use that we could even use the accelerator to boost the drop ship up to speed but that would take four months and wed have to do it now it would mean building another corliss accelerator but whyte grinned into the cameras we should have done that anyway years ago theres enough traffic to justify it return voyage is just as simple after they pick up the crew of lazarus they flick to the pluto drop ship which is big enough to catch them then to the mercury drop ship to lose their potential energy then back to the corliss accelerator drop cage we use the accelerator for another two months to slow it down the cost of an interstellar drop ship is half a billion new dollars a new corliss accelerator would cost us about the same and we can use it commercially total price is half of what lazarus cost whyte put down the chalk and sat jerryberry said when can you go ahead with this doctor jumpshift will submit a timeandcosts schedule to the un space authority i expect itll go to the world vote thank you doctor whyte for it was a formula when the cameras were off jerryberry sagged in his chair now i can say it boy are you out of practice what do you mean didnt i get it across i think you did i hope so you smiled a lot too much on camera that makes you look selfsatisfied i know you told me before said whyte i couldnt help it i just felt so good there is a tide then the planet had no name it circles a star which in lay beyond the fringe of known space a distance of nearly forty lightyears from sol the star is a g somewhat redder than sol somewhat smaller the planet swinging eighty million miles from its primary in a reasonably circular orbit is a trifle cold for human tastes in the year one louis gridley wu happened to be passing the emphasis on accident is intended in a universe the size of ours almost anything that can happen will take the coincidence of his meeting but well get to that louis wu was one hundred and eighty years old as a regular user of boosterspice he didnt show his years if he didnt get bored first or broke he might reach a thousand but he sometimes told himself not if i have to put up with any more cocktail parties or bandersnatch hunts or painted flatlanders swarming through an anarchy park too small for them by a factor of ten not if i have to live through another onenight love affair or another twentyyear marriage or another twentyminute wait for a transfer booth that blows its zap just as its my turn and people not if i have to live with people day and night all those endless centuries when he started to feel like that he left it had happened three times in his life and now a fourth presumably it would keep happening in such a state of anomie of acute antieverything he was no good to anyone especially his friends most especially himself so he left in a small but adequate spacecraft his own he left everything and everyone heading outward for the fringe of known space he would not return until he was desperate for the sight of a human face the sound of a human voice on the second trip he had gritted his teeth and waited until he was desperate for the sight of a kzinti face that was a long trip he remembered and because he had only been three and a half months in space on this fourth trip and because his teeth still snapped together at the mere memory of a certain human voice because of these things he added i think this time ill wait till im desperate to see a kdatlyno female of course few of his friends guessed the wear and tear these trips saved him and them he spent the months reading while his library played orchestrated music by now he was well clear of known space now he turned the ship ninety degrees beginning a wide circular arc with sol at its center he approached a certain g star he dropped out of hyperdrive well clear of the singularity in hyperspace which surrounds any large mass he accelerated into the system on his main thruster sweeping the space ahead of him with the deepradar he was not looking for habitable planets he was looking for slaver stasis boxes if the pulse returned no echo we would accelerate until he could shift to hyperdrive the velocity would stay with him and he could use it to coast through the next system he tried and the next and the next it saved fuel he had never found a slaver stasis box it did not stop him from looking as he passed through the system the deepradar showed him planets like pale ghosts light gray circles on the white screen the g sun was a wide gray disk darkening almost to black at the center the nearblack was degenerate matter compressed past the point where electron orbits collapse entirely he was well past the sun and still accelerating when the screen showed a tiny black fleck no system is perfect of course he muttered as he turned off the drive he talked to himself a good deal out here where nobody could interrupt him it usually saves fuel he told himself a week later by then he was out of the singularity in clear space he took the ship into hyperdrive circled halfway round the system and began decelerating the velocity hed built up during those first two weeks gradually left him somewhere near where hed found a black speck in the deepradar projection he slowed to a stop though he had never realized it until now his system for saving fuel was based on the assumption that he would never find a slaver box but the fleck was there again a black dot on the gray ghost of a planet louis wu moved in the world looked something like earth it was nearly the same size very much the same shape somewhat the same color there was no moon louis used his telescope on the planet and whistled appreciatively shredded white cloud over misty blue faint continental outlines a hurricane whorl near the equator the ice caps looked big but there would be warm climate near the equator the air looked sweet and noncarcinogenic on the spectrograph and nobody on it not a soul no next door neighbors no voices no faces what the hell he chortled ive got my box ill just spend the rest of my vacation here no men no women no children he frowned and rubbed the fringe of hair along his jaw am i being hasty maybe i should knock but he scanned the radio bands and got nothing any civilized planet radiates like a small star in the radio range moreover here was no sign of civilization even from a hundred miles up great okay first ill get that old stasis box he was sure it was that nothing but stars and stasis boxes were dense enough to show black in the reflection of a hyperwave pulse he followed the image around the bulge of the planet it seemed the planet had a moon after all the moon was twelve hundred miles up and it was ten feet across now why he wondered aloud would the slavers have put it in orbit its too easy to find they were in a war for finagles sake and why would it stay here the little moon was still a couple of thousand miles away invisible to the naked eye the scope showed it clearly enough a silver sphere ten feet through with no marks on it a billion and a half years its been there said louis to himself said he and if you believe that youll believe anything something would have knocked it down dust a meteor the solar wind tnuctip soldiers a magnetic storm nah he ran his fingers through straight black hair grown too long it must have drifted in from somewhere else recently wha another ship small and conical had appeared behind the silvery sphere its hull was green with darker green markings ii damn said louis he didnt recognize the make it was no human ship well it could be worse they could have been people he used the comm laser the other ship braked to a stop in courtesy so did louis would you believe it be demanded of himself three years total time ive spent looking for stasis boxes i finally find one and now something else wants it too the bright blue spark of another laser glowed in the tip of the alien cone louis listened to the autopilotcomputer chuckling to itself as it tried to untangle the signals in an unknown laser beam at least they did use lasers not telepathy or tentaclewaving or rapid changes in skin color a face appeared on louiss screen it was not the first alien he had seen this like some others had a recognizable head a cluster of sense organs grouped around a mouth with room for a brain trinocular vision he noted the eyes set deep in sockets well protected but restricted in range of vision triangular mouth too with yellow serrated bone knives showing their edges behind three gristle lips definately this was an unknown species boy are you ugly louis refrained from saying the aliens translator might be working by now his own autopilot finished translating the aliens first message it said go away this object belongs to me remarkable louis sent back are you a slaver the being did not in the least resemble a slaver and the slavers had been extinct for eons that word was not translated said the alien i reached the artifact before you did i will fight to keep it louis scratched at his chin at two weeks growth of bristly beard his ship had very little to fight with even the fusion plant which powered the thruster was designed with safety in mind a laser battle fought with comm lasers turned to maximum would be a mere endurance test and hed lose for the alien ship had more mass to absorb more heat he had no weapons per se presumably the alien did but the stasis box was a big one the tnuctipunslaver war had wiped out most of the intelligent species of the galaxy a billion and a half years ago countless minor battles must have occurred before a slaverdeveloped final weapon was used often the slavers losing a battle had stored valuables in a stasis box and hidden it against the day they would again be of use no time passed inside a closed stasis box alien meat a billion and a half years old had emerged still fresh from its hiding place weapons and tools showed no trace of rust once a stasis box had disgorged a small tarsierlike sentiment being still alive that former slave had lived a strange life before the aging process claimed her the last of her species slaver stasis boxes were beyond value it was known that the tnuctipun at least had known the secret of direct conversion of matter perhaps their enemies had too someday in a stasis box somewhere outside known space such a device would be found then fusion power would be as obsolete as internal combustion and this a sphere ten feet in diameter must be the largest stasis box ever found i too will fight to keep the artifacts said louis but consider this our species has met once and will meet again regardless of who takes the artifact now we can be friends or enemies why should we risk this relationship by killing the alien sensecluster gave away nothing what do you propose a game of chance with the risks even on both sides do you play games of chance emphatically yes the process of living is a game of chance to avoid chance is insanity that it is hmmm louis regarded the alien head that seemed to be all triangles he saw it abruptly whip around flick to face straight backward and snap back in the same instant the sight did something to the pit of his stomach did you speak the alien asked no wont you break your neck that way your question is interesting later we must discuss anatomy i have a proposal fine we shall land on the world below us we will meet between our ships i will do you the courtesy of emerging first can you bring your translator he could connect the computer with his suit radio yes we will meet between our ships and play some simple game familiar to neither of us depending solely on chance agreed provisionally what game the image on the screen rippled with diagonal lines something interfering with the signal it cleared quickly there is a mathematics game said the alien our mathematics will certainly be similar true though louis had heard of some decidedly peculiar twists in alien mathematics the game involves a screee some word that the autopilot couldnt translate the alien raised a threeclawed hand holding a lensshaped object the aliens mutually opposed fingers turned it so that louis could see the different markings on each side this is a screee you and i will throw it upward six times each i will choose one of the symbols you will choose the other if my symbol falls looking upward more often than yours the artifact is mine the risks are even the image rippled then cleared agreed said louis he was a bit disappointed in the simplicity of the game we shall both accelerate away from the artifact will you follow me down i will said louis the image disappeared iii louis wu scratched at a weeks growth of beard what a way to greet an alien ambassador in the worlds of men louis wu dressed impeccably but out here he felt free to look like death warmed over all the time but how was a trinoc supposed to know that he should have shaved no that wasnt the problem was he fool or genius he had friends many of them with habits like his own two had disappeared decades ago he no longer remembered their names he remembered only that each had gone hunting stasis boxes in this direction and that each had neglected to come back had they met alien ships there were any number of other explanations half a year or more spent alone in a single ship was a good way to find out whether you liked yourself if you decided you didnt there was no point in returning to the worlds of men but there were aliens out here armed one rested in orbit five hundred miles ahead of his ship with a valuable artifact halfway between still gambling was safer than fighting louis wu waited for the aliens next move that move was to drop like a rock the alien ship must have used at least twenty gees of push after a moment of shock louis followed under the same acceleration protected by his cabin gravity was the alien testing his maneuverability possibly not he seemed contemptuous of tricks louis trailing the alien at a goodly distance was now much closer to the silver sphere suppose he just turned ship ran for the artifact strapped it to his hull and kept running actually that wouldnt work hed have to slow to reach the spere the alien wouldnt have to slow to attack twenty gees was close to his ships limit running might not be a bad idea though what guarantee had he of the aliens good faith what if the alien cheated that risk could be minimized his pressure suit had sensors to monitor his body functions louis set the autopilot to blow the fusion plant if his heart stopped he rigged a signal button on his suit to blow the plant manually the alien ship burned bright orange as it hit air it fell free and then slowed suddenly a mile over the ocean showoff louis muttered and prepared to imitate the maneuver the conical ship showed no exhaust its drive must be either a reactionless drive like his own or a kzinstyle inducedgravity drive both were neat and clean silent safe to bystanders and highly advanced islands were scattered across the ocean the alien circled chose one at seeming random and landed like a feather along a bare shoreline louis followed him down there was a bad moment while he waited for some unimaginable weapon to fire from the grounded ship to tear him flaming from the sky while his attention was distracted by landing procedures but he landed without a jar several hundred yards from the alien cone an explosion will destroy both our ships if i am harmed he told the alien via signal beam our species seem to think alike i will now descend louis watched him appear near the nose of the ship in a wide circular airlock he watched the alien drift gently to the sand then he clamped his helmet down and entered the airlock had he made the right decision gambling was safer than war more fun too best of all it gave him better odds but id hate to go home without that box he thought in nearly two hundred years of life he had never done anything as important as finding a stasis box he had made no discoveries won no elective offices overthrown no governments this was his big chance even odds he said and turned on the intercom as he descended his muscles and semicircular canals registered about a gee a hundred feet away waves slid hissing up onto pure white sand the waves were green and huge perfect for riding the beach a definite beer party beach later perhaps he would ride those waves to shore on his belly if the air checked out and the water was free of predators he hadnt had time to give the planet a thorough checkup sand tugged at his boots as he went to meet the alien the alien was five feet tall he had looked much taller descending from his ship but that was because he was mostly leg more than three feet of skinny leg a torso like a beer barrel and no neck impossible that his neckless neck should be so supple but the chrome yellow skin fell in thick rolls around the bottom of his head hiding anatomical details his suit was transparent a roughly alienshaped balloon constricted at the shoulder above and below the complicated elbow joint at the wrist at hip and knee air jets showed at wrist and ankle tools hung in loops at the chest a back pack hung from the neck under the suit louis noted all these tools with trepidation any one of them could be a weapon i expected that you would be taller said the alien a laser screen doesnt tell much does it i think my translator may have mixed up right and left too do you have the coin the screee the alien produced it shall there be no preliminary talk my name is screee my machine cant translate that or pronouce it my name is louis has your species met others besides mine yes two but i am not an expert in that field of knowledge nor am i lets leave the politenesses to the experts were here to gamble choose your symbol said the alien and handed him the coin louis looked it over it was a lens of platinum or something similar sharpedged with the threeclawed hand of his new gambling partner stamped on one side and a planet with heavy ice caps outlined decorating the other maybe they werent ice caps but continents he held the coin as if trying to choose stalling those gas jets seemed to be attitude jets but maybe not suppose he won would he win only the chance to be murdered but theyd both die if his heart stopped no alien could have guessed what kind of weapon would render him helpless without killing him i choose the planet you flip first the alien tossed the coin in the direction of louiss ship louis eyes followed it down and he took two steps to retrieve it the alien stood beside him when he rose hand he said my turn he was one down he tossed the coin as it spun gleaming he saw for the first time that the alien ship was gone what gives he demanded theres no need for us to die said the alien it held something that had hung in a loop from its chest this is a weapon but both will die if i use it please do not try to reach your ship louis touched the button that would blow his power plant my ship lifted when you turned your head to follow the screee by now my ship is beyond range of any possible explosion you can bring to bear there is no need for us to die provided you do not try to reach your ship wrong i can leave your ship without a pilot he left his hand where it was rather than be cheated by an alien in a gambling game the pilot is still on board with the astrogator and the screee i am only the communications officer why did you assume i was alone louis sighed and let his arm fall because im stupid he said bitterly because you used the singular pronoun or my computer did because i thought you were a gambler i gambled that you would not see my ship take off that you would be distracted by the coin that you could see only from the front of your head the risks seemed better than onehalf louis nodded it all seemed clear there was also the chance that you had lured me down to destroy me the computer was still translating into the first person singular i have lost at least one exploring ship that flew in this direction not guilty so have we a thought struck him and he said prove that you hold a weapon the alien obliged no beam showed but sand exploded to louiss left with a vicious crack and a flash the color of lightning the alien held something that made holes so much for that louis bent and picked up the coin as long as were here shall we finish the game to what purpose to see who would have won doesnt your species gamble for pleasure to what purpose we gamble for survival then finagle take your whole breed he snarled and flung himself to the sand his chance for glory was gone tricked away from him there is a tide that governs mens affairs and there went the ebb carrying statues to louis wu history books naming louis wu jetsam on the tide your attitude is puzzling one gambles only when gambling is necessary nuts my translator will not translate that comment do you know what that artifact is i know of the species who built that artifact they traveled far weve never found a stasis box that big it must be a vault of some kind it is thought that that species used a single weapon to end their war and all its participants the two looked at each other possibly each was thinking the same thing what a disaster if any but my own species should take this ultimate weapon but that was anthropomorphic thinking louis knew that a kzin would have been saying now i can conquer the universe as is my right finagle take my luck said louis wu between his teeth why did you have to show at the same time i did that was not entirely chance my instruments found your craft as you backed into the system to reach the vicinity of the artifact in time it was necessary to use thrust that damaged my ship and killed one of my crew i earned possession of the artifact by cheating damn you louis stood up and something meshed between his brain and his semicircular canals iv one gravity the density of a planets atmosphere depended on its gravity and on its moon a big moon would skim away most of the atmosphere over the billions of years of a worlds evolution a moonless world the size and mass of earth should have unbreathable air impossibly dense worse than venus but this planet had no moon except the alien said something a startled ejaculation that the computer refused to translate secree where did the water go louis looked what he saw puzzled him only a moment the ocean had receded slipped imperceptibly away until what showed now was half a mile of level slickly shinning sea bottom where did the water go i do not understand i do where did it go without a moon there can be no tides tides are not this quick in any case explain please itd be easier if we use the telescope in my ship in your ship there may be weapons now pay attention said louis your ship is very close to total destruction nothing can save your crew but the comm laser in my ship the alien dithered then capitulated if you have weapons you would have used them earlier you cannot stop my ship now let us enter your ship remember that i hold my weapon the alien sood beside him in the small cabin his mouth working disturbingly around the serrated edges of his teeth as louis activated the scope and screen shortly a starfield appeared so did a conical spacecraft painted green with darker green markings along the bottom of the screen was the blur of thick atmosphere you see the artifact must be nearly to the horizon it moves fast that fact is obvious even to low intelligence yah is it obvious to you that this world must have a massive satellite but it does not unless the satellite is invisible not invisible just too small to notice but then it must be very dense the alien didnt answer why did we assume the sphere was a slaver stasis box its shape was wrong its size was wrong but it was shiny like the surface of a stasis field and spherical like an artifact planets are spheres too but gravity wouldnt ordinarily pull something ten feet wide into a sphere either it would have to be very fluid or it would have to be very dense do you understand me no i dont know how your equipment works my deepradar uses a hyperwave pulse to find stasis boxes when something stops a byperwave pulse its either a stasis box or its something denser than degenerate matter the matter inside a normal star and this object is dense enough to cause tides a tiny silver bead had drifted into view ahead of the cone telescopic foreshortening seemed to bring it right alongside the ship louis reached to scratch at his beard and was stopped by his faceplate i believe i understand you but how could it happen thats guesswork well call my ship they would be killed we must save them i had to be sure you wouldnt stop me louis wu went to work presently a light glowed the computer had found the alien ship with its comm laser he spoke without preliminaries you must leave the spherical object immediately it is not an artifact it is ten feet of nearly solid neutronium probably torn loose from a neutron star there was no answer of course the alien stood behind him but did not speak probably his own ships computer could not have handled the double translation but the alien was making one twoarmed gesture over and over the green cone swung sharply around broadside to the telescope good theyre firing lateral said louis to himself maybe they can do a hyperbolic past it he raised his voice use all the power available you must pull away the two objects seemed to be pulling apart louis suspected that that was illusion for the two objects were almost in lineofsight dont let the small mass fool you he said unnecessarily now computer whats the mass of a tenfoot neutronium sphere around two times ten to the minus six times the mass of this world which is pretty tiny but if you get too close computer whats the surface gravity i dont believe it the two objects seemed to be pulling together again damn thought louis if they hadnt come along thatd be me he kept talking it wouldnt matter now except to relieve his own tension my computer says ten million gravities at the surface that may be off newtons formula for gravity can you hear me they are too close said the alien by now it is too late to save their lives it was happening as he spoke the ship began to crumble a fraction of a second before impact impact looked no more dangerous than a cannonball striking the wall of a fort the tiny silver bead simply swept through the side of the ship but the ship closed instantly all in a moment like tinsel paper in a strong mans fist closed into a bead glowing yellow with heat a tiny sphere ten feet through or a bit more i mourn said the alien now i get it said louis i wondered what was fouling our laser messages that chunk of neutronium was right between our ships bending the light beams why was this trap set for us cried the alien have we enemies so powerful that they can play with such masses a touch of paranoia louis wondered maybe the whole species had it just a touch of coincidence a smashed neutron star for a time the alien did not speak the telescope for want of a better target remained focused on the bead its glow had died the alien said my pressure suit will not keep me alive long well make a run for it i can reach margrave in a couple of weeks if you can hold out that long well set up a tailored environment box to hold you until we think of something better it only takes a couple of hours to set one up ill call ahead the aliens triple gaze converged on him can you send messages faster than light sure you have knowledge worth trading for ill come with you thanks a whole lot louis wu started punching buttons margrave civilization people faces voices bah the ship leapt upward ripping atmosphere apart cabin gravity wavered a little then settled down well he told himself i can always come back you will return here i think so he decided i hope you will be armed what more paranoia your species is insufficiently suspicious said the alien i wonder that you have survived consider this neutronium object as a defense its mass pulls anything that touches it into smooth and reflective spherical surface should any vehicle approach this world its crew would find this object quickly they would assume it is an artifact what other assumption could they make they would draw alongside for a closer examination true enough but that planets empty nobody to defend perhaps the planet was dwindling below louis wu swung his ship toward deep space bigger than worlds just because youve spent all your life on one planet doesnt mean that everyone always will already there are alternatives to worlds the apollo spacecraft have an excellent record they have never killed anyone in space the soviet space station may have killed its inhabitants but the american skylab didnt alas they all lack a certain something gravity permanence we want something to live on or in something superior to what weve got safer or more mobile or roomier otherwise why move its odd how much there is to be said about structures larger than worlds considering that we cannot yet begin to build any one of them on the basis of size the dyson spherea spherical shell around a suncomes about in the middle but lets start small and work our way up the multigeneration ship robert heinleins early story universe has been imitated countless times by most of the writers in the business the idea was this presentday physics poses a limit on the speed of an interstellar vehicle the ships we send to distant stats will be on oneway journeys at least at first they will have to carry a complete ecology they couldnt carry enough food and oxygen in tanks because they will take generations to complete their journeys they must also carry a viable and complete society clearly were talking about quite a large ship with a population in the hundreds at least high enough to prevent genetic drift centrifugal force substitutes for gravity were going to be doing a lot of that we spin the ship on its axis and put all the things that need full gravity at the outside along the hull plant rooms exercise rooms et cetera things that dont need gravity like fuel and guidance instruments we line along the axis if our motors thrust through the same axis we will have to build a lot of the machinery on tracks because the aft wall will be the floor when the ship is under power the universe ship is basic to a discussion of life in space well be talking about much larger structures but they are designed to do the same things on a larger scale to provide a place to live with as much security and variety and pleasure as earth itself offersor more gravity gravity is basic to our lifestyle it may or may not be necessary to life itself but well want it if we can get it whatever we build i know of only four methods of generating gravity aboard spacecraft centrifugal force looks much the most likely there is a drawback coriolis effects would force us to relearn how to walk sit down pour coffee throw a baseball but its effects would decrease with increasing moment arm that is with larger structures on the ring city youd never notice it our second choice is to use actual mass plate the floor with neutronium for instance at a density of fifty quadrillion tons per cubic foot or build the ship around a quantum black hole invisibly small and around as massive as say phobos but this will vastly increase our fuel consumption if we expect the vehicle to go anywhere third choice is to generate gravity waves this may remain forever beyond our abilities but its one of those things that people are going to keep trying to build forever because it would be so damn useful we could launch ships at a million gravities and the passengers would never feel it we could put laboratories on the sun or colonize jupiter anything the fourth method is to accelerate all the way making turnover at the midpoint and decelerating the rest of the way this works fine over interstellar distances it would take an infinite fuel supplyand by god we may have it in the bussard ramjet a bussard ramlet would use an electromagnetic field to scoop up the interstellar hydrogen ahead of itwith an intake a thousand miles or more in diametercompress it and burn it as fuel for a fusion drive now the multigeneration ship would become unnecessary as relativity shortens our trip time four years to the nearest star twentyаne years to the galactic hub twentyeight to andromeda galaxyall at one gravity acceleration the bussard ramjet looks unlikely its another ultimate like generated gravity is the interstellar medium sufficiently ionized for such finicky control maybe not but its worth a try meanwhile our first step to other worlds is the universe shiphuge spun for gravity its population in the hundreds its travel time in generations flying cities james blish used a variant of generated gravity in his tales of the okie titles his spindizzy motors used a littleknown law of physics to create their own gravity and their own motive force because the spindizzy motors worked better for higher mass his vehicles tended to be big most of the stories centered around manhattan island which had been bodily uprooted from its present location and flown intact to the stars two of the stories involved whole worlds fitted out with spindizzies they were even harder to land than the flying cities but we dont really need spindizzies or generated gravity to build flying cities in fact we dont really need to fill out heinleins universe ship the outer hull is all we need visualize a ship like this cut a strip of los angeles say ten miles long by a mile wide roll it in a hoop buildings and streets face inward roof it over with glass or something stronger transport it to space reaction motors air and water recycling systems and storage areas are in the basement outward from the street level so are the fuel tanks jettisoning an empty fuel tank is easy we just cut it loose and it falls into the universe were using a lowthrust highefficiency drive ion jets perhaps the axis of the city can be kept clear a smaller ship can rise to the axis for sightings before a course change or we can set the control bridge atop a slender fin a ten mile circumference makes the fin a mile and a half tall if the bridge is at the axis but the strain on the structure would diminish approaching the axis what would it be like aboard the ring city one gravity everywhere except in the bridge we may want to enlarge the bridge to accommodate a schoolroom teaching physics would be easier in free fall otherwise it would be a lot like the generation ship the populace would be less likely to forget their destiny as heinleins people did they can see the sky from anywhere in the city and the only fixed stars are sol and the target star it would be like living anywhere except that great attention must be paid to environmental quality this can be taken for granted throughout this article the more thoroughly we control our environment the more dangerous it is to forget it inside outside the next step up in size is the hollow planetoid i got my designs from a book of scientific speculation islands in space by dandrige m cole and donald w cox step one construct a giant solar mirror formed under zero gravity conditions it need be nothing more than an echo balloon sprayed with something to harden it then cut in half and silvered on the inside it would be fragile as a butterfly and huge step two pick a planetoid ideally we need an elongated chunk of nickeliron perhaps one mile in diameter and two miles long step three bore a hole down the long axis step four charge the hole with tanks of water plug the openings and weld the plugs using the solar mirror step five set the planetoid spinning slowly on its axis as it spins bathe the entire mass in the concentrated sunlight from the solar mirror gradually the flying iron mountain would be heated to melting all over its surface then the heat would creep inward until the object is almost entirely molten step six the axis would be the last part to reach melting point at that point the water tanks explode the pressure blows the planetoid up into an iron balloon some ten miles in diameter and twenty miles long if everybody has done their jobs right the hollow world is now ready for tenants except that certain things have to be moved in air water soil living things it should be possible to set up a closed ecology cole and cox suggested setting up the solar mirror at one end and using it to reflect sunlight back and forth along the long axis we might prefer to use fusion power if weve got it naturally we spin the thing for gravity living in such an insideout world would be odd in some respects the whole landscape is overhead our sky is farms and houses and so forth if we came to space to see the stars well have to go down into the basement we get our choice of gravity and weather weather is easy we give the asteroid a slight equatorial bulge to get a circular central lake we shade the endpoints of the asteroid from the sun so that its always raining there and the water runs downhill to the central lake if we keep the gravity low enough we should be able to fly with an appropriate set of musclepowered wings and the closer we get to the axis the easier it becomes macrolife lets back up a bit to the heinlein universe ship why do we want to land it if the universe ship has survived long enough to reach its target star it could probably survive indefinitely and so can the nthgeneration society it now carries why should their descendants live out their lives on a primitive earthlike world perhaps they were born to better things let the universe ship become their universe then they can mine new materials from the asteroids of the new system and use them to enlarge the ship when necessary or build new ships they can loosen the population control laws change stars when convenient colonize space itself and let the planets become mere waystations see the universe the concept is called macro life macrolife is large powered selfsufficient environments capable of expanding or reproducing put a drive on the insideoutside asteroid bubble and it becomes a macro life vehicle the ringshaped flying city can be extended indefinitely from the forward rim blishs spindizzy cities were a step away from being macrolife but they were too dependent on planet based society a macrolife vehicle would have to carry its own mining tools and chemical laboratories and god knows what else wed learn what else accidentally by losing interstellar colony ships at best a macrolife vehicle would never be as safe as a planet unless it was as big as a planet and perhaps not then but there are other values than safety an airplane isnt as safe as a house but a house doesnt go anywhere neither does a world worlds the terraforming of worlds is the next logical step up in size for a variety of reasons im going to skip lightly over it we know both too much and too little to talk coherently about what makes a world habitable but were learning fast and will learn faster our present pollution problems will end by telling us exactly how to keep a habitable environment habitable how to keep a stable ecology stable and how to put it all back together again after it falls apart as usual the universe will learn us or kill us if we live long enough to build ships of the universe type we will know what to put inside them we may even know how to terraform a hostile world for the convenience of human colonists having tried our techniques on earth itself now take a giant step dyson spheres freeman dysons original argument went as follows approximately no industrial society has ever reduced its need for power except by collapsing an intelligent optimist will expect his own societys need for power to increase geometrically and will make his plans accordingly according to dyson it will not be an impossibly long time before our own civilization needs all the power generated by our sun every last erg of it we will then have to enclose the sun so as to control all of its output what we use to enclose the sun is problematic dyson was speaking of shells in the astronomical sense solid or liquid continuous or discontinuous anything to interrupt the sum light so that it can be turned into power one move might be to convert the mass of the solar system into as many little tenbytwentymile hollow iron bubbles as will fit the smaller we subdivide the mass of a planet the more useful surface area we get we put all thelittle asteroid bubbles in circular orbits at distances of about one earth orbit from the sun but differing enough that they wont collide its a gradual process we start by converting the existing asteroids when we run out we convert mars jupiter saturn uranus and eventually earth now aside from the fact that our need for power increases geometrically our population also increases geometrically if we didnt need the power wed still need the room in those bubbles eventually weve blocked out all of the sunlight from outside from another star such a system would be a great globe radiating enormous energy in the deep infrared what some science fiction writers have been calling a dyson sphere is something else a hollow spherical shell like a ping pong ball with a star in the middle mathematically at least it is possible to build such a shell without leaving the solar system for materials the planet jupiter has a mass of x lo grams which is most of the mass of the solar system excluding the sun given massive transmutation of elements we can convert jupiter into a spherical shell million miles in radius and maybe ten to twenty feet thick if we dont have transmutation we can still do it with a thinner shell there are at least ten earth masses of building material in the solar system once we throw away the useless gasses the surface area inside a dyson sphere is about a billion times that of the earth very few galactic civilizations in science fiction have included as many as a billion worlds here youd have that much territory within walking distance assuming you were immortal naturally we would have to set up a biosphere on the inner surface wed also need gravity generators the gravitational attraction inside a uniform spherical shell is zero the net pull would come from the sun and everything would gradually drift upward into it so we spot gravity generators all over the shell to hold down the air and the people and the buildings down is outward toward the stars we can control the temperature of any locality by varying the heatretaining properties of the shell in fact we may want to enlarge the shell to give us more room or to make the permanent noonday sun look smaller all we need do is make the shell a better insulator foam the material for instance if it holds heat too well we may want to add radiator fins to the outside note that life is not necessarily pleasant in a dyson sphere we cant see the stars it is always noon we cant dig mines or basements and if one of the gravity generators ever went out the resulting disaster would make the end of the earth look trivial by comparison but if we need a dyson sphere and if it can be built well probably build it now dysons assumptions may hold for any industrial society human or not if an astronomer were looking for inhabited stellar systems he would be missing the point if he watched only the visible stars the galaxys most advanced civilizations may be spherical shells about the size of the earths orbit radiating as much power as a soltype sun but at about o angstroms wavelengthin the deep infrared assuming that the galaxys most advanced civilizations are protoplasmic but beings whose chemistry is based on molten copper say would want a hotter environment they might have evolved faster in temperatures where chemistry and biochemistry would move far faster there might be a lot more of them than of us and their redhot dyson spheres would look deceptively like red giant or supergiant stars one wonders in the wanderer novelist fritz leiber suggested that most of the visible stars have already been surrounded by shells of worlds we are watching old light he suggested light that was on its way to earth before the industrial expansion of galactic civilization really hit its stride already we see some of the result the opaque dust clouds astronomers find in the direction of the galactic core are not dust clouds but walls of dyson spheres blocking the stars within i myself have dreamed up an intermediate step between dyson spheres and planets build a ring million miles in radiusone earth orbitwhich would make it million miles long if we have the mass of jupiter to work with and if we make it a million miles wide we get a thickness of about a thousand meters the ringworld would thus be much sturdier than a dyson sphere there are other advantages we can spin it for gravity a rotation on its axis of miles second would give the ringworld one gravity outward we wouldnt even have to roof itover put walls a thousand miles high at each rim aimed inward at the sun and very little of the air will leak over the edges set up an inner ring of shadow squareslight orbiting structures to block out part of the sunlightand we can have dayandnight cycles in whatever period we like and we can see the stars unlike the inhabitants of a dyson sphere the thing is roomy enough three million times the area of the earth it will be some time before anyonecomplains of the crowding as with most of these structures our landscape is optional a challenge to engineer and artist alike a look at the outer surface of a ringworld or dyson sphere would be most instructive seas would show as bulges mountains as dents river beds and river deltas would be sculpted in there would be no room for erosion on something as thin as a ringworld or a dyson sphere seas would be flatbottomed as we use only the top of a sea anywayand small with convoluted shorelines lots of beachfront mountains would exist only for scenery and recreation a large meteor would be a disaster on such a structure a hole in the floor of the ringworld if not plugged would eventually let all the air out and the pressure differential would cause storms the size of a world making repairs difficult the ringworld concept is flexible consider more than one ringworld can circle a sun imagine many ringworlds noncoplanar of slightly differing radiior of widely differing radii inhabited by very different intelligent races wed get seasons by bobbing the sun up and down actually the ring would do the bobbing the sun would stay put to build a ringworld when all the planets in the system are colonized to the hilt pro tem structures are needed a structure the size of a world and the shape of a pie plate with a huge rocket thruster underneath and a biosphere in the dish might serve to house a planets population while the planet in question is being disassembed it circles the sun at miles second firing outward to maintain its orbit the depopulated planet becomes two more pie plates and we wire them in an equilateral triangle and turn off the thrusters evacuate more planets and start building the ringworld dyson spheres i pointed out earlier that gravity generators look unlikely we may never be able to build them at all do we really need to assume gravity generators on a dyson sphere there are at least two other solutions we can spin the dyson sphere it still picks up all the energy of the sun as planned but the atmosphere collects around the equator and the rest is in vacuum we would do better to reshape the structure like a canister of movie film it gives us greater structural strength and we wind up with a closed ringworld or we can live with the fact that we cant have gravity according to the suggestion of dan aiderson phd we can built two concentric spherical shells the inner shell transparent the outer transparent or opaque at our whim the biosphere is between the two shells it would be fun we can build anything we like within the free fall environment buildings would be fragile as a butterfly left to themselves they would drift up against the inner shell but a heavy thread would be enough to tether them against the suns puny gravity the only question is can humanity stand long periods of free fall hold it a minute have you reached the point of vertigo these structures are hard to hold in your bead theyre so flipping big it might help if i tell you that though we cant begin to build any of these things practically anyone can handle them mathematically any college freshman can prove that the gravitational attraction inside a spherical shell is zero the stresses are easy to compute the mathematics of a ringworld are those of a suspension bridge with noendpoints okay go on with whatever you were doing the disc whats bigger than a dyson sphere dan alderson designer of the alderson double dyson sphere now brings you the alderson disc the shape is that of a phonograph record with a sun situated in the little hole the radius is about that of the orbit of mars or jupiter thickness a few thousand miles gravity is uniformly vertical to the surface except for edge effects engineers do have to worry about edge effects so well build a thousandmile wall around the inner well to keep the atmosphere from drifting into the sun the outer edge will take care of itself this thing is massive it weighs far more than the sun we ignore problems of structural strength please note that we can inhabit both sides of the structure the sun will always be on the horizon unless we bob it which we do now it is always dawn or dusk or night the disc would be a wonderful place to stage a gothic or a swordsandsorcery novel the atmosphere is right and there are real monsters consider we can occupy only a part of the disc the right distance from the sun we might as well share the disc and the cost of its construction with aliens from hotter or colder climes mercurians and venusians nearer the sun martians out toward the rim aliens from other stars living wherever it suits them best over the tens of thousands of years mutations and adaptations would migrate across the sparsely settled borders if civilization should fall things could get eerie and interesting cosmic macaroni pat gunkel has designed a structure analogous to the ringworld imagine a hollow strand of macaroni six hundred million miles long and not particularly thicksay a mile in diameter join it in a loop around the sun pat calls it a topopolis he points out that we could rotate the thing as in the illustrationgetting gravity through centrifugal forcebecause of the lack of torsion effects at six hundred million miles long and a mile wide the curvature of the tube is negligible we can set up a biosphere on the inner surface with a sunlight tube down the axis and photoelectric power sources on the outside so far weve got something bigger than a world but smaller than a ringworld but we dont have to be satisfied with one loop we can go round and round the sun as often as we like as long as the strands dont touch pat visualizes endless loops of rotating tube shaped like a hell of a lot of spaghetti patted roughly into a hollow sphere with a star at the center as the madhouse civilization that built it continued to expand the coil would reach to other stars with the interstellar links using power supplied by the inner coils the tube city would expand through the galaxy eventually our aegagropilous galactotopopolis would look like all the stars in the heavens had been embedded in hair the megasphere mathematically at least it is possible to build a really big dyson sphere with the heart of a galaxy at its center there probably arent enough planets to supply us with material we would have to disassemble some of the star of the galactic arms but well be able to do it by the time we need to we put the biosphere on the outside this time surface gravity is minute but the atmospheric gradient is infinitesimal once again we assume that it is possible for human beings to adapt to free fall we live in free fall above a surface area of tens of millions of light years within an atmosphere that doesnt thin out for scores of light years temperature control is easy we vary the heat conductivity of the sphere to pick up and hold enough of the energy from the stars within though the radiating surface is great the volume to hold heat is much greater immustrial power would come from photoreceptors inside the shell within this limitless universe of air we can build exceptionally large structures ringworldsized and larger we could even spin them for gravity they would remain aloft for many times the lifespan of any known civilization before the gravity of the core stars pulled them down to contact the surface the megasphere would be a pleasantly poetic place to live from a flat earth hanging in space one could actually reach a nearby moon via a chariot drawn by swans and stand a good chance of finding selenites there there would be none of this nonsense about carrying bottles of air along one final step to join two opposing life styles the macrolife tourist types and the sedentary types who prefer to restructure their home worlds the ringworld rotates at miles second given appropriate conducting surfaces this rotation could set up enormous magnetic effects these could be used to control the burning of the sun to cause it to fire off a jet of gas along the ringworld axis of rotation the sun becomes its own rocket the ringworld follows tethered by gravity by the time we run out of sun the ring is moving through space at bussard ramjet velocities we continue to use the magnetic effect to pinch the interstellar gas into a fusion flame which now becomes our sun and our motive power the ringworld makes a problematical vehicle whats it for you cant land the damn thing anywhere a traveling ringworld is not useful as a tourist vehicle anything you want to see you can put on the ringworld itself unless its a lovely multiple star system like beta lyrae but you just cant get that close on a flying ringworld a ringworld in flight would be a bird of ill omen it could only be fleeing some galaxywide disaster now galaxies do explode we have pictures of it happening the probable explanation is a chain reaction of novae in the galactic core perhaps we should be maintaining a space watch for fleeing ringworlds except that we couldnt do anything about it we live on a world small immobile vulnerable and unprotected but it will not be so forever when the phone rings late at night there is a limit to who it can be i had three guesses as i picked it up a wrong number or lois ori didnt bother to think his name it isnt his anyway hello hello he said you know who this is kelsey its the name he tells me what is it kelsey youre not due for another four months i need an advance are you sitting down tm in bed you son of a bitch reading a book but i didnt tell him that better he should be off balance sorry i just wanted you braced i need sixteen thousand bug off i slammed the phone down there was no point in picking up the book hed call again sometimes he waits a few minutes to make me nervous this time the phone started ringing almost immediately and i snatched it up in the same instant and held it to my ear without saying anything its a kind of bluffing game a game i always lose kelsey again and im not kidding i need sixteen thousand nine hundred and forty dollars i need it by the end of the week you know perfectly well i cant do that i cant make that much money disappear without somebody noticing lois the bank the bureau of internal revenue dammit kelsey weve worked this out before the best laid plans of mice and men go to hell something hit me then thats a funny number as long as i cant pay anyway why not make it seventeen thousand or twenty why uh sixteen thousand nine hundred and forty it just worked out that way he sounded defensive i probed what way you arent my only client client im a blackmail victim at least be honest with yourself kelsey i am shall i tell you what you are no someone might be listening which was the point he was trying to make youve got other clients huh go to one of them i did it was a mistake he hesitated then lets call him horatio okay horatio was a bank teller long ago he owns a hardware store now ive known him about five years i had to trace him myself you understand he embezzled some money while he was a teller what did he do die on you when the mortgage was due i put sarcastic sympathy in my voice i wish he would no he waited for my usual call which i make on april fools day not my idea his i call him once a year just like you so i called him and told him he was due and he said he couldnt afford it any more he got kind of bravepanicky you know how it goes dont i just damn you and he said he wouldnt pay me another red cent if he had to go to prison for it i got him to agree to meet me at a bar and grill i hate doing that carson i thought he might try to kill me occupational hazard i may return to this subject i had threatened to kill kelsey before this he sounded disspirited it wont help you im careful carson i took a gun and it was a public place and i got there first besides there are my files if i die the copsll go through those i was going to need that information someday maybe but it wasnt fun to hear so you met him in this bar and grill what then well he had the money right with him he put it right out on the table and i grabbed it quick because someone might be watching someone was too i saw the flashbulb go off and by the time my eyes had stopped watering whoever it was was out the door ra he caught himself horatio stopped me from getting out he said do you know what the statute of limitations is for embezzlement i remembered then it was seven years and horatio had me by the balls blackmail he figures ive taken him for sixteen thousand nine hundred dollars and no cents plus forty bucks for the guy with the camera he wants it back or he turns me in to the police complete with photographs kelsey had never heard me laugh before and mean it thats hilarious the biter bit bit if you turn in your files itll just be more evidence against you youll just have to fight it out in court kelsey tell em its a first offense ive got a better idea ill get the money from you nope if i make that much money disappear too many people would start wondering why if they find out im dead dead now i want you to remember that word kelsey because its important files carson i want you to remember that word because its important if i die somebody will go through my files and then call the cops well it hadnt worked poor hardluck kelsey okay kelsey ill have the money where can we meet no need just get it to me the usual way now dont be a damn fool i probably cant get it until saturday which means ill have to get it to you sunday there isnt any mail sunday he didnt answer for awhile then are you thinking of killing me i kept it light im always thinking of killing you kelsey files i know do you want the money or dont you i listened to the scared silence on the other end dammit now i didnt want him scared i was going to kill him id have to find out where the files were first and for that id have to have him alone somewhere far away for several bouts he was going to be too wary for that i could sense it listen theres a third way he said suddenly if you move the money someones likely to notice if you kill me someones sure to notice but theres a third way lets hear it kill horatio i yelped kelsey what do you think i am murder incorporated i made one mistake one youre not thinking carson there is no connection between you and horatio none zilch you cant even be suspected um he was right youve got to do this for me carson ill never tap you for another dime he went on talking but now i was way ahead of him if i could get horatios photograph of kelsey id have kelsey no more payments wed have each other by the throats poor hard luck horatio the hole man one day mars will be gone andrew lear says that it will start with violent quakes and end hours or days later very suddenly he ought to know its all his fault lear also says that it wont happen for from years to centuries so we stay lear and the rest of us we study the alien base for what it can tell us while the center of the world we stand on is slowly eaten away its enough to give a man nightmares it was lear who found the alien base we had reached mars fourteen of us in the cramped bulbous lifesupport system of the percival lowell we were circling in orbit taking our time correcting our maps and looking for anything that thirty years of mariner probes might have missed we were mapping mascons among other things those mass concentrations under the lunar maria were almost certainly left by goodsized asteroids mountains of rock falling silently out of the sky until they struck with the energies of thousands of fusion bombs mars has been cruising through the asteroid belt for four billion years mars would show bigger and better mascons they would affect our orbits so andrew lear was hard at work watching pens twitch on graph paper as we circled mars a bit of machinery fell alongside the percival lowell rotating within its thin shell was a weighted double lever system deceptively simple a forward mass detector the pens mapped its twitchings over sirbonis palus they began mapping strange curves another man might have cursed and tried to fix it andrew lear thought it out then sent the signal that would stop the freefalling widget from rotating it had to be rotating to map a stationary mass but now it was mapping simple sine waves lear went running to captain childrey running it was more like trapeze artistry lear pulled himself along by handholds kicked off from walls braked with a hard push of hands or feet moving in free fall is hard work when youre in a hurry and lear was a fortyyearold astrophysicist not an athlete he was blowing hard when he reached the control bubble childreywho was an athletewaited with a patient slightly contemptuous smile while lear caught his breath he already thought lear was crazy lears words only confirmed it gravity for sending signals dr lear will you please quit bothering me with your weird ideas im busy we all are this was not entirely unfair some of lears enthusiasms were peculiar gravity generators black holes he thought we should be searching for dyson spheres stars completely enclosed by an artificial shell he believed that mass and inertia were two separate things that it should be possible to suck the inertia out of a spacecraft say so that it could accelerate to near lightspeed in a few minutes he was a wideeyed dreamer and when he was flustered he tended to wander from the point you dont understand he told childrey gravity radiation is harder to block than electromagnetic waves patterned gravity waves would be easy to detect the advanced civilizations in the galaxy may all be communicating by gravity some of them may even be modulating pulsarsrotating neutron stars thats where project ozma went wrong they were only looking for signals in the electromagnetic spectrum childrey laughed sure your little friends are using neutron stars to send you messages whats that got to do with us well look lear held up the strip of flimsy nearly weightless paper hed torn from the machine i got this over sirbonis palus i think we ought to land there were landing in mare cimmerium as you perfectly well know the lander is already deployed and ready to board dr lear weve spent four days mapping this area its flat its in a greenbrown area when spring comes next month well find out whether theres life there and everybody wants it that way except you lear was still holding the graph paper before him like a shield please take one more circuit over sirbonis palus childrey opted for the extra orbit maybe the sine waves convinced him maybe not he would have liked inconveniencing the rest of us in lears name to show him for a fool but the next pass showed a tiny circular feature in sirbonis palus and lears mass indicator was making sine waves again the aliens had gone during our first few months we always expected them back any minute the machinery in the base was running smoothly and perfectly as if the owners had only just stepped out the base was an inverted pie plate two stories high and windowless the air inside was breathable like earths air three miles up but with a bit more oxygen marss air is far thinner and poisonous clearly they were not of mars the walls were thick and deeply eroded they leaned inward against the internal pressure the roof was somewhat thinner just heavy enough for the pressure to support it both walls and roof were of fused martian dust the heating system still workedand it was also the lighting system grids in the ceiling glowing brick red the base was always ten degrees too warm we didnt find the off switches for almost a week they were behind locked panels the air system blew gusty winds through the base until we fiddled with the fans we could guess a lot about them from what theyd left behind they must have come from a world smaller than earth circling a red dwarf star in close orbit to be close enough to be warm enough the planet would have to be locked in by tides turning one face always to its star the aliens must have evolved on the lighted side in a permanent red day with winds constantly howling over the border from the night side and they had no sense of privacy the only doorways that had doors in them were airlocks the second floor was a hexagonal metal gridwork it would not block you off from your friends on the floor below the bunk room was an impressive expanse of mercuryfilled waterbed wall to wall the rooms were too small and cluttered the furniture and machinery too close to the doorways so that at first we were constantly bumping elbows and knees the ceilings were an inch short of six feet high on both floors so that we tended to walk stooped even if we were short enough to stand upright habit but lear was just tall enough to knock his head if he stood up fast anywhere in the base we thought they must have been smaller than human but their padded benches seemed humandesigned in size and shape maybe it was their minds that were different they didnt need psychic elbow room the ship had been bad enough now this within the base was instant claustrophobia it put all of our tempers on hair triggers two of us couldnt take it lear and childrey did not belong on the same planet with childrey neatness was a compulsion he had enough for all of us during those long months aboard percival lowell it was childrey who led us in calisthenics he flatly would not let anyone skip an exercise period we eventually gave up trying well and good the exercise kept us alive we werent getting the healthy daily exercise anyone gets walking around the living room in a onegravity field but after a month on mars childrey was the only man who still appeared fully dressed in the heat of the alien base some of us took it as a reproof and maybe it was because lear had been the first to doff his shirt for keeps in the mess childrey would inspect his silverware for water spots then line it up perfectly parallel on earth andrew lears habits would have been no more than a character trait in a hurry he might choose mismatched socks he might put off using the dishwasher for a day or two if he were involved in something interesting he would prefer a house that looked lived in god help the maid who tried to clean up his study hed never be able to find anything afterward he was a brilliant but onesided man backpacking or skin diving might have changed his habitsin such pursuits you learn not to forget any least trivial thing but they would never have tempted him an expedition to mars was something he simply could not turn down a pity because neatness is worth your life in space you dont leave your fly open in a pressure suit a month after the landing childrey caught lear doing just that the fly on a pressure suit is a soft rubber tube over your male member it leads to a bladder and theres a spring clamp on it you open the clamp to use it then you close the clamp and open an outside spigot to evacuate the bladder into vacuum similar designs for women involve a catheter which is hideously uncomfortable i presume the designers will keep trying it seems wrong to bar half the human race from our ultimate destiny lear was addicted to long walks he loved the martian desert scene the hard violet sky and the soft blur of whirling orange dust the sharp close horizon the endless emptiness more he needed the room he was spending all his working time on the alien communicator with the ceiling too close over his head and everything else too close to his bony elbows he was coming back from a walk and he met childrey coming out childrey noticed that the waste spigot on lears suit was open the spring broken lear had been out for hours if hed had to go he might have bled to death through flesh ruptured by vacuum we never learned all that childrey said to him out there but lear came in very red about the ears muttering under his breath he wouldnt talk to anyone the nasa psychologists should not have put them both on that small a planet hindsight is wonderful right but lear and childrey were each the best choice for competence coupled to the kind of health they would need to survive the trip there were astrophysicists as competent and as famous as lear but they were decades older and childrey had a thousand spaceflight hours to his credit he had been one of the last men on the moon individually each of us was the best possible man it was a damn shame the aliens had left the communicator going like everything else in the base it must have been hellishly massive to judge by the thick support pillars slanting outward beneath it it was a bulky tank of a thing big enough that the roof had to bulge slightly to give it room that gave lear about a square meter of the only head room in the base even lear had no idea why theyd put it on the second floor it would send through the first floor or through the bulk of a planet lear learned that by trying it once he knew enough he beamed a dotdash message through mars itself to the forward mass detector aboard lowell lear had set up a mass detector next to the communicator on an extremely complex platform designed to protect it from vibration the detector produced waves so sharply pointed that some of us thought they could feel the gravity radiation coming from the communicator lear was in love with the thing he skipped meals when he ate he ate like a starved wolf theres a heavy pointmass in there he told us talking around a mouthful of food two months after the landing the machine uses electromagnetic fields to vibrate it at high speed look he picked up a toothpaste tube of tuna spread and held it in front of him he vibrated it rapidly heads turned to watch him around the zigzagged communal table in the alien mess im making gravity waves now but theyre too mushy because the tubes too big and their amplitude is virtually zero theres something very dense and massive in that machine and it takes a hell of a lot of field strength to keep it there what is it someone asked neutronium like the heart of a neutron star lear shook his head and took another mouthful that size neutronium wouldnt be stable i think its a quantum black hole i dont know how to measure its mass yet i said a quantum black hole lear nodded happily luck for me you know i was against the mars expedition we could get a lot more for our money by exploring the asteroids among other things we might have found if there are really quantum black holes out there but this ones already captured he stood up being careful of his head he turned in his tray and went back to work i remember we stared at each other along the zigzag mess table then we drew lots and i lost the day lear left his waste spigot open childrey had put a restriction on him lear was not to leave the base without an escort lear had treasured the aloneness of those walks but it was worse than that childrey had given him a list of possible escorts half a dozen men childrey could trust to see to it that lear did nothing dangerous to himself or others inevitably they were the men most thoroughly trained in space survival routines most addicted to childreys own compulsive neatness least likely to sympathize with lears way of living lear was as likely to ask childrey himself to go walking with him he almost never went out any more i knew exactly where to find him i stood beneath him looking up through the gridwork floor hed almost finished dismantling the protective panels around the gravity communicator what showed inside looked like parts of a computer in one spot electromagnetic coils in most places and a square array of pushbuttons that might have been the aliens idea of a typewriter lear was using a magnetic induction sensor to try to trace wiring without actually tearing off the insulation i called how you making out no good he said the insulation seems to be one hundred per cent perfect now im afraid to open it up no telling how much power is running through there if it needs shielding that good he smiled down at me let me show you something what he flipped a toggle above a dull gray circular plate this thing is a microphone it took me a while to find it i am andrew lear speaking to whoever may be listening he switched it off then ripped paper from the mass indicator and showed me squiggles interrupting smooth sine waves there the sound of my voice in gravity radiation it wont disappear until its reached the edges of the universe lear you mentioned quantum black holes there whats a quantum black hole um you know what a black hole is i ought to lear had educated us on the subject at length during the months aboard lowell when a not too massive star has used up its nuclear fuel it collapses into a white dwarf a heavier starsay times the mass of the sun and largercan burn out its fuel then collapse into itself until it is ten kilometers across and composed solely of neutrons packed edge to edge the densest matter in this universe but a big star goes further than that when a really massive star runs its course when the radiation pressure within is no longer strong enough to hold the outer layers against the stars own ferocious gravity then it can fall into itself entirely until gravity is stronger than any other force until it is compressed past the schwarzchild radius and effectively leaves the universe what happens to it then is problematical the schwarzchild radius is the boundary beyond which nothing can climb out of the gravity well not even light the star is gone then but the mass remains a lightless hole in space perhaps a hole into another universe a collapsing star can leave a black hole said lear there may be bigger black holes whole galaxies that have fallen into themselves but theres no other way a black hole can form now so there was a time when black holes of all sizes could form that was during the big bang the explosion that started the expanding universe the forces in that blast could have compressed little local vortices of matter past the schwarzchild radius what that left behindthe smallest ones anywaywe call quantum black holes i heard a distinctive laugh behind me as captain childrey walked into view the bulk of the communicator would have hidden him from lear and i hadnt heard him come up he called just how big a thing are you talking about could i pick one up and throw it at you youd disappear into one that size lear said seriously a black hole the mass of the earth would only be a centimeter across no im talking about things from tentotheminusfifth grams on up there could be one at the center of the sun eek lear was trying he didnt like being kidded but he didnt know how to stop it keeping it serious wasnt the way but he didnt know that either say tentotheseventeenth grams in mass and tentotheminuseleven centimeters across it would be swallowing a few atoms a day well at least you know where to find it said childrey now all you have to do is go after it lear nodded still serious there could be quantum black holes in asteroids a small asteroid could capture a quantum black hole easily enough especially if it was charged a black hole can hold a charge you know riight all wed have to do is check out a small asteroid with the mass detector if it masses more than it should we push it aside and see if it leaves a black hole behind youd need little teeny eyes to see something that small anyway what would you do with it you put a charge on it if it hasnt got one already and electromagnetic fields you can vibrate it to make gravity then you manipulate it with radiation i think ive got one in here he said patting the alien communicator riight said childrey and he went away laughing within a week the whole base was referring to lear as the hole man the man with the black hole between his ears it hadnt sounded funny when lear was telling me about it the rich variety of the universe but when childrey talked about the black hole in lears anything box it sounded hilarious please note childrey did not misunderstand anything lear had said childrey wasnt stupid he merely thought lear was crazy he could not have gotten away with making fun of lear not among educated men without knowing exactly what he was doing meanwhile the work went on there were pools of marsdust fascinating stuff fine enough to behave like viscous oil and kneedeep wading through it wasnt dangerous but it was very hard work and we avoided it one day brace waded out into the nearest of the pools and started feeling around under the dust hunch he said he came up with some eroded plasticlike containers the aliens had used the pool as a garbage dump we were having little luck with chemical analysis of the base materials they were virtually indestructible we learned more about the chemistry of the alien visitors themselves they had left traces of themselves on the benches and on the communal waterbed the traces had most of the chemical components of protoplasm but arsvey found no sign of dna not surprising he said there must be other giant organic molecules suitable for gene coding the aliens had left volumes of notes behind the script was a mystery of course but we studied the photographs and diagrams a lot of them were notes on anthropology the aliens had been studying earth during the first ice age none of us were anthropologists and that was a damn shame we never learned if wed found anything new all we could do was photograph the stuff and beam it up to lowell one thing was sure the aliens had left very long ago and they had left the lighting and air systems running and the communicator sending a carrier wave for us who else the alternative was that the base had been switched off for some six hundred thousand years then come back on when something detected lowell approaching mars lear didnt believe it if the power had been off in the communicator he said the mass wouldnt be in there any more the fields have to be going to hold it in place its smaller than an atom itd fall through anything solid so the base power system had been running for all that time what the hell could it be and where we traced some cables and found that it was under the base under several yards of marsdust fused to lava we didnt try to dig through that the source was probably geophysical a hole deep into the core of the planet the aliens might have wanted to dig such a hole to take core samples afterward they would have set up a generator to use the temperature difference between the core and the surface meanwhile lear spent some time tracing down the power sources in the communicator he found a way to shut off the carrier wave now the mass if there was a mass was at rest in there it was strange to see the forward mass detector pouring out straight lines instead of drastically peaked sine waves we were illequipped to take advantage of these riches we had been fitted out to explore mars not a bit of civilization from another star lear was the exception he was in his element with but one thing to mar his happiness i dont know what the final argument was about i was engaged on another project the mars lander still had fuel in it nasa had given us plenty of fuel to hover while we looked for a landing spot after some heated discussion we had agreed to take the vehicle up and hover it next to the nearby dust pool on low thrust it worked fine the dust rose up in a great soft cloud and went away toward the horizon leaving the pond bottom covered with otherworldly junk and more arsvey started screaming at brace to back off fortunately brace kept his head he tilted us over to one side and took us away on a gentle curve the backblast never touched the skeletons we worked out there for hours being very finicky indeed here was another skill none of us would own to but wed read about how careful an archaeologist has to be and we did our best traces of water had had time to turn some of the dust to natural cement so that some of the skeletons were fixed to the rock but we got a couple free we put them on stretchers and brought them back one crumbled the instant the air came hissing into the lock we left the other outside the aliens had not had the habit of taking baths wed set up a bathtub with very tall sides in a room the aliens had reserved for some incomprehensible ritual i had stripped off my pressure suit and was heading for the bathtub very tired hoping that nobody would be in it i heard voices before i saw them lear was shouting childrey wasnt but his voice was a carrying one it carried mockery he was standing between the supporting pillars his hands were on his hips his teeth gleamed white his head was thrown back to look up at lear he finished talking for a time neither of them moved then lear made a sound of disgust he turned away and pushed one of the buttons on what might have been an alien typewriter keyboard childrey looked startled he slapped at his right thigh and brought the hand away bloody he stared at it then looked up at lear he started to ask a question he crumpled slowly in the low gravity i got to him before he hit the ground i cut his pants open and tied a handkerchief over the blood spot it was a small puncture but the flesh was puckered above it on a line with his groin childrey tried to speak his eyes were wide he coughed and there was blood in his mouth i guess i froze how could i help if i couldnt tell what had happened i saw a blood spot on his right shoulder and i tore the shirt open and found another tiny puncture wound the doctor arrived it took childrey an hour to die but the doctor had given up much earlier between the wound in his shoulder and the wound in his thigh childreys flesh had been ruptured in a narrow line that ran through one lung and his stomach and part of his intestinal tract the autopsy showed a tiny very neat hole drilled through the hipbones we looked for and found a hole in the floor beneath the communicator it was the size of a pencil lead and packed with dust i made a mistake lear told the rest of us at the inquest i should never have touched that particular button it must have switched off the fields that held the mass in place it just dropped captain childrey was underneath and it had gone straight through him eating the mass of him as it went no not quite said lear id guessed it massed about tentothefourteenth grams that only makes it tentotheminussixth angstrom across much smaller than an atom it wouldnt have absorbed much the damage was done to childrey by tidal effects as it passed through him you saw how it pulverized the material of the floor not surprisingly the subject of murder did come up lear shrugged it off murder with what childrey didnt believe there was a black hole in there at all neither did many of you he smiled suddenly can you imagine what the trial would be like imagine the prosecuting attorney trying to tell a jury what he thinks happened first hes got to tell them what a black hole is then a quantum black hole then hes got to explain why he doesnt have the murder weapon and where he left it freely falling through mars and if he gets that far without being laughed out of court hes still got to explain how a thing smaller than an atom could hurt anyone but didnt dr lear know the thing was dangerous could he not have guessed its enormous mass from the way it behaved lear spread his hands gentlemen were dealing with more variables than just mass field strength for instance i might have guessed its mass from the force it took to keep it there but did any of us expect the aliens to calibrate their dials in the metric system surely there must have been safeties to keep the fields from being shut off accidentally lear must have bypassed them yes i probably did accidentally i did quite a lot of fiddling to find out how things worked it got dropped there obviously there would be no trial no ordinary judge or jury could be expected to understand what the attorneys would be talking about a couple of things never did get mentioned for instance childreys last words i might or might not have repeated them if id been asked to they were all right show me show it to me or admit it isnt there as the court was breaking up i spoke to lear with my voice lowered that was probably the most unique murder weapon in history he whispered if you said that in company i could sue for slander yeah really are you going to explain to a jury what you think i implied happened no ill let you get away with it this time hell you didnt get away scotfree yourself what are you going to study now the only known black hole in the universe and you let it drop through your fingers lear frowned youre right partly right anyway but i knew as much about it as i was going to the way i was going now i stopped it vibrating in there then took the mass of the entire setup with the forward mass sensor now the black hole isnt in there any more i can get the mass of the black hole by taking the mass of the communicator alone and i can cut the machine open see whats inside how they controlled it damn it i wish i were six years old what why well i dont have the times straightened out the math is chancy either a few years from now or a few centuries theres going to be a black hole between earth and jupiter itll be big enough to study i think about forty years when i realized what he was implying i didnt know whether to laugh or scream lear you cant think that something that small could absorb mars well remember that it absorbs everything it comes near a nucleus here an electron there and its not just waiting for atoms to fall into it its gravity is ferocious and its falling back and forth through the center of the planet sweeping up matter the more it eats the bigger it gets with its volume going up as the cube of the mass sooner or later yes itll absorb mars by then itll be just less than a millimeter acrossbig enough to see could it happen within thirteen months before we leave hmm lears eyes took on a faraway look i dont think so ill have to work it out the math is chancy the fourth profession the doorbell rang around noon on wednesday i sat up in bed andit was the oddest of hangovers my head didnt spin my sense of balance was quiveringly alert at the same time my mind was clogged with the things i knew facts that wouldnt relate churning in my head it was like walking the high wire while simultaneously trying to solve an agatha christie mystery yet i was doing neither i was just sitting up in bed blinking i remembered the monk and the pills how many pills the bell rang again walking to the door was an eerie sensation most people pay no attention to their somesthetic senses mine were clamoring for attention begging to be testedby a backflip for instance i resisted i dont have the muscles for doing backflips i couldnt remember taking any acrobatics pills the man outside my door was big and blond and blocky he was holding an unfamiliar badge up to the lens of my spyeye in a wide hand with short thick fingers he had candid blue eyes a square honest facea face i recognized hed been in the long spoon last night at a single table in a corner last night he had looked morose introspective like a man whose girl had left him for mr wrong a face guaranteed to get him left alone id noticed him only because he wasnt drinking enough to match the face today he looked patient endlessly patient with the patience of a dead man and he had a badge i let him in william morris he said identifying himself secret service are you edward harley frazer owner of the long spoor bar partowner yes thats right sony to bother you mr frazer i see you keep bartenders hours he was looking at the wrinkled pair of underpants i had on sit down i said waving at the chair i badly needed to sit down myself standing i couldnt think about anything but standing my balance was allconscious my heels would not rest solidly on the floor they barely touched my weight was all on my toes my body insisted on standing that way so i dropped onto the edge of the bed but it felt like i was giving a trampoline performance the poise the grace the polished ease hell what do you want from me mr morris doesnt the secret service guard the president his answer sounded like rotememory among other concerns such as counterfeiting we do guard the president and his immediate family and the presidentelect and the vice president if he asks us to he paused we used to guard foreign dignitaries too that connected youre here about the monk right morris looked down at his hands he should have had an air of professional selfassurance to go with the badge it wasnt there this is an odd case frazer we took it because it used to be our job to protect foreign visitors and because nobody else would touch it so last night you were in the long spoon guarding a visitor from outer space just so v here were you night before last was that when he first appeared yah i said remembering monday night he came in an hour after opening time he seemed to glide with the hem of his robe just brushing the floor by his gait he might have been moving on wheels his shape was wrong in a way that made your eyes want to twist around to straighten it out there is something queer about the garment that gives a monk his name the hood is open in front as if eyes might hide within its shadow and the front of the robe is open too but the loose cloth hides more than it ought to there is too much shadow once i thought the robe parted as he walked toward me but there seemed to be nothing inside in the long spoon was utter silence every eye was on the monk as he took a stool at one end of the bar and ordered he looked alien and was but he seemed supernatural he used the oddest of drinking systems i keep my house brands on three long shelves more or less in order of type the monk moved down the top row of bottles right to left ordering a shot from each bottle he took his liquor straight at room temperature he drank quietly steadily and with what seemed to be total concentration he spoke only to order he showed nothing of himself but one hand that hand looked like a chickens foot but bigger with lumpylooking very flexible joints and with five toes instead of four at closing time the monk was four bottles from the end of the row he paid me in one dollar bills and left moving steadily the hem of his robe just brushing the floor i testify as an expert he was sober the alcohol had not affected him at all monday night i said he shocked the hell out of us morris what was a monk doing in a bar in hollywood i thought all the monks were in new york so did we oh we didnt know he was on the west coast until it hit the newspapers yesterday morning thats why you didnt see more reporters yesterday we kept them off your back i came in last night to question you frazer i changed my mind when i saw that the monk was already here question me why all i did was serve him drinks okay lets start there werent you afraid the alcohol might kill a monk it occurred to me well i served him what he asked for its the monks own doing that nobody knows anything about monks we dont even know what shape they are let alone how theyre put together if liquor does things to a monk its his own lookout let him check the chemistry sounds reasonable thanks its also the reason im here said morris we know too little about the monks we didnt even know they existed until something over two years ago oh id only started reading about them a month ago it wouldnt be that long except that all the astronomers were looking in that direction already studying a recent nova in sagittarius so they caught the monk starship a little sooner but it was already inside plutos orbit theyve been communicating with us for over a year two weeks ago they took up orbit around the moon theres only one monk starship and only one groundtoorbit craft as far as we know the groundtoorbit craft has been sitting in the ocean off manhattan island convenient to the united nations building for those same two weeks its crew are supposed to be all the monks there are in the world mr frazer we dont even know how your monk got out here to the west coast almost anything you could tell us would help did you notice anything odd about him these last two nights odd i grinned about a monk it took him a moment to get it and then his answering smile was wan odd for a monk yah i said and tried to concentrate it was the wrong move bits of fact buzzed about my skull trying to fit themselves together morris was saying just talk if you will the monk came back tuesday night about what time about fourthirty he had a case ofpillsrna it was no use i knew too many things all at once all unrelated i knew the name of the garment to wear among strangers its principle and its purpose i knew about monks and alcohol i knew the names of the five primary colors so that for a moment i was blind with the memory of the colors themselves colors no man would ever see morris was standing over me looking worried what is it whats wrong ask me anything my voice was high and strange and breathless with giddy laughter monks have four limbs all hands each with a callus heel behind the fingers i know their names morris each hand each finger i know how many eyes a monk has one and the whole skull is an ear theres no word for ear but medical terms for each of theresonating cavitiesbetween the lobes of the brain you look dizzy you dont sample your own wares do you frazer im the opposite of dizzy theres a compass in my head ive got absolute direction morris it must have been the pills pills morris bad small squarish ears that couldnt possibly have come to point but i got that impression he had a sample case full ofeducation pills easy now he put a steadying hand on my shoulder take it easy just start at the beginning and talk ill make some coffee good coffee sounded wonderful suddenly pots ready just plug it in i fix it before i go to sleep morris disappeared around the partition that marks off the kitchen alcove from the bedroom living room in my small apartment his voice floated back start at the beginning he came back tuesday night he came back tuesday night i repeated hey your coffees already perked you must have plugged it in in your sleep keep talking he started his drinking where hed left off four bottles from the end of the top row id have sworn he was cold sober his voice didnt give him away his voice didnt give him away because it was only a whisper too low to make out his translator spoke like a computer putting single words together from a mans recorded voice it spoke slowly and with care why not it was speaking an alien tongue the monk had had five tonight that put him through the ryes and the bourbons and the irish whiskeys and several of the liqueurs now he was tasting the vodkas at that point i worked up the courage to ask him what he was doing he explained at length the monk starship was a commercial venture a trading mission following a daisy chain of stars he was a sampler for the group he was mightily pleased with some of the wares he had sampled here probably he would order great quantities of them to be freezedried for easy storage add alcohol and water to reconstitute then you wont be wanting to test all the vodkas i told him vodka isnt much more than water and alcohol he thanked me the same goes for most gins except for flavorings i lined up four gins in front of him one was tanqueray one was a dutch gin you have to keep chilled like some liqueurs the others were fairly ordinary products i left him with these while i served customers i had expected a mob tonight word should have spread have a drink in the long spoon youll see a thing from outer space but the place was half empty louise was handling them nicely i was proud of louise as with last night tonight she behaved as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening the mood was contagious i could almost hear the customers thinking we like our privacy when we drink a thing from outer space is entitled to the same consideration it was strange to compare her present insouciance with the way her eyes had bugged at her first sight of a monk the monk finished tasting the gins i am concerned for the volatile fractions he said some of your liquors will lose taste from condensation i told him he was probably right and i asked how do you pay for your cargos with knowledge thats fair what kind of knowledge the monk reached under his robe and produced a flat sample case he opened it it was full of pills there was a large glass bottle full of a couple of hundred identical pills and these were small and pink and triangular but most of the sample case was given over to big round pills of all colors individually wrapped and individually labeled in the wandering monk script no two labels were alike some of the notations looked hellishly complex these are knowledge said the monk ah i said and wondered if i was being put on an alien can have a sense of humor cant he and theres no way to tell if hes lying a certain complex organic molecule has much to do with memory said the monk ribonucleic acid it is present and active in the nervous systems of most organic beings wish you to learn my language i nodded he pulled a pill loose and stripped it of its wrapping which fluttered to the bar like a shred of cellophane the monk put the pill in my hand and said you must swallow it now before the air ruins it now that it is out of its wrapping the pill was marked like a target in red and green circles it was big and bulky going down you must be crazy bill morris said wonderingly it looks that way to me too now but think about it this was a monk an alien an ambassador to the whole human race he wouldnt have fed me anything dangerous not without carefully considering all the possible consequences he wouldnt would he thats the way it seemed i remembered about monks and alcohol it was a pill memory surfacing as if i had known it all my life it came too late a language says things about the person who speaks it about the way he thinks and the way he lives morris the monk language says a lot about monks call me bill he said irritably okay take monks and alcohol alcohol works on a monk the way it works on a man by starving his brain cells a little but in a monk it gets absorbed more slowly a monk can stay high for a week on a nights dedicated drinking i knew he was sober when he left monday night by tuesday night he must have been pretty high i sipped my coffee today it tasted different and better as if memories of some monk staple foods had worked their way as overtones into my taste buds morris said and you didnt know it know it i was counting on his sense of responsibility morris shook his head in pity except that he seemed to be grinning inside we talked some more after that and i took some more pills why i was high on the first one it made you drunk not drunk but i couldnt think straight my head was full of monk words all trying to fit themselves to meanings i was dizzy with nonhuman images and words i couldnt pronounce just how many pills did you take i dont remember swell an image surfaced i do remember saying but how about something unusual really unusual morris was no longer amused youre lucky you can still talk the chances you took you should be a drooling idiot this morning it seemed reasonable at the time you dont remember how many pills you took i shook my head maybe the motion jarred something loose that bottle of little triangular pills i know what they were memory erasers good god you didnt no no morris they dont erase your whole memory they erase pill memories the rna in a monk memory pill is tagged somehow so that the eraser pill can pick it out and break it down morris gaped presently he said thats incredible the education pills are wild enough but thatyou see what they must do dont you they hang a radical on each and every rna molecule in each and every education pill the active principle in the eraser pill is an enzyme for just that radical he saw my expression and said never mind just take my word for it they must have had the education pills for a hundred years before they worked out the eraser principle probably the pills must be very old he pounced how do you know that the name for the pill has only one syllable like fork there are dozens of words for kinds of pill reflexes for swallowing the wrong pill for side effects depending on what species is taking the pill theres a special word for an animal training pill and another one for a slave training pill morris i think my memory is beginning to settle down good anyway the monks must have been peddling pills to aliens for thousands of years id guess tens of thousands just how many kinds of pill were in that case i tried to remember my head felt congested i dont know if there was more than one of each kind of pill there were four stiff flaps like the leaves of a book and each flap had rows of little pouches with a pill in each one the flaps were maybe sixteen pouches long by eight across maybe morris we ought to call louise she probably remembers better than i do even if she noticed less at the time you mean louise schu the barmaid she might at that or she might jar something loose in your memory right call her tell her well meet her wheres she live santa monica hed done his homework all right her phone was still ringing when morris said wait a minute tell her well meet her at the long spoon and tell her well pay her amply for her trouble then louise answered and told me id jarred her out of a sound sleep and i told her shed be paid amply for her trouble and she said what the hell kind of a crack was that after i hung up i asked why the long spoon ive thought of something i was one of the last customers out last night i dont think you cleaned up i was feeling peculiar we cleaned up a little i think did you empty the wastebaskets we dont usually theres a guy who comes in in the morning and mops the floors and empties the wastebaskets and so forth the trouble is hes been home with flu the last couple of days louise and i have been going early good get dressed frazer well go down to the long spoon and count the pieces of monk cellophane in the waste baskets they shouldnt be too hard to identify theyll tell us how many pills you took i noticed it while i was dressing morriss attitude had changed subtly he had become proprietary he tended to stand closer to me as if someone might try to steal me or as if i might try to steal away imagination maybe but i began to wish i didnt know so much about monks i stopped to empty the percolator before leaving habit every afternoon i put the percolator in the dishwasher before i leave when i come home at three am its ready to load i poured out the dead coffee took the machine apart and stared the grounds in the top were fresh coffee barely damp from steam they hadnt been used yet there was another secret service man outside my door a tall midwesterner with a toothy grin his name was george littleton he spoke not a word after bill morris introduced us probably because i looked like id bite him i would have my balance nagged me like a sore tooth i couldnt forget it for an instant going down in the elevator i could feel the universe shifting around me thefe seemed to be a fourdimensional map in my head with me in the center and the rest of the universe traveling around me at various changing velocities the car we used was a lincoln continental george drove my map became three times as active recording every touch of brake and accelerator were putting you on salary said morris if thats agreeable you know more about monks than any living man well class you as a consultant and pay you a thousand dollars a day to put down all you remember about monks id want the right to quit whenever i think im mined out that seems all right said morris he was lying they would keep me just as long as they felt like it but there wasnt a thing i could do about it at the moment i didnt even know what made me so sure so i asked what about louise she spent most of her time waiting on tables as i remember she wont know much well pay her a thousand a day for a couple of days anyway for today whether she knows anything or not okay i said and tried to settle back youre the valuable one frazer youve been fantastically lucky that monk language pill is going to give us a terrific advantage whenever we deal with monks theyll have to learn about us well know about them already frazer what does a monk look like under the cowl and robe not human i said they only stand upright to make us feel at ease and theres a swelling along one side that looks like equipment under the robe but it isnt its part of the digestive system and the head is as big as a basketball but its half hollow theyre natural quadrupeds yah fourfooted but climbers the animal they evolved from lives in forests of plants that look like giant dandelions they can throw rooks with any foot theyre still around on center thats the home planet youre not writing this down theres a tape recorder going really id been kidding youd better believe it we can use anything you happen to remember we still dont even know how your monk got out here to california my monk forsooth they briefed me pretty quickly yesterday did i tell you i was visiting my parents in cannel when my supervisor called me yesterday morning ten hours later i knew just about everything anyone knows about monks except you frazer up until yesterday we thought that every monk on earth was either in the united nations building or aboard the monk groundtoorbit ship weve been in that ship frazer several men have been through it all trained astronauts wearing lunar exploration suits six monks landed on earthunless more were hiding somewhere aboard the groundtoorbit ship can you think of any reason why they should do that no neither can anyone else and there are six monks accounted for this morning all in new york your monk went home last night that jarred me how we dont know were checking plane flights silly as that sounds wouldnt you think a stewardess would notice a monk on her flight wouldnt you think shed go to the newspapers sure were also checking flying saucer sightings i laughed but by now that sounded logical if that doesnt pan out well be seriously considering teleportation would you thats it i said without surprise it had come the way a memory comes from the back of my mind as if it had always been there he gave me a teleportation pill thats why ive got absolute direction to teleport ive got to know where in the universe i am morris got bugeyed you can teleport not from a speeding car i said with reflexive fear thats death id keep the velocity oh he was edging away as if i had sprouted horns more memory floated up and i said humans cant teleport anyway that pill was for another market morris relaxed you might have said that right away i only just remembered why did you take it if its for aliens probably for the location talent i dont remember i used to get lost pretty easily i never will again morris id be safer on a high wire than youd be crossing a street with the walk sign could that have been your something unusual maybe i said at the same time i was somehow sure that it wasnt louise was in the dirt parking lot next to the long spoon she was getting out of her mustang when we pulled up she waved an arm like a semaphore and walked briskly toward us already talking alien creatures in the long spoon forsooth id taught her that word ed i keep telling you the customers arent human hello are you mr morris i remember you you were in last night you had four drinks all night morris smiled yes but i tipped big call me bill okay louise schu was a cheerful blonde by choice not birth shed been working in the long spoon for five years now a few of my regulars knew my name but they all knew hers louises deadliest enemy was the extra twenty pounds she carried as padding she had been dieting for some decades two years back she had gotten serious about it and stopped cheating she was mean for the next several months but clawing and scratching and halfstarved every second she had worked her way down to one hundred and twentyfive pounds she threw a terrific celebration that night andto hear her tell it afterwardate her way back to onefortyfive in a single night padding or not shed have made someone a wonderful wife id thought of marrying her myself but my marriage had been too little fun and was too recent and the divorce had hurt too much and the alimony the alimony was why i was living in a cracker box and also the reason i couldnt afford to get married again while louise was opening up morris bought a paper from the coin rack the long spoon was a mess louise and i had cleaned off the tables and collected the dirty glasses and emptied the ash trays into waste bins but the collected glasses were still dirty and the waste bins were still full morris began spreading newspaper over an area of floor and i stopped with my hand in my pocket littleton came out from behind the bar hefting both of the waste bins he spilled one out onto the newspaper then the other he and morris began spreading the trash apart my fingertips were brushing a scrap of monk cellophane id worn these pants last night under the apron some impulse kept me from yelling out i brought my band out of my pocket empty louise had gone to help the others sift the trash with their fingers i joined them presently morris said four i hope thats all well search the bar too and i thought five and i thought i learned five new professions last night what are the odds that ill want to hide at least one of them if my judgment was bad enough to make me take a teleport pill intended for something with too many eyes what else might i have swallowed last night i might be an advertising man or a superbly trained thief or a palace executioner skilled in the ways of torture or i might have asked for something really unpleasant like the profession followed by hitler or alexander the great nothing here morris said from behind the bar louise shrugged agreement morris handed the four scraps to littleton and said run these out to douglass call us from there well put them through chemical analysis he said to louise and me one of them may be real cellophane off a piece of candy or we might have missed one or two for the moment lets assume there were four all right i said does it sound right frazer should it be three or five i dont know as far as memory went i really didnt four then weve identified two one was a course in teleportation for aliens the other was a language course right it looks that way what else did he give you i could feel the memories floating back there but all scrambled together i shook my head morris looked frustrated excuse me said louise do you drink on duty yes morris said without hesitation and louise and i werent on duty louise mixed us three ginandtonics and brought them to us at one of the padded booths morris had opened a flattish briefcase that turned out to be part tape recorder he said we wont lose anything now louise lets talk about last night i hope i can help just what happened in here after ed took his first pill mmm louise looked at me askance i dont know when he took that first pill about one i noticed that he was acting strange he was slow on orders he got drinks wrong i remembered that he had done that for awhile last fall when he got his divorce i felt my face go stiff that was unexpected pain that memory i am far from being my own best customer but there had been a long lost weekend about a year ago louise had talked me out of trying to drink and bartend too so i had gone drinking when it was out of my system i had gone back to tending bar she was saying last night i thought it might be the same problem i covered for him said the orders twice when i had to watched him make the drinks so hed get them right he was spending most of his time talking to the monk but ed was talking english and the monk was making whispery noises in his throat remember last week when they put the monk speech on television it sounded like that i saw ed take a pill from the monk and swallow it with a glass of water she turned to me touched my ann i thought you were crazy i tried to stop you i dont remember the place was practically empty by then well you laughed at me and said that the pill would teach you not to get lost i didnt believe it but the monk turned on his translator gadget and said the same thing i wish youd stopped me i said she looked disturbed i wish you hadnt said that i took a pill myself i started choking shed caught me with a mouthful of gin and tonic louise pounded my back and saved my life maybe she said you dont remember that i dont remember much of anything coherent after i took the first pill really you didnt seem loaded not after id watched you awhile morris cut in louise the pill you took what did the monk say it would do he never did we were talking about me she stopped to think then baffled and amused at herself she said i dont know how it happened all of a sudden i was telling the story of my young life to a monk i had the idea he was sympathetic the monk yes the monk and at some point he picked out a pill and gave it to me he said it would help me i believed him i dont know why but i believed him and i took it any symptoms have you learned anything new this morning she shook her head baffled and a little truculent now taking that pill must have seemed sheer insanity in the cold grey light of afternoon all right said morris frazer you took three pills we know what two of them were louise you took one and we have no idea what it taught you he closed his eyes a moment then looked at me frazer if you cant remember what you took can you remember rejecting anything did the monk offer you anything he saw my face and cut it off because that had jarred something the monk had been speaking his own language in that alien whisper that doesnt need to be more than a whisper because the basic sounds of the monk language are so unambiguous so easily distinguished even to a human ear this teaches proper swimming technique a can reach speeds of sixteen to twentyfour per using these strokes the course also teaches proper exercises i said i turned down a swimming course for intelligent fish louise giggled morris said youre kidding im not and there was something else that swampedindata effect wasnt as bad as it had been at noon bits of data must be reaching cubbyholes in my head linking up finding their places i was asking about the shapes of aliens not about monks because thats bad manners especially from a race that hasnt yet proven its sentiency i wanted to know about other aliens so the monk offered me three courses in unarmed combat techniques each one involved extensive knowledge of basic anatomy you didnt take them no what for like one was a pill to tell me how to kill an armed intelligent worm but only if i was an unarmed intelligent worm i wasnt that confused frazer there are men who would give an arm and a leg for any of those pills you turned down sure a couple of hours ago you were telling me i was crazy to swallow an aliens education pill sorry said morris you were the one who said they should have driven me out of my mind maybe they did i said because my hypersensitive sense of balance was still bothering the hell out of me but morriss reaction bothered me worse frazer could start gibbering any minute better pump him for all hes worth while ive got the chance no his face showed none of that was i going paranoid tell me more about the pills morris said it sounds like theres a lot of delayed reaction involved how long do we have to wait before we know weve got it all he did say something i groped fot it and presently it came it works like a memory the monk had said hed turned off his translator and was speaking his own language now that i could understand him the sound of his translator had been bothering him that was why hed given me the pill but the whisper of his voice was low and the language was new and id had to listen carefully to get it all i remembered it clearly the information in the pills will become part of your memory you will not know all that you have learned until you need it then it will surface memory works by association hed said and there are things that cannot be taught by teachers always there is the difference between knowledge from school and knowledge from doing the work itself theory and practice i told morris i know just what he meant theres not a bartending course in the country that will teach you to leave the sugar out of an old fashioned during rush hour what did you say it depends on the bar of course no posh bar would let itself get that crowded but in an ordinary bar anyone who orders a complicated drink during rush hour deserves what he gets hes slowing the bartender down when its crucial when every second is money so you leave the sugar out of an old fashioned its too much money the guy wont come back so what hes not one of your regulars hed have better sense if he were i had to grin morris was shocked and horrified id shown him a brand new sin i said its something every bartender ought to know about mind you a bartending school is a trade school theyre teaching you to survive as a bartender but the recipe calls for sugar so at school you put in the sugar or you get ticked off morris shook his head tight lipped he said then the monk was warning you that you were getting theory not practice just the opposite look at it this way morris bill listen bill the teleport pill cant make a human nervous system capable of teleportation even my incredible balance and it is incredible wont give me the muscles to do ten quick backflips but i do know what it feels like to teleport thats what the monk was warning me about the pills give field training what you have to watch out for are the reflexes because the pills dont change you physically i hope you havent become a trained assassin one must be wary of newly learned reflexes the monk had said morris said louise we still dont know what kind of an education you got last night any ideas maybe i repair time machines she sipped her drink eyed morris demurely over the rim of the glass morris smiled back i wouldnt be surprised the idiot he meant it if you really want to know what was in the pill said louise why not ask the monk she gave morris time to look startled but no time to interrupt all we have to do is open up and wait he didnt even get through the second shelf last night did he ed no by cod he didnt louise swept an arm about her the place is a mess of course wed never get it clean in time not without help how about it bill youre a government man could you get a team to work here in time to get this place cleaned up by five oclock you know not what you ask its three fifteen now truly the long spoon was a disaster area bars are not meant to be seen by daylight anyway just because our worlds had been turned upside down and just because the long spoon was clearly unfit for human habitation we had been thinking in temis of staying closed tonight now it was too late tip top cleaners i remembered they send out a four man team with its own mops fifteen bucks an hour but wed never get them here in time morris stood up abruptly are they in the phone book sure morris moved i waited until he was in the phone booth before i asked any new thoughts on what you ate last night louise looked at me closely you mean the pill why so solemn weve got to find out before morris does why if morris has his way i said theyll classify my head top secret i know too much im likely to be a political prisoner the rest of my life and so are you if you learned the wrong things last night what louise did then i found both flattering and comforting she turned upon the phone booth where morris was making his call a look of such poisonous hatred that it should have withered the man where he stood she believed me she needed no kind of proof and she was utterly on my side why was i so sure i had spent too much of today guessing at other peoples thoughts maybe it had something to do with my third and fourth professions i said weve got to find out what kind of pill you took otherwise morris and the secret service will spend the rest of their lives following you around just on the off chance that you know something useful like me only they know i know something useful theyll be picking my brain until hell freezes over morris yelled from the phone booth theyre coming forty bucks an hour paid in advance when they get here great i yelled i want to call in new york he closed the folding door louise leaned across the table ed what are we going to do it was the way she said it we were in it together and there was a way out and she was sure id find itand she said it all in the sound of her voice the way she leaned toward me the pressure of her hand around my wrist we i felt the power and confidence rising in me and at the same time i thought she couldnt do that yesterday i said we clean this place up so we can open for business meanwhile you try to remember what you learned last night maybe it was something harmless like how to catch trilchies with a magnetic web tril space butterflies kind of oh but suppose he taught me how to bufld a fasterthanlight motor wed bloody have to keep morris from finding out but you didnt the english words for going faster than lighthyperdrive space warpthey dont have monk translations except in math you cant even say faster than light in monk oh morris came back grinning like an idiot youll never guess what the monks want from us now he looked from me to louise to nie grinning letting the suspense grow intolerable he said a giant laser cannon louise gasped what and i asked you mean a launching laser yes a launching laser they want us to build it on the moon theyd feed our engineers pills to give them the specs and to teach them how to build it theyd pay off in more pills i needed to remember something about launching lasers and how had i known what to call it they put the proposition to the united nations morris was saying in fact theyll be doing all of their business through the un to avoid charges of favoritism they say and to spread the knowledge as far as possible but there are countries that dont belong to the un louise objected the monks know that they asked if any of those nations had space travel none of them do of course and the monks lost interest in them of course i said remembering a species that cant develop spaceflight is no better than animals huh according to a monk louise said but what for why would the monks want a laser cannon and on our moon thats a little complicated said morris do you both remember when the monk ship first appeared two years ago no we answered more or less together morris was shaken you didnt notice it was in all the papers noted astronomer says alien spacecraft approaching earth no no for christs sake i was jumping up and down it was like when the radio astronomers discovered pulsars remember i was just getting out of high school pulsars excuse me morris said overpolitely my mistake i tend to think that everybody i meet is a science fiction fan pulsars are stars that give off rhythmic pulses of radio energy the radio astronomers thought at first that they were getting signals from outer space louise said youre a science fiction fan absolutely my first gun was a gyrojet rocket pistol i bought it because i read buck rogers i said buck who but then i couldnt keep a straight face morris raised his eyes to heaven no doubt it was there that he found the strength to go on the noted astronomer was jerome finney of course he hadnt said anything about earth newspapers always get that kind of thing garbled hed said that an object of artificial extraterrestrial origin had entered the solar system what had happened was that several months earlier jodrell bank had found a new star in sagittarius thats the direction of the galactic core yes frazer we were back to last names because i wasnt a science fiction fan i said thats right the monks came from the galactic hub i remembered the blazing night sky of center my monk customer couldnt possibly have seen it in his lifetime he must have been shown the vision through an education pill for patriotic reasons like kids are taught what the star spangled banner looks like all right the astronomers were studying a nearby nova so they caught the intruder a little sooner it showed a strange spectrum radically different from a nova and much more constant it got even stranger the light was growing brighter at the same time the spectral lines were shifting toward the red it was months before anyone identified the spectrum then one jerome finney finally caught wise he showed that the spectrum was the light of our own sun drastically blueshifted some kind of mirror was coming at us moving at a hell of a clip but slowing as it came oh i got it then that would mean a lightsail why the big deal frazer i thought you already knew no this is the first ive heard of it i dont read the sunday supplements morris was exasperated but you knew enough to call the laser cannon a launching laser i just now realized why its called that morris stared at me for several seconds then he said i forgot you got it out of the monk language course i guess so he got back to business the newspapers gave poor finney a terrible time you didnt see the political cartoons either too bad but when the monk ship got closer it started sending signals it was an interstellar sailing ship riding the sunlight on a reflecting sail and it was coming here signals with dots and dashes you could do that just by tacking the sail you must have read about it why its so obvious morris looked unaccountably ruffled whatever his reasons he let it pass the sail is a few molecules thick and nearly five hundred miles across when its extended on light pressure alone they can build up to interstellar velocities but it takes them a long time the acceleration isnt high it took them two years to slow down to solar system velocities they must have done a lot of braking before our telescopes found them but even so they were going far too fast when they passed earths orbit they had to go inside mercurys orbit and come up the other side of the suns gravity well backing all the way before they could get near earth i said sure interstellar speeds have to be above half the speed of light or you cant trade competitively what there are ways to get the extra edge you dont have to depend on sunlight not if youre launching from a civilized system every civilized system has a moonbased launching laser by the time the sun is too far away to give the ship a decent push the beam from the laser cannon is spreading just enough to give the sail a hefty acceleration without vaporizing anything naturally said morris but he seemed confused so that if youre heading for a strange system youd naturally spend most of the trip decelerating you cant count on a strange system having a launching laser if you know your destination is civilized thats a different matter morris nodded the lovely thing about the laser cannon is that if anything goes wrong with it theres a civilized world right there to fix it you go sailing out to the stars with trade goods but you leave your launching motor safely at home why is everybody looking at me funny dont take it wrong said morris but how does a paunchy bartender come to know so much about flying an interstellar trading ship what i didnt understand him why did the monk ship have to dive so deep into the solar system oh that thats the solar wind you get the same problem around any yellow sun with a lightsail you can get push from the solar wind as well as from light pressure the trouble is the solar wind is just stripped hydrogen atoms light bounces from a lightsail but the solar wind just hits the sail and sticks morris nodded thoughtfully louise was blinking as if she had double vision you cant tack against it tilting the sail does from nothing to use the solar wind for braking you have to bore straight in straight toward the sun i explained morris nodded i saw that his eyes were as glassy as louises eyes oh i said damn i must be stupid today morris that was the third pill right said morris still nodding still glassyeyed that must have been the unusual really unusual profession you wanted crewman on an interstellar liner jesus and he should have sounded disgusted but he sounded envious his elbows were on the table his chin rested on his fists it is a position that distorts the mouth making ones expression unreadable but i didnt like what i could read in morriss eyes there was nothing left of the square and honest man i had let into my apartment at noon morris was a patriot now and an altruist and a fanatic he must have the stars for his nation and for all mankind nothing must stand in his way least of all me reading minds again fraser maybe being captain of an interstellar liner involves having to read the minds of the crew to be able to put down a mutiny before some idiot can take a heat point to the mph glip habbabub or however a monk would say it it has something to do with straining the breathingair my urge to acrobatics had probably come out of the same pill free fall training there was a lot in that pill this was the profession i should have hidden not the palace torturer who was useless to a government grown too subtle to need such techniques but the captain of an interstellar liner a prize too valuable to men who have not yet reached beyond the moon and i had been the last to know it too late frazer captain i said not crew pity a crewman would know more about how to put a ship together frazer how big a crew are you equipped to rule eight and five thirteen yes then why did you say eight and five the question caught me off balance hadnt i oh thats the monk numbering system base eight actually base two but they group the digits in threes to get base eight base two computer numbers are they yes frazer they must have been using computers for a long time aeons all right i noticed for the first time that louise had collected our glasses and gone to make fresh drinks good i could use one shed left her own which was half full knowing she wouldnt mind i took a swallow it was soda water with a lime in it it had looked just like our gin and tonics she must be back on the diet except that when louise resumed a diet she generally announced it to all and sundry morris was still on the subject you use a crew of thirteen are they monk or human or something else monk i said without having to think too bad are there humans in space no a lot of twofeet but none of them are like any of the others and none of them are quite like us louise came back with our drinks gave them to us and sat down without a word you said earlier that a species that cant develop space flight is no better than animals according to the monks i reminded him right it seems a little extreme even to me but let it pass what about a race that develops spaceflight and then loses it it happens there are lots of ways a spacegoing species can revert to animal atomic war or they just cant live with the complexity or they breed themselves out of food and the world famine wrecks everything or waste products from the new machinery ruins the ecology revert to animal all right what about nations suppose you have two nations next door same species but one has space flight right good point too morris there are just two countries on earth that can deal with the monks without dealing through the united nations us and russia if rhodesia or brazil or france tried it theyd be publicly humiliated that could cause an international incident morriss jaw tightened heroically weve got ways of passing the warning along so that it wont happen louise said there are some countries i wouldnt mind seeing it happen to morris got a thoughtful look and i wondered if everybody would get the warning the cleaning team arrived then wed used tip top cleaners before but these four dark women were not our usual team we had to explain in detail just what we wanted done not their fault they usually clean private homes not bars morris spent some time calling new york he must have been using a credit card he couldnt have that much change that may have stopped a minor war he said when he got back and we returned to the padded booth but louise stayed to direct the cleaning team the four dark women moved about us with pails and spray bottles and dry rags chattering in spanish leaving shiny surfaces wherever they went and morris resumed his inquisition what powers the groundtoorbit ship a slow hbomb going off in a magnetic bottle fusion yah the attitude jets on the main starship use fusion power too they all link to one magnetic bottle i dont know just how it works you get fuel from water or ice fusion but dont you have to separate out the deuterium and tritium what for you melt the ice run a current through the water and youve got hydrogen wow morris said softly wow the launching laser works the same way i remembered what else did i need to remember about launching lasers something dreadfully important wow fraser if we could build the monks their launching laser we could use the same techniques to build other fusion plants couldnt we sure i was in dread my mouth was dry my heart was pounding i almost knew why what do you mean if and theyd pay us to do it its a damn shame we just dont have the hardware what do you mean weve got to build the launching laser morris gaped frazer whats wrong with you the terror had a name now my god what have you told the monks morris listen to me youve got to see to it that the security council promises to build the monks launching laser who do you think i am the secretarygeneral we cant build it anyway not with just saturn launching configurations morris thought id gone mad at last he wanted to back away through the wall of the booth theyll do it when you tell them whats at stake and we can build a launching laser if the whole world goes in on it morris look at the good it can do free power from seawater and lightsails work fine within a system sure its a lovely picture we could sail out to the moons of jupiter and saturn we could smelt the asteroids for their metal ores using laser power his eyes had momentarily taken on a vague dreamy look now they snapped back to what morris thought of as reality its the kind of thing i daydreamed about when i was a kid someday well do it todaywe just arent ready there are two sides to a coin i said now i know how this is going to sound just remember there are reasons good reasons reasons reasons for what when a trading ship travels i said it travels only from one civilized system to another there are ways to tell whether a system has a civilization that can build a launching laser radio is one the earth puts out as much radio flux as a small star when the monks find that much radio energy coming from a nearby star they send a trade ship by the time the ship gets there the planet thats putting out all the energy is generally civilized but not so civilized that it cant use the knowledge a monk trades for do you see that they need the launching laser that ship out there came from a monk colony this far from the axis of the galaxy the stars are too far apart ships launch by starlight and laser but they brake by starlight alone because they cant count on the target star having a launching laser if they had to launch by starlight too they probably wouldnt make it a plantandanimal cycle as small as the life support system on a monk starship can last only so long you said yourself that the monks cant always count on the target star staying civilized no of course not sometimes a civilization hits the level at which it can build a launching laser stays there just long enough to send out a mass of radio waves then reverts to animal thats the point if we tell them we cant build the laser well be animals to the monks suppose we just refuse not cant but wont that would be stupid there are too many advantages controlled fusion frazer think about the cost morris looked grim he wanted the laser he didnt think he could get it think about politicians thinking about the cost he said think about politicians thinking about explaining the cost to the taxpayers stupid i repeated and inhospitable hospitality counts high with the monks you see were cooked either way either were dumb animals or were guilty of a criminal breach of hospitality and the monk ship still needs more light for its lightsail than the sun can put out so so the captain uses a gadget that makes the sun explode the said morris and sun and explode he didnt know what to do then suddenly he burst out in great loud cheery guffas so that the women cleaning the long spoon turned with answering smiles hed decided not to believe me i reached across and gently pushed his drink into his lap it was twothirds empty but it cut his laughter off in an instant before he could start swearing i said i am not playing games the monks will make our sun explode if we dont build them a launching laser now go call your boss and tell him so the women were staring at us in horror louise started toward us then stopped uncertain morris sounded almost calm why the drink in my lap shock treatment and i wanted your full attention are you going to call new york not yet morris swallowed he looked down once at the spreading stain on his pants then somehow put it out of his mind remember id have to convince him i dont believe it myself nobody and nothing would blow up a sun for a breach of hospitality no no morris they have to blow up the sun to get to the next system its a serious thing refusing to build the launching laser it could wreck the ship screw the ship what about a whole planet youre just not looking at it right hold it your ship is a trading ship isnt it what kind of idiots would the monks be to exterminate one market just to get on to the next if we cant build a launching laser we arent a market but we might be a market on the next circuit what next circuit you dont seem to grasp the size of the monks marketplace the communications gap between center and the nearest monk colony is about i stopped to transpose sixtyfour thousand years by the time a ship finishes one circuit most of the worlds shes visited have already forgotten her and then what the colony world that built her may have failed or refitted the spaceport to service a different style of ship or reverted to animal even monks do that shed have to go on to the next system for refitting when you trade among the stars there is no repeat business oh said morris louise had gotten the women back to work with a corner of my mind i heard their giggling discussion as to whether morris would fight whether he could whip me etc morris asked how does it work how do you make a sun go nova theres a gadget the size of a locomotive fixed to the main supporting strut i guess youd call it it points straight astern and it can swing sixteen degrees or so in any direction you turn it on when you make departure orbit the math man works out the intensity you beam the sun for the first year or so and when it blows youre just far enough away to use the push without getting burned but how does it work you just turn it on the power comes from the fusion tube that feeds the attitude jet system oh you want to know why does it make a sun explode i dont know that why should i big as a locomotive and it makes suns explode morris sounded slightly hysterical poor bastard he was beginning to believe me the shock had hardly touched me because truly i had known it since last night he said when we first saw the monk lightsail it was just to one side of a recent nova in sagittarius by any wild chance was that star a market that didnt work out i havent the vaguest idea that convinced him if id been making it up id have said yes morris stood up and walked away without a word he stopped to pick up a bar towel on his way to the phone booth i went behind the bar to make a fresh drink cutty over ice splash of soda i wanted to taste the burning power of it through the glass door i saw louise getting out of her car with her arms full of packages i poured soda over ice squeezed a lime in it and had it ready when she walked in she dumped the load on the bar top irish coffee makings she said i held the glass out to her and she said no thanks ed ones enough taste it she gave me a funny look but she tasted what i handed her soda water well you caught me back on the diet yes you never said yes to that question in your life dont you want to tell me all the details she sipped at her drink details of someone elses diet are boring i should have known that a long time ago to work youll notice weve only got twenty minutes i opened one of her paper bags and fed the refrigerator with cartons of whipping cream another bag held fresh ground coffee the flat square package had to be a pizza pizza some diet i said she was setting out the glass coffeemakers thats for you and bill i tore open the paper and bit into a pieshaped slice it was a deluxe covered with everything from anchovies to salami it was crisp and hot and i was starving i snatched bites as i worked there arent many bars that will keep the makings for irish coffee handy its too much trouble youneed massive quantities of whipping cream and ground coffee a refrigerator a blender a supply of those glass figureeightshaped coffeemakers a line of hot plates andmost expensive of allroom behind the bar for all of that you learn to keep a line of glasses ready which means putting the sugar in them at spare moments to save time later those spare moments are your smoking time so you give that up you learn not to wave your arms around because there are hot things that can burn you you learn to halfwhip the cream a mere spin of the blender because you have to do it over and over again and if you overdo it the cream turns to butter there arent many bars that will go to all that trouble thats why it pays off your average irish coffee addict will drive an extra twenty minutes to reach the long spoon hell also down the drink in about five minutes because otherwise it gets cold hed have spent half an hour over a scotch and soda while we were getting the coffee ready i found time to ask have you remembered anything yes she said tell me i dont mean i know what was in the pill just i can do things i couldnt do before i think my way of thinking has changed ed im worried worried she got the words out in a rush it feels like ive been falling in love with you for a very long time but i havent why should i feel that way so suddenly the bottom dropped out of my stomach id had thoughts like this and put them out of my mind and when they came back i did it again i couldnt afford to fall in love it would cost too much it would hurt too much its been like this all day it scares me ed suppose i feel like this about every man what if the monk thought id make a good call girl i laughed much harder than i should have louise was getting really angry before i was able to stop wait a minute i said are you in love with bill morris too no of course not then forget the call girl bit hes got more money than i do a call girl would love him more if she loved anyone which she wouldnt because call girls are generally frigid how do you know she demanded i read it in a magazine louise began to relax i began to see how tense she really had been all right she said but that means i really am in love with you i pushed the crisis away from us why didnt you ever get married oh she was going to pass it off but she changed her mind every man i dated wanted to sleep with me i thought that was wrong so she looked puzzled why did i think that was wrong way you were brought up yes but she trailed off how do you feel about it flow well i wouldnt sleep with anyone but if a man was worth dating he might be worth marrying and if he was worth marrying hed certainly be worth sleeping with wouldnt he and id be crazy to marry someone i hadnt slept with wouldnt i i did and look how that turned out oh ed im sorry but you did bring it up yah i said breathing shallow but i used to feel that way too somethings changed we hadnt been talking fast there had been pauses gaps and we had worked through them i had had time to eat three slices of pizza louise had had time to wrestle with her conscience lose and eat one only she hadnt done it there was the pizza staring at her and she hadnt given it a look or a smell for louise that was unusual halfjoking i said try this as a theory years ago you must have sublimated your sex urge into an urge for food either that or the rest of us sublimated our appetites into a sex urge and you didnt then the pill unsublimated me hmm she looked thoughtfully at the pizza clearly its lure was gone thats what i mean i didnt used to be able to outstare a pizza those olive eyes hypnotic they were a good call girl should be able to keep herself in shape immediately i regretted saying it it wasnt funny sorry i said its all right she picked up a tray of candles in red glass vases and moved away depositing the candles on the small square tables she moved with grace and beauty through the twilight of the long spoon her hips swaying just enough to avoid the sharp corners of tables id hurt her but shed known me long enough she must know i had footinmouth disease i had seen louise before and known that she was beautiful but it seemed to me that she had never been beautiful with so little excuse she moved back by the same route lighting the candles as she went finally she put the tray down leaned across the bar and said im sorry i cant joke about it when i dont know stop worrying will you whatever the monk fed you he was trying to help you i love you what i love you okay i love you too i use those words so seldom that they clog in my throat as if im lying even when its the truth listen i want to marry you dont shake your head i want to marry you our voices had dropped to whispers in a tormented whisper then she said not until i find out what i do what was in the pill ed i cant trust myself until then me too i said with great reluctance but we cant wait we dont have time what thats right you werent in earshot sometime between three and ten years from now the monks may blow up our sun louise said nothing her forehead wrinkled it depends on how much time they spend trading if we cant build them the launching laser we can still con them into waiting for awhile monk expeditions have waited as long as good lord you mean it is that what you and bill were fighting over yah louise shuddered even in the dimness i saw how pale she had become and she said a strange thing she said all right ill marry you good i said but i was suddenly shaking married again me louise stepped up and put her hands on my shoulders and i kissed her id been wanting to do that for five years she fitted wonderfully into my arms her hands closed hard on the muscles of my shoulders massaging the tension went out of me drained away somewhere married us at least we could have three to ten years morris i said she drew back a little he cant hold you you havent done anything oh i wish i knew what was in that pill i took suppose im the trained assassin suppose i am well have to be careful of each other oh we know all about you youre a starship commander an alien teleport and a translator for monks and one thing more there was a fourth profession i took four pills last night not three oh why didnt you tell bill are you kidding dizzy as i was last night i probably took a course in how to lead a successful revolution god help me if morris found that out she smiled do you really think that was what it was no of course not why did we do it why did we swallow those pills we should have known better maybe the monk took a pill himself maybe theres a pill that teaches a monk how to look trustworthy to a generalized alien i did trust him said louise i remember he seemed so sympathetic would he really blow up our sun he really would that fourth pill maybe it taught you a way to stop him lets see we know i took a linguistics course a course in teleportation for martians and a course in how to fly a lightsail ship on that basis i probably changed my mind and took a karate course for worms it wouldnt hurt you at least relax ed if you remember taking the pills why dont you remember what was in them but i dont i dont remember anything how do you know you took four then here i reached in my pocket and pulled out the scrap of monk cellophane and knew immediately that there was something in it something hard and round we were staring at it when morris came back i must have cleverly put it in my pocket i told them sometime last night when i was feeling sneaky enough to steal from a monk morris turned the pill like a precious jewel in his fingers pale blue it was marked on one side with a burnt orange triangle i dont know whether to get it analyzed or take it myself now we need a miracle maybe this will tell us forget it i wasnt clever enough to remember how fast a monk pill deteriorates the wrappings torn that pill has been bad for at least twelve hours morris said a dirty thing analyze it i said youll find rna and you may even be able to tell what the monks use as a matrix most of the memories are probably intact but dont swallow the damn thing itll scramble your brains all it takes is a few random changes in a tiny percentage of the rna we dont have time to send it to douglass tonight can we put it in the freezer good give it here i dumped the pill in a sandwichsize plastic baggy sucked the air out the top tied the end and dropped it in the freezer vacuum and cold would help preserve the thing it was something i should have done last night so much for miracles morris said bitterly lets get down to business well have several men outside the place tonight and a few more in here you wont know who they are but go ahead and guess if you like a lot of your customers will be turned away tonight theyll be told to watch the newspapers if they want to know why i hope it wont cost you too much business it may make our fortune well be famous were you maybe doing the same thing last night yes we didnt want the place too crowded the monks might not like autograph hounds so thats why the place was half empty morris looked at his watch opening time are we ready take a seat at the bar and look nonchalant dammit louise went to turn on the lights morris took a seat to one side of the middle one big square hand was closed very tightly on the bar edge another gin and tonic weak after that one leave out the gin right nonchalant why should i be nonchalant frazer i had to tell the president of the united states of america that the end of the world is coming unless he does something i had to talk to him myself did he buy it i hope so he was so goddam calm and reassuring i wanted to scream at him god frazer what if we cant build the laser what if we try and fail i gave him a very old and classic answer stupidity is always a capital crime he screamed in my face damn you and your supercilious attitude and your murdering monsters too the next second he was icewater calm never mind frazer youre thinking like a starship captain im what a starship captain has to be able to make a sun go nova to save the ship you cant help it it was in the pill damn he was right i could feel that he was right the pill had warped my way of thinking blowing up the sun that warms another race had to be immoral didnt it i couldnt trust my own sense of right and wrong four men tame in and took one of the bigger tables morriss men no real estate men here to do business somethings been bothering me said morris he grimaced among all the things that have been ruining my composure such as the impending end of the world there was one thing that kept nagging at me i set his ginandtonic in front of him he tasted it and said fine and i finally realized what it was waiting there in the phone booth for a chain of human snails to put the president on frazer are you a college man no webster high see you dont really talk like a bartender you use big words i do sometimes and you talked about suns exploding but you knew what i meant when i said nova you talked about hbomb power but you knew what fusion was sure i got the possibly silly impression that you were learning the words the instant i said them parlezvous franзais no i dont speak any foreign languages none at all nope what do you think they teach at webster high je parle la langue un peu frazer et tu merde de cochon morris je vous ditoops he didnt give me a chance to think it over he said whats fanac my head had that clogged feeling again i said might be anything putting out a sine writing to the lettercol helping put on a conmorris what is this that language course was more extensive than we thought sure as hell it was i just remembered those women on the cleaning team were speaking spanish but i understood them spanish french monkish technical languages even fannish what you got was a generalized course in how to understand languages the instant you hear them i dont see bow it could work without telepathy reading minds maybe several times today it had felt like i was guessing with too much certainty at somebodys private thoughts can you read my mind thats not quite it i get the feel of how you think not what youre thinking morris i dont like the idea of being a political prisoner well we can talk that over later when my bargaining position is better morris meant when i dont need the bartenders good will to con the monk whats important is that you might be able to read a monks mind that could be crucial and maybe he can read mine and yours i let morris sweat over that one while i set drinks on louises tray already there were customers at four tables the long spoon was filling rapidly and only two of them were secret service morris said any ideas on what louise schu ate last night weve got your professions pretty well pegged down finally ive got an idea its kind of vague i looked around louise was taking more orders sheer guesswork in fact will you keep it to yourself for awhile dont tell louise surefor awhile i made four drinks and louise took them away i told morris i have a profession in mind it doesnt have a simple one or two word name like teleport or starship captain or translator theres no reason why it should is there were dealing with aliens morris sipped at his drink waiting being a woman i said can be a profession in a way that being a man can never be the word is housewife but it doesnt cover all of it not nearly housewife youre putting me on no you wouldnt notice the change you never saw her before last night just what kind of change have you got in mind aside from the fact that shes beautiful which i did notice yes she is morris but last night she was twenty pounds overweight do you think she lost it all this morning she was too heavy pretty but also pretty well padded morris turned to look over his shoulder casually turned back damn shes still well padded why didnt i notice before theres another thingby the way have some pizza thanks he bit into a slice cood its still hot well shes been staring at that pizza for half an hour she bought it but she hasnt tasted it she couldnt possibly have done that yesterday she may have had a big breakfast yah i knew she hadnt shed eaten diet food for years shed kept a growing collection of diet food but shed never actively tried to survive on it before but how could i make such a claim to morris id never even been in louises apartment anything else shes gotten good at nonverbal communication its a very womanly skill she can say things just by the tone of her voice or the way she leans on an elbow or but if mind reading is one of your new skills damn well it used to make louise nervous if someone touched her and she never touched anyone else i felt myself flushing i dont talk easily of personal things morris radiated skepticism it all sounds very subjective in fact it sounds like youre making yourself believe it frazer why would louise schu want such a capsule course because you havent described a housewife at all youve described a woman looking to persuade a man to many her he saw my face change whats wrong ten minutes ago we decided to get married congratulations morris said and waited all right you win until ten minutes ago wed never even kissed id never made a pass or vice versa no damn it i dont believe it i know she loves me i ought to i dont deny it morris said quietly that would be why she took the pill it must have been strong stuff too frazer we looked up some of your history youre marriageshy it was true enough i said if she loved me before i never knew it i wonder how a monk could know how would he know about such a skill at all why would he have the pill on him come on frazer youre the monk expert hed have to learn from human beings maybe by interviews maybe bywell the monks can map an alien memory into a computer space then interview that they may have done that with some of your diplomats oh great louise appeared with an order i made the drinks and set them op her tray she winked and walked away swaying deliciously followed by many eyes morris most of your diplomats the ones who deal with the monks theyre men arent they most of them why just a thought it was a difficult thought hard to grasp it was only that the changes in louise had been all to the good from a mans point of view the monks must have interviewed many men well why not it would make her more valuable to the man she caughtor to the lucky man who caught her got it morris looked up quickly well falling in love with me was part of her pill learning a set they made a guinea pig of her i wondered what she saw in you morriss grin faded youre serious frazer that still doesnt answer its a slave indoctrination course it makes a woman love the first man she sees permanently and it trains her to be valuable to him the monks were going to make them in quantity and sell them to men morris thought it over presently he said thats awful whatll we do well we cant tell her shes been made into a domestic slave morris ill try to get a memory eraser pill if i cant ill marry her i guess dont look at me that way i said low and fierce i didnt do it and i cant desert her now i know its justoh put gin in the next one dont look now i said in the glass of the door there was darkness and motion a hooded shape shadowonshadow supernatural a human silhouette twisted out of true he came gliding in with the hem of his robe just brushing the floor nothing was to be seen of him but his flowing gray robe the darkness in the hood and the shadow where his robe parted the real estate men broke off their talk of land and stared popeyed and one of them reached for his heart attack pills the monk drifted toward me like a vengeful ghost he took the stool we had saved him at one end of the bar it wasnt the same monk in all respects he matched the monk who had been here these last two nights louise and morris must have been fooled completely but it wasnt the same monk good evening i said he gave an equivalent greeting in the whispered monk language his translator was half on translating my words into a monk whisper but letting his own speech alone he said i believe we should begin with the rock and rye i turned to pour the small of my back itched with danger when i turned back with the shot glass in my hand he was holding a fistsized tool that must have come out of his robe it looked like a flattened softball grooved deeply for five monk claws with two parallel tubes poking out in my direction lenses glinted in the ends of the tubes do you know this tool it is a and he named it i knew the name it was a beaming tool a multifrequency laser one tube locked on the target thereafter the aim was maintained by tiny flywheels in the body of the device morris had seen it he didnt recognize it and he didnt know what to do about it and i had no way to signal him i know that tool i confirmed you must take two of these pills the monk had them ready in another hand they were small and pink and triangular he said i must be convinced that you have taken them otherwise you must take more than two an overdose may affect your natural memory come closer i came closer every man and woman in the long spoon was staring at us and each was afraid to move any kind of signal would have trained four guns on the monk and id be fried dead by a narrow beam of xrays the monk reached out with a third hand foot claw he dosed the fingers toes around my throat not hand enough to strangle me but hard enough morris was cursing silently helplessly i could feel the agony in his soul the monk whispered you know of the trigger mechanism if my hand should relax now the device will fire its target is yourself if you can prevent four government agents from attacking me you should do so i made a palmup gesture toward morris dont do anything he caught it and nodded very slightly without looking at me you can read minds i said yes said the monkand i knew instantly what he was hiding he could read everybodys mind except mine so much for morriss little games of deceit but the monk could not read my mind and i could see into his own soul and reading his alien soul i saw that i would die if i did not swallow the pills i placed the pink pills on my tongue one at a time and swallowed them dry they went down hard morris watched it happen and could do nothing the monk felt them going down my throat little lumps moving past his finger and when the pills had passed across the monks finger i worked a miracle your pillinduced memories and skills will be gone within two hours said the monk he picked up the shot glass of rock and rye and moved it into his hood when it reappeared it was half empty i asked why have you robbed inc of my knowledge you never paid for it but it was freely given it was given by one who had no right said the monk he was thinking about leaving i had to do something i knew now because i had reasoned it out with great care that the monk was involved in an evil enterprise but he must stay to hear me or i could not convince him even then it wouldnt be easy he was a monk crewman his ethical attitudes had entered his brain through an rna pill along with his professional skills you have spoken of rights i said in monk let us discuss rights the whispery words buzzed oddly in my throat they tickled but my ears told me they were coming out right the monk was startled i was told that you had been taught our speech but not that you cbuld speak it were you told what pill i was given a language pill i had not known that he carried one in his case he did not finish his tasting of the alcohols of earth will you have another drink i felt him guess at my motives and guess wrong he thought i was taking advantage of his curiosity to sell him my wares for cash and what had he to fear from me whatever mental powers i had learned from monk pills they would be gone in two hours i set a shot glass before him i asked him how do you feel about launching lasers the discussion became highly technical let us take a special case i remember saying suppose a culture has been capable of starlight for some sixtyfours of yearsor even for eights of times that long then an asteroid slams into a major ocean precipitates an ice age it had happened once and well he knew it a natural disaster cant spell the difference between sentience and nonsentience can it not unless it affects brain tissue directly at first it was his curiosity that held him later it was me he couldnt tear himself loose he never thought of it he was a sailship crewman and he was cold sober and he argued with the frenzy of an evangelist then take the general case i remember saying a world that cannot build a launching laser is a world of animals yes and monks themselves can revert to animals yes he knew that then build your own launching laser if you cannot then your ship is captained and crewed by animals at the end i was doing all the talking all in the whispery monk tongue whose sounds are so easily distinguished that even i warping a human throat to my will need only whisper it was a good thing i seemed to have been eating used razor blades morris guessed right he did not interfere i could tell him nothing not if i had had the power not by word or gesture or mental contact the monk would read morriss mind but morris sat quietly drinking his tonicandtonics waiting for something to happen while i argued in whispers with the monk but the ship he whispered what of the ship his agony was mine for the ship must be protected at one fifteen the monk was halfway across the bottom row of bottles he slid from the stool paid for his drinks in one dollar bills and drifted to the door and out all he needed was a scythe and hour glass i thought watching him go and what i needed was a long mornings sleep and i wasnt going to get it be sure nobody stops him i told morris nobody will but hell be followed no point the garment to wear among strangers is a lot of things its bracing it helps the monk hold human shape its a shield and an air filter and its a cloak of invisibility oh ill tell you about it if i have time thats how he got out here probably one of the crewmen divided and then one stayed and one walked he had two weeks morris stood up and tore off his sport jacket his shirt was wet through he said what about a stomach pump for you no good most of the rnaenzyme must be in my blood by now youll be better off if you spend your time getting down everything i can remember about monks while i can remember anything at all itll be nine or ten hours before everything goes which was a flatout lie of course okay let me get the dictaphone going again itll cost you money morris suddenly had a hard look oh how much id thought about that most carefully one hundred thousand dollars and if youre thinking of arguing me down remember whose time were wasting i wasnt he was but hed changed his mind good well transfer the money now while i can still read your mind all right he offered to make room for me in the booth but i declined the glass wouldnt stop me from reading morriss soul he came out silent for there was something he was afraid to know then what about the monks what about our sun i talked that one around thats why i dont want him molested hell convince others talked him around how it wasnt easy and suddenly i would have given my soul to sleep the profession pill put it in his genes he must protect the ship its in me too i know how strong it is then dont be an ass morris the ships perfectly safe where it is in orbit around the moon a sailships only in danger when its between stars far from help oh not that that convinced him it only let him consider the ethics of the situation rationally suppose someone else unconvinces him it could happen thats why wed better build the launching laser morris nodded unhappily the next twelve hours were rough in the first four hours i gave them everything i could remember about the monk teleport system monk technology monk family life monk ethics relations between monks and aliens details on aliens directions of various inhabited and uninhabited worlds everything morris and the secret service men who had been posing as customers sat around me like boys around a campfire listening to stories but louise made us fresh coffee then went to sleep in one of the booths then i let myself slack off by nine in the morning i was flat on my back staring at the ceiling dictating a random useless bit of information every thirty seconds or so by eleven there was a great black pool of lukewarm coffee inside me my eyes ached marginally more than the rest of me and i was producing nothing i was convincing and i knew it but morris wouldnt let it go at that he believed me i felt him believing me but he was going through the routine anyway because it couldnt hurt if i was useless to him if i knew nothing there was no point in playing soft what could he lose he accused me of making everything up he accused me of faking the pills he made me sit up and damn near caught me that way he used obscure words and phrases from mathematics and latin and fan vocabulary he got nowhere there wasnt any way to trick me at two in the afternoon he had someone drive me home every muscle in me ached but i had to fight to maintain my exhausted slump else my hindbrain would have lifted me onto my toes and poised me against a possible shift in artificial gravity the strain was double and it hurt it had hurt for hours sitting with my shoulders hunched and my head hanging but now if morris saw me walking like a trampoline performer morriss man got me to my room and left me i woke in darkness and sensed someone in my room someone who meant me no harm in fact louise i went back to sleep i woke again at dawn louise was in my easy chair her feet propped on a corner of the bed her eyes were open she said breakfast i said yah there isnt much in the fridge i brought things all right i closed my eyes five minutes later i decided i was all slept out i got up and went to see how she was doing there was bacon frying there was bread already buttered for toasting in the toastroven there was a pan hot for eggs and the eggs scrambled in a bowl louise was filling the percolator give that here a minute i said it only bad water in it i held the pot in my hands closed my eyes and tried to remember ah i knew id done it right even before the heat touched my bands the pot held hot fragrant coffee we were wrong about the first pill i told louise she was looking at me very curiously what happened that second night was this the monk had a translator gadget but he wasnt too happy with it it kept screaming in his ear screaming english he could turn off the part that was shouting english at me and it would still whisper a monk translation of what i was saying but first be bad to teach me the monk language he didnt have a pill to do that he didnt have a generalized language learning course either if there is one which i doubt he was pretty drunk but he found something that would serve the profession it taught me was something like yours i mean its an old one and it doesnt have a oneortwoword name but if it did the word would be prophet prophet said louise prophet she was doing a remarkable thing she was listening with all her concentration and scrambling eggs at the same time or disciple maybe apostle comes closer anyway it included the gift of tongues which was what the monk was after but it included other talents too like turning cold water into hot coffee miracles right i used the same talent to make the little pink amnesia pills disappear before they hit my stomach but an apostles major talent is persuasion last night i convinced a monk crewman that blowing up suns is an evil thing morris is afraid that someone might convert him back i dont think thats possible the mind reading talent that goes with the prophet pill goes deeper than just reading minds i read souls the monk is my apostle maybe hell convince the whole crew that im right or he may just curse the hachiroph shisp the little old nova maker which is what i intend to do curse it do you think im kidding or something oh no she poured our coffee will that stop it working yes good said louise and i felt the power of her own faith her faith in me it gave her the serenity of an idealized nun when she turned back to serve the eggs i dropped a pink triangular pill in her coffee she finished setting breakfast and we sat down louise said then thats it its all over all over i swallowed some orange juice wonderful what fourteen hours sleep will do for a mans appetite all over i can go back to my fourth profession the only one that counts she looked up quickly bartender first last and foremost im a bartender youre going to marry a bartender good she said relaxing in two hours or so the slave sets would be gone from her mind she would be herself again free independent unable to diet and somewhat shy but the pink pill would not destroy real memories two hours from now louise would still know that i loved her and perhaps she would marry me after all i said well have to hire an assistant and raise our prices theyll be fighting their way in when the story gets out louise had pursued her own thoughts bill morris looked awful when i left you ought to tell him he can stop worrying oh no i want him scared morris has got to talk the rest of the world into building a launching laser instead of just throwing bombs at the monk ship and we need the launching laser mmm thats good coffee why do we need a launching laser to get to the stars thats morriss bag youre a bartender remember the fourth profession i shook my head you and morris you dont see how big the monk marketplace is or how thin the monks are scattered how many novas have you seen in your lifetime damn few i said there are damn few trading ships in a godawful lot of sky there arc things out there besides monks things the monks are afraid of and probably others they dont know about things so dangerous that the only protection is to be somewhere else circling some other star when it happens here the monk drive is our lifeline and our immortality it would be cheap at any price your eyes are glowing she breathed she looked half hypnotized and utterly convinced and i knew that for the rest of my life i would have to keep a tight rein on my tendency to preach
