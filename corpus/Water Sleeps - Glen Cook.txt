water sleeps by glen cook the eighth chronicle of the black company in those days the black company did not exist this i know because there were laws and decrees that told me so but i did not feel entirely insubstantial the company standard its captain and lieutenant its standardbearer and all the men who had made the company so terrible had passed on having been buried alive at the heart of a vast desert of stone glittering stone they whispered in the streets and alleys of taglios and gone to khatovar they proclaimed from on high the mighty making what they had been so determined to prevent for so long over into a great triumph once the radisha or protector or somebody decided that people ought to believe that the company had fulfilled its destiny anyone old enough to remember the company knew better only fifty people had ventured out onto that plain of glittering stone half of those people had not been company only two of those fifty had returned to lie about what had happened and a third who had come back to retail the truth had been killed in the kiaulune wars far away from the capital but the deceits of soulcatcher and willow swan fooled no one then or now people simply pretended to believe them because that was safer they might have asked why mogaba needed five years to conquer a company that had passed on squandering thousands of young lives to bring the kiaulune domains under the radishas rule and into the realm of the protectors twisted truths they might have mentioned that people claiming to be black company had held out in the fortress overlook for years after that until the protector soulcatcher finally became so impatient with their intransigence that she invested her own best sorceries in a twoyear project that reduced that huge fortress to white powder white rubble and white bones they might have raised these points but they remained silent instead they were afraid with cause they were afraid the taglian empire under the protectorate is an empire of fear during the years of defiance one unknown hero won soulcatchers eternal hatred by sabotaging the shadowgate the sole gateway to the glittering plain soulcatcher was the most powerful sorcerer alive she might have become a shadowmaster to eclipse those monsters the company had pulled down during its earlier wars on taglios behalf but with the shadowgate sealed she could not conjure killer shadows more powerful than the few score she had controlled when she worked her treachery on the company oh she could open the shadowgate one time she did not know how to close it again though meaning everything inside would be free to wriggle out and begin tormenting the world meaning that for soulcatcher party to so few of the secrets the choice must be all or very little the end of the world or making do for the moment she is making do and pursuing continuous researches she is the protector fear of her steeps the empire there are no challenges to her terror but even she knows this age of dark concord cannot endure water sleeps in their homes in the shadowed alleyways in the citys ten thousand temples nervous whispers never cease the year of the skulls the year of the skulls it is an age when no gods die and those that sleep keep stirring restlessly in their homes in the shadowed alleyways or fields of grain or in the sodden paddies in the pastures and forests and tributary cities should a comet be seen in the sky or should an unseasonable storm strew devastation or particularly if the earth should shake they murmur water sleeps and they are afraid they call me sleepy i was withdrawn as a child hiding from the horrors of my childhood inside the comfort and emotional safety of daydreams and nightmares any time i did not have to work i went away in there to hide the evil could not touch me there i knew no safer place till the black company came to jaicur my brothers accused me of sleeping all the time they resented my ability to get away they did not understand they died without ever understanding i slept on i did not waken fully till i had been with the company for several years i keep these annals today somebody must and no one else can though the annalist title never devolved upon me formally there is precedent the books must be written the truth must be recorded even if fate decrees that no man ever reads a word i write the annals are the soul of the black company they recall that this is who we are that this is who we were that we persevere and that treachery as it ever has failed to suck the last drop of our blood we no longer exist the protector tells us so the radisha swears it mogaba that mighty general with his thousand dark honors sneers at our memory and spits on our name people in the streets declare us no more than an evil haunting memory but only soulcatcher does not watch over both shoulders to see what might be gaining ground we are stubborn ghosts we will not lie down we will not cease to haunt them we have done nothing for a long time but they remain afraid their guilt cannot stop whispering our name they should be afraid somewhere in taglios every day a message appears upon a wall written in chalk or paint or even animal blood just a gentle reminder water sleeps everyone knows what that means they whisper it aware that there is an enemy out there more restless than running water an enemy who will somehow someday lurch forth from the mouth of his grave and come for those who played at betrayal they know no power that can prevent it they were warned ten thousand times before they gave in to temptation no evil can preserve them mogaba is afraid radisha is afraid willow swan is so afraid he barely functions like the wizard smoke before him whom he indicted and tormented for his cowardice swan knew the company of old in the north before anyone here recognized it as more than a dark memory of ancient terror the years have seen no calluses form on swans fear purohita drupada is afraid inspectorgeneral gokhale is afraid only the protector is not afraid soulcatcher fears nothing soulcatcher does not care she mocks and defies the demon she is mad she will laugh and be entertained while being consumed by fire her lack of fear leaves her henchmen that much more troubled they know she will drive them before her into the grinding jaws of destiny occasionally a wall will carry another message a more personal note all their days are numbered i am in the streets every day either going to work going to spy listening capturing rumors or launching new ones within the anonymity of chor bagan the thieves garden even the greys have not yet been able to extirpate i used to disguise myself as a prostitute but that proved to be too dangerous there are people out there who make the protector seem a paragon of sanity it is the worlds great good fortune that fate denies them the power to exercise the fullest depth and sweep of their psychoses mostly i go around as a young man the way i always did rootless young men are everywhere since the end of the wars the more bizarre the new rumor the faster it explodes out of chor bagan and the more strongly it gnaws the nerves of our enemies always always taglios must enjoy a sense of grim premonition we must provide them their ration of omens signs and portents the protector hunts us in her more lucid moments but she never remains interested long she cannot keep her attention fixed on anything and why should she be concerned we are dead we no longer exist she herself has declared that to be the reality as protector she is the great arbiter of reality for the entire taglian empire but water sleeps in those days the spine of the company was a woman who never formally joined the witch ky sahra wife of my predecessor as annalist murgen the standardbearer ky sahra was a clever woman with a will like sharp steel even goblin and oneeye deferred to her she would not be intimidated not even by her wicked old uncle doj she feared the protector the radisha and the greys no more than she feared a cabbage the malice of evils as great as the deadly cult of deceivers their messiah the daughter of night and their goddess kina intimidated sahra not at all she had looked into the heart of darkness its secrets inspired in her no dread only one thing made sahra tremble her mother ky gota was the incarnation of dissatisfaction and complaint her lamentations and reproaches were of such amazing potency that it seemed she must be an avatar of some cranky old deity as yet undiscovered by man nobody loves ky gota except oneeye and even he calls her the troll behind her back sahra shuddered as her mother limped slowly through a room gone suddenly silent we were not in power now we had to use the same few rooms for everything only a short while ago this one had been filled with loafers some company most of them employees of banh do trang we all stared at the old woman willing her to hurry willing her to overlook this opportunity to socialize old do trang who was so feeble he was confined to a wheelchair rolled over to ky gota evidently hoping a show of concern would keep her moving everyone always wanted gota to go somewhere else this time his sacrifice worked she had to be in a lot of discomfort though not to take time to harangue all who were younger than she silence persisted till the old merchant returned he owned the place and let us use it as our operational headquarters he owed us nothing but nevertheless shared our danger out of love for sahra in all matters his thoughts had to be heard and his wishes had to be honored do trang was not gone long he came back rolling wearily the man behind the liver spots seemed so fragile it had to be a miracle that he could move his chair himself ancient he was but there was an irrepressible twinkle in his eyes he nodded he seldom had anything to say unless someone else said something incredibly stupid he was a good man sahra told us everything is in place every phase and facet has been doublechecked goblin and oneeye are sober its time the company speaks up she glanced around inviting comments i did not think it was time but i had said my piece when i was planning this and had been outvoted i treated myself to a shrug of despair there being no new objections sahra said start the first phase she waved at her son tobo nodded and slipped out he was a skinny scruffy furtive youngster he was nyueng bao which meant he had to be a sneak and a thief his every move had to be watched in consequence he was so generally observed that no individual examined in detail what he actually did so long as his hands did not stray toward a dangling purse or some treasure in a vendors stall people did not look for what they did not expect to see the boys hands stayed behind his back while they were there he was not considered a threat he could not steal no one noticed the small discolored blobs he left on any wall he leaned against gunni children stared the boy looked so strange in his black pajama clothing gunni raise their children polite gunni are peaceable folk in the main shadar children though are wrought of sterner stuff they are more bold their religion has a warrior philosophy at its root some shadar youths set out to harass the thief of course he was a thief he was nyueng bao everyone knew all nyueng bao were thieves older shadar called the youngsters off the thief would be dealt with by those whose responsibility that was the shadar religion has its streak of bureaucratic rectitude too even such a small commotion attracted official attention three tall greyclad bearded shadar peacekeepers wearing white turbans advanced through the press they looked around constantly intently oblivious to the fact that they traveled in an island of open space the streets of taglios are packed day and night yet the masses always find room to shrink away from the greys the greys are all men with hard eyes seemingly chosen for their lack of patience and compassion tobo drifted away sliding through the mob like a black snake through swamp reeds when the greys inquired about the commotion no one could describe him as anything but what prejudice led them to presume a nyueng bao thief and there was a plague of those in taglios these days the capital city boasted plenty of every kind of outlander imaginable every layabout and lackwit and sharpster from the length and breadth of the empire was migrating to the city the population had tripled in a generation but for the cruel efficiencies of the greys taglios would have become a chaotic murderous sink a hellfire fueled by poverty and despair poverty and despair existed in plentitude but the palace did not let any disorder take root the palace was good at ferreting out secrets criminal careers tended to be short as did the lives of most who sought to conspire against the radisha or the protector particularly against the protector who did not concern herself deeply with the sanctity of anyone elses skin in times past intrigue and conspiracy had been a miasmatic plague afflicting every life in taglios there was little of that anymore the protector did not approve most taglians were eager to win the protectors approval even the priesthoods avoided attracting soulcatchers evil eye at some point the boys black clothing came off leaving him in the gunnistyle loincloth he had worn underneath now he looked like any other youngster though with a slightly jaundiced cast of skin he was safe he had grown up in taglios he had no accent to give him away it was the waiting time the stillness the doing nothing that there is so much of before any serious action i was out of practice i could not lean back and play tonk or just watch while oneeye and goblin tried to cheat each other and i had writers cramp so could not work on my annals tobo i called you want to go see it happen tobo was fourteen he was the youngest of us he grew up in the black company he had a full measure of youths exuberance and impatience and overconfidence in his own immortality and divine exemption from retribution he enjoyed his assignments on behalf of the company he was not quite sure he believed in his father he never knew the man we tried hard to keep him from becoming anyones spoiled baby but goblin insisted on treating him like a favorite son he was trying to tutor the boy goblins command of written taglian was more limited than he would admit there are a hundred characters in the everyday vulgate and forty more reserved to the priests who write in the high mode which is almost a second unspoken formal language i use a mixture recording these annals once tobo could read uncle goblin made him do all his reading for him aloud could i do some more buttons sleepy mom thinks more would get more attention in the palace i was surprised he talked to her that long boys his age are surly at best he was rude to his mother all the time he would have been ruder and more defiant still if he had not been blessed with so many uncles who would not tolerate that stuff naturally tobo saw all that as a grand conspiracy of adults publicly in private he was amenable to reason occasionally when approached delicately by someone who was not his mother maybe a few but its going to get dark soon and then the show will start whatll we go as i dont like it when youre a whore well be street orphans though that had its risks too we could get caught by a press gang and forced into mogabas army his soldiers these days are little better than slaves subject to a savage discipline many are petty criminals given an option of rough justice or enlistment the rest are children of poverty with nowhere else to go which was the standard of professional armies men like murgen saw in the far north long before my time why do you worry so much about disguises if we never show the same face twice our enemies cant possibly know who theyre looking for dont ever underestimate them especially not the protector shes outwitted death itself more than once tobo was not prepared to believe that or much else of our exotic history though not as bad as most he was going through that stage where he knew everything worth knowing and nothing his elders said particularly if it bore any vaguely educational hue was worth hearing he could not help that it went with the age and i was my age and could not help saying things i knew would do no good its in the annals your father and the captain didnt make up stories he did not want to believe that either i did not pursue it each of us must learn to respect the annals in our own way in our own time the companys diminished circumstance makes it difficult for anyone to grasp tradition only two old crew brothers both survived soulcatchers trap on the stone plain and the kiaulune wars afterward goblin and oneeye are haplessly inept at transmitting the company mystique oneeye is too lazy and goblin too inarticulate and i was still practically an apprentice when the old crew ventured onto the plain in the captains quest for khatovar which he did not find not the khatovar he was looking for anyway i am amazed before long i will be a twentyyear veteran i was barely fourteen when bucket took me under his wing but i was never like tobo at fourteen i was already ancient in pain for years after bucket rescued me i grew younger what i asked why you look so angry all of a sudden i was remembering when i was fourteen girls have it so easy he shut up his face drained his northern ancestry became apparent he was an arrogant and spoiled little puke but he did have brains enough to recognize it when he stepped into a nest of poisonous snakes i told him what he knew not what he did not when i was fourteen the company and nyueng bao were trapped in jaicur dejagore they call it here the rest does not matter anymore the rest is safely in the past i almost never have nightmares now tobo had heard more than he ever wanted to about jaicur already his mother and grandmother and uncle doj had been there too goblin says well be impressed by these buttons tobo whispered they wont just make spooky lights theyll prick somebodys conscience thatll be unusual conscience was a rare commodity on either side of our dispute you really knew my dad tobo had heard stories all his life but lately wanted to know more murgen had begun to matter in a more than lipservice fashion i told him what i had told him before he was my boss he taught me to read and write he was a good man i laughed weakly as good a man as belonging to the black company let him be tobo stopped he took a deep breath he stared at a point in the dusk somewhere above my left shoulder were you lovers no tobo no friends almost but definitely not that he didnt know i was a woman till just before he left for the glittering plain and i didnt know he knew till i read his annals nobody knew they thought i was a cute runt who just never got any bigger i let them think that i felt safer as one of the guys oh his tone was so neutral i had to wonder why did you even ask surely he had no reason to believe i had behaved differently before he knew me he shrugged i just wondered something must have set him off possibly an i wonder if from goblin or oneeye say while they were sampling some of their homemade elephant poison i didnt ask did you put the buttons behind the shadow show thats what i was told to do a shadow show uses cutout puppets mounted on sticks some of their limbs are manipulated mechanically a candle behind the puppets casts their shadows on a screen of white cloth the puppeteer uses a variety of voices to tell his story as he maneuvers his puppets if he is sufficiently entertaining his audience will toss him a few coins this particular puppeteer had performed in the same place for more than a generation he slept inside his stage setup in so doing he lived better than most of taglios floating population he was an informer he was not beloved of the black company the story he told as most were was drawn from the myths it sprang from the khadi cycle it involved a goddess with too many arms who kept devouring demons of course it was the same demon puppet over and over kind of like real life where the same demon comes back again and again just a hint of color hung above the western rooftops there was an earsplitting squeal people stopped to stare at a bright orange light glowing orange smoke wobbled up from behind the puppeteers stand its strands wove the wellknown emblem of the black company a fanged skull with no lower jaw exhaling flames the scarlet fire in its left eye socket seemed to be a pupil that stared right down inside you searching for the thing that you feared the most the smoke thing persisted only a few seconds it rose about ten feet before it dispersed it left a frightened silence the air itself seemed to whisper water sleeps whine and flash a second skull arose this one was silver with a slightly bluish tint it lasted longer and rose a dozen feet higher before it perished it whispered my brother unforgiven here come the greys exclaimed someone tall enough to see over the crowd being short makes it easy for me to disappear in groups but also makes it tough for me to see what is happening outside them the greys are never far away but they are helpless against this sort of thing it can happen anywhere any time and has to happen before they can react our supposed ironclad rule is that perpetrators should never be nearby when the buttons speak the greys understand that they just go through the motions the protector must be appeased the little shadar have to be fed now tobo murmured as four greys arrived a shriek erupted from behind the puppeteers stage the puppeteer himself ran out spun and leaned toward his stage mouth wide open there was a flash less bright but more persistent than its predecessors the subsequent smoke image was more complex and lasted longer it appeared to be a monster the monster focused on the shadar one of the greys mouthed the name niassi niassi would be a major demon from shadar mythology a similar demon under another form of the name exists in gunni belief niassi was a chieftain of the inner circle of the most powerful demons shadar beliefs being heretical vehdna include a posthumous punitive hell but also definitely include the possibility of a gunnilike hell on earth in life managed by demons in niassis employ laid on for the particularly wicked despite understanding that they were being taunted the greys were rocked this was something new this was an attack from an unanticipated and sensitive direction and it came on top of ever more potent rumors associating the greys with vile rites supposedly practiced by the protector children disappear reason suggests this is inevitable and unavoidable in a city so vast and overcrowded even if there is not one evil man out there babies vanish by wandering off and getting lost and horrible things do happen to good people a clever sick rumor can reassign the numb evil of chance to the premeditated malice of people no one ever trusted anyway memory becomes selective we do not mind a bit lying about our enemies tobo yelled something insulting i started to pull him away dragging him toward our den others began to curse and mock the greys tobo threw a stone that hit a greys turban it was too dark for them to make out faces they began to unlimber bamboo wands the mood of the crowd turned ugly i could not help but suspect that there was more to the devil display than had met the eye i knew our tame wizards and i knew that taglians do not lose control easily it takes a great deal of patience and selfcontrol for so many people to live in such unnaturally tight proximity i looked around for crows fluttering bats or anything else that might be spies for the protector after nightfall all our risks soar we cannot see what might be watching i held onto tobos arm you shouldnt have done that its dark enough for shadows to be out he was not impressed goblin will be happy he spent a long time on that and it worked perfectly the greys blew whistles summoning reinforcements a fourth button released its smoke ghost we missed the show i dragged tobo through all the shadow traps between the excitement and our headquarters he would be explaining to some uncles soon those for whom paranoia remains a way of life will be those who will be around to savor the companys many revenges tobo needed more instruction his behavior could have been exploited by a clever adversary sahra summoned me as soon as we arrived not to chastise me for letting tobo take stupid risks but to observe as she launched her next move it might be time tobo walked into something that would scare some sense into him life underground is unforgiving it seldom gives you more than one chance tobo had to understand that in his heart after sahra grilled me about events outside she made sure goblin and oneeye were acquainted with her displeasure too tobo was not there to defend himself goblin and oneeye were not cowed no fortysomething slip of a lass could overawe those two antiques besides they put tobo up to half his mischief sahra said ill raise murgen now she seemed unsure about that she had not consulted murgen much recently we all wondered why she and murgen were a genuine romantic love match straight out of legend with all the appurtenances seen in the timeless stories including gods defied parents disappointed desperate separations and reunions intrigues by enemies and so forth it remained only for one of them to go down into the realm of the dead to rescue the other and murgen was tucked away in a nice cold underground hell right now courtesy of the mad sorceress soulcatcher he and all the captured lived on in stasis beneath the plain of glittering stone in a place and situation known to us only because sahra could conjure murgens spirit could the problem be the stasis sahra got a day older every day murgen did not had she begun to fear she would be older than his mother before we freed the captured sadly after years of study i realize that most history may really pivot on personal considerations like that not on the pursuit of ideals dark or shining long ago murgen learned to leave his flesh while he slept he retained some of that ability but sadly it was diminished by the supernatural constraints of his captivity he could do nothing outside the cavern of the ancients without being summoned forth by sahra or conceivably chillingly by any other necromancer who knew how to reach him murgens ghost was the ultimate spy outside our circle none but soulcatcher could detect his presence murgen informed us of our enemies every plot those that we suspected strongly enough to ask sahra to investigate the process was cumbersome and limited but still murgen constituted our most potent weapon we could not survive without him and sahra was ever more reluctant to call him up god knows it is hard to keep believing many of our brothers have lost their faith and have drifted away vanishing into the chaos of the empire some may be rejuvenated once we have had a flashy success or two the years have been painful for sahra they cost her three children an agony no loving parent should have to bear she lost their father as well but suffered little by that deprivation no one who remembered the man spoke well of him she suffered with the rest of us during the siege of jaicur maybe sahra and the entire nyueng bao people had angered ghanghesha or maybe the god with the several elephant heads just enjoyed a cruel prank at the expense of his worshipers certainly kina got a chuckle out of pulling lethal practical jokes on her devotees goblin and oneeye were not usually present when sahra raised murgen she did not need their help her powers were narrow but strong and those two could be a distraction even when they tried to behave those antiques being there told me something unusual was afoot and old they are almost beyond reckoning their skills sustain them oneeye if the annals do not lie is on the downhill side of two hundred his youthful sidekick lags less than a century behind neither is a big man which is being generous both are shorter than me and never were taller even long before they became driedup old relics which was probably when they were about fifteen i cannot imagine oneeye ever having been anything but old he must have been born old and wearing the ugliest filthiest black hat that ever existed maybe oneeye goes on forever because of the curse of that hat maybe the hat uses him as its steed and depends on him for its survival that crusty stinking glob of felt rag will hit the nearest fire before oneeyes corpse finishes bouncing everyone hates it goblin in particular loathes that hat he mentions it whenever he and oneeye get into a squabble which is about as often as they see one another oneeye is small and black and wrinkled goblin is small and white and wrinkled he has a face like a dried toads oneeye mentions that whenever they get into a squabble which is about as often as there is an audience but nobody to get between them they strain to be on their best behavior around sahra though the woman has a gift she brings out the best in people except her mother though the troll is much worse away from her daughter lucky us we do not see ky gota much her joints hurt her too bad tobo helps care for her our cynical exploitation of his special immunity from her vitriol she dotes on the boy even if his father was foreign slime sahra told me these two claim theyve found a more effective way to materialize murgen so you can communicate directly usually sahra had to talk for murgen after she raised him up i do not have a psychic ear i said if you bring him across strong enough so the rest of us can see and hear him then tobo ought to be here too hes suddenly got a lot of questions about his father sahra peered at me oddly i was saying something but she did not get what i meant boy ought to know his old man oneeye rasped he stared at goblin waiting to be contradicted by a man who did not know his that was their custom pick a fight and never mind trivia like facts or common sense the debate about whether or not they were worth the trouble they caused went back for generations this time goblin abstained he would make his rebuttal when sahra was not around to embarrass him with an appeal to reason sahra nodded to oneeye but first we have to see if your scheme really works oneeye began to puff up somebody dared suggest that his sorcery needed fieldtesting come on forget the record this time i told him dont start time had caught up with oneeye his memory was no longer reliable and lately he tended to nod off in the middle of things or to forget what had gotten him exercised when he roared off on a rant sometimes he ended up contradicting himself he was a shadow of the driedup old relic he was when first i met him though he got around under his own power still but halfway through any journey he was likely to forget where he was bound occasionally that was good him being oneeye but mostly it was a pain tobo usually got the job of keeping him headed in the right direction when it mattered oneeye doted on the kid too the little wizards increasing fragility did make it easier to keep him inside away from the temptations of the city one moment of indiscretion could kill us all and oneeye never quite caught on to what it meant to be discreet goblin chuckled as oneeye subsided i suggested could you two concentrate on what youre supposed to be doing i was haunted by the dread that one day oneeye would doze off in the midst of a deadly spell and leave us all up to our ears in demons or bloodsucking insects distraught about having been plucked from some swamp a thousand miles away this is important its always important goblin grumbled even when its just goblin give me a hand here im too lazy to polish the silver myself they make it sound like the worlds about to end always important hmmph i see youre in a good mood tonight gralk oneeye heaved himself out of his chair leaning on his cane muttering unflattering remarks about me he shuffled over to sahra he had forgotten i was female he was less unpleasant when he remembered though i expect no special treatment because of that unhappy chance of birth oneeye became dangerous in a whole new way the day he adopted that cane he used it to swat people or to trip them he was always falling asleep between here and there but you never knew for sure if his nap was the real thing that cane might dart out to tangle your legs if he was pretending the dread we all shared was that oneeye would not last much longer without him our chances to continue avoiding detection would plummet goblin would try hard but he was just one smalltime wizard our situation offered work for more than two in their prime start woman oneeye rasped goblin you worthless sack of beetle snot would you get that stuff over here i dont want to hang around here all night sahra had had a table set up for them she used no props herself at a fixed time she would concentrate on murgen she usually made contact quickly at her time of the month when her sensitivity went down she would sing in nyueng bao unlike some of my company brothers i have a poor ear for languages nyueng bao mostly eludes me her songs seem to be lullabies unless the words have double meanings which is entirely possible uncle doj talks in riddles all the time but insists he makes perfect sense if we would just listen uncle doj is not around much thank god he has his own agenda though even he does not seem clear on what that is anymore the world keeps changing on him not in ways he likes goblin brought a sack of objects without challenging oneeyes foul manners he deferred to oneeye more lately if only for efficiencys sake he wasted no time making his opinions known if work was not involved though even though they were cooperating laying out their tools they began bickering about the placement of every instrument i wanted to paddle them like they were fouryearolds sahra began singing she had a beautiful voice it should not have been buried this way strictly speaking she was not employing necromancy she was not laying an absolute compulsion on murgen nor was she conjuring his shade murgen was still alive out there but his spirit could escape his tomb when summoned i wished the other captured could be called up too especially the captain we needed inspiration a cloud of dust formed slowly between goblin and oneeye who stood on opposite sides of the table no it was not dust nor was it smoke i stuck a finger in tasted that was a fine cool water mist goblin told sahra were ready she changed tone she began to sound almost wheedling i could pick out even fewer words murgens head materialized between the wizards wavering like a reflection on a rippling pond i was startled not by the sorcery but by murgens appearance he looked just like i remembered him without one new line in his face none of the rest of us looked the same sahra had begun to look something like her mother had back in jaicur not as heavy not with the strange rolling waddle caused by problems of the joints but her beauty was going fast in her that had been a wonder stretching on way past the usual early swiftfading characteristic of nyueng bao women she did not talk about it but it preyed upon her she had her vanity and she deserved it time is the most wicked of all villains murgen was not happy about being called up i feared he suffered the malaise afflicting sahra he spoke and i had no trouble hearing him though his words were an ethereal whisper i was dreaming there is a place his irritation faded pale horror replaced it and i knew he had been dreaming in the place of bones he described in his own annals a white crow we had a problem indeed if he preferred a drift through kinas dreamscapes to a glimpse of life sahra told him were ready to strike the radisha ordered the privy council convened just a little while ago see what theyre doing make sure swan is there murgen faded from the mist sahra looked sad goblin and oneeye began excoriating the standardbearer for running away i saw him i told them perfectly i heard him too exactly like i always imagined a ghost would talk grinning goblin told me thats because you hear what you expect to hear you werent really listening with your ears you know oneeye sneered he never explained anything to anybody unless maybe to gota if she caught him sneaking back in in the middle of the night then he would have a story as convoluted as the history of the company itself sounding like a woman pretending not to be bitter sahra said you can bring tobo in we know there wont be any explosions or fires and you melted only two holes through the tabletop a base canard oneeye proclaimed that happened only because frogface here sahra ignored him tobo can record what murgen has to say so sleepy can use it later its time for us to turn into other people send a messenger if murgen finds out anything dangerous that was the plan i was even less enthusiastic about it now i wanted to stay and talk to my old friend but this thing was bigger than a bull session bigger than finding out if bucket was keeping well murgen drifted through the palace like a ghost he found that thought vaguely amusing though nothing made him laugh anymore a decade and a half in the grave destroyed a mans sense of humor the rambling stone pile of the palace never changed well it got dustier and it needed repairs ever more desperately credit that to soulcatcher who did not like having hordes of people underfoot most of the original vast professional staff had been dismissed and replaced by occasional casual labor the palace crowned a sizable hill each ruler of taglios generation after generation tagged on an addition not because the room was needed but because that was a memorial tradition taglians joked that in another thousand years there would be no city just endless square miles of palace mostly in ruin the radisha drah having accepted that her brother the prahbrindrah drah had been lost during the shadowmaster wars and galvanized by the threat of the protectors displeasure had proclaimed herself head of state traditionalists in the ecclesiastical community did not want a woman in the role but the world knew this particular woman had been doing the job practically forever anyway her weaknesses existed mainly in the ambitions of her critics depending who did the pontificating she had made one of two great mistakes or possibly both one would be betraying the black company when it was a wellknown fact that nobody ever profited from such treachery and the other error of particular popularity with the senior priests would be that she had erred in employing the black company in the first place the terror of the shadowmasters being expunged in the interim by agency of the company did not present a counterargument of any current merit unhappy people shared the meeting chamber with the radisha the eye automatically went to the protector first soulcatcher looked exactly as she always had slimly androgynous yet sensual in black leather a black mask a black helmet and black leather gloves she occupied a seat slightly to the left of and behind the radisha within a curtain of shadow she did not put herself forward but there was no doubt who made the ultimate decisions every hour of every day the radisha found another reason to regret having let this particular camel shove her nose into the tent the cost of having tried to get around fulfilling an unhappy promise to the black company was insupportable already surely keeping her promises could not have been so painful what possibly could have happened that would be worse than what she suffered now had she and her brother helped the captain find the way to khatovar at desks to either hand facing one another from fifteen feet stood scribes who struggled valiantly to record anything said one group served the radisha the other was in soulcatchers employ once upon a time there had been disagreements after the fact about decisions made during a privy council meeting a table twelve feet long and four wide faced the two women four men sat behind its inadequate bulwark willow swan was situated at the left end his oncemarvelous golden hair had gone grey and stringy at higher elevations it had grown extremely sparse swan was a foreigner swan was a bundle of nerves swan had a job he did not want but could not give up swan was riding the tiger willow swan headed up the greys in the public eye in reality he was barely a figurehead if his mouth opened the words that came out were pure soulcatcher popular hatred deservedly belonging to the protector settled upon willow swan instead seated with swan were three runningdog senior priests who owed their standing to the protectors favor they were small men in large jobs their presence at council meetings was a matter of form they would not take part in any actual debate though they might receive instructions their function was to agree with and support soulcatcher if she happened to speak significantly all three represented gunni cults though the protector used the greys to enforce her will the shadar had no voice in the council neither did the vehdna that minority simmered continuously because soulcatcher arrogated to herself much that properly applied only to god the vehdna being hopelessly monotheistic and stubborn about keeping it that way swan was a good man inside his fear he spoke for the shadar when he could there were two other men of more significance present they were positioned behind tall desks located back of the table they perched atop tall stools and peered down at everyone like a pair of lean old vultures both antedated the coming of the protector who had not yet found a suitable excuse for getting rid of either though they irritated her frequently the righthand desk belonged to the inspectorgeneral of the records chandra gokhale his was a deceptive title he was no glorified clerk he controlled finances and most public works he was ancient hairless lean as a snake and twice as mean he owed his appointment to the radishas father until the latter days of the shadowmaster wars his office had been a minor one the wars caused that offices influence and power to expand and chandra gokhale was never shy about snatching at any strand of bureaucratic power that came within reach he was a staunch supporter of the radisha and a steadfast enemy of the black company he was also the sort of weasel who would change all that in an instant if he saw sufficient advantage in so doing the man behind the desk on the left was more sinister arjana drupada was a priest of rhavilemnas cult but there was not one ounce of brotherly love in the man his official title was purohita which meant more or less that he was the royal chaplain in actuality he was the true voice of the priesthoods at court they had forced him upon the radisha at a time she was making desperate concessions in order to gain support like gokhale drupada was more interested in control than he was in doing what was best for taglios but he was not an entirely cynical manipulator his frequent moral bulls got up the protectors nose more often even than the constant quibbling financial caveats of the inspectorgeneral physically drupada was known for his shock of wild white hair that clung to his head like a mad haystack the good offices of a comb being completely unfamiliar only gokhale and drupada seemed unaware that their days had to be numbered the protector of all the taglias was not enamored of them at all the final member of the council was absent which was not unusual the great general mogaba preferred to be in the field harrying those designated as his enemies he viewed the infighting in the palace with revulsion none of which mattered at the moment there had been incidents there were witnesses to be brought forward the protector was not pleased willow swan rose he beckoned a grey sergeant out of the gloom behind the two old men ghopal singh nobody remarked on the unusual name possibly he was a convert stranger things were happening singhs patrol watches an area immediately outside the palace on the north side this afternoon one of his patrolmen discovered a prayer wheel mounted on one of the memorial posts in front of the north entrance twelve copies of this sutra were attached to the arms of the wheel swan made a show of turning a small paper card so the light would fall upon the writing there the lettering appeared to be in the ecclesiastical style swan failed to appreciate his own ignorance of taglian letters though he was holding the card inverted he did not however make any mistakes when he reported what the prayer card had to say rajadharma the duty of kings know you kingship is a trust the king is the most exalted and conscientious servant of the people swan did not recognize the verse it was so ancient that some scholars attributed it to one or another of the lords of light in the time when the gods still handed down laws to the fathers of men but the radisha drah knew it the purohita knew it someone outside the palace had leveled a chiding finger soulcatcher understood it too its object she said only a bhodi monk would presume to chastise this house and they are very few that pacifistic moralistic cult was young and still very small and it had suffered during the war years almost as terribly as had the followers of kina the bhodi refused to defend themselves i want the man who did this the voice she used was that of a quarrelsome old man uh swan said it was not wise to argue with the protector but that was an assignment beyond the capacities of the greys among soulcatchers more frightening characteristics was her seeming ability to read minds she could not really but never insisted that she could not in this instance she found it convenient to let people believe what they wanted she told swan being bhodi he will surrender himself no search will be necessary hunh there is a tree sometimes called the bhodi tree in the village of semchi it is a very old and highly honored tree the bhodi enlightened one made his reputation loafing in the shade of this tree the bhodi consider it their most holy shrine tell them i will make kindling wood out of the bhodi tree unless the man who rigged that prayer wheel reports to me soon soulcatcher employed the voice of a petty vindictive old woman murgen made a mental note to send sahra a suggestion that the guilty man be prevented from reaching the protector destruction of a major holy place would create thousands of new enemies for soulcatcher willow swan started to speak but soulcatcher interrupted i do not care if they hate me swan i care that they do what i tell them to do when i tell them to do it the bhodi will not raise a fist against me anyway that would put a stain on their kharma a cynical woman the protector get on with it swan swan sighed several more of those smoke shows appeared tonight one was much bigger than any seen before once again the black company sigil was part of all of them he brought forward another shadar witness who told of being stoned by the mob but did not mention the demon niassi the news was no surprise it was one of the reasons the council had been convened with no real passion the radisha demanded how could that happen why cant you stop it you have men on every street corner chansdra she appealed to the man who knew just how much it cost to put all those greys out there gokhale inclined his head imperially as long as the radisha did the questioning swans nerve stood up she could not hurt him in ways he had not been hurt before not the way the protector could he asked have you been out there you should disguise yourself and go like saragoz in the fairy tale every street is clogged with people thousands sleep where others have to walk over them breezeways and alleyways are choked with human waste sometimes the press is so thick you could murder somebody ten feet from one of my men and never be noticed the people playing these games arent stupid if theyre really company survivors theyre especially not stupid theyve already survived everything ever thrown at them theyre using the crowds for cover exactly the way theyd use the rocks and trees and bushes out in the countryside they dont wear uniforms they dont stand out theyre not outlanders anymore if you really want to nail them put out a proclamation saying they all have to wear funny red hats swans nerve had peaked high that was not directed at the radisha soulcatcher speaking through her had issued several proclamations memorable for their absurdity being steeped in company doctrine they wouldnt be anywhere around when the smoke emblems actually formed so far we havent even figured out where they come from soulcatcher unleashed a deepthroated grunt it said she doubted that swan could figure out much of anything his nerve guttered like a dying lamp he began to sweat he knew he walked a tightrope with the madwoman he was tolerated like a naughty pet for reasons clear only to the sorceress who sometimes did things for no better reason than a momentary whim which could reverse itself an instant later he could be replaced others had been soulcatcher did not care about facts insurmountable obstacles or mere difficulties she cared about results swan offered on the plus side theres no evidence even from our most eager informants that suggests this activity is anything but a lowgrade nuisance even if black company survivors are behind it and even with tonights escalation soulcatcher said theyll never be anything but a nuisance her voice was that of a plucky teenage girl theyre going through the motions they lost heart when i buried all their leaders that was all spoken in a powerful male voice by someone accustomed to unquestioning obedience but those words amounted to an oblique admission that company members might after all still be alive and the final few words included in a rising inflection betraying potential uncertainty there were questions about what had happened on the plain of glittering stone that soulcatcher herself could not answer ill worry when they call them back from the dead she did not know in truth little had gone according to anyones plan out there her escape with swan had been pure luck but soulcatcher was the sort who believed fortunes bright countenance was her born due probably true and only marginally significant if i understood your summons there are other forces afoot soulcatcher said this voice was a sybils rife with portent the deceivers have been heard from the radisha announced causing a general startled reaction that included the disembodied spy lately weve had reports from dejagore meldermhai ghoja and danjil about men having been slain in classic strangler fashion swan had recovered in classic strangler work only the killers know that it happened they arent assassins the bodies would go through their religious rites and be buried in some holy place the radisha ignored his remarks today there was a strangling here in taglios perhule khoji was the victim he died in a joy house an institution specializing in young girls such places arent supposed to exist anymore yet they persist that was an accusation the greys were charged with crushing that sort of exploitation but the greys worked for the protector and the protector did not care i gather that anything you can imagine can still be found for sale some people blamed a national moral collapse on the black company others blamed the ruling family a few even blamed the protector fault did not matter nor did the fact that most of the nastier evils had existed almost since the first mud hut went up alongside the river taglios had changed and desperate people will do what they must to survive only a fool would expect the results to be pretty swan asked who was this perhule khoji he glared over his shoulder he had a scribe of his own recording the meeting back there in the darkness plainly he wondered why the radisha was familiar with this particular murder when he was not sounds like the guy got something he had coming you sure it wasnt just his adventure with the little girls gone bad quite possibly khoji did deserve what happened the radisha said with bitter sarcasm he was vehdna so hell be talking it over with his god about now i would imagine his morals dont interest us swan his position does he was one of the inspectorgenerals leading assistants he collected taxes in the checca and east waterfront areas his death will cause problems for months his areas were some of our best revenue producers maybe somebody who owed his child companion survived and he did call for help the sort of men who handle troublemakers in those places arrived while it was happening stranglers did it it was an initiation killing the strangler candidate was inept nevertheless with the help of his armholders he managed to break khojis neck so they were captured no the one they call daughter of night was there overseeing the initiation so the strongarm guys would have been scared witless once they recognized her no gunni or shadar wanted to believe the daughter of night was just a nasty young woman not a mythic figure few taglians of those religions would find the courage to interfere with her all right swan conceded that would mean real stranglers but how did they recognize the daughter of night exasperated soulcatcher snapped she told them who she was you ninny i am the daughter of night i am the child of darkness forthcoming come to my mother or become prey for the beasts of devastation in the year of the skulls typically portentous stuff soulcatchers voice had become the midrange monotone of an educated skeptic not to mention that she was vampirewhite and a prettier duplicate of my sister as a child the daughter of night feared no one and nothing she knew that her spiritual parent kina the destroyer the dark mother would shelter her even though that goddess had stirred not at all for more than a decade rumors about the daughter of night had run through the underside of society for years a lot of people believed she was what she claimed which only added to her power over the popular imagination another rumor losing currency with time credited the black company with having forestalled kinas year of the skulls back about the time the taglian state chose to betray its hired protectors the deceivers and company alike had a psychological strength vastly exceeding their numbers being social ghosts made both groups more frightening what signified most was that the daughter of night had come to taglios itself and that she had shown herself publicly and where the daughter of night went the chieftain of all deceivers the living legend the living saint of the stranglers narayan singh surely followed like a faithful jackal and worked his evils too murgen considered aborting his mission to warn sahra to call everything off till this news could be assessed but it would be too late to stop everything now whatever else was happening narayan singh was the most hated enemy of the black company still standing upright not mogaba nor even soulcatcher who was an old old adversary were as eagerly hunted as was narayan singh nor did singh harbor any love for the company he had gotten himself caught once and had spent a long time being made uncomfortable by people overburdened with malice he had debts he would love to collect should it please his goddess to permit that the privy council as was customary degenerated into nagging and fingerpointing soon afterward with the purohita and inspectorgeneral both maneuvering to get a rung up on one another and maybe on swan the purohita could count on the backing of the three tame priests unless soulcatcher had other ideas the inspectorgeneral usually enjoyed the support of the radisha these squabbles were generally prolonged but trivial more symbol than substance the protector would let nothing she disapproved of come out of them as murgen started to leave his presence never having been detected two royal guards rushed into the chamber they headed for willow swan though he was not their captain perhaps their news was something they did not care to share with the unpredictable protector their official commander swan listened for a moment then slammed a fist onto the tabletop damn it i knew it had to be more than a nuisance he bulled past the purohita giving the man a look of contempt there was no love lost there it has started already murgen thought back to do trangs warehouse then he could prevent nothing already in motion but he could get word to those still at headquarters so they could get after narayan and the daughter of night as soon as possible sahra changed faces as easily as an actor swaps masks sometimes she was the cruel cunning coldly calculating necromancer who conspired with the captured sometimes she was just the nearwidow of the standardbearer and official annalist of the company sometimes she was just tobos doting mother and whenever she went out into the city she was minh subredil another being entirely minh subredil was an outcast the halfbreed byblow of a priest of khusa and a nyueng bao whore minh subredil knew more about her antecedents than did half the people on the streets of taglios she talked to herself about them all the time she would tell anyone she could trap into listening minh subredil was a woman so pathetic so shunned by fortune that she was an old bent thing decades before her time her signature which made her recognizable to people who never had encountered her was the small statue of ghanghesha she carried everywhere ghanghesha who was the god in charge of good luck in gunni and some nyueng bao belief minh subredil talked to ghanghesha when there was nobody else who would listen widowed minh subredil supported her one child by doing scutwork day labor at the palace each morning well before dawn she joined the assembly of unfortunates who gathered at the northern servants postern in hopes of gaining work sometimes she was joined by her dead husbands retarded sister sawa sometimes she brought her daughter though seldom anymore the girl was getting old enough to be noticed subassistant housekeeper jaul barundandi would come out and announce the number of positions available for the day then would select the people to fill them barundandi always chose minh subredil because though she was too ugly to demand sexual favors of she could be counted upon to kick back a generous percentage of her salary minh subredil was a desperate creature barundandi was amused by subredils omnipresent statue a devout gunni of the cult of khusa he often included in his prayers a petition that he be spared subredils sort of luck he would never admit it to his henchmen but he did favor subredil some because of her poor choice of a father like most villains he was wicked only most of the time and mainly in smallminded ways subredil as ky sahra never prayed ky sahra had no use for gods unaware of his tiny soft spot she did have in mind a destiny for jaul barundandi when the time came the subassistant would have ample opportunity to regret his predations there would be many many regrets spanning the length and breadth of the taglian empire when the time came we went out through the maze of confusion and distraction spells goblin and oneeye have spent so many years weaving throughout the neighborhood a thousand layers of gossamer deception so subtle only the protector herself might notice them if she was looking but soulcatcher does not roam the streets looking for enemy hideouts she has the greys and her shadows and bats and crows to do that work and those are too dim to notice that they are being guided away from or subtly ushered through the area in a manner that left it seeming no more remarkable than any other the two little wizards spent most of their time maintaining and expanding their maze of confusion people not trusted no longer got within two hundred yards of our headquarters not without being led we had no trouble we wore strands of yarn tied around our left wrists these enchanted loops softened the confusion spells they let us see the truth thus we often knew what the palace intended before plans went into motion minh subredil or sometimes sawa listened in while the plans were being made i muttered isnt it awfully early for us to be out yes but there will be others already there when we take our place there are a lot of desperate people in taglios some will camp as near the palace as the greys will allow we did reach the palace area hours earlier than ever before but there were rounds of the darkness to make brothers of the company to visit in their hiding places in each instance the voice of the witch came out of the wreckage that was minh subredil sawa tagged along behind and drooled out of the corner of her twisted mouth most of the men did not recognize us they did not expect to do so they expected to receive a code word from those in charge that would expose us as messengers they got that word chances were good they were in some disguise themselves every company brother was supposed to create several characters he could assume in public some did better than others the worst were called upon to risk the least subredil glanced at the fragment of moon sneaking a peek through a crack in the clouds minutes to go i grunted nervous it had been a while since i had been involved in anything directly dangerous other than wandering around the palace or going to the library of course but nobody was likely to stick me with sharp objects there those clouds look like the kind that come right before the rainy season if they were that season would be early which was not a pleasant thought during the rainy season that is what it does in torrents every day the weather can be truly ferocious with dramatic temperature shifts and hailstorms and thunder like all the gods of the gunni pantheon are drunk and brawling but mainly i do not like the heat taglians divide their year into six seasons only during the one they call winter is there any sustained relief from the heat subredil asked would sawa even notice the clouds she was a stickler for staying in character in a city ruled by darkness you never knew what eyes watched from the shadows what unseen ears were pricked to overhear uhm that was about as intelligent a thing as sawa ever said come subredil took my arm guiding me which was what she always did when we went to work at the palace we approached the main north entrance which was only twoscore yards from the service postern a single torch burned there it was supposed to show the guards who might be outside but it was situated so poorly it only helped them see the honest people as we drew closer someone who had sneaked in along the foot of the wall jumped up and enveloped the torch in a sack of wet rawhide the crude startled remark of one of the guards carried clearly now would he be incautious enough to come see what had happened there was no reason to believe he would not the royal guards had had no trouble for almost a generation the sliver of moon vanished behind a cloud as it went something moved at the palace entrance now came the tricky part making it look like we screwed up a sure thing by going in right at a shift change a sound of scuffling a startled cry somebody else demanding what was going on a rattle and clatter as people rushed the gate clang of metal a scream or two whistles then within fifteen seconds answering whistles from several directions exactly according to plan in moments the whistles from the palace entrance became shrilly desperate when first the idea was broached there had been serious debate about whether or not the attack should be the real thing it seemed likely taking the entrance would be easy a strong faction made up of men tired of waiting just wanted to bust in and kill everybody while that might have offered a certain amount of satisfaction there was little chance soulcatcher could be destroyed and such wholesale murder would do nothing to liberate the captured which was supposed to be our primary mission i had convinced everyone that we needed to launch an oldfashioned annalsbased game of misdirection make the enemy think we were up to one thing when actually we wanted to accomplish something else entirely get them running hard to head us off in one direction when we were following a completely different course with goblin and oneeye now so old our deceits have to be increasingly intellectual those two do not have the strength or stamina to create and maintain massive battlefield illusions and though willing to share their secrets they had not been able to arm sahra for the struggle her talent did not extend in that direction the first greys charged out of the darkness into the ambushes waiting to receive them for a while it was a vicious slaughter but somehow a few managed to get through to support the guards barely hanging on at the palace entrance subredil and i moved into position against the foot of the wall between the big entrance and the servants postern subredil hugged her ghanghesha and whimpered sawa clung to subredil and drooled and made strange little frightened noises though the attackers piled up heaps of greys they never quite managed to break through the defense of the entryway then help arrived from inside willow swan and a platoon of royal guards burst through the gateway the attackers scattered instantly so fast in fact that swan screeched hold up theres something wrong the night lit up the air filled with hurtling fireballs their like had not been seen since the heavy fighting at the end of the shadowmaster wars lady had created those weapons in vast numbers and a few had been husbanded carefully since then the men employing them had not been involved in the attack on the entrance they clung to the fire plan which counted on everyone being able to pick swan out from amongst the guards and greys his life depended on it fire fell to the side of the group away from subredil and me willow was afraid when fire swiftly shifted to fall on the entry and cut him off he was supposed to retreat toward the service entrance past us good old swan he must have read my script as his men were being torn apart by fireballs just yards away he skittered along hand against the wall staying just steps ahead of destruction molten stone and chunks of burning flesh flew over his head and ours and i realized that i had underestimated the fury of my weapons perhaps fatally it was definitely a mistake to have committed so many swan stumbled over minh subredils ankle somehow when he hit the cobblestones he found himself facetoface with a drooling idiot who had a daggers point neatly positioned under his chin dont even breathe she whispered fireballs hitting the palace wall melted their way right in the wooden gateway was on fire there was plenty of light by which our brothers could see us signal that we had gotten our man fire became more accurate the resistance to the greys coming to help became less porous a second apparent attack came forward a couple of those brothers collected swan they kicked and cursed us and took our weapons with them when they went away part of a general retreat as the attack wave fled from no evident resistance as they disappeared into the darkness the thing that we had feared most occurred soulcatcher came out on the battlements above to see what was happening subredil and i knew because all fighting ceased within seconds once somebody spotted her then a storm of fireballs flashed her way we were lucky she was sufficiently unprepared that she could do nothing but duck our brothers then did what they were supposed to do they got the heck out of there they got downhill and lost amongst the population before the protector could release her bats and crows it was my belief that the activity would have all the nearby part of the city in an uproar within minutes the men were supposed to help that along by launching absurd rumors if they remained calm enough subredil and sawa moved two dozen yards closer to the servants postern we had just settled down to drool and be held and whimper while we watched the corpses burn when a frightened voice demanded minh subredil what are you doing here jaul barundandi our boss i did not look up and subredil did not respond until barundandi stirred her with a toe and asked again not unkindly she told him we were going to be here early sawa needs to work bad she looked around where are the others there had been others four or five even more eager to be first in line they had fled that might mean trouble no telling what they might have seen before they ran an early stray fireball was supposed to have panicked and scattered them before swan got to us but i could not recall that having happened subredil turned more toward barundandi i held on to her tighter and whimpered she patted my shoulder and murmured something indistinct barundandi seemed to buy it particularly when subredil discovered that one of her ghangheshas trunks had broken off and she began to cry and search our surroundings several of barundandis associates were out as well looking around asking one another what happened the same thing was going on at the main entrance where stunned guards and sleepfuddled functionaries asked one another what had happened and what they should do and holy shit some of those fires burned all the way through the wall and it was six or eight feet thick shadar from as far as a mile away were arriving gathering dead and wounded greys and also trying to figure out what had happened jaul barundandis voice gentled further he beckoned his assistants help these two inside be gentle the high and the mighty may want to talk to them i hoped my start did not give us away i had counted on getting inside early but it had not occurred to me that anyone might be interested in what two nearuntouchables might have seen i need not have worried we were interviewed by a seriously distracted guard sergeant who seemed to be going through the motions mainly as a sop to jaul barundandi the subassistant had evidently suffered an overinspiration of ambition in thinking he could win favor by providing eyewitnesses to the tragedy his solicitude began to fade once he had little to gain a few hours after we were taken inside while excitement still gripped the palace and a thousand outrageous rumors circulated while leading guardsmen and greys kept bringing in more and more trusted armed men and sending out more and more spies to watch the regular soldiers in their barracks just in case they were in on the attack somehow minh subredil and her idiot sisterinlaw were already hard at work barundandi had them cleaning the chamber where the privy council met a huge mess had been left there somebody had lost her temper and had worked out her anger by tearing the place up barundandi told us expect to work very hard today minh subredil few workers showed up this morning he sounded bitter he would not garner much kickback because of the raid it did not occur to him to be thankful he was still alive is she all right he meant me sawa i was still doing a credible job of shaking she will manage as long as i stay close it would not be good to put her anyplace where she cannot see me today barundandi grunted so be it theres work enough here just dont get in anybodys way minh subredil bowed slightly she was good at being unobtrusive she seated me at a wide table about a dozen feet long piled up lamps and candlesticks and whatnot that had gotten thrown around i invoked sawas narrow focus and went to work cleaning them subredil began cleaning floors and furniture people came and went many of them important none of them noticed us except the inspectorgeneral of the records chandra gokhale who kicked subredil irritably because she was scrubbing the floor where he wanted to walk subredil got back onto her knees bowing and begging pardon gokhale ignored her she began cleaning up spilled water showing no emotion whatsoever minh subredil took that sort of thing but i suspect ky sahra had just formed a definite opinion about which of our enemies should follow willow swan into captivity the radisha appeared the protector was with her they settled into their places jaul barundandi appeared soon afterward meaning to get us out of there sawa seemed to notice nothing her focus on a candlestick was too narrow a tall shadar captain bustled in he announced your highness the preliminary tally shows ninetyeight dead and one hundred twentysix injured some of those will die from their wounds minister swan hasnt been found but many of the bodies are burned too badly to identify many that were hit by fireballs caught fire and burned like greasy torches the captain had trouble remaining calm he was young chances were good he had not seen the consequences of battle before i kept working hard to shove myself way down deep into character i had not been this close to soulcatcher since she held me prisoner outside kiaulune fifteen years ago those were not happy memories i prayed she did not remember me i went all the way down into my safe place i had not been there since my captivity the hinges on the door were rusty but i got inside and got comfortable while remaining sawa i had just enough attention left to catch most of what was happening around me the protector suddenly asked who are these women barundandi fawned pardon great ones pardon my fault i did not know the chamber was to be used answer the question housekeeper the radisha ordered certainly great one barundandi kowtowed halfway to the floor the woman scrubbing is minh subredil a widow the other is her idiot sisterinlaw sawa they are outside staff employed as part of the protectors charity program soulcatcher said i feel i have seen one or both of them before barundandi bowed deeply again the attention frightened him minh subredil has worked here for many years protector sawa accompanies her when her mind is clear enough for her to accomplish repetitive tasks i felt him trying to decide whether or not to volunteer the news that we had witnessed the mornings attack from up close i clung to my safe place so hard that i did not catch what happened during the next few minutes barundandi chose not to volunteer us for questioning perhaps he reasoned that too intensive an attention paid to us might expose the fact that he was charging us half our feeble salaries for the right to work our hands into raw aching crabs the radisha finally told him go away housekeeper let them work the fate of the empire will not be decided here today and soulcatcher waved a gloved hand shooing barundandi out but then halted him to demand what is that the woman has on the floor beside her meaning subredil of course since i was seated at the table uh oh a ghanghesha great one the woman never goes anywhere without it its an obsession with her it go away now so it was that sahra at least sat in on almost two hours of the innermost powers responses to our assault after a while i came forward again enough to follow most of it couriers came and went a picture of generally upright behavior by the army and people took shape which was to be expected neither had any real reason to rise up right now which was nothing but good news to the radisha positive intelligence just made the protector more suspicious though the old cynic no prisoners taken she said no corpses left behind quite possibly no serious casualties suffered nor any great risks endured if you examine it closely they fled as soon as there was a chance someone would hit back what were they up to what was their real purpose reasonably chandra gokhale pointed out the attack appears to have been sustained with exceptional ferocity till you yourself appeared on the battlements only then did they run the shadar captain volunteered several survivors and witnesses report that the bandits argued amongst themselves about your presence protector it seems they expected you to be away from the palace evidently the attack would not have been undertaken had they known you were here one of my touches of misdirection i hoped it did some good that makes no sense where would they get that idea she did not expect an answer and did not wait for one have you identified any of the burned bodies only three protector most are barely recognizable as human the radisha asked chandra how bad was the physical damage do you have an assessment yet yes radisha it was bad extremely bad the wall appears to have suffered some structural damage the full extent is being determined right now its certain to be a weak point for a while you might consider putting up a wooden curtainwall in front of what is going to become a construction area and think hard about bringing in troops troops the protector demanded why troops her voice long neutral became suspicious when you have no friends at all paranoia is an even more natural outlook than it is for brothers of the black company because the palace is too big to defend with the people you have here now even if you arm the household staff an enemy doesnt need to use any of the regular entrances he could climb the outside wall where no one is watching and attack from inside the radisha said if he tried that hed need maps to get around ive never seen anyone but smoke who was our court wizard a long time ago who could get around this place without one you have to have an instinct the inspectorgeneral observed if the attack was undertaken by elements descended from the old black company and the employment of fireball weapons would suggest some connection even though we know that the company was exterminated by the protector then they may have access to hallway maps created when the liberator and his staff were quartered here the radisha insisted you cant chart this place i know ive tried thank goblin and oneeye for that princess long long ago the captain had those two old men scatter confusion spells liberally everywhere there were things he had not wanted the radisha to find things that remained hidden still among them those ancient volumes of the annals that supposedly explain the companys secret beginnings but which have been a complete disappointment so far minh subredil knows how to get to them whenever she gets the chance minh subredil tears out a few pages and smuggles them out to me then i sneak them into the library and when no one is watching i translate them a few words at a time looking for that one phrase that will show us how to open the way for the captured sawa cleaned brass and silver minh subredil cleaned floor and furniture the privy council and their associates came and went the level of panic declined as no new attacks developed too bad we did not have the numbers to stir them up again every few hours soulcatcher remained uncharacteristically quiet she had known the company longer than anyone but the captain goblin and oneeye though from the outside she would accept nothing at face value not yet i hoped she broke a mental sprocket trying to figure it out though i feared she had already done so because she kept wondering about the burned bodies and willow swan could i have planned so obviously that she was confused only because she kept looking for something beyond the kidnapping i finished the last candlestick i did not look around did not say anything just sat there it was difficult to focus my thinking away from the danger seated across the room when my fingers were not busy i gave praise to god silently as i had learned was proper for a woman when i was little equal praise was due sahras insistence on staying in character both served me well at some point jaul barundandi came back under the eyes of the great ones he was not an unkind boss he told subredil it was time to leave subredil bestirred sawa as i got to my feet i made some sounds of distress what is that barundandi asked shes hungry we havent eaten all day usually the management did provide a few scraps that was one of the perks subredil and sawa sometimes husbanded some of their share and took it home that established and sustained the womens habit of carrying things out of the palace the protector leaned forward she stared intently what had we done to tickle her suspicion was she just so ancient in her paranoia that she needed no clue stronger than intuition or was it possible that she really could read minds just a touch barundandi said well go to the kitchen then the cooks overprepared badly today we shuffled out behind him each step like leaping another league out of winter toward spring out of darkness into light four or five paces outside the meeting chamber barundandi startled us by running a hand through his hair and gasping he told subredil oh it feels good to get out of there that woman gives me the green willies she gave me the green willies too and only the fact that i had gone deep into character to deal with them saved me giving myself away who would suspect that much humanity in jaul barundandi i got a grip on subredils arm and shook subredil responded to barundandi softly submissively agreeing that the protector might be a great horror the kitchens normally off limits to casual labor was a dragons hoard of edible treasures with the dragon evicted subredil and sawa ate till they could barely waddle they loaded themselves with all the plunder they thought they would be allowed to carry off they collected their few coppers and headed for the servants postern before anyone could think of something else for them to do before any of barundandis cronies realized that the customary kickbacks had been overlooked there were armed guards outside the postern that was new they were greys rather than soldiers they did not seem particularly interested in people going out they did not bother with the usual cursory search casuals had to endure so nobody carried off the royal cutlery i wish our characters had more curiosity in them i could have used a closer look at the damage we had done they were putting up scaffolding and erecting a wooden curtainwall already the glimpses i did catch awed me i had only read about what the later versions of those fireball throwers could do the face of the palace looked like a model of dark wax that someone had stuck repeatedly with a whitehot iron rod not only had stone melted and run some had been vaporized we had been released much earlier than usual it was only midafternoon i tried to walk too fast eager to get away subredil refused to be rushed ahead of us stood quiet crowds who had come to stare at the palace subredil murmured something about ten thousand eyes i erred that mass of people had not come just to examine our nights work and marvel that the protectors dead men could be so frisky they were interested in four bhodi disciples at the memorial posts that stood a dozen yards in front of the battered entrance outside the growing curtainwall one disciple was mounting a prayer wheel onto one of the posts another two were spreading an elaborately embroidered dark redorange cloth on the cobblestones the fourth shaved balder and shinier than a polished apple stood before a grey who was sixteen at the oldest the bhodi disciple had his arms folded he looked through the youngster who seemed to be having trouble getting across the message that these men had to stop doing what they were doing the protector forbade it this was something that would interest even minh subredil she stopped walking sawa clung to her arm with one hand and cocked her head so she could watch too i felt terribly exposed standing out there a dozen yards from the silent gawkers reinforcements for the young grey arrived in the person of a grisled shadar sergeant who seemed to think the bhodis problem was deafness clear off he shouted or youll be cleared the bhodi with folded arms said the protector sent for me not having gotten murgens report yet sahra and i had no idea what this was about huh the disciple preparing the prayer wheel announced its readiness the sergeant growled swatted it off the post with the back of his hand the responsible disciple bent picked it up began remounting it they were not violent people the bhodi disciples nor did they resist anything but they were stubborn the two spreading the prayer rug were satisfied with their work they spoke to the man with folded arms he bowed his head slightly then raised his eyes to meet those of the elder shadar in a voice loud but so calm it was disturbing he proclaimed rajadharma the duty of kings know you kingship is a trust the king is the most exalted and conscientious servant of the people not one witness had any trouble hearing and understanding those words the speaker settled himself on the prayer rug his robes were an almost identical shade he seemed to fade into a greater whole one of the secondary disciples passed him a large jar he raised that as though in offering to the sky then dumped its contents over himself the shadar sergeant looked as rattled as the youngster he peered around for help the prayer wheel was back in place the disciple responsible set it spinning then backed off with the two who had spread the prayer rug the disciple on the rug struck flint to steel and vanished in a blast of flame just as i recognized the odor of naphtha heat hit me like a blow i was in character strongly enough to whimper and grab subredil with both hands she resumed moving eyes wide stunned the man inside the flames never cried out never moved till all life was gone and the charred husk left behind toppled over crows circled above cursing in their own tongue so soulcatcher knew or soon would we continued moving into the nowanimated crowd and through heading home the bhodi disciples who had helped prepare the ritual suicide had disappeared already while all eyes were fixed on the burning man i cant believe he did that i said still climbing out of sawas smelly rags and crippled personality word had beaten us home the suicide was all anyone wanted to discuss our own nighttime effort had become secondary that was over and they had survived tobo definitely did not believe it he mentioned that in passing and insisted on telling us everything his father had seen inside the palace last night he referred to notes he had made with goblins help he was thoroughly proud of the job he had done and wanted to rub our noses in it but i couldnt really get him to talk to me mom anything i asked seemed to be just an irritation it was like he just wanted to get it over with so he could go away i know dear sahra said i know hes that way with me too heres some nice bread they let us bring home eat something goblin what did they do with swan is he healthy oneeye cackled he said healthy as a man with cracked ribs can be scared shitless though he cackled again cracked ribs explain goblin told her somebody with a grudge against the greys got overexcited but dont worry about it the guy is going to have plenty of opportunity to be sorry he let his feelings get the best of him im exhausted sahra said we spent the whole day in the same room as soulcatcher i thought i would burst you did it was all i could do not to run out of there screaming i concentrated so hard on being sawa that i missed half of what they said what didnt get said might be more important soulcatcher was really suspicious about the attack i told you go for the throat oneeye barked while they still didnt believe in us kill them all and you wouldnt have to sneak around trying to figure out how to get the old man out you could make those guys at the library do your research for you wedve just gotten killed sahra said soulcatcher was already looking for trouble the news about the daughter of night did that speaking of whom i want you two looking for her and narayan too too goblin asked soulcatcher will hunt them with a great deal of enthusiasm i expect i observed kina must be stirring again narayan and the girl wouldnt come to taglios unless they were confident of her protection which means the girl will start copying the books of the dead again too sahra tell murgen to keep an eye on them those terrible ancient volumes were buried in the same cavern as the captured i had a thought while we were up there after i ran out of candlesticks and didnt have anything else to do its been a long time since i read murgens annals it didnt seem like they had much bearing on what were trying to do being so modern but when i was sitting there just a few feet from soulcatcher i got a really creepy feeling that i had missed something and its been so long since i studied those things i cant guess what you should have time well need to lie pretty low for a few days youll be going to work wont you it would be suspicious if i didnt im going to the library i located some histories that go back to the earliest days of taglios yeah oneeye croaked jerked himself out of a halfsleep then find out for me why the hell the ruling gang are only princes the territories they rule are bigger than most kingdoms around here a question that never would have occurred to me i said politely or to any native of this end of the world probably ill ask if i remembered nervous laughter came from the shadows in the back of the warehouse willow swan goblin said hes playing tonk with some guys he knew in the old days sahra said we should get him out of the city where can we keep him i need him here i said i need to ask him about the plain thats why we grabbed him first and im not going off to some place in the country when ive finally started getting somewhere at the library soulcatcher might have him marked somehow weve got two halfass wizards of our own have them check him over they add up to one competent you watch your mouth little girl i forget myself oneeye you two together add up to half as much as either one alone sleepy has a point if soulcatcher marked him you two ought to be able to find out oneeye snapped use your head if shed marked him shed already be here she wouldnt be up there asking her lackeys if theyd found his bones yet the little man climbed out of his chair creaking and groaning he headed for the shadows at the rear of the warehouse but not toward swans voice i said hes right i headed to the back myself i had not seen swan up close for fifteen years behind me tobo started grilling his mother about murgen he was upset because his father had been indifferent seemed to me there was a good chance murgen did not understand who tobo was he had trouble with time he had had that problem since the siege of jaicur he might think it was still fifteen years ago and he was stumbling away into a possible future swan stared at me for a few seconds after i stepped into the light of the lamp illuminating the table where he was playing cards with the gupta brothers and a corporal we called slink sleepy right you havent changed goblin or oneeye put some kind of hex on you god is good to the pure of heart how are your ribs swan ran fingers through the remnants of his hair so thats the story he touched his side ill live youre taking it well i needed a vacation nothings in my hands now i can relax until she finds me again can she do that you the captain now the captain is the captain i design ambushes can she find you well son this looks like the fabled collision between the unstoppable whatsis and the immovable thingee i dont know where to lay my bets over here we got the black company with four hundred years of bad and tricky over there you got soulcatcher with four centuries of mean and crazy its a tossup i guess she doesnt have you marked somehow only with scars the way he said that made me feel i knew exactly what he meant you want to come over to our side youre kidding you pulled all that stuff this morning just to ask me to join the black company we pulled all that stuff this morning to show the world that were still here and that we could do what we want whenever we want protector or no protector and to take you so i can question you about the plain of glittering stone he looked at me for several seconds then checked his cards theres a subject that hasnt come up in a while you going to be stubborn about it you kidding ill talk your ear off but ill bet you dont learn a damned thing you didnt already know he discarded a black knave slink jumped on the card laid down a ninequeen spread discarded a red queen and grinned he needed to see oneeye about those teeth shit swan grumbled i missed this game how did you people learn its the simplest damn game in the world but i never met a taglian who could figure it out i observed you learn fast when you play with oneeye scoot over sin let me play while i pick this guys brain i pulled up a stool studying swan every second the man knew how to get into a character this was not the willow swan that murgen wrote about or the swan that sahra saw when she visited the palace i picked up my five cards from the next deal this aint a hand its a foot how come youre so relaxed swan no stress you cant have a worse hand than mine i dont got no two cards of the same suit no stress as of today i got nothing to do but lean back and take it easy just play tonk till my honey comes and takes me home youre not afraid reports ive had said youre shakier than smoke used to be his features hardened that was not a comparison he liked the worst has happened hasnt it im in the hands of my enemies but im still healthy theres no guarantee youll stay that way unless you cooperate darn im going to have to rob a poor box if this keeps on play had not gotten all the way back to me before the hand ended i did not win ill sing like a trained crow swan said like a chorus but i cant do you much good i was never as close to the center as you may think possibly i watched his hands closely as he dealt it seemed like a moment when a skilled manipulators ego might compel him to show himself how good he was at pulling fast moves if he had any moves he would not get them by me i learned the game from oneeye too prove it tell me how soulcatcher kept you two alive long enough to get off the plain thats an easy one he completed a straight deal we ran away faster than the ghosts chasing us could run we were riding those black horses the company brought down from the north i had ridden those enchanted beasts a few times myself that could be the answer they could outdistance any normal horse and could run almost forever without tiring maybe maybe she didnt have any special talisman not that she mentioned to me i looked down at another terrible hand grilling swan could get expensive i am not one of the better tonk players in the gang what happened to the horses far as i know theyre all dead time or magic or wounds got them and the queen bitch wasnt happy about that either she dont like walking and she aint fond of flying flying startled i discarded a card i should have kept that allowed one of the guptas to go down and take me for another couple of coppers swan said i think im going to like playing with you yeah flying shes got a couple of them carpets that was made by the howler and she just aint real good with them i can tell you that from personal experience your deal aint nothing like falling off of one of them suckers while its hauling ass even if youre only five feet high oneeye materialized he looked about as bright and alert as he ever did these days room for one more his breath smelled of alcohol swan grumbled i know that voice no i figured you out twentyfive years ago i thought we got your ass at khadighat or maybe it was bhoroda or nalanda im quick on my feet slink said youre in only if you show some money up front and you agree not to deal and you keep your hands on top of the table all the time i added you smite me to the heart little girl people might get the idea you dont trust me not to cheat good thatll save them a lot of time and pain little girl swan asked there was a whole different look in his eye suddenly oneeyes got diarrhea of the mouth sit down old man swan was just telling us about soulcatchers magic carpets and how she doesnt like flying and im wondering if we couldnt find some way to take advantage of that swan looked from one of us to the other i watched oneeyes hands as he picked up his first bunch of cards just in case he might have done something to this deck sometime in the past little girl is there an echo in here slink asked is that suddenly a problem i asked no no swan showed me the palm of his free hand im just getting a lot of surprises here soulcatcher thought she was pretty solid on the company survivors but ive already run into four people who are known to be dead including the worlds ugliest wizard and that nyueng bao woman who acts like shes in charge oneeye growled dont you go talking about goblin that way hes my pal ill have to stand up for him someday he snickered swan ignored him and you that we had down as a man i shrugged not many knew and its not important the dope with the eye patch and smelly hat shouldve had sense enough not to mention it in front of an outsider i glared oneeye grinned drew a card from the pile discarded shes feisty swan smart too designed the plan that pulled you in you started on another one little girl several i think sahra will want the inspectorgeneral next though gokhale he cant tell us anything say its personal swan you know anything about gokhale he dabble in little girls like perhule khoji used to oneeye gave me an evil look swan stared my messup this time i had given something away too late to fuss about it well actually yes swan was pale he focused on his cards having trouble keeping his hands steady those two and several others in that office common interests brought them together the radisha doesnt know she doesnt want to know he discarded out of turn he had lost his zest for the game i realized what the problem was he thought my speaking freely meant i expected to elevate him to a higher plane before long youre all right swan long as you behave long as you answer questions when youre asked hell i got to save you theres a bunch of guys buried under the glittering plain that want to talk to you about that when they get back might be interesting to watch him talk it over with murgen theyre still alive the idea seemed to stun him very alive just frozen in time and getting angrier by the minute i thought great god shit do not speak so on the name of god slink growled slink was jaicuri vehdna too and much less lapsed than i he managed prayers at least once a day and temple several times a month the local vehdna thought he was a dejagoran refugee employed by banh do trang because he had done the nyueng bao favors during the siege there most of our brothers endured genuine employment and worked hard to resemble pillars of the local community swan swallowed said you people ever eat i aint had nothing since yesterday we eat i said but not like youre used to its true what they say about nyueng bao they dont eat anything but fish heads and rice eight days a week fish will do right now ill save the bitching till my bellys full slink i said we need to send a kill team down to semchi to watch the bhodi tree the protectors probably going to try to smash it we could make some friends if we save it i explained about the bhodi disciple who burned himself and soulcatchers threat to turn the bhodi tree into kindling id like to go myself just to see if the bhodi nonviolent ethic is strong enough to make them stand around while somebody destroys their most holy shrine but i have too much work to do here i tossed my cards in in fact i have work to do now i was tired but figured i could study murgens annals for a few hours before i passed out as i walked away swan whispered how the hell does she know all that and is she really a she never checked personally slink said i have a wife but shes definitely got some female habits on her what the devil did that mean i am just one of the guys these were exciting times i found myself eager to be up and outside where things were happening the impact of our boldness would have reached every cranny of the city by now i gobbled cold rice and listened to tobo complain again that his father had paid him no attention is there something i can do about that tobo huh unless you think i can go back there and tell him to shape up and talk to his kid youre wasting your time and mine bitching about it wheres your mother she left for work a long time ago she said theyd be suspicious if she didnt show up today probably would be theyll be real edgy about everything for a while how about instead of fussing about whats happened already you spend some time thinking about what youll do next time you see your father and in the meantime you can stay out of trouble by keeping notes for me whenever anybody questions the prisoner his glower told me he was no more excited about being offered work than any boy his age would be youre going out too i have to go to work it would be a good day to get to the library early the scholars were supposed to be gone most of the day there was supposed to be a big meeting of the bhadrhalok which was a loosely associated group of educated men who did not like the protector and who found the institution of the protectorate objectionable jokingly they referred to themselves as a band of intellectual terrorists bhadrhalok means more or less the respectable people and that was exactly what they thought they were they were all educated highcaste gunni which meant right away that a vast majority of the taglian population regarded them with no sympathy at all their biggest problem with the protector was that she held their selfconfident arrogant assumption of superiority in complete contempt as revolutionaries and terrorists they were less incandescent than any of the lowcaste social clubs that existed on every residential block in the city i doubt that soulcatcher wasted two spies watching them but they had great fun fulminating and crying on one anothers shoulders about the world going to hell in a goat cart driven by the demon in black and every week or so it got most of the library crew out of my way i did what i could to encourage their seditious fervor i got off to a slow start not thirty yards from the warehouse exit i ran into two of our brothers doing donkey work for do trang while standing lookout one made gestures indicating that they had something to report sighing i strolled over whats the story river the men called him riverwalker i did not know him by any other name we got shadowtraps thats been sprung we got ourselves some new pets oh no darn i shook my head thats not good not good run report it to goblin ill stick with ran till you get back dont dawdle im late for work not true but taglians have little sense of urgency and the concept of punctuality is alien to most shadows in the shadowtraps not a good eventuation for sure near as we could determine soulcatcher had no more than two dozen manageable shadows left under control as many more had gone feral in the remote south and were developing reputations as rakshasas which were demons or devils but not quite like those my northern forebrethren knew northern demons seemed to be solitary beings of considerable power rakshasas are communal and pretty weak individually but deadly very deadly in ancient myth of course they are much more powerful they swat each other over the head with mountaintops grow two heads for every one chopped off by a hero and collect the beautiful wives of kings who are really gods incarnate but do not remember that fact things must have been much more exciting in olden times even if they did not make a lot of sense from day to day catcher would keep a close eye on her shadows they were her most valuable resource which meant that if they had been sent out to spy she should know exactly where each was supposed to have gone at least that is the way i would have done it if i were committing irreplaceable resources i did that for every single man we committed to willow swans capture i knew how they were going to get to their places and how they were going to get home and everything they were supposed to do in between and just like i figured soulcatcher might i would have gone looking for them personally if they had failed to return home goblin came hobbling into the early morning light cursing all the way he wore the allcovering brown wool of a veyedeen dervish he hated the outfit however necessary it was to disguise himself when he was outside i did not blame him the wool was hot it was supposed to remind the holy men of the hell they were escaping by devoting themselves to chastity asceticism and good works what the hell is this shit he growled its hot enough to boil eggs out here already the boys say weve caught something in our shadowtraps i thought you might want to do something about that before mama comes looking for her babies shit more work old man you just had something in your mouth i wouldnt even want in my hand vehdna priss get the flock out of here before i give you a real language lesson and bring home something decent to eat when you come back like maybe a cow more than once he and oneeye had conspired to kidnap one of the sacred cattle that wander the city to date their efforts have come to naught because none of the men will go along the majority have gunni backgounds it took no time at all to learn that our shadow captives were not the only shadows that had run wild just before dawn rumor was rife the stories of the murders the shadows committed banished news of the attack on the palace and the selfimmolation of the bhodi disciple the killings were closer to home and closer in time and they were grotesque the corpse of a man whose life has been devoured by a shadow is a twisted husk of the creature that was i insinuated myself into the crowd surrounding the doorway of a family where there had been multiple deaths you can do that when you are little and limber and know how to use your elbows i arrived just in time to watch them bring the bodies out i was hoping they would be exposed to the public eye not that i wanted to see them myself i saw plenty of those kinds of bodies during the shadowmaster wars i just thought the people ought to see what soulcatcher could do she needed all the enemies she could get the bodies were enshrouded already but there was talk i traveled on learning that most of the dead had been people who lived on the streets and there had been a lot of those taken in no obvious pattern whatsoever it looked like soulcatcher had sent the shadows out just to demonstrate that she had the power and the will to kill the deaths had evoked no great fear people thought it was over most of them did not know any of the dead so were not angry either curiosity and revulsion were the common emotions i considered turning back to tell goblin to fix the captured shadows so they would go out killing again tonight and every night thereafter till soulcatcher tracked them down she would not look for trappers if she thought her pets had gone rogue and the shadows would create a lot more enemies for her before their terror ended at first it seemed the greys had faded from the streets they were less in evidence than usual but as i skirted chor bagan it became evident why they had the place under siege apparently on the assumption that any black company survivers having been branded bandits by the protector would hide themselves amongst taglios homegrown thieves and villains amusing sahra and i insist that we have as little to do with the criminal element as possible over oneeyes objections and ignoring banh do trangs occasional lapses that element included folk of dubious morals and discipline who might serve us up for enough blood money to buy one more jar of illegal wine i hoped they and the greys had fun i hoped somebody forgot the rules and their day turned bloody that would make life easier for me and mine any trip across town exposes you to the cruel truth about taglios beggary exists there like nowhere else in the world were someone to sweep the city clean and organize the beggars into regiments they would number more than the biggest army the captain put together in the days of the shadowmaster wars if you look the least bit foreign or prosperous they come at you in waves every attempt is made to exploit your pity not far from do trangs warehouse there is a boy with neither hands nor lower legs somehow blocks of wood have been affixed in their place he crawls around with a bowl in his mouth every cripple over the age of fifteen claims to be a wounded hero of the wars the children are the worst often they have been maimed deliberately their limbs deformed evilly they are sold to men who then feel they own them because they feed them a handful of toasted grain every few days a new mystery of the city is that men of that stripe seem to run the risk of cruel tortures and their own careers as deformed beggars if they do not watch their backs very very carefully my route took me near one such he had one arm he could use to drag himself around the rest of his limbs were twisted ruins his bones had been crushed to gravel but he had been kept alive by a dedicated effort his face and exposed skin were covered with burn scars i paused to place one small copper in his bowl he whimpered and tried to crawl away he could still see out of one eye everywhere you looked life proceeded in the unique taglian fashion every vehicle in motion had people hanging off it sponging a ride unless it was the ricksha of a rich man perhaps a banker from kowlhri street who could afford outrunners armed with bamboo canes to keep people off shopkeepers often sat on top of their tiny counters because there was no other space workmen jogged hither and yon with backbreaking loads violently cursing everyone in their way the people argued laughed waved their arms wildly simply stepped to the side of the street where no one was lying to defecate when the need came upon them they bathed in the water in the gutters indifferent to the fact that a neighbor was urinating in the same stream fifteen feet away taglios is an allout relentless assault upon all the senses but engages none so much as it does the sense of smell i hate the rainy season but without its protracted sluicingsout taglios would become untenable even for rats without the rains the endemic cholera and smallpox would be far worse than they are though the rainy times bring outbreaks of malaria and yellow fever disease of every sort is common and accepted stoically and then there are the lepers whose plight gives new depth of meaning to horror and despair never do i find my faith in god so tested as when i consider the lepers i am as terrified by them as anyone but i do know enough about some individuals to realize that very few are being visited by a scourge they deserve unless the gunni are right and they are paying for evils done in previous lives up above it all are the kites and crows the buzzards and vultures for the eaters of carrion life is good till the dead wagons come to collect the fallen the people come from everywhere from five hundred miles to find their fortunes but fortune is an ugly twofaced goddess when you have lived with her handiwork for half a generation you hardly notice anymore you forget that this is not the way life has to be you cease to marvel at just how much evil man can conjure simply by existing the library created by and bequeathed to the city by an earlier mercantile prince who was much impressed by learning strikes me as a symbol of knowledge rearing up to shed its light into the surrounding darkness of ignorance some of the citys worst slums wash right up against the wall enclosing its ground the beggars are bad around its outer gates why is a puzzlement i have never seen anyone toss them a coin there is a gateman but he is not a guard he lacks even a bamboo cane but a cane is unnecessary the sanctity of the place of knowledge is observed by everyone everyone but me you might say good morning adoo i said as the gateman swung the wrought iron open for me though i was a glorified sweeper and fetchit man i had status i appeared to enjoy the favor of some of the bhadrhalok status and caste grew more important as taglios became more crowded and resources grew less plentiful caste has become much more rigidly defined and observed in just the last ten years people are desperate to cling to the little that they have already likewise the trade guilds have grown increasingly powerful several have raised small private armed forces that they use to make sure immigrants and other outsiders do not trample on their preserves or that they sometimes hire out to temples or others in need of justice some of our brothers have done some work in that vein it generates revenue and creates contacts and allows us glimpses inside otherwise closed societies outside the library resembles the more ornate gunni temples its pillars and walls are covered with reliefs recalling stories both mythical and historical it is not a huge place being just thirty yards on its long side and sixty feet the other way its main floor is elevated ten feet above the surrounding gardens and monuments which themselves cap a small knoll the building proper is tall enough that inside there is a fullsize hanging gallery all the way around at the level where a second floor should be then an attic of sorts above that plus a welldrained basement below the main floor i find that interior much too open for comfort unless i am way down low or way up high everyone can watch what i am doing the main floor is an expanse of marble brought from somewhere far away upon it in neat rows stand the desks and tables where the scholars work either studying or copying decaying manuscripts the climate is not conducive to the longevity of books there is a certain sadness to the library a developing air of neglect scholars grow fewer each year the protector does not care about the library because it cannot brag that it contains old books full of deadly spells there is not one grimoire in the place though there is a lot of very interesting stuff if she bothered to look but that sort of curiosity is not part of her character there are more glass windows in the library than anywhere else i have ever seen the copyists need a lot of light most of them these days are old and their sight is failing master santaraksita often goes on about the library having no future no one wants to visit it anymore he believes that has something to do with the hysterical fear of the past that began to build soon after the rise of the shadowmasters when he was still a young man back when fear of the black company gained circulation before the company ever appeared i stepped into the library and surveyed it i loved the place in another time i would gladly have become one of master santaraksitas acolytes if i could have survived the close scrutiny endured by wouldbe students i was not gunni i was not high caste the former i could fake well enough to get by i had been surrounded by gunni all my life but i did not know caste from within only the priestly caste and some selected commercialcaste folks were permitted to be literate though familiar with the vulgate and the high mode both i could never pretend to have grown up in a priestly household fallen on hard times i had not grown up in much of any kind of household i had the place entirely to myself and there was no obvious cleaning that needed doing right away it ever amazed me that no one actually lived in the library that it was more holy or more frightening than a temple the kangali the parentless and homeless and fearless boys of the street who run in troops of six to eight see temples as just another potential resource but they would not trouble the library to the unlettered the knowledge contained in books was almost as terrible as the knowledge bound up in the flesh of a creature as wicked as soulcatcher i had one of the best jobs in taglios i was the main caretaker at the biggest depository and replicatory of books within the taglian empire it had taken three and a half years of scheming and several carefully targeted murders to put me into a position i enjoyed way too much always before me was the temptation to forget the company the temptation might have gotten me had i had the social qualifications to be anything but a janitor who sneaked peeks into books when nobody was looking in quick order i conjured the tools of my purported trade then hurried to one of the more remote copying desks it was out of the way yet offered a good line of vision and good acoustics so i would not be surprised doing something both forbidden and impossible i had gotten caught twice already luckily both times with tantric books illuminated with illustrations they thought i was sneaking peeks at dirty pictures master santaraksita himself suggested i go study temple walls if that sort of thing appealed to me but i could not help feeling that he began to harbor a deep suspicion after the second incident they never threatened me with dismissal or even punishment but they made it clear i was out of line that the gods punish those who exceed caste and station they were of course unaware of my origins or associations or of my disinclination to accept the gunni religion with all its idolatry and tolerance for wickedness i dug out the book that purported to be a history of taglios earliest days i would not have been aware of it had i not noticed it being copied from a manuscript so old that much of it had appeared to be in a style of calligraphy resembling that of the old annals i was having so much trouble deciphering old baladitya the copyist had had no difficulty rendering the text in modern taglian i have salvaged the moldy crumbling original i had it hidden i had a notion that by comparing versions i could get a handle on the dialect of those old annals if not girish could be offered a chance to translate for the black company an opportunity he ought to pounce on considering the alternative available at that point i already knew that the books i wanted to translate were copies of even earlier versions at least two of which had been transcribed originally in another language entirely presumably that spoken by our first brothers when they came down off the plain of glittering stone i started at the beginning it was an interesting story taglios began as a collection of mud huts beside the river some of the villagers fished and dodged crocodiles while others raised a variety of crops the city grew for no obvious reason beyond its being the last viable landing before the river lost itself in the pestilential delta swamps in those days not yet inhabited by the nyueng bao trade from upriver continued overland to all the great kingdoms of the south not a one of those was mentioned by name taglios began as a tributary of baladiltyla a city great in oral histories and no longer in existence it is sometimes associated with some really ancient ruins outside the village of videha which itself is associated with the intellectual achievements of a kuras empire and is the center of ruins of another sort entirely baladiltyla was the birthplace of rhaydreynak the warrior king who nearly exterminated the deceivers in antiquity and who harried the handful of survivors into burying their sacred texts the books of the dead in that same cavern where murgen now lay entombed with all the old men in their cobwebs of ice not all this was information from the book i was reading as i went i made connections with things i had read or heard elsewhere this was very exciting stuff for me here was an answer for goblin the princes of taglios could not be kings because they honored as their sovereigns the kings of nhanda who raised them up of course nhanda was no more and goblin would want to know why in that case the taglian princes could not just crown themselves there were plenty of precedents from the looks of the history of the centuries before the coming of the black company that had been the favorite pastime of anybody who could get three or four men to follow him around i overcame a powerful urge to rush ahead and look for the era when the free companies of khatovar exploded upon the world what had happened before that would help explain what had happened when they did a sudden startled thrill ran through me i was not alone anymore a long time had passed the sun had swung several hours across the sky the quality of the light within the library had changed it had become a much paler version of its morning self presumably the clouds had passed away i did not jump or i hope show any immediate outward reaction but i did have to respond visibly to my awareness of the presence of whoever was standing behind me perhaps it was his breath that alerted me the curry and garlic were strong certainly i never heard a sound i brought my heartbeat under control smoothed my features turned the master of the library my boss surendranath santaraksita met my gaze dorabee i believe you were reading at the library they know me as dorabee dey banerjae an honorable name a man of that name died beside me in a skirmish near the daka woods a long time ago he did not need it anymore and i would do it no harm i did not speak the truth would be hard to deny if the master had been there long i was halfway through the book which was of the bound sort and contained no illustrations whatsoever not even one tantric passage i have been watching you for some time dorabee your interest and skill are both evident its clear that you read better than most of my copyists yet its equally obvious that you arent of the priestly caste my face was still as old cheese i was wondering if i should kill him and how i could dispose of the corpse if i did perhaps the stranglers could be framed no master santaraksita was old but still hale enough to throw me around if i tried to throttle him being small has definite disadvantages at times he had eight inches on me but at the moment that seemed like several feet and someone else was moving around at the other end of the library i heard voices i did not drop my eyes the way a menial should master santaraksita already knew i was more than a curious sweeper though a good one i kept the place spotless that was a company rule our public characters had to be morally straight and excellent workers which did not make some of the men at all happy i waited master santaraksita would decide his own fate he would decide the fate of the library that he loved so our dorabee is a man of more talents than we suspected what else do you do that we dont know about dorabee can you write as well i did not answer of course where did you learn it has long been the contention of many of the bhadrhalok that those not of the priestly caste do not have the mental facility to learn the high mode still i did not speak eventually he would commit to movement in some direction i would respond accordingly i hoped i could avoid destroying him and his brethren and stripping the library of whatever might be useful that was the course oneeye wanted to follow years ago never mind being subtle never mind not alerting soulcatcher to what was happening right under her nose you have nothing to say no defense a pursuit of knowledge needs no defense sri sondhel ghosh the janaka declared that in the garden of wisdom there is no caste albeit in an age when caste had much less meaning sondhel ghosh spoke of the university at vikramas where all the students had to pass an exhaustive examination before they were allowed to enter the grounds do we suppose many students of any caste were admitted who were unable to read the panas and pashids sondhel ghosh was not called the janaka for nothing vikramas was the seat of janai religious study a janitor who knows about a religion long dead we are indeed entering the age of khadi where all is turned upon its head khadi is the favored taglian name for kina in one of her less vicious aspects the name kina is seldom spoken lest the dark mother hear and respond only the deceivers want her to come around where did you acquire this skill who taught you a friend started me out a long time ago after we buried him i continued to teach myself my gaze never left his face for a goofy old boffin whose stuffiness was grist for the mockery of the younger copyists he seemed remarkably flexible mentally but then he might be brighter than he seemed he might realize that he could buy himself a float downriver to the swamps if the wrong words passed his lips no master surendranath santaraksita did not yet live in a world where one who read and cherished sacred texts also cut throats and trafficked with sorcerers the dead and rakshasas master surenranath santaraksita did not think of himself that way but he was a sort of holy hermit selfconsecrated to preserve all that was good in knowledge and culture this much i had discovered already through continuous observation i had figured out also that we might not often agree on what was good you just wish to learn then i lust after knowledge the way some men lust after pleasures of the flesh ive always been that way i cant help it its an obsession santaraksita leaned a little closer studying me with myopic eyes you are older than you seem i confessed people think im younger than i am because im small tell me about yourself dorabee dey banerjae who was your father of what family was your mother you will not have heard of them i considered refusing to elaborate but dorabee dey banerjae did have a story i had been rehearsing it for seven years if i just stayed in character it would all be true stay in character be dorabee caught reading let sleepy worry about what to do when it was time for sleepy to come back onstage you denigrate yourself overmuch santaraksita said at one point i may have known your father if he was the same dollal dey banerjae who could not resist the liberators call for recruits when he raised the original legion that triumphed at ghoja ford i had named dead dorabees father already i could not take that back now how could he know dollal anyway banerjae was one of the oldest and most common of traditional taglian surnames banerjaes were mentioned in the text i had been reading till moments ago that may have been him i never knew him well i do recall him boasting that he was one of the first to enroll he marched off with the liberator to defeat the shadowmasters he never came back from ghoja ford i did not know much more about dorabees family not even his mothers name in all taglios how could it be possible i would encounter anyone who remembered the father fortune is indeed a goddess filled with caprice did you know him well if that was so the librarian might have to go just that would make my exposure inevitable no not well not well at all now master santaraksita seemed disinclined to say more he seemed worrisomely thoughtful after a moment he told me come with me dorabee sir you brought up the university at vikramas i have a list of the questions the gate guards put to those who wanted to enroll curiosity impels me to subject you to the same examination i know little about janai master if the truth were told i was a bit shaky on the tenets of my own religion always having been afraid to examine it too closely other religions do not stand up to the rigorous application of reason for all we have things like kina stalking the earth and i really did not want to find myself stumbling over any boulders of absurdity protruding from the bedrock of my own faith the examination was not religious in nature dorabee it tested the prospective students morals ethics and ability to think janaka monks did not wish to educate potential leaders who would come to their calling with the stain of darkness upon their souls that being the case i had to get into character very deeply indeed sleepy the vehdna soldier girl from jaicur had stains on her soul blacker than a shadow of all night falling then what did you do tobo asked around a mouthful of spicy taglianstyle rice i told him then i went out and made sure the library was clean and surendranath santaraksita remained where he was stunned into immobility by the answers he had received from a lowly sweeper i could have told him that anyone who paid attention to the storytellers in the street the sermons of mendicant priests and the readily available gratuitous advice of hermits and yogis could have satisfied most of the vikramas questions darn it a vehdna woman from jaicur could do it we got to kill him oneeye said how you want to do it thats always your solution these days isnt it i asked the more we get rid of now the fewer therell be around to aggravate me in my old age i could not tell if he was joking when you start getting old well worry about it guy like that will be easy little girl he wont be looking for it bam hes gone and nobodyll care strangle his ass leave a rumel on him blame it on our old buddy narayan hes in town we need to put all kinds of shit off on him language old man oneeye babbled on putting a name to animal waste in a hundred tongues i turned my back sahra youve been very quiet ive been trying to digest what i picked up today by the way jaul barundandi was distraught because you stayed home tried to take your kickback out of my wages he finally found minh subredils limit i threatened to scream he wouldve called my bluff if his wife hadnt been around somewhere are you sure its safe to let this librarian live if it looked natural no one would suspect it may not be safe but it could pay dividends master santaraksita wants to make some kind of experiment out of me to see if a lowcaste dog really can be taught to roll over and play dead what about soulcatcher what about the shadows did you learn anything she loosed everything she had just an impulse no master plan except to remind the city of her power she expected the victims to be immigrants who live in the streets no one much cares about them only a handful of shadows got back before dawn our captives wont be missed until tomorrow we could go catch a few more bats goblin said inviting himself to take a seat oneeye appeared to have dozed off he still had hold of his cane though bats theres bats out there tonight sahra offered a confirming nod goblin said back before we marched against the shadowmasters we killed all the bats had bounties on them big enough for bat hunters to make a living because the shadowmasters used them to spy i recalled a time when crows were murdered relentlessly because they might be acting as soulcatchers farflying eyes youre saying we should stay in tonight mind like a stone ax this old gal i asked sahra what did soulcatcher think about our attack it didnt come up where i could hear she pushed some sheets from the old annals across the bhodi suicide bothered her more shes afraid it might start a trend a trend there could be more than one monk goofy enough to set himself on fire she thinks so tobo asked mom are we going to call up dad tonight i dont know right now dear i want to talk to him some more you will im sure hes interested in talking to you too she sounded like she was trying to convince herself i asked goblin would it be possible for you to keep that mist thing going all the time so we could keep murgen connected and any time we wanted we could just send him where we needed to know about something were working on it he took off on a technical rant i did not understand a word but i let him roll he deserved to feel good about something oneeye began to snore the smart would stay out of reach of his cane anyway i said tobo could keep notes all the time i had had this sudden vision of the son of the annalist taking over for the father the way it goes in taglian guilds where trades and tools pass down generation after generation in fact oneeye said as though no time had passed since the last remark and as though he had not been faking sleep a moment ago right nows the time you could play you a really great big ol hairyassed oldtime company dirty trick little girl send somebody down to the silk merchants exchange have them get you some silk different colors big enough to make up copies of them scarves the stranglers use them rumels then we start picking off the guys we dont like anyway once in a while we leave one of them scarves behind like with that librarian i said i like that except the part about master santaraksita thats a closed subject old man oneeye cackled mans got to stand by what he believes it would get a lot of fingers pointing goblin said oneeye cackled again it would point them in some other direction too little girl and im thinking we dont want much more attention coming our way right now im thinking maybe were closer to figuring things out than any of us realizes water sleeps we have to be taken seriously thats what im saying we use them scarves to take out informants and guys who know too much librarians for instance would i be correct in my suspicion that youve been thinking about this for a while and by chance you just happen to have a little list all ready to go very likely any such list would include all the people responsible for his several failed attempts to establish himself in the taglian black markets he cackled he took a swipe at goblin with his cane and you said shes got a mind like a flint hatchet bring me the list ill discuss it with murgen next time i see him with a ghost they got no sense of perspective you know you mean maybe hes seen everything and knows what youre really up to sounds like a perspective to me makes me wonder how far the company mightve gone if our forebrethren had had a ghost to keep an eye on you oneeye grumbled something about how unfair and unreasonable the world was he had been singing that song the whole time i had known him he would keep it up after he became a ghost himself i mused you think we could get murgen to winkle out the source of the stink that keeps coming from the back there where do trang hides his crocodile skins i know its not them croc hides have a flavor all their own oneeye scowled he was ready to change the subject now the odor in question came from his beer and liquormanufacturing project hidden in a cellar he and do trang thought nobody knew about banh do trang once our benefactor for sahras sake now was practically one of the gang because he had a powerful taste for oneeyes product a huge hunger for illegal and shadowy income and he liked having tough guys on the payroll who would work hard for very little money he thought his vice was a secret he shared only with oneeye and gota the three of them got drunk together twice a week alcohol is a definite nyueng bao weakness im sure its not worth the trouble little girl its probably dead rats bad rat problem in this town do trang puts rat poison out all the time by the pound no need to waste murgens time chasing rodents youve both got better things to do i would be talking over a lot of things with murgen if i could deal with him directly if we could catch and keep his attention i would like to know firsthand everything that ordinarily came to me through other people i imply no malice particularly from sahra but people do reshape information according to their own prejudices including even me possibly though until now my objectivity has been peerless all my predecessors though their reports must be read with a jaundiced eye of course most of them made the same observation in regard to their own predecessors so we are all in agreement everyone is a liar but us only lady was unabashedly selfcongratulating she missed few opportunities to remind those who came later how brilliant and determined and successful she was turning the tide of the shadowmaster wars when she had nothing to begin building upon but herself murgen was putting it charitably less than sane much of the time because i lived through many of the times and events he recollected i have to say he did pretty good most of what he recorded could be true i cannot contradict him but a lot he set down does seem fanciful fanciful last night i had a long chat with his ghost or spirit or ka whatever that was if that was really murgen and not some trick played on us by kina or soulcatcher we can never be onehundredpercent certain that anything is exactly what it appears to be kina is the mother of deceit and soulcatcher to quote a man far wiser and more foul of mouth than i is a mudsucking lunatic this is excellent i enthused again as sahra summoned murgen once more she herself betrayed no enthusiasm for the task tobos hovering did nothing to improve her temper before he does anything else i want to have him check on surendranath santaraksita so you dont trust the librarian after all oneeye said he chuckled i think hes all right but why hand him a chance to break my heart if i can avoid it by keeping an eye on him how come its got to be my eye theres not a sharper one available is there and you already turned down a chance to work on the annals ive got to do some heavy studying in those tonight i might be on the track of something the little wizard grunted i think i found something at the library today if santaraksita doesnt trip me up i may have an outside view of the first coming of the company by the end of the week an independent historical source has been a goal almost as long as has been our desire for a look at uncontaminated editions of the earliest three volumes of the annals sahra had something else on her mind barundandi wants me to bring sawa to work sleepy no sawa is on hiatus shes sick she has cholera if thats what it takes im finally starting to make some real headway im not going to let that slide now hes also been asking about shiki back when tobo had accompanied his mother to the palace occasionally she had called him shikhandini which was a joke jaul barundandi never got because he was not the sort to pay attention to historical mythology one of the kings of legendary hastinapur had had a senior wife who seemed to be barren a good gunni he prayed and made sacrifice faithfully and eventually one of the gods stepped down from heaven to tell him he could have what he wanted which was a son but he was going to get it the hard way for the son would be born a daughter and as they say it came to pass that the wife brought forth a daughter whom the king then named shikhandin a name that also existed in the female form shikhandini it is a long and not that interesting story but the girl grew up to become a mighty warrior the trouble started when it came time for the prince to take a bride many of our public characters have obscure allusions or jokes built into them that helped make things more interesting for the brothers playing the roles i asked do we have any reason to snatch barundandi other than his general sliminess i thought he was most useful right where he was any replacement was sure to be as venal and unlikely to be as kind to minh subredil and could we even get him out where we could touch him nobody suggested a strategic reason for grabbing the man sahra wanted to know why do you ask because i do think we could lure him if we dress tobo up pretty then refuse to cooperate unless barundandi meets him outside sahra was not offended the ruse is a legitimate weapon of war she looked thoughtful maybe gokhale instead perhaps though he might want someone younger we can ask swan i was thinking of catching gokhale in that place where the deceivers killed that other one the enemys leading personalities seldom left the palace which was why we had chosen to go get willow swan sahra began to sing murgen was reluctant again tonight i said murgen should look at that joy house too hed be the best way for us to check it out though no doubt we could find several brothers willing to risk themselves in an extended recon sahra nodded did not break the rhythm of her lullaby we might even no we could not just burn the place once gokhale had been inside long enough to become seriously engaged nobody would understand why i wanted to waste a perfectly good whorehouse though a few might find a deadly fire highly amusing oneeye looked like he was sleeping again but was not without opening his eyes he asked you know where youre going little girl you got some kind of overall plan yes i was surprised to find that i really believed that intuitively somewhere inside though i had not known it consciously i had engineered a master plan for the liberation of the captured and the resurrection of the company and it was starting to come together after all these years murgen showed up muttering about a white crow he was distracted i asked the wizards you figured out how to anchor him here yet always some damned thing oneeye grumbled whatever you do its never enough it can be done goblin admitted but i still dont see why we would want to he hasnt been very cooperative he doesnt want to be here hes losing his connection to the real world hed rather sleep and wander those caverns i took a stab in the dark and put on his white wings be khadis messenger white wings they did not read the annals the albino crow that turns up sometimes sometimes murgen is inside it because kina puts him there or used to put him there and now he keeps stumbling back in the way he kept stumbling around in time once soulcatcher got him started how do you know that i read sometimes and once in a while i even read the annals and try to figure out what murgen didnt tell us what he might not actually have known himself right now he may be enamored of being the white crow because that way he gets into actual flesh that ranges outside the caverns or he may just be falling under the influence of kina as she wakes up again but none of that ought to matter much right now right now we have a bunch of spying we need him to do i want to be able to twist his arm if i have to the mission comes first murgen himself taught me that sahra said sleepys right anchor him then ill grab him by the nose and kick his behind until ive got his undivided attention she seemed suddenly optimistic as though taking a direct approach with her husband was some totally new concept fraught with unexpected hope she went straight to outright confrontation drawing tobo in to support her maybe she could rebuild murgens ties with the outside world i turned to the others i found another kina myth this morning in this one her father didnt trick her into going to sleep she died then her husband got so upset that husband goblin squeaked what husband i dont know goblin the book didnt name names it was written for people who grew up in the gunni religion it assumes you know who theyre talking about when kina died her husband was so griefstricken he grabbed up her corpse and started doing that stomping dance murgen talks about her doing in his visions he got so violent that the other gods were afraid he would destroy the world so her father threw an enchanted knife that cut her up into about fifty pieces and every place one of the chunks fell became a holy place for kinas worshippers just reading between the lines and guessing id say khatovar is where her head hit the ground i got a notion oneeye was on the right track back when he was going to desert and retire oneeye gawked goblin saying something positive about anything he ever did the hell i was i just had an attack of juvenile angst i got over it and got responsible again theres a new concept i observed oneeye responsible for catastrophes and afflictions maybe goblin said oneeye said i dont get the kina story if she died back at the beginning of the world how could she be giving us trouble for the last twenty or thirty years its religion dimwit goblin barked it dont got to make sense kina is a goddess i said i guess gods cant ever be completely dead i dont know oneeye i didnt make it up i just reported it look the gunni dont believe anybody dies really their soul goes on hehhehheh goblin chuckled if these gunni got it right youre in deep shit runt boy you got to keep going round on the wheel of life till you get it right you got a lot of karma to work off stop now i snapped were supposed to be working work not the favorite swear word of either man i told them you get murgen nailed down or chained down whatever it takes to keep him under control then you help sahra try to get through to him i have a suspicion things are going to get exciting before long and well need him wide awake and cooperative oneeye grumbled sounds to me like you dont plan to be here looking over our shoulders i was up already clever man i have some reading and some translating to do you can manage without me if you concentrate oneeye told goblin we got to get that little bit into the sack with some guyll pork her brains out his cure for all ills even at his age i paused to say when hes given everything else the onceover have him search for narayan and the daughter of night i did not need to explain how badly we needed to keep those two from achieving their ends ive got it i shouted running back to the corner where murgens friends and family were trying to torment him into taking a broader interest in the world of the living i found it ive got it i hope you aint gonna give it to me oneeye grumbled my excitement was so loud and intense even murgen who was caught in the mist and being a real pain about his situation paused to study me i had a feeling an intuition the other day that the answer was in the annals in murgens annals and id just overlooked it maybe because it had been so long since i read them and i wouldnt have thought to look for it back then and behold oneeye sneered there it was in ink of gold on myrextinted paper with little scarlet arrows saying here it is little girl the secret of the stuff it dustbag goblin snapped i want to hear what sleepy found though it would have been him doing the sarcasm if oneeye had not beat him to it its the whole thing with the nyueng bao well maybe not all of it i said as sahra scowled at me but the part with uncle doj and mother gota and why they came out of the swamp when they didnt have a debt of honor like your brother sahra sahras brother thai dei was under the glittering plain with murgen serving as his bodyguard because of what murgen and the company had done to help the nyueng bao during the siege of jaicur sahra you must know some of this that may be true sleepy but youll have to tell us what youre talking about first im talking about whatever it was that the thousand voices stole from the temple of ghanghesha sometime between the end of the siege and when uncle doj and your mother invited themselves to come stay with you here in taglios murgen touches on it over and over lightly but i dont think he ever really caught on completely whatever it was that the thousand voices stole uncle doj called it the key from other internal evidence i think it had to be another key to the shadowgate like the lance of passion the thousand voices was what the nyueng bao called soulcatcher i think if we had that key we could open the way for the captured if i was guessing right here i had created a whole new line of inquiry why the nyueng bao sahra began shaking her head slowly am i wrong what is the key then im not saying youre wrong sleepy im saying i dont want you to be right there are things i wouldnt want to be true what why myths and legends sleepy ugly myths and legends some of them im not supposed to know and i know i dont know them all probably none of the worst doj was their curator and keeper as you are for the black company but doj never shared his secrets tobo find your grandmother bring her here get do trang too if hes here bewildered the boy shuffled away a spectral whisper came out of the device where murgen waited sleepy may be right i recall suspecting something like that and wondering if i could find a good history of the nyueng bao so i could figure it out youll need to question willow swan too i said ill do that later separately swan doesnt need to know whats happening are you paying attention now standardbearer do you have any idea where were at and what were doing i do his tone was resigned though like mine when i know i have to get up in the morning want to or not tell me about the temple of ghanghesha then both of you why would this key have been kept there sahra did not want to talk about it her whole body said she was caught up in a ferocious internal struggle why is this so hard i asked there is old evil in my peoples past im only vaguely familiar with it doj knows the whole truth the rest of us just understand that our ancestors were guilty of a great sin and until we expiate it our whole race is condemned to live in bitter destitution in the swamp the temple was a holy place long before some nyueng bao began to adopt gunni beliefs it protected something possibly the key you mentioned the thing uncle doj has been looking for where did the nyueng bao come from sahra that question had intrigued me since childhood each few years hundreds of those strange people would pass through jaicur on pilgrimage they were quiet and orderly and stayed to themselves and a year after they arrived from the north they would pass through again going back that way even at the height of the power of the shadowmasters that cycle had continued nobody knew where they went nobody ever cared out of the south somewhere a long time ago from beyond the dandha presh i could not imagine subjecting little children and old folks to the rigors of a journey of that magnitude the pilgrimage had to be very important indeed yes but there are no pilgrimages anymore the one that had ended up with hundreds of nyueng bao dying in jaicur was the last of which i was aware the shadowmaster and the kiaulune wars made the next few times impossible theres supposed to be a pilgrimage every four years each nyueng bao de duang has to make the pilgrimage at least once as an adult for a while the lack was no problem but now the protector will not permit the people to meet their obligations banh do trang rasped from his wheelchair having arrived in time to catch the drift of my interrogation there are things we do not discuss with those who arent nyueng bao i got the feeling he was saying the same thing twice at one time one way for my benefit and another for sahras this could be ticklish we dared not offend banh do trang whose friendship we needed if we lost him we also risked losing sahra whose value to the company could not be calculated nothing is ever simple and straightforward i told the old man the way i had it figured ky gota waddled in just as i started my eyes widened as oneeye gallantly offered her his seat it is a world just chockfull of wonders the little wizard went and got another seat which he set next to gotas the two of them sat there leaning on their canes like a couple of temple gargoyles a ghost of ancient beauty peeked out of the wide permanent scowl that gota used for a face i explained the situation but heres the mystery where is the key today nobody volunteered that information id think that if the thousand voices still had it shed be running down to kiaulune every month to round up a new gaggle of killer shadows it if could open the shadowgate safely and if uncle doj had it he wouldnt be roaming around looking for it hed be back in the swamp blithely letting the rest of us go to alsheil in a handcart am i wrong mother gota you know the man you must be able to offer something able perhaps willing of course not the big thing that stands out to my ear about the companys sojourn in the south is the stubborn silence of so many people about everything like if we even discovered our own birthdays that would be something we could use against them the fact that the company now consists almost entirely of native soldiers has not helped at all our life does not attract the knowledgeable educated portion of the population if a priest offered to sign on we would send him downriver knowing for certain that he was a spy you got the damned gimmick oneeye asked who you little girl the villainess you i didnt forget that you were soulcatchers guest for a while when she caught you on the road coming back from running that message for murgen i havent forgotten that when our sweet old uncle doj rescued you it was incidental he was looking for his missing trinket the key not so thats all true but i didnt bring anything away from that except a few new scars and the rags on my back what we need to know then is has soulcatcher been looking for the key we dont know for sure but she does fly down south occasionally and patrols the old ground like shes looking for something we knew that courtesy of murgen though till now her behavior had made no sense so who else couldve snatched this prize oneeye did not press gota for any information the way to get around gota was to ignore her in time she would insist that she be noticed i remembered a pale ragged little girl who though just four years old had seemed ageless silent and patient confidently unfrightened by her captivity the daughter of night she never spoke to me once she acknowledged my existence only when she had to because if she irritated me too much i might take all of what little food soulcatcher allowed us i should have strangled her then but at that time i did not know who she was at that time i was having trouble remembering who i was soulcatcher had drugged me and gone down inside me and found half what made me me then had tried being me in order to infiltrate the company i still wonder how well she really knows me certainly i do not want her to find out that i survived the kiaulune wars she might have the emotional weapons to crush me narayan came to get the daughter of night i mused aloud but i caught only glimpses of him an extremely skinny little man in a filthy loincloth who didnt look anything like the terrible monster he was supposed to be it didnt occur to me it was him till i realized i wasnt going to be released too since i couldnt see what they were doing i dont know if they took anything with them murgen you saw them then i have it written down that you did did they take anything away that might have been this key i dont know believe it or not you really do miss some things out here he seemed piqued i realized i had not bothered to hear what he had to report i asked not much useful sahra told me cutting murgen off before he could retell everything from the beginning can you find them now i foresaw trouble there was an unwilling connection to kina if the dark goddess was stirring again he would have to be careful not to attract divine attention we have these priorities regarding the daughter of night kill her failing that kill her sidekick failing that make sure she cant copy the books of the dead which im sure shell start doing again as soon as she develops a reliable connection with kina finally recapture anything she and singh might have carried off when narayan rescued her oneeye stopped nodding off long enough to clap his hands lazily tear em up little girl tear em up sarky old reprobate oneeye snickered goblin said you want another angle find out from your library pals who makes bound blank books go to them and find out whos ordered some recently or bribe them to let you know when anybody does gosh i said somebody who actually uses his brain to think the delight of the world is that its wonders never cease where the devil did murgen go sahra said you just told him to find narayan singh and the daughter of night i didnt mean right this second i wanted to know if he found out anything about chandra gokhale we can use pressure getting to you little girl oneeyes tone was so sweet i wanted to pop him relax nows the time when you dont want to force anything a couple of men from the duty crew runmust singh and a shadowlander dubbed kendo cutter by his squad mates invited themselves into the staff meeting kendo reported theres all kinds of screaming going on out there tonight i sent out word everybody should hole up someplace where theres plenty of light sahra said the shadows are hunting i said well be all right here but just to be safe goblin why dont you make the rounds with kendo and runmust we dont want any surprise sahra will soulcatcher let the shadows run completely wild to make her point youre the annalist what do the books say about her they say shes capable of anything she has no connection with the humanity of anyone else it must be very lonely to be her what we agree our next target should be chandra gokhale sahra eyed me oddly that had been decided already unless some better opportunity fell into our laps we would eliminate the inspectorgeneral without whom the tax system and the bureaucratic side of government would stumble and stagger he also seemed the most vulnerable of our enemies and his removal would leave the radisha more isolated than ever cut off by the protector on one hand the priests on the other and unable to turn anywhere because she was the radisha the princess unapproachable in some respects a demigoddess it had to be lonely to be her too subtlety and finesse i asked what did we do today to frighten the world then i realized that i knew the answer it had been part of the plan for capturing swan all the brotherhood would have avoided any risks tonight there would be shows from buttons previously planted there would be more again tomorrow night smokeandlight shows proclaiming water sleeps or my brother unforgiven or all their days are numbered there would be more somewhere every evening from now on sahra mused someone who wasnt one of us brought in another prayer wheel and mounted it on a memorial post outside the north entrance it hadnt been noticed yet when i left same message i presume thats scary that could be a potent one rajadharma it has the radisha thinking already that monk burning himself definitely got her attention story of my life here i spend months working out every tiny detail of a marvelous plan and i get upstaged by a lunatic with a fire fetish so those bhodi nuts found a good message you think we could steal some of their thunder oneeye chuckled evilly what i demanded sometimes i amaze myself goblin about to leave with runmust and kendo observed you been amazed at yourself for two hundred years mainly cause nobody else bothers to get interested in insects you better not go to sleep any time soon frogface gentlemen sahra said gently yet she grabbed the attention of both wizards can we stick to business i need some sleep absolutely goblin said absolutely if the old fart has an idea lets get it out here before it dies of loneliness you may continue your assignment goblin stuck out his tongue but left amaze the rest of us oneeye i suggested i did not want him dozing off before he shared his wisdom next time one of those bhodi loons lights himself up we have the smoke and flames carry our message water sleeps and a new one i thunk up nor even death destroy you got to admit thats got a nice religious ring to it indeed i agreed what the heck does it mean little girl dont you start in on me the ghost of evils past whispered i found them murgen was back i did not ask who where the thieves garden chor bagan the greys have it under siege and they were still serious about getting the place cleaned out murgen said sahra wakened me well before dawn which is not my best time of day when i opted for a military career we were besieged in my hometown i just knew that once we got out of there we would sleep till noon we would eat fresh food all the time and there would be plenty of it and never ever would we have to go out in the rain again in the meantime i took the best i could get which was the black company during the siege with the water fifty feet deep the only thing resembling fresh food was the long pig mogaba and his nar friends were enjoying unless you counted the occasional lame rat or slowwitted crow what i grumbled personally i am convinced that even the priests of happygolucky old ghanghesha are not required to be pleasant before an hour much closer to noon than this was i have to go to the palace you have to appear at the library if we want to snatch narayan and the girl right in front of the greys we need to start planning right now she was right but that did not mean i had to accept it gracefully every company member inside do trangs complex and banh himself gathered over a crude breakfast only tobo and mother gota were absent but they would have no part in any of this i thought nobody from outside could be included now because shadows were on the prowl we got a plan all worked out oneeye announced proudly im sure its one stroke of genius after another i replied as i made a groggy effort to collect a bowl of cold rice a mango and a bowl of tea first thing goblin goes up there in his dervish outfit then tobo comes strutting along good morning adoo i murmured distractedly as the gateman admitted me to the library grounds i was worried about leaving goblin and oneeye to operate on their own my mother instinct at work they said both showing nasty teeth as they reminded me that every hen has to trust her chicks on their own sometime a point well made though few hens have to worry about their chicks getting drunk forgetting what they are doing and wandering off in search of adventure in a city where there is not even one other skinny little black man or ugly little white character adoo nodded his greeting he never had anything to say inside the library i went to work immediately though only a couple of copyists had arrived before me sometimes dorabee focused as intently as sawa did that helped turn off the worries dorabee dorabee dey banerjae i started awake amazed that i had fallen asleep i had squatted down on my heels in a corner in a fashion common amongst gunni and nyueng bao but not common among vehdna shadar or many of the ethnic minorities we vehdna favor sitting on the floor or on a cushion crosslegged shadar like low chairs or stools not owning at least a crude stool is the truest mark of poverty amongst the shadar i was in character even in my sleep master santaraksita are you ill he sounded concerned tired i didnt sleep well the skildirsha were hunting last night i used the shadowlander name for the shadows that did not trouble santaraksita it had become part of the language under the protectorate the screams kept waking me up i understand i did not enjoy a sound sleep myself though not for that reason i was unaware of the horror till i saw its marks this morning the skildirsha show a proper respect for the priestly class then the faintest twitch of his lip told me he had not missed the joke i am properly appalled dorabee this is evil unlike any we have ever known the blind misfortune of flood or plague or disaster we must endure stoically and against the darkness even the gods themselves sometimes contend in vain but to send out a pack of these shadows to do murder randomly and often and for no reason even an insane man can comprehend that is evil of the sort the northerners used to preach dorabee managed a credible job of looking slackjawed im sorry im exercised you probably never saw any of the outsiders he placed the same stress on outsiders that many taglians used when they meant the black company specifically i did i saw the liberator himself once when i was little and i saw the one they called the lieutenant after she came back from dejagore i was pretty far away but i remember it because that was the same day she killed all the priests and the protector i saw her a couple of times i was making it up as i went but that was the sort of thing most adult taglians could claim the company had been in and out of the city for years before the final campaign against longshadow and the fortress overlook i rose ill get back to work now you do your job well dorabee thank you master santaraksita i try indeed he seemed to be having trouble getting something out i have decided that you will be allowed access to any books not in the restricted section restricted books were those not available in multiple copies only the most favored scholars were allowed near those so far i had been able to determine only a handful of the titles of the books so set aside when you have no other obligations part of my day every day i spent just waiting to be told about something i needed to do thank you master santaraksita ill expect you to be able to discuss them yes master santaraksita we have set our feet upon an unknown road dorabee an exciting and frightening journey lies ahead his prejudices were such that he actually meant what he said me reading had twisted his universe all out of shape and now he was going to conspire in this perverted vermiculation i took my broom in hand exciting and frightening things would be happening elsewhere in my universe and i hated every second that i was not there to control them the little dervish in brown wool seemed completely lost inside himself he was busy talking to himself paying no attention to the surrounding world most likely he was quoting to himself from the sacred texts of the vehdna as understood by his peculiar splinter sect though tired and irritable the greys did not challenge him immediately they had been taught to honor all holy men not just those already secure within the shadar truths any devoted stalker after wisdom would find his path leading him to enlightenment eventually tolerance of such seekers was common to all taglians the welfare of the soul and the spirit were of grave concern to most the gunni indeed considered the seeking of enlightenment to be one of the four key stages of an ideally lived life once a man successfully raised up and provided for his children he should put all things material all ambition and pleasure aside he should go into a forest to live as a hermit or become a mendicant seeker or in some other way should live out his final years looking for the truth and purifying his soul many of the greatest names in taglian and southern history are those of kings and rich men who chose just such a path but human nature being human nature the greys did not however let the dervish follow his quest into chor bagan a sergeant intercepted him his associates surrounded the holy man the sergeant said father you cannot go in that direction this street has been closed to traffic by order of minister swan even dead swan had to take the blame for soulcatchers policies the dervish apparently failed to notice the greys till he actually collided with the sergeant huh the younger greys laughed men enjoy seeing their prejudices confirmed the sergeant repeated his message he added you must turn right or left were rooting out the evils infesting what lies straight ahead he possessed a touch of wit the dervish looked first right then left he shivered then announced all evil is the result of metaphysical error in a raspy little voice and started along the street to the right it was a very strange street it was almost empty of humanity in taglios that was something seldom seen a moment later the shadar sergeant squealed in surprise and pain he began slapping his side whats the matter another grey asked something bit me he squealed again which indicated that he was in a great deal of agony for shadar were proud of their ability to endure pain without outcry or even flinching two of the sergeants men tried to lift his shirt while a third clung to his arm in an effort to keep him immobile he shrieked again smoke began to boil out of his side the greys were so startled they backed away the sergeant went down he went into convulsions smoke continued to boil up it assumed a form none of the greys wanted to see niassi the demon niassi began to whisper secrets no shadar wanted to hear grinning to himself goblin slipped into chor bagan he disappeared long before anyone wondered if there might not be a connection between the sergeants discomfort and the veyedeen dervish greys arrived from all directions officers barked and cursed and drove them back to their stations before the denizens of chor bagan seized the opportunity to escape obviously this was a distraction meant to give their prey the chance to run a crowd had begun to gather too among them was a nyueng bao boy who picked his moment cut a purse and fled past the greys one of whom recalled him from the evening when one of their own got stoned discipline began to collapse the grey officers tried and managed rather well considering only a few people escaped chor bagan and a halfdozen slipped inside among them a skinny little old man in the allenveloping yellow of a leper oneeye was not pleased he was sure strategy had had nothing to do with it being him who had to assume the yellow goblin was up to something wicked the six raiders approached the target tenement from front and rear in loose teams of three oneeye was around front people cleared off fast when they saw the yellow lepers were held in absolute terror none of the men wanted to carry out a raid in broad daylight it was not the company way but darkness was denied us till soulcatcher pulled her shadows back off the streets and the consensus of the annalists and wizards was that it was less likely that the daughter of night could summon kinas help during daylight daytime also offered a better chance of taking her by surprise each team paused to make sure every man still wore his yarn bracelet before they stormed into the tenement each wizard set loose an array of previously prepared lowgrade confusion spells that buzzed through the ramshackle structure like a swarm of drunken mosquitoes the attackers passed inside stepping over and around frightened shivering families who till now had considered themselves wildly fortunate to have a roof over their heads even if that meant renting floor space in a hallway both teams posted a man who would make sure no one went outside another two men met at the foot of the rickety stair they would prevent movement up or down goblin and oneeye met at the cellar entrance and shared a few complaints about being desperately undermanned then a few exaggerated courtesies as each offered the other the opportunity to go down into the enemys den first goblin finally accepted on the basis of superior youth quickness and alleged intelligence he launched a couple of luminary floating stars into the pit where the darkness was blacker than kinas heart here goblin said ha weve got something like a flaming tiger burst out of nowhere it leaped at goblin a shadow drifted in from the side it flicked something long and thin that looped around the little wizards neck oneeyes cane came down on narayans wrist hard enough to crack bone the living saint of the stranglers lost his rumel which flew across the cellar oneeyes off hand tossed something over goblins head toward the source of the tiger a ghostly light floated up like a wisp of luminescent swamp gas it moved suddenly enveloping a young woman she began to slap at herself trying to wipe it off goblin did something quick while she was distracted she collapsed goddamn goddamn it worked im a genius admit it im a fucking genius whos a genius who came up with the plan plan what plan success is in the details runt who came up with the details any damned fool couldve said lets go catch them two both men tied limbs as they nattered oneeye said plan the details on this we got to get out of here with these people through all the greys in the world already covered theyve got so much trouble they wont have time to worry about any damned lepers he started trying to get a yellow outfit over the head of the daughter of night remind me to warn them back at the shop that this one can put together an illusion or two i know thats the way its supposed to go oneeye began dragging narayan singh into another yellow outfit in a moment goblin would trade his brown for yellow too upstairs the four company brothers all of shadar origin were turning themselves into greys im saying it aint got a prayer of working that because i planned it absolutely youre beginning to catch on welcome to reality it goes to shit in our hands you can blame it on sleepy not me it was her idea we got to do something about that girl she thinks too damned much will you quit farting around them goddamn greys out there are going to have time to go home for lunch dont hit him so hard you want him to walk out of here under his own power you talking to me what the hell you doing with get your hand out of there you old pervert im putting a control amulet over her heart you driedup old turd so she wont embarrass us before we get her home oh yeah sure you are but why dont i look on the bright side at least youre interested in girls again she built as nice as her mother better watch your mouth the place might be haunted and i got a suspicion maybe some of those ghosts can talk to each other no matter what murgen claims oneeye began to bully the groggy narayan singh up the steps i do believe this is going to work oneeye crowed the combination of greys and lepers seemed the perfect device for exiting the thieves garden particularly now that the real greys were running around distracted i dont want to break your heart oldtimer goblin said but i think we done been fished he was looking over his shoulder oneeye looked back shit a small flying carpet dropped toward them accompanied by crows making no sounds at all soulcatcher and her very stance suggested mischievous glee she threw something spread out goblin barked dont let those two get away he faced the descending carpet heart in this throat if it came to a direct faceoff he was going to get splattered like a stomped egg he extended a gloved hand caught the falling black globule whipped his arm in a circle and launched the missile back into the sky soulcatcher shrieked outraged the people of taglios did not have that kind of nerve she drove the carpet to one side avoiding the black globe and well she moved when she did her luck had served her yet again a screaming fireball ripped right through the space she had vacated the same kind of fireball that had eaten all those holes in the palace wall and had set the bodies of so many men burning like bad fat candles she continued to dive two more fireballs barely missed her she put a tenement between herself and the sharpshooters she was extremely angry but did not let rage cloud her thinking above her her crows began bursting like soundless fireworks blood flesh and feathers rained down in seconds she figured it out conversing with herself in a committee of voices they had not been hiding inside chor bagan after all she could not have caught anyone trying to slip away like this if they had not come in to retrieve something they did not want found theyre here in the city but we havent found them we havent seen a trace or heard a rumor that they didnt want to reach our ears until now that takes wizardry that bold little one that was the toad man goblin though the great general of the armies mogaba assures us that he saw the body himself who else is alive could the great general himself be less trustworthy than he would like us to believe that was not possible mogaba had no other friends he was committed in perpetuity soulcatcher brought her carpet to earth stepped off folded its light bamboo frame rolled the carpet around that surveyed the street they had come down this way from up there what could they have wanted desperately enough to have exposed themselves so thoroughly anything they thought that important would be something she was bound to find very interesting herself it took just one whispered word of power to illuminate the cellar the squalor was appalling soulcatcher turned slowly a man and his daughter apparently an old man and a young woman anyway one lamp discarded clothing a few handfuls of rice some fish meal why the writing instruments and ink what was this a book somebody had just begun writing in it in an unfamiliar alphabet she caught a spot of black movement in the corner of her eye she whirled crouching fearing an attack by a rogue shadow the skildirsha maintained an especially potent hatred for those who dared command them a rat fled dropping the object of its curiosity soulcatcher knelt picked up a long strip of black silk with an antique silver coin sewn into one corner oh i see she began to laugh like a young girl catching on late to the meaning of an offcolor joke she collected the book surveyed the scene once more before leaving dedication sure doesnt pay once in the street again she reassembled her carpet unconcerned about snipers those people would be long gone and far away they knew their business but crows should be tracking them she froze staring upward but not really seeing the white crow on the peak of the tenement roof how did they find out where those two were what happened sahra demanded as soon as she came in before she began shedding minh subredils rags i was still dorabee dey banerjae myself we lost murgen somehow goblin thought they had him anchored but he went away while we were all out and i dont know how to get him back i meant what happened in the thieves garden soulcatcher was out there whatever she tried to pull didnt work out but she came back a different person i didnt get to hear everything she told the radisha but i do know she found something or figured out something that changed her whole attitude like everything suddenly stopped being fun i said oh i dont know maybe murgen can tell us if we can get him back here goblin joined us he was pushing a sleeping oneeye in banh do trangs spare wheelchair he announced theyre resting peacefully drugged narayan was distraught the girl took it pretty calmly we need to worry about her whats wrong with him i asked indicating oneeye hes worn out hes an old man i want to see you have half the energy he does when you get to be half his age sahra asked why do we need to worry about the girl because shes her mothers daughter she doesnt have much skill with it yet because she hasnt had anybody to teach her but shes got the natural ability to become a substantial sorceress maybe even as powerful as her mother but without ladys rudimentary sense of ethics it reeks off her taint the only thing she reeks of neither oneeye chirped first thing you do with that little honey you throw her in a vat of hot water then throw in a couple four lumps of lye soap and let her soak for a week sahra and i exchanged glances if she was bad enough to offend oneeye she had to be ripe indeed goblin grinned from ear to ear but eschewed temptation i said i hear you ran into the protector she was on a roof or somewhere waiting for something to happen she didnt get what she expected a couple of fireballs and she ducked and stayed ducked you made it home without being followed i knew the answer because i knew they knew the stakes they would not have come anywhere near here had they had the slightest doubt that that was safe i had to ask even knowing that if they had failed the warehouse would be buried in greys already we were ready to deal with the crows all but one oneeye grumbled what i saw a white one up there it didnt try to follow us though once again sahra and i exchanged glances sahra said im going to change and relax and get something to eat lets meet in an hour if you could find it in your heart goblin you might try to get murgen back here youre the necromancer youre the one who claimed he anchored him one hour goblin began grumbling to himself oneeye chuckled and made no offer to help he asked me you ready to kill your librarian yet i did not tell him so but i was slightly more open to the suggestion tonight surendranath santaraksita seemed to suspect that dorabee dey banerjae was something more than he pretended or maybe i was just paranoid enough to hear things santaraksita never intended to say you dont worry about master santaraksita hes being very good to me today he told me i can look at any book i want unless its in the restricted stacks woo oneeye breathed somebody finally found the way to her heart whoda thunk a book would do it name the first one after me little girl i waved a fist under his nose id knock out your last tooth and call you mushy but i was brought up to respect my elders even if theyre rambling demented and senile for all its one true god focus my religion contains a strong taint of ancestor worship every vehdna believes his forefathers can hear his prayers and can intercede with god and his saints if he feels he has been properly treated im going to follow sahras example you holler if you want to get in practice for your new boyfriend his cackle ended abruptly as gota limped around me when i glanced back oneeye appeared to be sound asleep again must have been some other old fool running his mouth during the siege of jaicur i announced that never again would i be picky about what i ate that i would respond to anything offered me with a smile of gratitude and a spoken thank you but time has a way of wearing away at such vows i was nearly as sick of rice and smoked fish as goblin and oneeye were breaking the tedium with the occasional supper of rice and fish meal did not seem to help i am confident that it is their diet that makes the nyueng bao such a humorless people i ran into sahra who had bathed and let her hair down and relaxed looking a decade younger so that it was easy to see how a decade earlier still she could have been every young mans fantasy i still have a little money i took off somebody who picked the wrong side down south i told her waving a tiny piece of fish caught between two bamboo chopsticks nyueng bao refuse to adopt innovative utensils that have been in common use amongst everyone else in this part of the world for centuries those who did the cooking in do trangs complex were all nyueng bao what sahra was completely baffled ill give it up if we can buy a pig with it vehdna are not supposed to eat pork but i made the mistake of being born female so i probably do not have a seat reserved in paradise anyway or anything else that doesnt go through the water like this i made a wiggly motion with one hand sahra did not understand food was a matter of indifference to her so long as she got some fish and rice forever were perfectly fine and she was probably right there are plenty of people out there who have to eat chhatu because they cannot afford rice and others cannot afford any food at all though soulcatcher seemed to be thinning those out now sahra started to tell me something about a rumor that another bhodi disciple was going to present himself at the entrance to the palace and demand an audience with the radisha but we were approaching the lighted area where we worked our wickednesses of evenings and she saw something there that made her stop i started to say then we need to get somebody next to him sahra growled what the hell is he doing here i saw it now uncle doj was back probably determined to invite himself into our lives again his timing seemed interesting and suspect i also found it interesting that sahra spoke taglian when she was stressed she had some definite points of contention with her own people though around the warehouse nobody used nyueng bao except mother gota who did so only to remain a pain uncle doj was a wide little man who though on the brink of seventy was mostly muscle and gristle and in recent years bad temper he carried a long slightly curved sword he called ash wand ash wand was his soul he had told me so he was some sort of priest but would not bother to explain his religion involved martial arts and holy swords though he was nobodys uncle in reality uncle was a title of respect among nyueng bao and they all seemed to consider doj a man worthy of the greatest respect uncle doj has meandered in and out of our lives since the siege of jaicur always more distraction than contribution he could be underfoot for years at a stretch then would disappear for weeks or months or years this latest time he had been out of the way for more than a year when he did turn up he never bothered reporting what he had been doing or where he had been but judging from murgens observations and my own he was still searching for his key diligently curious him materializing so suddenly after my epiphany i asked sahra did your mother happen to leave the warehouse today that question occurred to me too it might be worth pursuit very little warmth existed between mother and daughter murgen was not the cause but absolutely had become the symbol uncle doj was supposed to be a minor wizard i never saw any evidence to support that other than his uncanny skill with ash wand he was old and his joints were getting stiff his reflexes were fading but i could not think of anyone who would remotely be his match nor have i ever heard of anyone else dedicating his life to a piece of steel the way he has maybe i did have evidence of his being a wizard i reflected he never had any trouble getting through the mazes goblin and oneeye had created to save us the embarrassment of unexpected walkins those two ought to tie him down till he explained how he did that i asked sahra how do you want to handle this her voice was edged with flint far as im concerned we can lump him right in there with singh and the daughter of night the enemy of my enemy is my enemy huh i never liked doj much by nyueng bao standards hes a great and honorable man a hero due great respect and hes the embodiment of everything i find distasteful about my people secretive huh she betrayed a hint of a smile in that she was as guilty as any other nyueng bao thats in the blood tobo noticed us watching and talking he darted over he was excited enough to forget he was a surly young man mom uncle doj is here so i see he say what he wants this time i touched her arm gently cautioning her no need to start butting heads doj of course was aware of our presence i never saw a man so intensely aware of his environment he might have heard every word we whispered too i put no store in the chance that time had weathered his sense of hearing he gobbled rice and paid us no heed i told sahra go say hello i need a second to put my face on i ought to send for the greys have them raid the place im too tired for this she did not bother to keep her voice down mom i held dojs eye my face was cold my voice held no emotion whatsoever as i asked what is the key bound gagged narayan singh and daughter of night watched and waited their turn the faintest flicker of surprise stirred in dojs eyes i was not the sort he expected to be a questioner i was in character again a borrowed one based on a gang enforcer who had offended us a few years ago vajra the naga the gang was out of business and vajra the naga had gone on to a better world but his legacy occasionally proved useful doj enjoyed the reasonable expectation that he would not be tortured i had no intention of taking it that far with him the companys fortunes and those of the nyueng bao had become so intermingled that i could not brutalize doj without alienating our most useful allies doj volunteered nothing nor did i expect him to be any more vocal than a stone i told him we need to open the way onto the glittering plain we know you dont have the key we do know where to start looking for it well be pleased to return it to you once we release our brothers i paused giving him time to surprise me by replying he did not you are perhaps philosophically opposed to opening the way were going to disappoint you on that the way will open somehow you have only the option of participating or not participating dojs eyes shifted just for an instant he wanted to read sahras stance hers was plain she had a husband trapped under the glittering plain the wishes of the lone priest of some obscure neverexplained cult carried no weight with her not even banh do trang or ky gota offered demonstrative support though both would favor him mainly out of decades of inertia if you dont cooperate then we wont return the key when were done with it and we will determine what constitutes cooperation the first step is to put an end to all of the normal nyueng bao equivocation and evasion and selective deafness vajra the naga was not a character i liked to adopt too often a naga was a mythical serpent being that lived beneath the earth and had no sympathy whatever for anything human the trouble with the character was that i could slip into it like it had been tailored for me it would take only a small emotional distortion to turn me into vajra the naga you have something we want a book i was betting a lot on my having reasoned out or intuited the course of various hidden events based upon what i had gotten from murgen and his annals its about sobyso and this thick bound in tan vellum the writing inside is in an untrained hand in a language no one has spoken for seven centuries specifically it is a nearly complete copy of the first volume of the books of the dead the lost sacred texts of the children of kina chances are you didnt know that narayan and even the daughter of night reacted to that i continued the book was stolen from the fortress overlook by the sorcerer called the howler he concealed it because he didnt want soulcatcher to get it nor did he want the child to have it you either saw him hide it or stumbled onto it soon after he did you concealed it somewhere you feel is safe ignoring the fact that nothing can remain hidden forever some eyes will discover anything eventually once again i allowed doj time for remarks he chose to pass on the opportunity you have a choice in all this i remind you though that youre getting old that your chosen successor is buried under the plain with my brothers and that you have no allies more favorable than gota whose enthusiasm has to be suspect at this late date you may choose to say nothing ever in which case truth will follow you into the darkness but the key will remain here in other hands have you had enough to eat has do trang been a good host will somebody help our guest find something to drink we shouldnt be scorned for our failures of hospitality you didnt get a word out of him oneeye complained as soon as doj was out of earshot i didnt expect to i just wanted him to have something to think about lets talk to these two scoot singh over here take the gag off and turn him so he cant get cues from the girl she was spooky even bound and gagged she radiated a disturbingly potent presence put her in the company of people already prepared to believe that she was touched by the dark divine and it was easy to understand why the deceiver cult was making a comeback interesting though that that was a recent phenomenon that for a decade she and narayan had been fugitives painstakingly taking control of the few surviving deceivers and evading the protectors agents and now just as we feel we are up to tugging a few beards they began making their survival known too i had no trouble seeing where the gunni imagination would find connections and portents and wild harbingers of the year of the skulls narayan singh i said in my vajra the naga voice youre a stubborn old man you should have been dead long ago perhaps kina does favor you which would suggest that here in my hands is where the goddess wants you to be we vehdna are good at blaming everything on god nothing can happen that is not the will of god therefore he has already measured the depth of the brown stuff and has decided to toss you in and these are bloody hands make no mistake singh looked at me he did not fear much he did not recognize me if our paths had crossed before i had been too minor an annoyance for him to recall the daughter of night remembered me though she was thinking that i was a mistake she would not be making again i was thinking maybe she was a mistake we ought not to make however useful a tool she might become she almost scared vajra the naga who had been too dense to comprehend fear in personal terms youre troubled by events but arent afraid you rely upon your goddess good let me provide assurances we wont harm you assuming you cooperate however much we owe you he did not believe a word of that and i did not blame him that was the usual sort of hold out a feather of hope a torturer used to leverage cooperation from the doomed in this case the pain will all be directed elsewhere he tried to turn to look at the girl not just there narayan singh not only there though thats where well start narayan you have something we want we have several things we believe to be of value to you im prepared to make an exchange sworn in the names of all our gods narayan had nothing to say yet but i began to sense that his ears might be open to the right words the daughter of night sensed that too she squirmed she tried to make some kind of noise she was going to be as stubborn and crazy as her mother and aunt must be the blood narayan singh in another life you were a vegetable seller in the town called gondowar every other summer you would go off to lead your company of tooga singh looked uncomfortable and puzzled this was nothing he expected you had a wife yashodara whom you called lily in private you had a daughter khaditya which was maybe just a little too clever a naming you had three sons valmiki sugriva and aridatha aridatha youve never seen because he wasnt born until after the shadowmasters carried the able men of gondowar off into captivity narayan looked more uncomfortable and troubled than ever his life before the coming of the shadowmasters was a lost episode since his unexpected salvation he had dedicated himself solely to his goddess and her daughter those times were so unsettled that you have since proceeded on the reasonable assumption that nothing of your former life survived the coming of the shadowmasters but that assumption is a false one narayan singh yashodara bore you that third son aridatha and lived to see him become a grown man though she endured great poverty and despair your lily survived until just two years ago in fact until just after we located her i still did not know for certain if some of my brothers had not grown overly zealous in their eagerness to locate narayan of your sons aridatha and sugriva still live as does your daughter khaditya though she has used the name amba since she learned to her horror that her very father was the narayan singh of such widespread infamy by stealing ladys baby narayan had ensured that his name would live on amongst those of the great villains everyone over a certain age knew the name and a score of evil stories burdening it the majority of them fabrications or accretions of stories formerly attached to some other human demon whose ignominy had been nibbled up by time i had his attention despite his determination to remain indifferent family is critically important to all but a handful of us sugriva continues in the produce business although his desire to escape your reputation led him first to move to ayodahk then to jaicur when the protector decided she wanted the city repopulated he felt everyone would be strangers there and he could create a more favorable past for himself both captives noted my unfortunate use of jaicur which did not give them anything they could use but which did tell them i was not taglian no taglian would call that city anything but dejagore i continued aridatha grew into a fine young man wellformed and beautiful hes a soldier now a senior noncommissioned officer in one of the city battalions his rise has been rapid he has been noticed theres a good chance hell be chosen to become one of the career commissioned officers the great general had been imposing on the army i fell silent no one else spoke some were hearing this for the first time though sahra and i had started looking for those people a long time ago i got up and went out got myself a large cup of tea i cannot abide the nyueng bao teamaking ceremonies i am of course a barbarian in their eyes i do not like the tiny little cups they use either when i have some tea i want to get serious about it make it strong and bitter and toss in a glob of honey i seated myself in front of narayan again no one had spoken in my absence so living saint of the stranglers have you truly put aside all the chains of the earth would you like to see your khaditya again she was little when you left would you like to see your grandchildren there are five of them i can say the word and inside a week we can have one of them here i sipped tea looked singh in the eye and let his imagination toy with the possibilities but you are going to be all right narayan im going to see to that personally i showed him my vajra the naga smile will somebody show these two to their guest rooms that all youre going to do goblin asked once they were gone im going to let singh think about the life he never lived ill let him think about losing whats left of that and about losing his messiah when he can avoid all those tragedies just by telling us where to find the souvenir he carried away from soulcatchers hideout down by kiaulune he wont take a deep breath without getting permission from the girl well see how he handles having to make his own decisions if he stalls too long and we get pressed you can put a glamour on me thatll make him think im her what about her oneeye asked you going to personally work on her too yes starting right now put some of those choke spells on her one on each wrist and ankle and double them up around her neck we had done some herding amongst other things over the years and oneeye and goblin being incredibly lazy had developed choke spells that constricted tighter and tighter as an animal moved farther away from a selected marker point shes a resourceful woman with a goddess on her side id prefer to kill her and be done with it but we wont get any help from singh if we do if she does manage to escape i want complete success to be fatal i want near success to render her unconscious from lack of air i dont want her having regular contact with any of our people remember what her aunt soulcatcher did to willow swan tobo has swan said anything that might interest us he just plays cards sleepy he does talk all the time but he never says anything kind of like uncle oneeye whisper you put him up to that didnt you frogface sounds like swan to me i said i shut my eyes began massaging my brow between thumb and forefinger trying to make vajra the naga go away his reptilian lack of connection was seductive im so tired then why the hell dont we all just retire oneeye croaked for a whole goddamned generation it was the captain and his next year in khatovar shit that beat us into the ground now its you two women and your holy crusade to resurrect the captured find yourself a guy little girl spend a year screwing his brains out were not going to get those people out of there accept that start believing that theyre dead he sounded exactly like the traitor in my soul that whispered in my mind every night before i fell asleep the part about accepting that the captured were never going to be coming back anyway i asked sahra can we call up our favorite dead man oneeye ask him what he thinks of our plan bah frogface you deal with this i need a little medicinal pickmeup almost smiling despite her aching joints gota waddled out behind oneeye we would not see those two for a while if we were lucky oneeye would get drunk fast and pass out if we were not he would come staggering out looking to feud with goblin and we would have to restrain him that could turn into an adventure well heres our prodigal sahra finally had murgen back in the mist box i told him tell me about the white crow puzzled i go there sometimes its not voluntary we took narayan singh and the daughter of night out of chor bagan today there was a white crow there you werent here i wasnt there more puzzled even troubled i dont remember being there i think soulcatcher noticed it and she knows her crows murgen continued i wasnt there but i remember things that happened this cant be happening to me again just calm down tell us what you know murgen proceeded to report everything soulcatcher said and did after she ducked our snipers he would not tell us how he knew i do not think he could sahra said she does know that we have singh and the girl but did she guess why the company has an old grudge with those two shell need to see bodies to be convinced there was nothing more to it than that shes still not completely satisfied that swan is dead a very suspicious woman the protector a narayan corpse would be easy if we could make it credible therere a million skinny filthy little old men with green teeth out there but wed sure come up short on beautiful twentyyearold women with blue eyes and skin paler than ivory the greys will definitely become more active now sahra said whatever she suspects or doesnt the protector wants no one going about any tricky business in her city a point the radisha might argue which reminds me of something thats been knocking around the back of my head listen to this and tell me what you think as the bhodi disciples made their way through the crowds more than one onlooker reached out to slap their backs the disciples took that with poor grace it told them that many of the witnesses were there to be entertained the rite proceeded as before but more quickly as it was evident that the greys anticipated trouble and had instructions to head it off the kneeling priest in orange burst into flames just as the greys began manhandling his assistants out of the way a gout of smoke leaped upward a black company skull formed inside it an evil eye seeming to stare deep into the souls of all the witnesses a voice filled the morning all their days are numbered and the wooden curtainwall shielding the reconstruction came to life glowing lime characters as tall as a man proclaimed water sleeps and my brother unforgiven they crawled slowly back and forth soulcatcher herself materialized on the ramparts overhead her rage was palpable a second and larger cloud of smoke burst off the burning disciple a face the best representation of the captains that oneeye and goblin could manage told the awed and silent thousands rajadharma the duty of kings know you kingship is a trust the king is the most exalted and conscientious servant of the people i began to slide away from there this was sure to sting the protector into some impulsive and selfdefeating response or maybe not she did nothing obvious though a sudden breeze came along it blew the smoke away but it fanned the flames consuming the bhodi disciple the smell of burning flesh spread out downwind when master santaraksita wanted to know why i was late i told the truth another bhodi disciple set himself on fire in front of the palace i went to watch i couldnt help myself there was sorcery involved i described what i had seen as so many of the actual eyewitnesses also had santaraksita seemed both repelled and intrigued why do you suppose those disciples are doing that dorabee i knew why they were doing it it took no genius to fathom their motives only their determination remained a puzzle theyre trying to tell the radisha that shes not fulfilling her obligations to the taglian people they consider the situation so desperate that theyve chosen to send their message by a means that cant be ignored i too believe that to be the case the question remains what can the radisha do the protector wont go away just because some people believe shes bad for taglios i have a great deal to do today sri and im starting late go go i must assemble the bhadrhalok its possible we can present the radisha with some means of shaking the protectors grip good luck sri he would need it only the most outrageous good luck since the beginning of time was going to give him and his cronies the tools to undo soulcatcher chances were good the bhadrhalok had no idea how dangerous an opponent they had chosen i dusted and mopped and checked the rodent traps and after a while noticed that most everyone had gone away i asked old baladitya the copyist where everyone was he told me that the other copyists had ducked out as soon as the senior librarians had gone off to their bhadrhalok meeting they knew that the bhadrhalok would do nothing but it would take them hours of grumbling and talking and arguing to get it done so they made themselves a holiday it was not an opportunity to be refused i began examining books even going so far as to penetrate the restricted stacks baladitya knew nothing he could not see three feet in front of his face jaul barundandi partnered minh subredil with a young woman named rahini and sent them to work in the radishas own quarters under the direction of a woman named narita a fat ugly creature possessed by an inflated conception of her own importance narita complained to barundandi i need six more women im supposed to clean the council chamber again after i complete the royal suite then i suggest you pick up a broom yourself ill be back in a few hours i expect to see progress ive given you the best workers available barundandi went elsewhere to be unpleasant to someone else the fat woman took it out on subredil and rahini subredil did not know who narita was the woman had not worked in the royal chambers before as subredil steered a mop around she whispered who is this woman who is so bitter she stroked her ghanghesha rahini glanced right and left but did not raise her eyes you must understand her she is barundandis wife you two you arent being paid to gossip pardon maam sahra said i didnt understand what to do and didnt want to trouble you the fat woman scowled for a moment but then turned her displeasure in another direction rahini smiled softly whispered shes in a good mood today as the hours passed and her knees and hands and muscles began to ache sahra realized that she and rahini had been delivered to barundandis wife more for who they were than for the work they could do they were not bright and they were not among the more attractive workers barundandi wanted narita to believe that these were the kind of women he always employed elsewhere no doubt he and his chief assistants would take full advantage of their bit of power over the unfortunate and the desperate it was not a good day for exploring there was more work than three women could possibly complete sahra got no chance to collect additional pages from the hidden annals then not many hours after the day started conditions within the palace became much less relaxed the high and the mighty began to show themselves moving rapidly here and there rumor came apparently passing right through stone walls another bhodi disciple had burned himself to death outside and the radisha was completely distraught narita herself confided shes very frightened many things are happening over which she has no control she has gone to the anger chamber she does so almost every day now the anger chamber sahra murmured she had not heard of this before but till recently she never worked this close to the heart of the palace what is that maam a room set aside where she can tear her hair and clothing and rage and weep without having her emotions poison surroundings used for other purposes she wont come out until she can face the world in complete calm subredil understood it was a gunni thing only gunni would come up with an idea like that gunni religion personified everything it had a god or goddess or demon a deva or rakshasa or yaksha or whatever for everything usually with several aspects and avatars and differing names none of whom were seen much nowadays but who had been very busy way back when only an extremely wealthy gunni would come up with a conceit like an anger chamber a gunni cursed with a thousand rooms she did not know how to use later in the day subredil contrived to be allowed to service the freshly evacuated anger chamber it was small and contained nothing but a mat on a polished wooden floor and a small shrine to ancestors the smoke was thick and the smell of incense was overpowering a good thing i didnt have any pages on me too sahra told me the greys started searching us going out that woman vancha tried to steal a little silver oil lamp shell spend all morning tomorrow being punished by jaul barundandi does barundandis boss know what he does i dont think so why we could trick him into betraying himself get him tossed out no barundandi is the devil we know an honest man would be harder to manipulate i loathe the man thats because hes loathsome not unlike other men in similar positions of petty power but were not here to reform taglios sleepy were here to find out how to release the captured and to torment our enemies when doing that doesnt jeopardize our primary mission and we did a great job of that today the radisha was crushed by our messages sahra told me what she had discovered then i told her about my own small triumph i got into the restricted stacks today and i found what i think might be the original of one of the annals weve got hidden in the palace its in terrible shape but its all there and its still readable and there may be more volumes i only got through part of the restricted stack before i had to go help baladitya find his slippers so his grandson could lead him home i had the book right there on the table i patted it proudly sahra asked wont it be missed i hope not i replaced it with one of the moldy discards ive been saving sahra squeezed my hand good good things have gone well lately tobo would you find goblin i have an idea to run past him i said ill see how our guests are doing somebody might be ready to whisper confidences in my ear but only swan wanted my ear and he did not have confidences in mind in his way he was as incorrigible as oneeye yet he had a style that did not offend me i do not think swan had an evil bone in him like so many people he was a victim of circumstance struggling to keep his head up in the turbulence of the river of events uncle doj was displeased with his circumstances even though he was not a prisoner we can certainly get along without that book i told him i doubt that i could read it anyway mostly i want to make sure it doesnt get back to the deceivers what we really need is your knowledge doj was a stubborn old man he was not yet ready to make deals or to look for allies before i left i asked will it all die with you will you be the last nyueng bao to follow the path thai dei cant if hes buried under the glittering plain i winked i understood doj better than he thought his problem was not a conflict with his morality it was a matter of control he wanted to do everything his way no strings he would come around if i kept reminding him of his mortality and his lack of a son or an apprentice nyueng bao are famous for their stubbornness but even they will not sacrifice all their hopes and dreams rather than adjust i visited narayan just long enough to offer a reminder that our interest did not lie in harming him but the only reason we had for keeping the daughter of night healthy was our hope of his cooperation you can be stubborn for a while yet we have several tasks to wrap up before you become our main interest and we concentrate on murdering your dreams that was my whole focus with each of our prisoners make them put their hopes and dreams on the line maybe i could weasel my way into history as famous or infamous as soulcatcher and widowmaker as stormshadow and longshadow remembered forever as the dreamkiller i had a vision of myself drifting through the night like murgen disembodied but dragging along a bottomless bag of black night into which i stuffed all the dreams i stole from restless sleepers i was a real oldtime rakshasa there the daughter of night did not look up when i went to view her she was in a cage banh do trang used for keeping large animals of the deadliest sort sometimes leopards but mostly tigers a fully grown male tiger was worth a fortune in the apothecary market she was shackled as well the cats never were in addition i believe a little opium and nightshade were used to season her food nobody wanted to underestimate her potential her family had a dire history and she had a goddess on her shoulder reason told me to kill her right now before kina wakened as much as she could that would buy me the rest of my lifetime free of the end of the world it would take the dark goddess generations to create another daughter of night reason also told me that if the girl died the captured would spend the rest of time in those caverns under the glittering plain reason told me after a moment watching her that she was not just ignoring me she did not know i was there her mind was elsewhere which was not a comfortable feeling at all if kina could turn her loose the way murgen was loose master santaraksita paused to tell me it was good of you to care for baladitya yesterday dorabee i had forgotten him in my eagerness to assemble the bhadrhalok but you should be careful or his grandson will begin expecting you to walk the old man home for him he tried it with me i did not look into his eyes though i did want to see what was there there was a tightness in his voice that told me he had something on his mind but i had taken too many liberties with dorabee already he would not stare into the eyes of the priestly caste i but did the right thing master are we not taught to respect and aid our elders if we do not when we are young who will respect and aid us when we ourselves become frail indeed nevertheless you continue to amaze and intrigue me dorabee uncomfortable i tried to change the subject by inquiring was the meeting of the bhadrhalok productive master santaraksita frowned then smiled youre very subtle dorabee no of course not were the bhadrhalok we talk we dont act for a moment he mocked his own kind well still be debating what form our resistance should take when the protector perishes of old age is it true what they say master that shes four hundred years old yet fresh as a bride i did not need to know i just needed conversation to nurture santaraksitas surprising interest in me that seems to be the common belief handed down from the northern mercenaries and those travelers the radisha adopted she must be a great sorceress indeed then do i detect a note of jealousy would we all not like to live forever he looked at me oddly but we shall dorabee this life is only a stage wrong thing to say dorabee dey i meant in this world i find myself largely content to remain dorabee dey banerjae santaraksita frowned slightly but let it go how are your studies coming wonderfully master im especially fond of the historical texts im discovering so many interesting facts excellent excellent if theres anything i can do to help i asked is there a written nyueng bao language or was there ever that took him from the blind side nyueng bao i dont know why in the world would you something ive seen a few times near where i live nobody knows what it means the nyueng bao down there wont talk but i never heard of them being literate he rested a hand on my shoulder for a moment ill find out for you his fingers seemed to be trembling he murmured something unintelligible and hurried away word was in that the bhodi disciples were not happy with us for stealing their thunder at the palace gate i wondered what they would think when the news arrived about our behavior at semchi that seemed to be coming together perfectly for us unless soulcatcher was thinking farther ahead than we could detect murgen had slinks party well on the way to the village and moving faster than the group the protector had sent to destroy the bhodi tree that group outnumbered our brothers but did not expect any resistance in a few days it would turn really nasty down there as the weather had here storm season had arrived i had been delayed coming home by a ferocious thunderstorm that flooded some streets and sent down hail an inch in diameter the kangali and other children went out and tried to gather up the ice barking in pain every time a hailstone found unprotected skin for a short while the air was almost tolerably cool but then the storm moved on and the heat returned worse than it had been before the stench of the city welled up one storm was not enough to sluice it clean only to turn everything over in a few days the insects would be more miserable than ever before i hugged my burden and told myself i would not have to stay in this cesspool much longer one more to locate and ill have everything i need from the library my new acquisition lay open for public viewing of course no one could read it not even me but i was confident that i now possessed another original of the three missing annals perhaps the very first since it was so alien the other seemed to be inscribed in the same alphabet much modified and somewhat like that used in the discarded volume i had rescued if the language was the same i would be able to figure it out eventually oneeye cackled yeah everything but somebody to translate that stuff for you everything but your new boyfriend he insisted that master santaraksita was out to seduce me and that santaraksita would be brokenhearted if he succeeded and discovered that i was female thats enough of that you filthy old thing sacrifice for the cause little girl he started to offer some graphic advice he had been drinking again or was drinking still sahra arrived she tossed a large bundle of pages my way can it oneeye find goblin theres work to do of me she demanded why do you put up with that hes harmless and hes for sure too darned old to change and if hes nagging me hes not getting into something thats going to get us all killed so youre sacrificing for the cause something like that that was quick goblin had arrived what happened to oneeye taking a leak what do i have to do now sahra said i can get into the anger chamber the rest is up to you you do this and youll never be able to get back into the palace you know that dont you whatre we talking about i asked sahra said i think we can kidnap the radisha with a little luck and a lot of help from goblin and oneeye goblins right you do that wed all better be a hundred miles away by the time the word gets out i have a better idea if we have to give away the fact that we can get inside the palace do it by sabotaging soulcatcher get to one of her carpets rig it to come apart under her when shes two hundred feet up and moving fast i like the way you think sleepy put that on the list sahra i want to be there itd be like the time the howler flew into the side of the tower at charm man he mustve been going at least three times as fast as a horse could run when he hit that wall blauw hair teeth and eyeballs all over the he walked away from that you idiot oneeye was back hes out there under the plain with our guys right now a unique odor suggested that oneeye had taken a moment out to award himself some medicinal refreshment stop it now sahra was cranky tonight our next step will be to neutralize chandra gokhale weve already decided that these other things we can worry about down the road i observed well need to freshen up our evacuation drill in case we need to get out of taglios in a hurry the more active we get the more likely it becomes that something will go wrong if it does well have soulcatcher breathing down our necks goblin observed she isnt stupid shes just lazy i asked sahra did she call in her shadows yet i dont know i didnt hear anything goblin grumbled what we really need is a formula for doing without sleep for about a year let me see minh subredils ghanghesha sahra sent tobo to fetch the statue the boy could be much less unpleasant when he was in a group silence struck as banh do trang rolled in pushed by one of his own people he smiled at a private joke he enjoyed startling us one of my men tells me that we have a couple of outsiders caught in the confusion net they appear to be harmless an old man and a mute somebody will have to get them out and send them on their way without making them suspicious that news gave me a little chill but i did not suspect the truth till poor overworked tobo and goblin the latter going along but staying out of sight while the boy led the intruders to safety returned and goblin reported i think your boyfriend followed you home sleepy what there was this terrified old man who tried to impress tobo with the fact that he was a librarian a lot of taglians would have been impressed the ability to read was almost a sorcery in itself he called his sidekick adoo you told us oneeye began to howl the little girls a regular heartbreaker damn id give anything to be there when that oid fool slides his hand into her pants and dont find what hes looking for i was embarrassed i do not think i have been embarrassed about anything since the first time my uncle rafi slipped his hand under my sari and did find what he was after that darned fool santaraksita why did he have to go complicating things like this thats enough of that sahra snapped theres supposed to be a meeting of the privy council tomorrow i think we can use it to get to gokhale but ill need to take sawa and shikhandini why i asked i had no desire to go back inside the palace ever again thats great oneeye enthused you dont show at the library tomorrow that old goat is gonna pine and whine and wonder what happened if its all his fault even though he knows theres no way you could know he tried to follow you home youll have your hook set little girl all you have to do is pull him in sahra snapped i said wait a minute he may have a point suppose i do play santaraksitas game to the point where i get him to do my translations for me we could even add him to our collection i dont think he has much family why dont we take a closer look see how long it might be before people wondered why he was missing oh youre wicked little girl oneeye said youre really wicked you could find out someday you keep riding me about gokhale sahra asked all right why are we taking me and tobo both tobo to put an idea into his head so he gets an itch hes going to have to go scratch you to cover us just in case ill have tobo carry his flute tobos flute was a small version of the fireprojecting bamboo he can turn it over to you once were inside tobo had carried that flute every time he had accompanied his mother into the palace we try to think ahead also i want to keep you fresh in jaul barundandis mind ill definitely have to have you along when i snatch the radisha goblin what can you do with my ghanghesha no one else on earth would have dared hand the little wizard a straight line like that but sahra was sahra she did not have to pay the price i started to leave i had other things to do tobo asked is it all right if i show your annals to murgen he wants to read them you two starting to get along now i think so good you can let him see them tell him not to be too critical if he is i wont come out there and dig him up narayan seemed thoroughly puzzled by my continued interest i do not believe he remembered me at all but he now knew that i was female and had been the young man sleepy that he had encountered only rarely ages ago youve had time to reflect have you decided to help us yet he looked at me with pure venom yet without obvious personal hatred i was just a particularly unpleasant obstacle delaying the inevitable triumph of his goddess he had gotten his mind back into a rut all right ill see you again tomorrow night your son aridatha has a leave day coming up well bring him around to visit you there was a guard watching the daughter of night whatre you doing here kendo keeping an eye on go away and dont come back and spread the word nobody guards the daughter of night shes too dangerous nobody even goes near her unless sahra or i tell them to and then they dont do it alone she dont look she wouldnt would she start hiking i went to the cage how long would it take for your goddess to create all the right conditions for the birth of another like you if i decide to kill you the girls gaze rose slowly i wanted to cringe away from the power in her eyes but i held on maybe she should be getting even more opium than she was already reflect upon your value and upon my power to destroy it i felt puffed up that was the kind of thing the devas or lesser gods blathered at one another on the fringes of the epics spun by the professional storytellers she glared there was so much power in her eyes that i decided kendo ought to spend a little time in private with goblin and oneeye making sure he had not been taken in already i think that without you there never will be a year of the skulls and i know that youre still alive only because i want something from narayan who loves you like a father singh was her father for all practical purposes croaker had been denied the chance by cruel fortune or more accurately by the will of kina keep well dear i left i had a lot of reading to get done and some writing if i got the chance my days were always full and all too often they got confused i decided to do things then forgot i told others to do things then forgot that too i was beginning to look forward to the time when our successes or sufficiently spectacular failures forced us out of town i could sneak off somewhere where nobody knew me and just loaf for a few months or for the rest of my life if i wanted i had no trouble understanding why every year a few more of our brothers gave up and faded away i only hoped a little notoriety would bring them back i studied the pages sahra had brought out for me but the translation was difficult the subject matter was uninspiring and i was tired i kept losing my concentration i thought about master santaraksita i thought about going back up to the palace armed i thought about what soulcatcher would do now that she knew she did not have us trapped inside the thieves garden i thought about getting old and being alone and had a suspicion that that fear might have something to do with why some brothers remained with the company no matter what they had no other family i have no other family i will not look back i am not weak i will not relax my selfcontrol i will persevere i will triumph over myself and will conquer all adversity i fell asleep rereading my own recollections of what murgen had reported about the companys adventure on the glittering plain i dreamed about the creatures he had encountered there were they the rakshasas and nagas of myth did they have anything to do with the shadows or with the men who evidently created the shadows from hapless prisoners of war i have a bad feeling about this i told sahra as she and tobo and i started the long walk youre sure the shadows are all off the streets quit fussing sleepy youre turning into an old woman the streets are safe the only monsters out here are human we can handle those youll be safe in the palace if you just stick to your character tobo will be safe as long as he remembers that hes not really shikhandini and desperate for his mother to keep her job its in the nature of men like jaul barundandi that they do their bullying inside your head not physically theyll take no for an answer and i wont lose my job over it my work is being noticed by others especially by barundandis wife now get yourself into character tobo you too you particularly i know sleepy can do this when she concentrates on it tobo was clad as a budding young woman minh subredils daughter and i hoped we could get him back inside the warehouse unnoticed by goblin and oneeye because they would ride him mercilessly with the investment of a little artifice on his mothers part tobo made a very attractive young woman jaul barundandi thought so too minh subredil was the first worker called forward and barundandi never bothered with his customary grumble about taking sawa as part of the package sawa had trouble keeping a straight face later when we found barundandis wife narita waiting to pick women to work for her one glance at shiki was enough minh subredils family definitely belonged under her direct supervision minh subredil had done a good job of ingratiating herself with narita for the very good reason that narita was in charge of cleaning those parts of the palace of most immediate interest to us sawa had not worked for narita in the past subredil explained sawa to narita who seemed more patient than she had the few times i had seen her before narita said i understand therere plenty of simple things that need doing the radisha was particularly restless last night these days when she has trouble sleeping she breaks things and makes messes the woman actually sounded sympathetic but the taglian people loved their ruling family and seemed to feel that they deserved more room than the man on the street perhaps because of the burdens they bore always in the past with maximum respect for rajadharma subredil maneuvered me into a spot whence i could observe well without being noticed she and narita brought me several brass treasures that needed cleaning the ruling family had to be very fond of brass sawa cleaned tons of it but sawa could be trusted not to damage anything shiki came to me and asked will you take care of my flute for me aunt sawa i took the instrument studied it briefly pasted on an idiot grin and tooted on the thing a few times just so everybody would know it was a real flute and not imagine that it might be a small fireball thrower capable of making life both brief and painful for the first halfdozen people who got too close to a flautist in a bad temper barundandis wife asked shiki you play the flute yes maam but not very well i was quite a skilled player when i was a girl she noticed her husband peeking in for the second time this morning and began to suspect he was interested in more than just the progress of the days work subredil i dont think its wise for you to bring your daughter here and a moment later she growled ill be back in a minute i have to talk to that man i have to straighten him out the moment she stepped out minh subredil moved with startling rapidity she vanished into the radishas anger chamber i had to admire her her mind never seemed clearer than when she was in a dangerous position i suspected she actually enjoyed her role as a palace menial and the more dangerous the times the more effective she seemed despite a massive workload and naritas frequent trips away to sabotage her husbands efforts to weasel in close to shikhandini or to draft shiki into a different working group in midafternoon we left the radishas personal suite for the gloomy chambers where the privy council assembled there was a rumor that the bhodi disciples were about to send another suicidal goof to the gateway the radisha wanted to forestall that somehow we were supposed to get the place ready for a council session the bhodi rumor had had its birth in the mind of ky sahra it was supposed to be the device by which we could bring shikhandini facetoface with chandra gokhale we had almost two hours before the staffers appeared the quiet little men who wrote everything down then the purohita arrived accompanied by the ecclesiastical members of the privy council the purohita did not deign to note our existence even though shiki mistook him for gokhale and batted her eyes till subredil signed her off i could hear the excuse that would come later all old men looked alike neither arjuna drupada nor chandra gokhale considered themselves old we continued our work ignored the folk of the palace particularly the inner circle were lucky we had other things we wanted to do with our lives had we not cared about our own survival we could have slaughtered scores of them but getting rid of the purohita would not mean much in the grand scheme the senior priests would replace him with another old man just as nasty and narrow of mind before drupadas bones got cold chandra gokhale came in and he did not overlook the help sahra must have gleaned a few suggestions from willow swan about what the old pervert liked because he stopped dead staring at shikhandini like somebody had clubbed him between the eyes shiki had the role down perfectly she was a shy virgin and a flirt at the same time as though her maidenly heart had been smitten instantly god apparently fashioned men so that they would swallow that sort of bait ninetynine times out of ten barundandis timing was good he came to move us out of the meeting chamber just as the protector swooped in like some dark angry eagle gokhale watched our departure with moon eyes before we completed our evacuation he was whispering to one of his scribes jaul barundandi unfortunately had a sharp eye for some things minh subredil i believe your daughter has charmed the inspectorgeneral of the records subredil appeared surprised sir no that cant be i wont let my child stumble into the trap that destroyed my mother and condemned me to this cruel life sawa caught subredils arm apparently she had become frightened by that intense outburst but in reality she squeezed warning subredil not to say anything that barundandi might remember if chandra gokhale disappeared we might want to consider a change of plan we did not want anyone to have any reason to connect anything outside with any of us subredils outburst faded she became embarrassed and anxious to be elsewhere shiki come on i was ready to kick shikhandinis bottom myself she was being a positive slut but she did respond to her mothers command sawa sort of settled down out of the way with the last of her dirty brass in hopes of being overlooked while the privy council convened but jaul barundandi was alert minh subredil bring your sisterinlaw he tried to flirt with shikhandini he got a look of disgust for his trouble minh subredil got me going then went after her daughter what did you think you were doing in there i was just having fun the man is a disgusting old pervert softly as though not meant for barundandis ears while the words really were subredil said dont ever have fun like that again men like that will do whatever they like with you and there isnt anything anybody can do about it that warning was not all acting the last thing we needed was one of the mighty dragging shikhandini into a dark corner to do a little groping that was not supposed to happen it was unthinkable supposedly and for ordinary people that was mostly true but not so at a level where men began to believe that they existed outside the usual rules narita barundandi called where have you gotten to that damned woman shes slipped off to the kitchen again or shes gone somewhere to sneak a nap i heard the radisha behind us in the meeting chamber but could not make out individual words an angry voice responded that had to be soulcatcher i wanted to be somewhere a little farther away i started moving sawa of course did things others did not always understand subredil grabbed hold and started to fuss barundandi told her take this bunch to the kitchen get something to eat if narita is there tell her i want her the moment he was out of sight i announced sawa is going to wander off sawa was not completely happy with the pages subredil kept bringing sleepy subredil could not read them worked in a rush and seemed incapable of collecting anything interesting i hoped i remembered the way even when you wear the yarn bracelet the palace is a confusing place and i had not roamed it since the days when the captain was the liberator and a great hero of the taglian people and even then i had been only an occasional visitor as soon as i began to feel unsure i got out a small piece of chalk and began to leave tiny marks in the sangel alphabet i had managed to learn a little of that language during our years in the far south but it had been a struggle i hoped anyone who discovered the marks would not recognize what they were i did find the room where the old books were hidden it was obvious that someone came there often the dust was disturbed badly which in itself would raise questions if discovered i tried to drag out the book that looked the oldest darn that thing was heavy once i got it open i found that the pages were real stubborn about tearing they were not paper at all which never has been very common i could tear them only one at a time which maybe explained why subredil just grabbed whatever came easiest she would not have time to pick and choose i worried that i had been away too long myself convinced that barundandi or his wife must have noticed that i was missing i hoped it did not occur to them to wonder why subredil was not making a scene because she had lost track of me even so i continued to tear pages until i had all i thought the three of us could carry away i hid everything in an unused room not far from the service postern uncertain how we would recover it heading out then took myself way down inside sawa almost to the point of incapacitating confusion they found me dirty and tearstained and still trying to find the way back to the meeting chamber they being some of the other day workers in moments i was reunited with subredil and shikhandini i clung to my sisterinlaw like a wood chip desperate to shed the embrace of a rushing flood jaul barundandi was not happy minh subredil i accepted this woman here for your sake out of kindness and charity but lapses of this sort are not acceptable no work got done while we were searching his voice trailed off the radisha and the protector were headed our way following a most unusual route this was backstairs country which meant nothing whatsoever to soulcatcher of course that woman had no sense of class or caste there was the protector and beneath the protector there was everyone else sawa just sort of folded up and squatted with her face in her lap subredil and shikhandini and jaul barundandi partially tried to get out of the way partially gawked shiki had not seen either woman before sawa crossed her fingers out of sight in her lap subredil whispered prayers to ghanghesha jaul barundandi shivered in terror shikhandini stared with a teens inability to feel appropriate fear the radisha paid us no heed she stamped past talking about ripping the guts out of bhodi disciples her voice contained almost no emotional conviction the protector though slowed down and considered us all intently for an instant i found myself almost overcome by the dread that she really could read minds then she went on and jaul barundandi ran along behind forgetting us and narita both because the radisha barked some command back his way sawa rose and whimpered i want to go home subredil agreed that it was enough of a day neither the greys nor the royal guards were searching anyone a good thing too i carried so much paper in my small clothes i could fake a normal walk for only a few dozen yards i got through my part of the evening meeting quickly and ran off to my own little corner so i could compare my newly acquired pages with those of the book i had stolen from the library that i thought was an exact copy if not the genuine original of the true first volume of the annals of the black company i was so cheerful i am sure oneeye must have had great fun talking about me behind my back it did not occur to me to stick around to see how our temptation of chandra gokhale played out the story i got later was gokhale had a man try to follow shiki home when that man did not report back within a reasonable time on account of he ran into runmust and iqbal singh someplace he should not have been and ended up taking the long swim downriver gokhale headed for the joy house that specialized in serving him his associates and those who shared their select but hardly rare tastes in pleasure riverwalker and several other brothers picked him up when he left the palace he was accompanied by two companions who would regret their wishes to ingratiate themselves with the inspectorgeneral by joining him in an evening of indulgence murgen followed events closely too knowing that he would do so i felt at ease snuggling up with my new acquisitions it took me over an hour to conclude that what i had brought out today was indeed a later version of the first ever annal and most of another hour to realize that i would not be able to winkle out the books secrets without skilled help or a lot more time than i had chandra gokhale apparently died in that joy house likewise his two companions there were witnesses people saw them strangled then a red rumel got left behind in the killers haste to get away the greys arrived almost immediately they loaded the corpses into a cart saying the protector wanted gokhales back in the palace instantly but the greys stopped being greys moments after they left the pleasure house their course led them toward the river rather than toward the palace the extra bodies vanished into the flood a white crow dozing on a rooftop wakened when they started downhill it stretched and followed them murgen was there when soulcatcher received the news the report reached the palace in a remarkably short time and was unusually complete the greys worked hard to please their mistress the party bringing gokhale to the warehouse had not yet arrived murgen had been asked to look around the protectors quarters while he was there we knew nothing about them nobody ever went into her suite not since willow swan had gone to his reward murgen would have to be questioned about how she lived in private soulcatcher did not retreat there however she went out looking for the radisha right away the radisha knew something had happened to gokhale but she had not had detailed reports the women settled in the receiving chamber of the radishas austere suite soulcatcher told what she knew she used a very businesslike voice it was said sometimes that the protector was her most dangerous and least stable when she stopped being capricious and seemed calmest and most serious it seems the inspectorgeneral shared some habits with perhule khoji in fact im now assured that his particular weakness was common amongst the senior men of his ministry there were rumors and you did nothing chandra gokhales private amusements loathsome as i found them personally did not prevent his performing perfectly as inspectorgeneral of the records he was particularly adept at generating revenue indeed soulcatchers businesslike manner wavered momentarily murgen would report his amusement at the thought she might actually have a moral opinion he was attacked in the same manner as khoji was suggesting somebody might have a grudge against the ministry as a whole or that the deceivers pick men of his particular weakness as ceremonial targets deceivers didnt kill gokhale of that im sure this was done by the people who lured swan out and killed him if they killed him if the radisha was startled by the implication we saw no corpse note that we have no body this time either men disguised as our men were right there to haul the body away thats two members of the privy council lost in less than a week organizationally they were the most important they made the machinery work if the great general was anywhere nearby id predict that he would be their next target that gaggle of priests means nothing they do nothing they control nothing my sister proved that if theyre killed they can be replaced by other donothings within minutes nobody can replace swan or gokhale the greys are beginning to unravel already murgen made a mental note to mention that willow swan might have been less a puppet than he led the world to believe why couldnt it be the stranglers the radisha asked because those people cut the head off that particular serpent the other day she described events in the thieves garden obviously she had not bothered to share the news before it was clear that the protector considered the princess a necessary but junior partner in her enterprise in a matter of days these people whom we thought ruined forever have cut the head off one enemy and have crippled the other seriously there is a dangerous mind behind this not dangerous at all not even that lucky but a sufficiently paranoid mind will discern patterns and threats where only fortune has conspired soulcatcher was ever alert for evils as great as her own we knew they couldnt remain in the darkness forever the radisha said she corrected herself hastily i knew the captain reminded me often enough she did not need to bring up the past and her belief in mistakes she had made that devil was buried deep hundreds of miles away a much more immediate danger was right there in the room with her the protector was a mistake she had abandoned hope of living long enough to correct blind to the consequences at the time she had chosen to mount the tiger now her sole choice was to hang on for the rest of the ride soulcatcher said we have to recall the great general if we can get his troops into the city before our enemies make their next move well have the manpower to hunt them down you should send the orders immediately and once the courier is safely off we should announce that the great general is returning their special dislike for mogaba should cause them to delay their other plans till they can gather him in as well you think you know what theyll do i know what id do if i came down with the kind of sudden burning ambition that seems to have taken them over i wonder if there hasnt been some kind of coup or something exasperated the radisha demanded what will they do next ill keep that to myself for now not that i dont trust you soulcatcher probably had abiding suspicions about herself i just want to make sure ive identified enough of a pattern to begin tapping into the workings of this new mind im quite talented at that you know the radisha knew to her own despair she said nothing soulcatcher sat silently herself as though waiting for the princess to speak but the radisha had nothing to say the protector mused i wonder who it could be i knew the wizards of old neither one has the ambition or imagination or drive even though both do have the hardness the radisha made a squeak of sound the wizards the two little men the dayandnight pair they arent much of anything but lucky they survived i said theyre lucky do you recall anyone who didnt go onto the plain who looked like a potential leader i dont i thought all those people were dead as did i in most cases our great general claims to have seen most of their bodies personally but the great general identified them assuming that the two wizards had been killed first hmm here i had begun to be suspicious of him perhaps his only crime is that hes a fool can you think of anyone not inside the company i knew but there was a nyueng bao who had something to do with the standardbearers wife a priest of some sort he seemed to be totally obsessed with weapons and the martial arts i ran into him only a few times and hes never been accounted for in any reports a master of the path of the sword that would explain a lot but i killed them all when i have you noticed how people keep turning up alive when theres every reason to believe that theyre dead an actual smile tried to gnaw its way out of the radishas mouth the woman talking could be considered the mother of all those whose deaths had been celebrated prematurely theres sorcery afoot nothing should be any great surprise youre right youre absolutely right and thats a blade that can have more than one edge soulcatcher rose to leave her voice changed became cruel more than one edge a master of the path of the sword its been a long time since i visited those people they may be able to tell me something useful she stalked out of the room the radisha remained motionless for several minutes clearly troubled then she got up and went to her anger chamber she settled herself there the unseen spy went after the protector she he discovered had gone directly to the ramparts she assembled her small singlerider carpet all the while arguing with herself in a dozen querulous voices he barely listened he was too surprised and shocked there was a white crow up there it was watching the protector who remained unaware of murgens presence although historically she had been more sensitive to him than to any of the living except her sister but the bird had no trouble seeing murgen it examined him with first one eye then with the other then it winked deliberately and then it launched itself into the night when the protectors rookery took flight to accompany her on her travels but i am the white crow the disorientation was brief but as frightening as it had been years ago when first murgen had started stumbling around outside his flesh i said better get uncle doj before we go any farther with this tobo i spotted kendo cutter and runmust you guys finally back how did it go perfect just like you planned it sahra asked you have my present theyre lugging him in now hes still out cold drop him right here where i can chat with him when he comes around sahra had a wicked gleam in her eye i chuckled soulcatcher thinks were following some grand carefully orchestrated master plan exquisitely fashioned by a great strategic mastermind if she knew we were just stumbling around in the dark hoping we stay lucky until we can open the way for the captured oneeye barked you telling me you masterminds dont got a next step ready to go little girl we have several i did and im sure the next one hasnt ever occurred to soulcatcher as being within the realm of possibility im going to bring master santaraksita home for supper and give him a chance to sign up for the adventure of a lifetime hehheh i knew it uncle doj joined us he was seriously peeved about the way he had been treated lately i told him one of our friends just reported a conversation between the thousand voices and the radisha the process of reasoning is beyond my imagination but the thousand voices has decided that all her troubles recently are the fault of a master of the path of the sword who shouldve been killed a long time ago when last seen she was off to visit the folks at the vinh gao ghang temple to ask about the man you may be familiar with that temple doj lost color his sword hand trembled for an instant his right eyelid twitched he turned toward sahra sahra told him its true what can she learn there speak the tongue of the people no the master of the path of the sword accepted what he could not control you would have to say he was somewhat less than gracious about it though if you wanted to report the whole truth i said you still have a book we want and you could tell us a great deal that we could use i think he was a stubborn old man he was determined not to let me stampede him into anything i said the thousand voices has sent for mogaba she means to have the army come dig us out if i could id like to get out of taglios before she starts but we have a lot to do and a lot to find out before we can go your help would be invaluable as i keep reminding you you have people under that plain too huh what sleepy sahra said goblin see whats the matter with her im all right im fine i just had what you call an epiphany i think listen all the evidence indicates that soulcatcher thinks the captured are dead which would mean that she believes longshadow is dead we know hes not which is why were not worried right now but if she doesnt know why isnt she amazed that the world hasnt been overrun by shadows i got a lot of blank looks for my trouble even from the wizards i said look what it means is it doesnt matter if longshadow is dead or alive after all as long as he stays inside the shadowgate there isnt a doomsday sword hanging over the world certain to fall when the madman croaks somebody besides the cleverest wizards will survive the less clever wizards caught on then they brightened up dramatically not that either had ever cared much what became of the world after they staggered out of it what to do about the shadowmaster had never been a significant issue to us because there were always more immediate obstacles to overcome before he could become a major concern sahra said as much if we cant open the way theres no point in worrying about how we can keep it closed to those not in our favor i wonder how the shadowmasters did it brute force the black company was still in the far north and the lance of passion was up there with them i stared at uncle doj others began to do so too i wondered aloud could it be that the great shame of the nyueng bao isnt nearly as ancient as i thought could it be that it just goes back a couple of generations to about the time that the shadowmasters appeared practically manifesting themselves overnight uncle doj closed his eyes they stayed that way for a while when the old priest opened them again he glared at me come walking with me stone soldier chandra gokhale inspectorgeneral of the records and favorer of very young girls chose that moment to groan i told doj indulge me for a few minutes uncle i have a guest to entertain i promise not to take too long goblin knelt beside the minister patted his face gently helped gokhale to a sitting position the inspectorgeneral began to puff up for a bluster storm as his mouth opened i leaned down to whisper water sleeps gokhales head jerked around in a moment he recalled where he had seen me before goblin told him all their days are numbered buddy and it looks like some of you got a few less days than some others do gokhale recognized him too though he was supposed to be dead and when he remembered where he had seen sahra before he began to tremble sahra asked would you recall abusing minh subredil on several occasions subredil certainly remembers what i think well do to requite that is to return it fivefold the brothers will install you in a tiger cage in a moment youll be well treated otherwise and in a few days maybe well bring in the purohita to keep you company she chuckled so wickedly i felt a chill for all the rest of their days calling the heaven and the earth and the day and the night like brothers chandra gokhale and arjuna drupada part of that was some nyueng bao formula i didnt understand but i got the point and so did gokhale he would be caged all the rest of his days with the man he most loathed sahra chuckled again she made me nervous when she got like that i watched the old priest closely as we eased through the spell net surrounding the warehouse he did not have a yarn amulet his head twitched and jerked his feet kept wanting to change direction but his will hacked a way through the illusions possibly that was a result of his training on the path of the sword i recalled though that lady had insisted he was a minor wizard where are we going uncle and why are we going there we go where no nyueng bao ear will hear what i tell you old nyueng bao would label me a traitor young nyueng bao would call me a lying fool or worse and i i was generally a proponent of the latter view whenever i heard him preaching about his path to inner peace through obsessively continuous preparation for combat his philosophy had appealed only to a very few of banh do trangs employees all nyueng bao all too young to have witnessed actual warfare i understood that the path of the sword was not militaristic but others had trouble grasping that fact you want to maintain your image as an old stiffneck who wouldnt be caught dead helping a subhuman jengali fall and break her skull it was too dark to tell but i thought he smiled thats an extreme way of stating it but it approximates the facts his taglian never poor improved now that he had no other audience are you overlooking the fact that every bit of darkness out here might harbor a bat or crow or rat or even one of the protectors shadows i have nothing to fear from those things the thousand voices already knows everything im going to tell you but she might not want me to know too we walked in silence for a long time taglios seldom fails to amaze me doj cut across a wealthy section where whole families fort up in estates surrounded by guarded walls their youths were out on salara road which grew up ages ago to provide them with their diversions reason insisted that beggars ought to be plentiful where the wealth was concentrated but that was not the case the extremely poor were not allowed to offend the sight of the mighty with their presence there as everywhere odors assailed the nostrils but these scents were sandalwood cloves and perfumes after that doj led me into the dark crowded streets of a temple district we stepped aside to let a band of gunni acolytes pass the boys were bullying the people living in the streets i thought we might have trouble with them too which would have ended with them suffering a lot of pain but a brake on their misbehavior saved them from its consequences that arrived in the form of three greys the shadar do not disdain the caste system entirely but they do hold to the notion that the highest caste must include not just the priests and men qualified by birth to become priests but also certainly any men of the shadar faith and that faith which is an extremely heretical and gunniinfected bastard offshoot of my own one true faith contains a strong strain of charity toward the weak and the unfortunate the greys methodically applied their bamboo canes and invited the youths to take up any complaints with the protector the acolytes were smarter than they pretended they got the hell out of there before the greys used their whistles to invite all their friends to the caning all part of night in the city doj and i drifted onward eventually he led me to a place called the deer park which is an expanse of wilderness near the center of the city it had been created by some despot of centuries past i told doj i really dont need all this exercise i wondered if he had some goofball plan to murder me and leave the body under the trees but what would be the point doj was doj with him you never knew i feel more comfortable here he said but i never stay long there is a company of rangers charged with keeping squatters out they consider anyone not taglian and high caste a squatter this is good this log has shaped itself to my posterior the log in question tripped me i got back onto my feet and said im listening sit this will take a while leave out the begats which was a jaicuri vehdna colloquialism having to do with difficulties memorizing scripture which you have to do as a child i meant dont bother telling me whose fault it was and why theyre such bloody villains for it just tell me what happened asking a storyteller not to embellish is like asking a fish to give up water i do have to go to work tomorrow as you will you are aware are you not that the free companies of khatovar and the roving bands of stranglers who murder for the glory of kina share a common ancestry theres enough suggestion in our recent annals to allow for that interpretation i admitted caution seemed indicated my place amongst the nyueng bao would correspond roughly with yours as annalist of the black company it includes as well the role of the priest in the strangler band whose secondary obligation is to maintain a sound oral history of the band over the centuries the toog have lost their respect for education my own studies suggested that a great deal of evolution had taken place in my company during those same centuries probably a lot more than had been the case with the deceiver bands they had stayed inside one culture that had not changed a lot meanwhile the black company kept moving into stranger and stranger lands old soldiers being replaced by young foreigners who had no connection with the past and no idea that khatovar even existed doj seemed to echo my thoughts the strangler bands are pale imitations of the original free companies the black company retains the name and some of the memories but youre philosophically much farther from the original than the deceivers are your band is ignorant of its true antecedents and has been kept that way willfully mainly through the manipulations of the goddess kina but also to a lesser extent by others who didnt want your company to become what it had been in another time i waited he did not volunteer to explain doj was difficult that way he did i suppose do something that was even harder for him he told the truth about his own people nyueng bao are the almost pureblooded descendants of the people of one of the free companies one that chose not to go back but the black company is supposed to be the only one that didnt go back the annals say they tell you only what those who recorded them knew my ancestors arrived here after the black company finished laying the land to waste and moved on north already having lost sight of its divine mission deserting in its own way through ignorance of what it was supposed to be by then it was already three generations old and had made no effort to maintain the purity of its blood it had just fought the war which is the first that your annalists remember and was almost completely destroyed that seems to be the fate of the black company to be reduced to a handful then to reconstitute itself again and again losing something of its previous self each time and the fate of your company i noted that he did not mention a name no matter really no name would mean anything to me to sink ever deeper into ignorance itself i know the truth i know the secrets and the old ways but im the last unlike other companies we brought our families with us we were a late experiment we had too much to lose we deserted we went and hid in the swamps but weve kept our lineage pure almost and the pilgrimages the old people who died in jaicur hong tray and the great dark terrible secret of the nyueng bao that sahra worries about so much the nyueng bao have many dark secrets all the free companies had dark secrets we were instruments of the darkness the soldiers of darkness the bone warriors charged with opening the way for kina stone soldiers warring for the honor of being remembered for all eternity by having our names written in golden letters in glittering stone we failed because our ancestors were imperfect in their devotion in every company there were those who were too weak to bring on the year of the skulls the old people ky dam and hong tray ky dam was the last elected nyueng bao captain there was no one to take his place hong tray was a witch with the curse of foresight she was the last true priest priestess curse of foresight she never foresaw anything good i sensed that he did not want to get into that subject i recalled that hong trays final prophecy involved murgen and sahra which certainly was an offense to all rightthinking nyueng bao and was not yet a prophecy completely fulfilled probably the great sin of the nyueng bao you had that idea from sahra of course and she like all those born after the coming of the shadowmasters believes that sin is what caused the nyueng bao to flee into the swamps she believes wrongly that flight involved no sin but survival the true black sin occurred within my own lifetime his voice tightened up he had strong feelings about this i waited i was a small boy just taking my first small steps on the path of the sword when the stranger came he was a personable man of middle years his name was ashutosh yaksha in the oldest form of the language ashutosh meant something like despair of the wicked yaksha meant much the same as it does in taglian today which was good spirit people were prepared to believe he was a supernatural being because he had a white skin a very pale white skin lighter than goblin or willow swan who sometimes get some sunlight he wasnt an albino though he had normal eyes his hair wasnt quite as blond as swans is in sum he was a magical creature to most nyueng bao he spoke the language oddly but he did speak it he said he wanted to study at the vinh gao ghang temple the fame of which had reached him far away when pressed about his origins he insisted that he hailed from the land of unknown shadows beneath the stars of the noose he claimed to have come off the glittering stone not quite that was never clear there or beyond no one pressed him hard not even ky dam or hong tray though he troubled them very early we learned that ashutosh was a powerful sorcerer and in those days many of the older people still knew about the origins of the nyueng bao it was feared that he might have been sent to summon us home that proved to be untrue for a long time ashutosh seemed to be nothing but what he claimed a student who wanted to absorb whatever wisdom had accumulated at the temple of ghanghesha which had been a holy place since the nyueng bao first entered the swamp but theres a but right the man was a villain after all he was indeed in fact ashutosh was the man you knew later as shadowspinner he was there to find our key sent by his teacher and mentor whom you came to know as longshadow at a young age this man had stumbled across rumors that not all the free companies had returned to khatovar what he understood from that that nobody else realized was that each company still outside must possess a talisman capable of opening and closing the shadowgate an ambitious man could use that talisman to recruit rakshasas he could send out to do evil for him the power to kill becomes the ultimate power in the hands of a man who has no reservations about employing it so this ashutosh yaksha found the key he only assured himself that it existed he wormed his way into the confidence of the senior priests one day someone let something drop soon afterward ashutosh announced that he had received word that his teacher mentor and spiritual father maricha manthara dhumraksha impressed by his reports on the temple had chosen to come visit dhumraksha turned out to be a tall incredibly skinny man who always wore a mask apparently because his face was deformed you heard a name like maricha manthara dhumraksha and you didnt suspect something i could not see doj in the darkness but i could feel his unhappy frown he said i was a small child and the nyueng bao arent interested in anything not their own yes im vehdna uncle but i recognize the names manthara and dhumraksha as those of legendary gunni demons even though you walk amongst lesser beings you might keep your ears open that way when a nasty jengali sorcerer pulls your leg youll at least have a clue doj grunted he had a golden tongue dhumraksha did when he discovered that each decade as the custom was then a band of the leading men undertook a pilgrimage south he invited himself along and tricked somebody into letting him examine the key close but not quite yes you did guess correctly the pilgrimage went to the very shadowgate the pilgrims would spend ten days there waiting for a sign i dont believe anyone knew what that might be anymore but the traditions had to be observed the pilgrims however never took the actual key with them they carried a replica charged with a few simple spells meant to fool an inattentive thief the real key stayed home the old men didnt really want a sign from the other side longshadow got in a hurry he did when the pilgrims arrived at the shadowgate they found ashutosh yaksha and a halfdozen other sorcerers waiting several were fugitives from that northern realm of darkness where the black company was then in service when dhumraksha used the false key his band found themselves under attack from the other side of the shadowgate before the gateway could be stopped up using the power of longshadows true name three of the wouldbe shadowmasters had perished the one called the howler cruelly injured had fled the survivors quickly became the feuding conquering monsters your brothers found in place when they arrived and the same disaster caused the mother of night to reawaken and begin scheming toward a year of the skulls once more and thats the great sin of the nyueng bao letting themselves be hoodwinked by sorcerers in those days there was little contact with the world outside the swamp banh do trangs family managed all outside trade once a decade a handful of the older men traveled to the shadowgate about as frequently gunni ascetics would enter the swamp hoping to purify their souls these gunni hermits were obviously crazy or they wouldnt have come into the swamps in the first place they were always tolerated and ghanghesha found a home where does the thousand voices fit she learned the story from the howler around the time we were trapped in dejagore or soon afterward she came to the temple soon after we returned the best of us exhausted our old men all dead including our captain and speaker and witch hong tray with them there was no one but me left who knew everything though gota and thai dei knew some and sahra a little they being of the family of ky dam and hong tray the thousand voices went to the temple while i was away she used her power to intimidate and torture the priests until they surrendered the mysterious object that had been given them for safekeeping ages ago they didnt even know what it was anymore they really cant be blamed but i cant help blaming them and there you have it all the secrets of the nyueng bao i doubted that i doubt that seriously but its a basis from which to work are you going to cooperate if we get narayan singh to divulge what he did with the key if youll undertake a promise never to tell anyone what i told you here tonight i swear it on the annals this was too easy i wont say a word to a soul but i did not say anything about not writing it down i did not extract an oath from him sometime eventually he would face the moral dilemma that had swallowed the radisha once it seemed that the company would fulfill its obligation to her and it was coming time for her to deliver on her own commitments once uncle doj had his own people out from under the glittering stone his reliability as an ally would turn to smoke easily dealt with when the time came i thought i told doj i still have to work tomorrow and its a whole lot later now than it was an hour ago he rose evidently relieved that i had not asked many questions i did have a few in mind such as why the nyueng bao had risked more frequent pilgrimages to the shadowgate once the shadowmasters were in power adding women and children and old people to the entourage so i asked anyway while we were walking he told me the shadowmasters permitted it it added to their feelings of superiority and it let us keep them thinking that we didnt have the real key that we were searching for it our own people believed that was what we were doing only ky dam and hong tray knew the whole truth the shadowmasters were hoping wed find it for them the thousand voices figured it out yes her crows went everywhere and heard everything and in those days she had a very sneaky demon at her beck and call i continued to pester him all the way back to the warehouse cleverly trying to find his remaining secrets by coloring in more map around the blank places i did not fool him a bit before i dragged off to bed i visited sahra murgen and goblin one more time you people get all of that most of it murgen said this weary old slave has been doing some other chores too think he told the truth mostly sahra admitted he told no lies that i noticed but i dont think he told the whole truth well of course not hes nyueng bao right down to his twisted toe bones and a wizard besides before sahra got indignant goblin told me there was a white crow out there with you i saw it i said i figured it was murgen murgen said it wasnt murgen i was there disembodied same as now what was it then who was it i dont know murgen replied i did not entirely believe him maybe it was a false intuition but i was sure he had a strong suspicion master santaraksita hardly waited till there were no eavesdroppers before he approached me dorabee your record is beginning to look bad two days ago you were late yesterday you didnt show up at all this morning you dont look alert and ready for work i was not i would have been testy with anyone else in this case i barely noticed that his words were not spoken in a tone in keeping with their content i sensed relief in him at my return and a lingering whiff of a fear that i would not i lied i had a fever i couldnt stay on my feet for more than few minutes at a time i tried to come in but i was so weak i got lost for a while and eventually ended up just going home should you even be here today then changing course sounding overly worried i have a little more strength today i have a lot of work to do i really want to keep this job sri none other would put me so close to so much wisdom where is home dorabee i had collected my broom he was following me eyes were following us some with a knowing look that told me santaraksita may have pursued other young men in the past i was ready for this one because i knew he had tried to follow me i share a small room near the waterfront in the sirada neighborhood with several friends from the army a common situation throughout taglios where men outnumber women almost two to one because so many men have come in from the territories hoping to make their fortunes why didnt you go home when you came back dorabee ohoh sri your mother your brothers your sisters and their wives and husbands and children all still dwell in the same place where you lived as a child they believed you were dead oh darn he had gone to see them the busybody i dont get along with those people sri which was an outright lie on behalf of dorabee dey banerjae the man i had known had been very close to his family when i came back from the kiaulune wars i was so horribly changed that they wouldnt have recognized me had i gone home it wouldnt have been long before they found out things about me that wouldve caused them to disown me i preferred to let them think dorabee was dead the boy they remembered no longer exists anyway i hoped he would interpret that according to his own wishful thinking he bit i understand im grateful for your concern sri if you will excuse me i went to work i worked briskly deep in thought what i needed to do required me to let myself be seduced i had no experience along those lines from either of the possible viewpoints but the old men tell me i am clever and after a while i thought i saw a way by which events could proceed as desired without surendranath santaraksita putting himself in a position of emotional or moral risk greater than he had when he tried to follow me home and i had to send tobo out to rescue him which of course he did not know i had a weak spell toward midmorning at a point where old baladitya could repay his small debt by being solicitous by the time master santaraksita manufactured a reasonable excuse to put himself into my proximity i had collected myself and was back at work a few hours later i contrived to throw up my lunch then made a show of cleaning up i suffered dizzy spells later still the last occurred after most of the librarians and copyists had gone home despite the threat of further showers the afternoon storm had not been as terrible as most taglians generally viewed that as a bad omen santaraksita played his part perfectly he was beside me before my spell was over nervously he suggested youd better quit now dorabee youve put in more than your days work the rest will be here tomorrow ill walk along with you to make sure youre all right a relapse threatened as i began to protest that that was not necessary so i said thank you sri your generosity knows no bounds what about baladitya the old copyists grandson had failed to show again hes practically on our way well just leave him off first i tried to think of some small act or something i could say that would encourage santaraksitas fantasy but could not that proved unnecessary anyway the man was determined to hook himself all because i knew how to read weird riverwalker just happened to be hanging around outside when master santaraksita baladitya and i left the library grounds i made a little gesture to let him know we were going to do it more signs and gestures along the way let him know that the old man should be rounded up as soon as santaraksita and i left him he was a witness who could say that the master librarian had been seen last in my company and he might be useful not far from the warehouse i suffered another mild spell santaraksita put an arm around me to help i drifted back into my safe place some and went on with the game by now we were surrounded at a distance by company brothers just straight ahead i told santaraksita who was becoming confused by the outer web of spells just hold my hand moments later a gentle tap at the base of the master librarians skull let me step away from my uncomfortable role here im known as sleepy im the annalist of the black company i brought you here to assist in the translation of material recorded by some of my earliest predecessors santaraksita began to fuss kendo cutter placed a hand over his mouth and nose so he could not breathe after several such episodes even a member of the priestly class recognized the connection between silence and unimpeded breathing i told him we have a pretty cruel reputation sri and its rightly deserved no im not dorabee dey banerjae dorabee did die during the kiaulune wars fighting on our side what do you want in a shaky voice like i said we need to translate some old books tobo get the books from my worktable the boy went away grumbling about why was it always he who had to run and fetch master santaraksita was very put out when he discovered that some of what i wanted translated had been pilfered from his own restricted stacks in fact when i told him i want to start with this one and showed him what i believed to be the earliest of the annals he lost some color im doomed dorabee im sorry young man sleepy was it haw oneeye bellowed having appeared only moments before did you ever go sniffing up the wrong tree my little darling sleepy here is all girl i smirked darn here we go again sri now you have to get your mind around the fact that a woman can read ah heres baladitya youll be working with him thank you river did you run into any trouble santaraksita began to balk again i wont kendo silenced him again youll translate and youll work hard at it sri or we wont feed you we arent the bhadrhalok we quit talking about it a long time ago were doing it its just your misfortune to get caught up in it sahra arrived she was soaked its raining again i see you landed your fish she collapsed into a chair considered surendranath santaraksita im exhausted my nerves were on edge all day the protector returned from the swamp at noon she was in a totally foul mood she had a huge argument with the radisha right in front of us the radisha stood up to her she did shes reached her limit another bhodi disciple came this morning but the greys stopped him from burning himself then the protector announced that she was going to take the night away from us by letting the shadows run loose from now on thats when the radisha started screaming santaraksita looked so completely appalled by the implications of sahras revelations that i had to laugh no he insisted its not funny then we discovered that he was not really concerned about the shadows the protector is going to clip my ears at the very least these books werent supposed to be in the library at all i was supposed to have destroyed them ages ago but i couldnt do that to any book then i forgot about them i shouldve locked them up somewhere why sahra snapped she did not get an answer i asked her did you make any headway i didnt get a chance to pick up any pages i did get into the radishas suite i did eavesdrop on her and soulcatcher and i did pick up a little other information for example for example the purohita and all the sacerdotal members of the privy council will be leaving the palace tomorrow to attend a convocation of senior priests in preparation for this years druga pavi the druga pavi is the biggest gunni holiday of the taglian year taglios with all its numerous cults and countless minorities boasted some holiday almost every day but the druga pavi beggared all the rest but that doesnt come up until after the end of the rainy season i had a funny feeling about this i got a premonition from it myself sahra admitted river take the master and copyist and make sure theyre as comfortable as we can make them here have goblin provide them with chokers and make sure they understand how they work i asked sahra did you happen to hear about this before or after soulcatcher got back from terrorizing the swamp after of course of course she suspects something kendo as soon as its light out tomorrow i want you to head for the kernmi what see what you can find out about this meeting without giving away how interested you are if you see a lot of greys or other shadar around dont bother just get back here with that word suppose thiss a genuine opportunity sahra asked itll stay genuine as long as theyre outside the palace wont it maybe it would be best to just kill them put some flash buttons on the corpses that would make soulcatcher really mad wait im having a thought it might just be straight from alshiel i waved a finger in the air as though counting musical beats yes thats it we need to hope the protector is trying to bait a trap with the purohita i explained my thinking thats good sahra said but if were going to make it work you and tobo will have to go inside with me and i cant theres no way i can miss work the day after master santaraksita disappears get murgen see if he was around the palace today find out if theres a trap and where its at if soulcateher is going to be away maybe you and tobo can do it on your own i dont want to belittle your genius sleepy but this is something ive thought about a lot off and on for years the possibility is partly why i keep trying to worm my way closer to the center of things the truth is it cant be managed by fewer than three people i need shiki and i need sawa let me think sahra got murgens attention while i thought murgen seemed to be more alert and more interested in the outside world now particularly where his wife and son were concerned he must have begun to understand ive got it sahra we can have goblin be sawa aint no fucking way goblin said he repeated himself four or five times in as many languages just in case somebody missed his point what the fuck is the matter with you woman youre as small as i am we rub a little betelnut juice on your face and hands dress you up in my sawa outfit have sahra sew your mouth shut so you cant shoot it off every time the urge hits you nobody will know the difference as long as you keep looking down which is what sawa mostly does that may be a solution sahra said ignoring goblins continued protests in fact the more i think about it the better i like it no disrespect meant but in a major pinch goblin would be a lot more useful than you would i know there you go and i could go ahead and be dorabee dey besides isnt it wonderful women goblin grumbled cant live with them but they wont go away sahra said youd better start learning sawas quirks from sleepy to me she said therell be plenty of work for sawa i made sure and narita is eager to get her back tobo you need to get some sleep nobodys connected you with gokhale but youll still need to be alert i really dont like going up there mom you think i do we all have yes i think you do i think you keep going up there because you want the danger i think it might be hard for you when you do have to stop taking risks i think when that happens were all going to have to watch you close so you dont do something that might get us all killed along with you that was a kid who had been doing a lot of thinking maybe with a little help from one or more uncles sounded to me like he might be riding knee to knee with the truth too i settled into a chair outside the cage where narayan singh was being kept he was awake but he ignored me i said the daughter of night still lives i know that you do how id know if youd harmed her then you need to know this she isnt going to stay unharmed a whole lot longer the only reason shes healthy now is that we want your cooperation if we cant get it then theres not much reason to keep on feeding her or you either though i do intend to keep my word about taking care of you because id want you to see everything you value destroyed before youre allowed to die yourself which reminds me aridatha couldnt be with us tonight his captain was concerned that there might be some unrest another bhodi disciple planned to burn himself so well have to wait until tomorrow night narayan made a sound like a whispered moan he did not want to have to acknowledge my existence for existence and mine in particular was making him very unhappy which made me happy though i had no personal grudge my enmity was all very sanitary very institutional very much on behalf of my brothers who had been injured and on behalf of my brothers who were imprisoned beneath the earth i suggested maybe you should go to kina for guidance such a look he gave me narayan singh had no sense of humor and did not recognize sarcasm when it struck from the grass and sank its fangs in his ankle i told him just to recap i dont have much patience left i dont have much time left weve leaped onto the tigers back the big catfight is coming catfight universal male slang for a squabble amongst women oh really it had just occurred to me we were all women in this fight sahra and i the radisha and soulcatcher kina and the daughter of night uncle doj was as close to a principal as any man was right now and narayan though he was mainly the daughter of nights shadow strange strange narayan when the fur starts flying i wont be much interested in looking out for your friend but im definitely going to take care of you i started to leave i cant do this thing singhs voice was almost inaudible work on it narayan if you love the girl if you dont want your goddess to have to start all over from scratch i thought i had that much power by killing the right people i could lay kina down to sleep for another age and i would if i could not get my own brothers out of the ground i found banh do trang awaiting me in the little corner where i worked and slept he did not look well which was not surprising he was not too many years younger than goblin and did not have goblins wondrous resources can i be of any service uncle i understand doj told you the story of our people the best he could manage was a hoarse whisper he told me a story therere always doubts left behind when any nyueng bao shares a secret with me hen hehheh youre a bright young woman sleepy few illusions and no obvious obsessions i think doj was as honest with you as he could compel himself to be assuming he was honest with me when he consulted me afterward he finally heard me when i told him that thiss a new age that that was what hong tray wanted to show us when she chose the jengal to become sahras husband were all lost children we must join hands that too is what hong tray wanted us to understand she couldve said so she was hong tray a seeress a nyueng bao seeress would you have her issue blunt rescripts like the radisha and protector absolutely do trang chuckled then he seemed to fall asleep was that that i wondered uncle uh oh im sorry young woman listen i dont think anyone else has mentioned it maybe no one else but gota and i have seen it but theres a ghost in this place weve seen it several times the past two nights a ghost was murgen getting so strong people were starting to see him its a cold and evil thing sleepy like something thats happiest skulking around the mouths of graves or slithering through a mountain of bones like that vampire child in the tiger cage you should be very wary of her and i think i should find my way to bed before i fall asleep here and your friends begin to talk if theyre going to gossip about me i cant think of anyone id rather have them connect me with someday when im young again next time around the wheel good night uncle i thought i might read for a while but i fell asleep almost instantly sometime during the night i discovered that do trangs ghost did exist i awakened instantly alert and saw a vaguely human shimmer standing nearby evidently watching me the old man had done a good job describing it too i wondered if it might not be death himself it went away as soon as it sensed my scrutiny i lay there trying to put it together murgen soulcatcher spying an unknown or what it felt like the girl in the tiger cage out for an ectoplasmic stroll i tried reason but was still too tired to stick with it long there was something wrong with the city in addition to its extraordinarily clean smell the rain had continued throughout most of the night and in addition to the stunned looks on the faces of streetdwellers who had survived their worst night yet no it was a sort of batedbreath feeling that got stronger as i approached the library maybe it was some sort of psychic phenomenon i stopped the captain used to say you had to trust your instincts if it felt like something was wrong then i should take time to figure out why i felt that way i turned slowly no street poor here but that was understandable there were dead people around here the survivors would be clinging to whatever shelter they could find afraid the greys would replace the shadows by day but the greys were absent too and traffic was lighter than it should be and most of the tiny oneman stalls that sprawled out into the thoroughfare were not in evidence there was fear in the air people expected something to happen they had seen something that troubled them deeply what that might be was not obvious though when i asked one of the merchants who was bold enough to be out he ignored my question completely and tried to convince me that there was no way i could manage another day without a hammeredbrass censer in a moment i decided he might be right i paused to speak to another brass merchant whose space lay within eyeshot of the library where is everyone this morning i asked examining a longspouted teapot sort of thing with no real utility a furtive shift of the merchants eyes toward the library suggested there was substance to my premonitions and whatever had spooked him had taken place quite recently no taglian neighborhood remains quiet and empty for long i seldom carry money but did have a few coins on me this morning i bought the useless teapot a gift for my wife for finally producing a son youre not from around here are you the brass smith asked no im from dejagore the man nodded to himself as if that explained everything when i started to move on he murmured you dont want to go that way dejagoran ah be in no hurry find a long way around that place i squinted at the library i saw nothing unusual the grounds appeared completely normal though some men were working on the garden ah i continued forward only till i could slide into the mouth of an alley why were there gardeners there only the master librarian ever brought them in i caught glimpses of something wheeling above the library it drifted down to settle on the ironwork of the gate above adoos head i took it for a lone pigeon at first but when it folded its wings i saw that it was a white crow and a crow with a sharper eye than adoo had but adoo was accustomed to posting himself in the gateway that constituted another warning sign the white crow looked right at me and winked or maybe just blinked but i preferred the implication of intelligence and conspiratorial camaraderie the crow dropped onto adoos shoulder the startled gateman nearly jumped out of his sandals the bird evidently said something adoo jumped again and tried to catch it after he failed he ran into the library moments later shadar disguised as librarians and copyists rushed out and began trying to bring the crow down with stones the bird got the heck out of there i followed its example heading in another direction i was more alert than i had been in years what was going on why were they there obviously they were lying in wait for me who else but why what had i done to give myself away maybe nothing though failing to show up to be questioned would count as damning evidence but i was not lunatic enough to try to bluff my way through whatever it was the greys were trying to do the milk was spilt no going back but i did want to mourn the one volume of ancient annals i had not yet been able to locate and pilfer all the way home i tried to reason out what had brought out the greys surendranath santaraksita had not been missing long enough to cause any official interest in fact some mornings the master librarian did not arrive until much later than this i gave it up before i threw my brain out of joint murgen could go poking around down there he could find the answer by eavesdropping murgen was busy eavesdropping even though it was daytime he was worried about sahra and tobo and maybe even a little about goblin i found oneeye hung over but attentive at the table where the mist engine resided mother gota and uncle doj were there as well tense and attentive themselves which told me that sahra was determined to go ahead with our most daring stroke yet to my amazement oneeye hustled over in reality a slow shuffle and patted me on my back we heard you were coming in little girl we were scared shitless they were going to get you what murgen warned us there was a trap he heard some of the grey bosses talking about it when he was scouting to see what sahra was headed into the old bitch soulcatcher herself was out there waiting for you well not exactly you personally just somebody who goes around stealing books that arent supposed to be there in the first place youve lost me good old man start someplace where i can see a couple of landmarks somebody followed you and your boyfriend yesterday somebody more suspicious of him than of you evidently a parttime spy for the protector we knew there were informants out there getting paid piecework rates we tried not to be vulnerable to them also evidently with a boner for your boyfriend oneeye all right for your boss more or less literally he went and told the greys that this dirty old man was about to force perversions on one of the youths who worked for him a few greys went to the library and started poking around and asking questions and quickly discovered that some funds had gone missing and santaraksita as well when they started dragging people out of bed and pulling them in then they discovered several books missing also including some great rarities and even a couple that were supposed to have been removed from the library years ago but had not been that got back to catcher she got her sweet little behind down there in about ten seconds and started threatening to eat people alive and hurting anybody whose looks she didnt like and i almost walked into the middle of it i mused how did they know the books were gone i replaced them with discards but maybe master santaraksita if he was a crook had been doing that too if he had been corrupt he had had me fooled we would have to talk near as murgen could find out dorabee dey banerjae isnt suspected of anything worse than naïveté surendranath santaraksita though is in deep shit soulcatcher is going to kill him one limb at a time and let him watch the crows eat them as they go and after that shes going to get nasty oneeye grinned a grin in which just the one lonely tooth loomed not exactly a recommendation of his talents as the company dental specialist say what you like about soulcatcher she doesnt put up with any corruption which was just another black mark in her ledger as far as oneeye was concerned im safe i said heres food for thought a white crow was waiting at the gate possibly to warn me it made a definite attempt to communicate so whats the story with sahra shes going ahead that jaul barundandi is a real dimwit he bought goblins feeble imitation of your sawa character then he tried to get tobo away from sahra sahra threatened to tell his wife minh subredil was going to have trouble staying employed if she kept up the bad attitude the cover team in place little girl whos been doing this shit since before your greatgrandmother was born you always check again and keep on checking because sooner or later youre going to save someone who overlooked something is the evacuation team operational chances were good we were going to have to leave taglios long before i wanted soulcatcher soon would be hunting us hard oneeye said ask do trang he said hed take care of it you might find it interesting to note that catcher dropped the watch on arjana drupada when the library jumped to the head of her list and she needed trustworthy people there she doesnt have enough to go around not that she trusts most of those shes had watching the bhodi disciples so she can head them off before they pull any more suicide stunts then we have to hit drupada go teach your granny to suck eggs little girl like i said who was playing these games when grannys mommy was still shitting her nappies whos covering the warehouse then having so many things in the air meant that every brother had to be occupied somewhere soulcatcher was not alone in facing manpower limitations you and me little girl pooch and spiff are around somewhere being a mixture of sentries and couriers youre sure drupada is clean murgen checks every half hour much as hed rather be haunting his honey friend arjana is clean for now but how long will it last and murgens also been keeping an eye on slink at semchi checking him every couple of hours looks like thats going to happen today too soulcatcher is going to shit shes just going to shit rocks were going to do everything but stroll up and bite her on the tit today language old man language uncle doj murmured something oneeye hastened to the mist projector despite her enthusiasm the night before sahra had been worried about having goblin along playing sawas role the little man was not reliable he was bound to do something she did not give him enough credit he had not survived so long by doing stupid things in tight places he was determined to be more completely sawa than ever i had played the role he did nothing on his own minh subredil guided him completely but over his conservative roleplaying he laid a glamour of disinterest jaul barundandi and everyone else merely gave the idiot woman a glance and concentrated on shiki who appeared particularly attractive this morning who carried her flute hung on a thong around her neck anyone who tried to use force would suffer a cruel surprise the flute was not new but the ghanghesha that shiki carried was today even sawa carried a statue of the god jaul barundandi mocked subredil when will you start carrying a ghanghesha in each hand this was after he had been threatened because of shiki and he was not feeling kindly subredil bent and whispered to her ghanghesha something about pardoning barundandi because at heart he was a good man who needed help finding his anchor within the light barundandi heard some of that it disarmed him for a while he turned the madwoman and her companions over to his wife who had developed an almost proprietary interest lately subredil in particular made her look good because she got so much work done narita too noted the ghanghesha if religious devotion will win you a better life next time around the wheel subredil youre headed for the priestly class for sure then the fat woman frowned but didnt you leave your ghanghesha here yesterday ah ah ah i did i thought i lost that one forever i didnt know what had become of it where is it where is it she had prepared for this though the ghanghesha had been left behind intentionally easy easy subredils love affair with her ghanghesha amused everyone we took good care of it there was a lot of work scheduled for the day which was good it helped pass the time nothing else could be done till much later and even then luck would have to play a big part another dozen ghangheshas would not have been out of place where the need for luck went during the noon break over kitchen scraps subredils party heard rumors of the protectors rage over someone having stolen some books from the royal library she was out there now investigating personally subredil shot warning looks at her companions no questions no worrying about the people they could not possibly help later in the day there were more rumors the purohita and several members of the privy council along with bodyguards and hangerson had been treated to a wholesale slaughter on the very steps of the kernmi what in what sounded like a fullscale military assault supported by heavy sorcery reports were vague and confused because everyone but the attackers had been trying to find somewhere safe to hide subredil tried to take that into account but could not control her anger entirely kendo cutter was too violent a man to have been in charge and too devout a vehdna the gunni were not going to be pleased about bloodshed happening on the very steps of a major temple there was much talk about the signs and portents thrown up as cover and diversion while the attackers faded away there would be no doubt who had been responsible nor even who was next on the list of the doomed any smoke cloud that did not declare water sleeps thundered my brother unforgiven it had been rumored only for a day that the great general had been summoned to taglios to deal with the dead who refused to lie down to the people in the street it looked like the company would be waiting sahra was worried soulcatcher was sure to abandon the library when she heard about the attack if she returned to the palace extremely agitated sahras operation might have to be abandoned because the sorceress would be too alert the radisha stormed through not long after the news began to make the rounds she was distraught she headed directly for her anger chamber sawa looked up from the brasswork she was cleaning just for an instant apparently badly troubled subredil set her mop aside and went to see what was wrong no one else paid them any attention not much later when jaul barundandi dropped in to see how the work was going and somehow got into an argument with narita sawa wandered away when no one was looking no one noticed right away because sawa almost never did anything to be noticed and today she wore charms reinforcing that shiki drifted closer to her mother she looked pale and troubled and kept touching her flute she whispered shouldnt be we going it isnt time place your ghanghesha shiki was supposed to have done that hours ago rumor rushed through pursued by uglier rumor still the protector had returned and she was in a frothing rage she was visiting her shadows now it was going to be another night of terror in the streets of taglios the women started talking about the possible wisdom of finishing work before the protector decided she had to see the radisha the protector would not respect the privacy of the princess she made no secret of her contempt for taglian custom even narita seemed to hold the opinion that it would be best not to be where you could be seen when the protector was in a mood at that point shiki discovered that her aunt was missing damn it subredil narita fumed you promised youd watch her closer the last time this happened im sorry mistress i became so frightened she probably decided to go to the kitchen that was what she was trying to do when she got lost last time shiki was going already not more than a minute later she called i found her mother when the rest of the women arrived they found sawa seated against a wall brass lamp in her lap unconscious with vomit all over her oh no subredil cried not again and in a whirlwind of nonsense and apparently vain efforts to get sawas attention she got across the hint of a fear that sawa might be pregnant after having been abused by one of the palace staff narita was away in seconds fuming subredil and shiki were right behind her supporting sawa between them heading for the servants postern nobody noticed that none of the women were carrying their ghangheshas not even the one that subredil had forgotten the day before because of the state sawa was in and the state narita was in and the imminent explosion of displeasure expected from the protector the women managed to draw their pay then to escape without having to deal with barundandis kickback lieutenant again they were able to lay sawa inside a covered ox cart not long after they got into the twisty streets downhill from the palace subredil had to caution shiki repeatedly against celebration everything we did must have been seen by somebody i told the gathered troops when word gets out that the radisha has vanished all those people are going to remember and try to help soulcatcher is supposed to have a knack for separating wheat from chaff also a knack for calling up the kind of supernatural assistance that can pick your particular trail out of a thousand willow swan volunteered he was present because he had agreed to take care of the radisha she was going to be in a state when she awakened and discovered that her demons had caught up with her at last banh do trang wanted to know are you going to flee or not the old man was at the edge of collapse he had been working since before dawn can we i asked you could go this instant if the situation became totally desperate it will be a few hours yet before the barges are completely provisioned however nobody wanted to go though not just yet a lot of the men had developed ties everyone had unfinished business that was life the same situation had come up time and again over the course of the companys history sahra said you still havent gotten narayan to give you the key ill talk to him is river back yet no what about kendo how about pooch and spiff we had people running all over on special assignments good old oneeye had sent our last two men the barely competent pooch and spiff to assassinate adoo the gateman because murgen had been able to determine that it had been he who had caused all the excitement at the library more adoo knew the general neighborhood where i lived oneeye informed me kendo cutter is coming through the web right now arjana drupada appears to be reasonably healthy for a man with a dozen knife wounds hang on murgen was whispering something it was thundering and hailing outside i could not hear a word its started at semchi murgen says slink hit them just as they were starting to pitch camp cut them off from their weapons darn i swore darndarndarn whats the matter with you little girl he shouldve waited until they tried to do something to the bhodi tree this way nobody will know why we jumped them theres why you dont have you a man what you ask too much you sent slink out there to kill some people unless you told him its got to be a show all our guys allowed to fight only lefthanded or something hes going to do it fast and dirty and with as little risk to our own guys as he can i thought he understood did you assume little girl at this late stage in your career you whos got to run a checklist on lacing your own boots he had me and he had me good i tried to change the subject if we decide to evacuate were going to have to run somebody out there to warn slink and tell him where to rendezvous dont try to change the subject i turned away kendo does he need medical attention drupada hes not bleeding that much anymore then lets take him back to meet his new roommate oneeye catching me out had me feeling particularly evil this seemed like a good time to take it out on the enemy the rest of you take real good care of the radisha we dont want her coming up with a hangnail anybody can blame on us cutter bobbed his head and muttered something under his breath hey pervert i called to the inspectorgeneral of the records i dont want you ever to say that the black company dont cater to its guests so heres your very own human play toy maybe a little longer in the tooth than you prefer but its only until the protector gets around to rescuing you kendo planted a boot in drupadas behind and shoved into the cage the purohita went he and gokhale backed off into opposite corners and glared at one another human nature being what it is each man probably thought the other was responsible for his dismay i told kendo relax now get something to eat take a nap but stay away from the girl hey i got it the first time sleepy and more so now shes started sleepwalking so ease up give me a reason why dont we just skrag her because we need singh to help open the way through the shadowgate and he wont unless he feels confident that well be good to the daughter of night i dont know any of the captured that well dont feel like youve got to save them on my account i feel like we have to save them on the companys account kendo just the same as wed be doing if it was you out there sure right kendo cutter was one of those people who tended to look on the dark side no matter what get some rest i went to talk with narayan while i waited for murgen to generate some report on what was happening inside the palace i did not want to run away but knew it was very close to time for the company to go we had to see what soulcatchers reaction to the kidnapping would be and we had to get goblin out of the palace if soulcatcher did not come after us like a screaming monsoon storm i was going to get really worried about what she was up to ive had a real good day thank you mr singh a whole lot of planning and a little inspired improvisation fell into place all at once just one thing more could make the day perfect i sniffed the air it smelled like oneeye and friends were cooking up a new batch probably so they could take a little something along when we had to run i kicked a bundle of hides of some kind over beside the bars of singhs cage settled myself i caught him up on the latest gossip including none of your people seem to be worried about you two maybe you were just a little too secretive be kind of pathetic if the whole cult faded away because everyone just sat around waiting to find out what was going on ive been told that im free to deal with you there was no cringe to the man tonight he had gotten a little backbone somewhere im prepared to discuss the object you seek if i receive absolute assurances that the black company will never do the daughter of night any harm never is an awful long time youre out of luck i got up goblins been wanting to work on her just forever im going to let him pull a few fingers off now to show you we have no conscience or remorse where certain old enemies are concerned i offered you what you asked you offered me a delayed death warrant if i agree to that kind of nonsense ten years from now the blackhearted witch will start poisoning us and well be stuck with the disastrous choice of keeping our word and accepting destruction or breaking our word and seeing our reputation destroyed im certain you dont know much northern mythology theres an old religion up there that tells how a leading god allowed himself to be slain so his family would no longer be bound by a promise he made foolishly to an enemy who wore it like a turtles shell narayan stared at me cold as a cobra waiting for me to crack and i did a little because i bothered to explain oneeye has told me a hundred times that i should not explain i just dont want that artifact badly enough to commit my people to the level of vulnerability that youre asking in particular i wont undertake commitments for those of us who are buried on the other hand maybe youd like to undertake commitments whereby assuming you get out of this alive you guarantee never to be a pain in the company neck ever again whereby you agree to go to the captain and the lieutenant and beg their forgiveness for stealing their child the very suggestion appalled the living saint of the deceivers shes the child of kina the daughter of night those two are irrelevant evidently we dont have anything to talk about yet ill send you a few fingers for breakfast i went to see if surendranath santaraksita was being a good fellow and pursuing the tasks i had suggested he could use to help overcome the tedium of his captivity to my surprise i found him hard at work with old baladitya assisting translating what i had presumed to be the first volume of the lost annals they had a whole stack of sheets already done dorabee master santaraksita said excellent your friend the foreigner keeps telling us we cant have any more real vellum when were done with these last few sheets he wants us to use those ridiculous bark books they still employ out in the swamps before there were modern paper and vellum and parchment there was bark i do not know what kind of tree it came from just that the inner bark was removed carefully treated and pressed and used to write on to make a book you stacked the bark sheets drilled a hole down through the upperlefthand corner of the stack then bound everything together with a cord or ribbon or length of very light chain banh do trang would favor bark because it was both cheap traditional and hardier than animal products ill talk to him theres nothing earthshaking in there dorabee my name is sleepy sleepy isnt a name its a disease or a misfortune i prefer dorabee ill use dorabee use whatever you like ill know who youre talking to i read a couple of sheets he was right this is tedious stuff this looks like an account book thats what it is mainly the things you want to know are just the things the writer assumes any reader of his own time would know already he wasnt writing for the ages or even for another generation he was keeping track of horseshoe nails lance shafts and saddles all he has to say about their battle is that the lowerranking officers and noncommissioned officers failed to demonstrate an adequate enthusiasm for appropriating weapons lost or abandoned by the defeated enemy preferring to wait till the next dawn to begin gleaning as a consequence stragglers and the local peasantry managed to scavenge all the best i notice he doesnt bother to name a single name person or place i had begun reading while the master talked i could listen and read at the same time even though i was a woman he does give mileage and dates the context suggests the appropriate systems of measure it can be figured out but what ive already started to wonder dorabee is why weve all been deathly afraid of these people all our lives this book gives us no reason to be afraid this book is about a troop of crabby little men who marched off somewhere they didnt want to go for reasons they didnt understand fully believing that their unstated mission would last only several weeks or at most a few months then they would be able to go home but the months piled into years and the years into generations and still they didnt really know the material also suggested we needed to revise our old belief that the free companies exploded into the world at the same time in a vast orgy of fire and bloodshed the only other company mentioned was noted to have returned years before the black company marched and in fact several senior company noncoms had served as private soldiers in that earlier unnamed band i can see it i grumbled were going to translate these things find out all sorts of things and not be an inch closer to understanding anything santaraksita said thiss much more exciting than a meeting of the bhadrhalok dorabee then baladitya spoke for the first time do we have to starve to death here dorabee nobodys brought you anything to eat no ill just see about that dont be startled if you hear me shouting i hope you enjoy fish and rice i took care of that then hid in my corner for a while i was feeling a little depressed after having seen master santaraksitas work i suppose that sometimes i invest too much in my goals then suffer a correspondingly huge disappointment when things do not work out tobo woke me how can you sleep sleepy i guess i must be tired what do you want the protector has finally started to grumble about the radisha dad wants you to come keep track yourself so you dont have to record anything thirdhand at the moment my name felt entirely appropriate i just wanted to lie down on my pallet and dream about finding another kind of life trouble was i had been doing this since i was fourteen i did not know anything else unless master santaraksita was willing to let bygones by bygones and take me back at the library right after we buried soulcatcher in a fiftyfootdeep hole we filled in with boiling lead i dragged a stool in between sahra and oneeye leaned forward with my elbows on the table and stared into the mist where murgen appeared to report when it suited him oneeye was fussing at murgen even though murgen was away i said anybody would think you were worried about goblin the way youre carrying on of course im worried about goblin little girl the runt borrowed my transeidetic locuter before he went up there this morning not to mention he still owes me several thousands pais for well he owes me a bunch of money my recollection had it the other way around oneeye always owed everyone even when he was doing well and several thousand pais is not exactly a fortune a pai being a tiny seed of such uniform weight that it is used as a measure for gems and precious metals it takes almost two thousand of them to equal a northern ounce since oneeye had not specified gold or silver the standard assumption would be that he had meant coingrade copper in other words not very much in other words still he was worried about his best friend but he could not say so because he had a centurylong history of reviling the man in public if there was any such magical instrument as a transeidetic locuter oneeye invented it an hour before he loaned it to goblin he muttered that ugly little turd gets himself killed im gonna strangle him he cant leave me holding the bag on he realized he was thinking out loud sahra and i both made mental notes to investigate the bag metaphor it sounded like there were business plans afoot secret plans surprise surprise murgen materialized practically nose to nose with me he murmured soulcatcher is out of patience a flock of crows just brought the news from semchi shes in a complete black mood she says shes going into the radishas anger chamber after her if she doesnt come out in the next two minutes hows goblin oneeye barked hiding murgen replied waiting for sunrise he was not going to try leaving during the night the way we had planned originally soulcatcher had loosed her shadows just to punish taglios for irritating her we had a few traps out randomly distributed through likely neighborhoods but i did not expect to catch anything i figured our luck along those lines was about used up goblin was armed with a shadowrepellent amulet left over from the shadowmaster wars but did not know if it was any good anymore being bright and full of forethought it had not occurred to any of us to test it on real shadows while we had some in stock you cannot think of everything but you should make the effort one of the royal guards actually tried to stop the protector when her patience failed and she went to dig the radisha out of her hideaway he went down without a sound stricken by a casual touch he would recover eventually the protector was not feeling particularly vindictive for the moment she crashed through the door of the anger chamber and howled in frustration before the pieces finished falling where is she the power of her rage wilted the onlookers a subassistant chamberlain bowing almost double continuing to bob and get lower whined she was in there o great one someone else insisted we never saw her leave she has to be in there from somewhere echoing almost as if coming from some distance in time as well as place there was the sound of brief laughter soulcatcher turned slowly her stare a cruel spear come closer tell me again her voice was compelling chilling terrible she stared into one pair of eyes after another making full use of the fear so many had that she could read the deepest secrets in their minds none of the radishas people changed their stories out of here out of this whole apartment something happened here i want no distractions i want nothing disturbed she turned again slowly extending a sorceresss senses to feel the shape of the past it was more difficult than she anticipated she had been loafing for too long falling out of practice and getting out of shape the remote laughter sounded again for an instant seeming just a touch closer you soulcatcher snapped at a fat woman one of the housekeepers what are you doing maam narita was barely able to croak her response in a moment she would lose control of her bladder you just pushed something into your left sleeve something off the altar a single white candle almost consumed still burned in the tiny shrine to ancestors come here soulcatcher extended her gloved right hand narita could not resist she stepped toward the dark woman so trim and evilly feminine in her leather idly narita hated her for maintaining that sleek body give it to me reluctantly narita removed the ghanghesha from her sleeve she began to babble about not wanting her friend to get into trouble making no sense at all failing to realize that if she had not tried to conceal the ghanghesha the protector would have overlooked it entirely soulcatcher stared at the little clay figurine the cleaning woman it belongs to the cleaning woman where is she far mocking laughter shes a day employee maam she comes in from outside where does she live i dont know maam i dont think anybody does nobody ever asked it never mattered one of the other staffers offered she was a good worker soulcatcher continued to examine the ghanghesha somethings odd here now it does matter to me find out how i dont care be creative but do it soulcatcher hurled the clay figurine to the floor shards flew in every direction a wisp of a ghost of darkness curled up and stood like a rampant cobra a foot high for an instant then it struck at the protector the staffers squealed and began trampling one another trying to get away they had not seen a shadow before but they knew what a shadow could do the laughter was closer now louder and lasting longer soulcatcher offered a convincing squeal of surprise and fright like a young woman who has just stepped on a snake her apparel and the handful of generalized protective spells that always surrounded her saved her from becoming a victim of her own crudest weapon even so for a minute she was like a child swatting mosquitoes as the shadow enthusiastically strove to terminate their relationship failing to reclaim control of the shadow soulcatcher destroyed it the necessity told her that a pretty clever mind had prepared it probably hoping that she would be too angry to pay close attention for just that instant needed woman come back here the protector extended a hand in the direction narita had fled somehow a single strand of the womans hair had become entwined through soulcatchers fingers those fingers shimmered momentarily the air became charged the other staffers whimpered and wished they had even had the nerve to try to run narita reappeared slowly taking short zombie steps here soulcatcher said she pointed at a spot on the anger chamber floor the rest of you go away quickly she did not have to add any encouragement fat woman tell me everything about the creature who always carried the ghanghesha ive told you everything i know narita whined no you have not start talking she may have kidnapped the radisha soulcatcher regretted mentioning that the instant the words left her helmet the laughter sounded like it was coming from just out in the hallway a diabolic snickering the protectors head twitched toward that direction she sensed no threat it could wait a minute her name is minh subredil it took narita only another thirty seconds to relate everything she knew about minh subredil her daughter shikhandini and her sisterinlaw sawa thank you soulcatcher snarled youve been most unhelpful and for that i shall provide an appropriate reward she gripped the fat womans throat in her right hand squeezed as narita went limp that laughter sounded once more there might have been a word there too ardath or perhaps silath or might it have been no matter soulcatcher would not listen to that just to the mockery she hurled herself toward the sound but when she burst into the hallway there was nothing to see she started to call for guards for greys but recalled that she had just slain the one person other than herself who knew for sure that the radisha had disappeared the radisha had shut herself away from the world that was all anybody really needed to know the princess could live forever right there in her anger chamber she did not need to venture forth ever again she had her good friend the protector to handle the boring chores of managing her empire for her more laughter apparently from nowhere and everywhere soulcatcher stamped away this was not over yet a white crow dropped out of the murk near the ceiling of the hallway flapped heavily landed beside the fat woman it held its beak poised beneath her nostrils momentarily as though checking for breath then it flapped away suddenly sharp ears having caught the sound of a stealthy footfall a shivering jaul barundandi eased into the chamber he knelt beside the woman he took her hand he remained there tears streaking his cheeks until he heard the protector returning arguing with herself in a variety of voices what do you know about that i said to sahra narita tried to cover for you and then barundandi got all broken up about what happened to her sahra waggled a finger she was thinking murgen what do you know about that white crow murgen hesitated before responding nothing which meant he was telling an approximate truth but he had some definite ideas sahra and i both knew him that well sahra said suppose you tell me what you think is going on then murgen faded away what the heck is that i snapped at oneeye you were supposed to rig this thing so he has to do what hes told he does most of the time he could be carrying out a previous instruction but the old fool sounded to me like he had no idea what murgen was doing soulcatcher worked quickly then summoned the staff members who had been present when she had broken into the anger chamber the continuing excitement was too much for this poor woman ive tried to resurrect her but her soul refuses to respond she must be happy where she is now there were no witnesses to contradict her though remote laughter mocked her i did find the radisha shed fallen asleep she has retreated into the anger chamber and does not wish to be disturbed again not for a long time i should have honored her wishes before we would have avoided this disaster she indicated the fat woman even the staffers who had looked into the anger chamber earlier and had seen nothing had to admit that someone was inside now moving around angrily muttering the way the radisha did and looking very much like the radisha in glimpses caught through cracks in the poorly restored door the protector suggested lets all turn in for the night tomorrow well begin repairing the mess i made she watched her audience intently feeling for anyone who could cause trouble the staff departed they were relieved just to be away from soulcatcher soulcatcher sat down and thought there was no way to tell what was going through her mind till she began muttering in a committee of voices then it was clear that she was trying to work out the mechanics of the abduction she seemed willing to give considerable weight to the possibility that the radisha had stagemanaged the whole thing herself a very suspicious woman the protector one by one she found and questioned each of the people who had dealt with minh subredil sawa and shikhandini beginning with jaul barundandi and finishing with del mukharjee the man barundandi usually trusted to collect the kickbacks from the outside workers you will cease that the protector informed mukharjee you and anyone else involved if it happens again i will put you into a glass ball and hang you above the service postern with your whole body turned inside out ill add a couple of imps to feed on your entrails for the six months it will take you to die do you understand del mukharjee understood the threat just fine but he had no idea whatsoever why the protector would want to interfere with his livelihood the protector had a passion about corruption in time the protector reasoned that three women had come into the palace and three women had gone away again it seemed very likely that the three who had departed were not the three who had entered and no one the radishas size had gone out since which meant that someone with some answers might still be inside chuckling wickedly soulcatcher began to look for evidence that someone had slipped off into the untenanted wilds of the palace goblin was asleep on a dusty old bed occasionally his snores would turn to sneezes and snorts when too much dust got into his nostrils a squawk had him bouncing up so suddenly he almost collapsed from lightheadedness he spun around he saw nothing he heard soft laughter then a bizarre squawking voice that sounded almost familiar wake up wake up she is coming whos coming whos talking there was no response he did not feel any strong sorcerous presence it was a puzzle goblin had a good idea who might be coming though not many women were likely to be hunting him here in the middle of the night he was ready his little pack was carrying the two books sleepy most wanted to save taking all three was physically impossible his traps were set all he had to do was move on into the nowempty part of the palace that had been occupied by the black company back when its staff and leadership had been quartered there there were ways to get out unnoticed he and oneeye had found them in olden times the trouble was he had no desire to be on the streets after dark amulet or no soulcatcher gave up most of her sense of touch when she chose to wrap every inch of her body in leather and helmet she never noted the touch of or resistance of the strand of spider silk stretched across the corridor but she did have a marvelously welldeveloped sense for personal danger before the ghanghesha hit the floor she was moving to defend herself it was such reflexes that made it possible for creatures like her her sister lady and the howler to have survived for so long this time she had the proper controlling spells ready hung about her sparkling like spankingnew tools the shadow trapped inside the figurine barely got its bearings before it was attacked itself seized and constrained then twisted and crushed down into a whining seething ball completely enclosed inside one of the protectors gloved hands a merry young voice called youll have to do better than that soulcatcher continued to move forward amused by the idea of tossing the shadow back into someones face the trail began to grow indistinct then disorienting experimentation showed her the cause was external the corridor had been strewn with cobwebs of spells so subtle that even she might not have noticed had she just been hurrying along oh you clever devils how long has this been here ah a very long time indeed i see you were still in favor when you started this have you been hiding here all along i certainly couldnt find you in the city if you never were out there in another voice entirely she asked what have we here it smells like somebody very frightened is hiding behind this door and he didnt even bother to lock it how stupid does he think i am she shoved the door with her toe a clay ghanghesha plummeted from its place atop the door soulcatcher giggled she was even quicker to recapture this shadow which she squeezed down inside her other hand then she pushed into the room there was no one there anymore that was easy to sense but there was a curious feel to the place it demanded an investigation she generated a small light stood in place turned slowly while she read the history of the room for subtle clues a great deal had happened there much of the recent history of the black company had been shaped in that room it retained a strong smell of old fear she identified eventually with the longdead taglian court wizard smoke all this she debated with herself in a committee of argumentative voices in the end she seemed entertained most of the time life was a great entertainment for soulcatcher and what do we have here something with inked characters on it peeped from beneath a dusty old bed where someone had been lying until minutes ago thoughtlessly she reached for the object opening her hand to grasp it damn that was stupid she wasted several minutes regaining control of the shadow it was very agile this time she stuffed it into the hand restraining the other the two were extremely unhappy in there one thing shadows seemed to hate more than the living was other shadows what soulcatcher had found was a book with half the pages torn out it was alone so this is what became of those i was never quite sure who took them i wonder if they got any use out of them as she was about to depart the protector glanced at the damaged book once more been taking these pages a few at a time that would take a long time which means theyve been coming in and out of the palace for a long time which therefore suggests that the radisha didnt engineer her own disappearance oh well shes gone it amounts to the same thing lets catch our little rat and let him play with our little friends unlike soulcatcher goblin could not see in the dark but he had the advantage of knowing where he was going he did manage to stay ahead and did slide out of one of the old hidden exits there was a little light outside from a fragment of moon peeking through scurrying young clouds trying to catch up with mother storm goblin laid the last ghanghesha on the cobblestones in plain sight then ran the books on his back beat against him pounding the breath out of him he muttered something about the good news being that it was all downhill from here the bad news was that it was dark out there were shadows on the prowl and he was not so sure about the quality of his fifteenyearold amulet he had to hope that in a city this vast none of the handful of nightstalkers would cross his path while he was huffing and puffing and concentrating on staying ahead of soulcatcher it did not occur to him that she might have recovered the shadows he had left in ambush that they might be after him too soulcatcher stepped into the night close enough behind to glimpse a flicker of her quarry vanishing into the shadows between structures across the open area outside the palace she spied the abandoned ghanghesha and several other small items that looked like they had been dropped in the rush to get away she tossed her two shadows into the air and stomped her heel down on the clay figurine at the same time this would set a pack of small deaths on the little mans heels by now she was reasonably certain that she was chasing the wizard called goblin she screamed the pain in her heel was beyond anything she had ever experienced as she collapsed trying to will her throat to seal itself she watched three ferociously bright balls of light streak into the night in pursuit of the shadows she had sent to claim goblin still fighting the incredible pain she produced a dagger and used its tip to dip another fireball out of her heel already it had eaten all the way to the bone and in and had done some damage as high as her ankle despite her normal protection ill be crippled she snarled he lulled me he set me up so id think this would be another easy shadow trap none of her voices were amused now clever little bastard will pay for this the fallen fireball burned its way into the cobblestones still ignoring her pain soulcatcher tried to stand she discovered that she was not going to be able to walk she was however not losing any blood the fireball had cauterized her wound my beloved sister if you werent already dead id kill you for inventing those damned things laughter echoed down off the ramparts of the palace a flicker of white glided after goblin i think ill kill somebody anyway soulcatcher made her way toward the palace entrance on hands and knees muttering continuously she had isolated her pain in a remote corner of her mind and was now concentrating on being angry about what this odyssey was doing to her beautiful leather pants and gloves can you believe that i asked she was as mad about ruining her outfit as she was about losing goblin and getting hurt oneeye chuckled immensely relieved because goblin had gotten away i believe it what you too its a northern thing everything she wears is leather you people are all goofy about stuff like that she probably has to fly five thousand miles every time she wants a new pair of pants means shes really got to watch her waist and behind unlike some hey no punching were all on the same side here do you believe this little pervert i asked sahra you go ask swan oneeye showed me his tooth the one he was about to lose hell tell you the womans got her good points sahra remained all business what are we going to do if she just pretends the radisha is all right how many people normally see the princess not many i know and theres no privy council anymore weve seen to them except for mogaba weve got to see about him too oneeye grumbled lets not overreach the great general will be harder to take than the others were i mused she wouldnt actually have to keep the radisha in hiding very long maybe two weeks while she builds a new council handpicked to woof yes maam and how high when she tells them to jump oneeye blew out a bushel of air shes right maybe we shouldve considered that i said i did consider it having the radisha under our control looked like the best deal we can trot her out any time soulcatcher gets too bizarre and soulcatcher will realize that she wont let temptation carry her too far not until she sorts us out she will do everything she can to find and recover the radisha sahra said im sure of that which means we need to hurry up and get out of the city i said i have one little thing to do before i go dont anybody wait on me murgen be a pal and put a little real effort into finding out about this other white crow i did not await his response now that goblin seemed safe i was eager to interview our newest prisoner someone had taken some effort to make the radisha comfortable nor had she been forced into a cage presumably oneeye had provided a sampler of choker spells i studied her while she remained unaware of my presence she had had a formidable reputation when first the company had come to taglios she had put up a good struggle too but the years had worn her down she looked old and tired and defeated now i stepped forward have they treated you well so far radisha she showed me a weak smile there was a twinkle both of anger and sarcasm in her eye i know its not the palace but ive enjoyed worse including chains and no roof at all and animal hides ive lived here for the last six years you get used to it it had been longer than that but i was not taking time to be precise why water sleeps radisha water sleeps you were expecting us we had to come at that point it became completely real to her her eyes grew big ive seen you before many times lately around the palace once upon a time long ago around the palace also with the standardbearer youre the idiot am i perhaps one of us she began to grow angry then i told her that wont help but if you need to rage to feel better consider this the protector is covering up your disappearance already the one person who knew for sure not counting us villains of course is dead already therell be more deaths and youll begin making the most outrageous pronouncements from the anonymity of your anger chamber and in six months the protector will be so solidly in control behind her greys and those who think they can profit from an alliance with her that you wont matter anymore as long as soulcatcher could come to an accommodation with mogaba i did not mention that the radisha began to speak quite rudely of her ally i let her run for a while then offered another slogan all their days are numbered what the hell does that mean sooner or later were going to get everyone who injured us youre right its not really sane but its the way we are youve seen it happening lately only the protector and the great general are still running free all their days are numbered the reality sank in a little deeper she was a captive she did not know where she did not know what was going to happen she did know that her captors were willing to pursue their grudges to insane lengths just as they had promised they would before she made the mistake of letting herself be seduced by soulcatchers deadly promises you have no designated heir do you the change of direction startled her what there isnt any clearcut line of succession again what at the moment i dont just hold you hostage i have the entire future of taglios and the taglian territories firmly under my thumb you dont have a child your brother has no child im too old for that now your brother isnt and he is still alive i left her then to think her mouth hanging open i considered seeing narayan singh again decided i would seem too eager i was too tired anyway you do not treat with a deceiver without full command of your faculties sleep was the lover whose arms i needed to wrap me up i was playing tonk with spiff and jojo and kendo cutter an interesting mix at least three of us took our religion somewhat seriously jojos real name was cho dai cho he was nyueng bao and in theory oneeyes bodyguard oneeye did not want a bodyguard jojo did not want to be a bodyguard so they did not see much of one another and the rest of us saw as little of jojo as we did of uncle doj jojo complained youre just ganging up on the dumb swamp boy i know i said me get in cahoots with a heretic and an unbeliever youll ambush them after you finish picking my bones i had been having an unusual run of luck everybody resents it when their favorite mark gets lucky i said i cant get used to this not having to go to work jojo discarded a six i needed to fill to the inside of a fivecard straight maybe this is my day be a good time to get out and find you a man then goblin youre still alive as mad as soulcatcher was last night i figured she would have you for a midnight snack before you got halfway home goblin gave me his big frog grin shes gonna walk funny for a while i couldnt believe she actually stomped on it his grin faded ive been thinking maybe nailing her that way was a mistake i couldve led her somewhere where we couldve got her in a crossfire she wouldve been looking for that in fact her suspecting something like that was probably one reason she didnt keep chasing you you want to sit in all three of my companions glowered goblin was not oneeye but they did not trust him a bit they knew with the confidence of ignorance that goblin was just more clever when he cheated the fact that his history was one of losing more than he won was just a part of the coverup you might have noticed that the human animal is fond of forming and clinging to prejudices remaining their steadfast curator in the face of all reason and contradiction not this time goblin could take a hint he would also take them some other way sometime and laugh himself silly behind his hand and it would serve them right got work to do im already getting complaints from everybody about a ghost that was all over the warehouse last night got to scope it out i had a losing hand or foot i tossed it in hes making me feel guilty for loafing i collected my winnings you cant quit now kendo grumbled you proved your point women cant play cards i stay here much longer i wont have a copper left to my name then you wouldnt get a birthday present this year didnt get one last year either i mustve played tonk with you then too so many of you do it i have a hard time keeping track of which ones of you guys keep beating up on me they all grumbled now goblin said maybe i can sit in just for a hand or two thats all right you better help sleepy or sleepy can help you the grumbling stopped till we were out of earshot goblin chuckled so did i he said we ought to get married im too old for you see if chandra gokhale can fix you up arent those two like a couple of starving rats gokhale and drupada were at one another constantly their squabbles had not yet devolved into anything physical only because they had been warned in the strongest of terms that the winner of any fight would be punished terribly maybe one of them will kill and eat the other one i said if were lucky youre a dreamer for sure whats your opinion on this ghost he shrugged you know its the girl dont you im pretty sure you think shes going through the same thing murgen did when he started falling through time and everything i dont know theres a difference nobody ever saw anything with murgen can you stop her from doing it spooking you out in the sense that im scared shell go out and get help sure ooh i didnt think about that do think about it goblin what about the white crow could she be the white crow i thought murgen was the white crow he knew better murgens here being sahras recon slave it wouldnt be the first time murgen was in the same place looking at things from two different times he tells me he cant remember being the crow maybe thats because he hasnt done it yet maybe its a murgen from next year or something i did not know what to say to that that possibility had not occurred to me and murgen had done that sort of thing before on the other hand personally i dont think its murgen or the brat he grinned his big toad grin he knew i would stub my toe on that i did what you little rat who is it then he shrugged i got a couple ideas but im not ready to talk about them yet you got the annals all you need to follow my reasoning is right in there he began giggling pleased with himself for stumping the annalist at her own game so to speak haha he spun around dancing lets go beat up on narayan singh whoa look whos here swan youre too damned old to wear your hair that long unless youre going to comb it all up on top there to kind of cover the thin spot i held a finger above goblins dome pointing down he had not had a crop come in during my lifetime swan said kind of looks like your widows peak is sagging back a little too probably comes of banging your head on the bottoms of so many tables swan looked at me an eyebrow raised he been in the ganja or something no he just hasnt gotten over the fact that he went toe to toe with your girlfriend and came out ahead on points swan had suggested a good point indirectly though with hemp such a common weed it was a wonder that goblin and oneeye had not gotten in on the entertainment side of that crop goblin understood what i was thinking without me saying a word he told me we dont have anything to do with it because it screws up your head and that waterbuffalo urine you brew back there doesnt thats pure medicine sleepy you ought to try it its chockfull of stuff thats good for you my diet is just fine goblin except for the fish and the rice thats what im saying we take up a collection buy us a pig never mind what sahra says there aint nothing sweeter than some fatback and beans swan had invited himself to accompany us in our seventyfoot trek to narayans cage he said ill kick in on that myself i havent tasted bacon in over twenty years shit goblin said youre going to kick in man you dont even have a name anymore youre dead i could run up to the palace dig around under my mattress times havent been all bad for me you wont marry me sleepy goblin said then you oughta marry swan hes got a hoard put back and hes too damned old to bother you with any of that man stuff narayan singh get your skinny shitsmelling ass up from there and talk to me swan whispered survival must be a real powerful drug i expect it is when youre goblins age i agreed i guess it is at any age meaning i asked meaning i guess i shouldve headed back north a long time ago i got nothing going for me here i shouldve started moseying when blade and cordy went down but i couldnt and it wasnt just soulcatcher twisting my arm umm im a loser we were all losers all three of us we couldnt even make it as soldiers in the old empire we deserted blade got his ass thrown to the crocodiles for smarting off to the priests back in his home country we never had no real startup any of us me and cordy only headed on down here because once we got to running it took a long time to stop now i dont have my friends anymore i dont have anybody to goose me into doing things i did not enlighten him about the health of blade and mather who were among the captured but i did point out you cant be entirely inadequate youve had some kind of commission or other from the taglian throne practically since you got here im an outsider i make a great fall guy everybody knows who i am and everybody can recognize me so the protector or the radisha puts me out front where i can take the heat for all their unpopular decisions now theyll need to find somebody else dont give me that look i wouldnt join the black company if you promised to marry me and make me captain too you guys got doom written all over you what do you want me since i dont got the stones or the young body to go home anymore and home wouldnt be there when i showed up anyway what id like to do is what we tried to do when we first came down here set me up a little brewery spend my last few years making peoples lives a little easier im sure goblin and oneeye would be happy to take on a partner them two no way theyd drink up half the product theyd get drunk and get in a fight and start throwing the barrels at each other he had a point you have a point though theyve shown considerable selfcontrol lately it helps you pay attention if your fuckup will get you killed im always surprised by this guy he meant narayan singh he looks like such a trivial little wart therere ten thousand that look just like him out there on the streets right now and not one will ever do anything more important than starve to death if i thought it would do any good id starve this one to death too narayan im back are you going to talk to me today singh raised his eyes he seemed serene at peace that could be said for stranglers they never had trouble with their consciences good morning young woman yes we can talk i took your advice i went to the goddess and she approved your petition frankly i was surprised she set down no special conditions for making a bargain other than that the lives and wellbeing of her chief agents remain unimpaired swan was more taken aback than i was you got the right guy here sleepy i dont know i figured theyd still try to weasel a little even after they couldnt stall anymore this required a little thought or a lot of thought and maybe some worry im definitely pleased narayan definitely wheres the key narayan smiled a smile almost as ugly as oneeyes ill take you to it aha i murmured i see the first shoe drops fine when will you be ready to travel as soon as the girl recovers you may have noticed shes been sick yes i did i thought it must be her time of the month a horrible horrible thought occurred to me shes not pregnant is she the look on singhs face told me that notion was completely unthinkable to him thats good but it doesnt matter narayan as long as were conspiring together deceivers and black company you two arent going to be a team its a sad truth narayan singh but i just dont trust you and her i wouldnt trust if she was in her grave he smiled like he knew a secret but you expect us to trust you based on the wellknown fact that once it has sworn a thing the company always keeps its word yes a slight exaggeration of course narayan glanced at swan for just a second he smiled again i guess thats just going to have to be good enough for me i pasted on my most scintillating false smile wonderful were in business together ill get some people ready for an expedition do we have far to go smile not far just a few days south of the city ha the grove of doom i should have guessed i led swan away i rejoined the fellows at the card table i want singhs son brought in as soon as we can get him it could not hurt to have a little extra ammunition i dont know what to do with myself not having to work sahra told me she and tobo were huddled in front of the mist box sharing what they could with murgen i was pleased to see mother and son getting along i suggested theres always work for those who want to put out the buttons thatll remind everyone about us after were gone theres always something that needs lugging down to the river to paraphrase goblin i dont miss work so much im actually going to volunteer to do some was there something the guys just brought in singhs son goodlooking fellow they also brought in a couple of rescripts they found posted on the official announcement pillars put up since the radisha went into seclusion what do they say mainly that shes willing to pay some pretty big rewards for information leading to the apprehension of any member of the gang of vandals masquerading as members of the long defunct black company and causing public disorders will anybody believe that if she says it often enough i dont care about her telling tall tales i care about the reward offers therere people out there whod sell their mothers she puts a couple of nogoods on the street throwing money around and bragging about how they cashed in somebody who really knows something might decide to bet the long odds then why dont we just go there isnt that much more we can do here anyway is there we can get mogaba let the world think that start a rumor start a bunch of rumors about the great general and about the radisha while we evacuate when are you leaving to get the key im not sure soon im stalling for time so a message can get through to slink sahra nodded she smiled good thinking singh will have something up his sleeve willow swan suddenly invited himself to join us the girl is having some kind of a problem i scowled at him sahra did the same but was polite enough to ask the daughter of night what kind of problem i think shes having a fit a seizure like perfect timing i grumbled at the same time sahra yelled for tobo to get goblin i growled what were you doing anywhere near her swan he showed some color and said uh aw you dumb mudsucker lady did you in you panted after her for years then you put the screws to a dozen million people by letting ladys baby sister threaten to blow in your ear now youre going to let ladys brat put a ring in your nose and make an even bigger idiot out of you you really are stupid and pathetic swan i was just thinking with something that isnt your brain as though youre some dopey fifteenyearold this woman isnt some cute little virgin swan shes worse than your worst nightmare come here he came i moved suddenly violently the way i had wanted to do so many times with my uncles the tip of my dagger penetrated the skin underneath his chin you really want to die a really stupid humiliating pointless death let me know ill arrange it without the rest of us having to pay the price again oneeyes cackle filled the air aint she a wonder swan you ought to think about her instead of your usual black widows he was in do trangs spare wheelchair again but getting around under his own power i could arrange something pointless and humiliating for you too old man he just laughed at me you invited this soldier aridatha down here to meet his longlost daddy sleepy you ought to be dealing with him instead of here flirting with swan he could be maddening at times and he loved it if he could find any kind of lever at all i told swan you explain to oneeye what you mean about the girl oneeye deal with it solve it short of killing her singh wont give me the key if we kill the skinny little witch darn aridatha singh was almost enough to make me change my mind about swearing off men he was gorgeous tall wellproportioned a beautiful smile that showed magnificent teeth even when he was under stress his manners were perfect he was a gentleman in every sense but condition of birth i told him your mother must have been a marvel excuse me nothing nothing around here im called sleepy youre aridatha thats enough of an introduction who are you people why am i here he did not bluster or threaten amazing few taglians ever recognized that as a waste of time it isnt necessary for you to know who we are youre here to meet a man who is also our prisoner dont mention the fact that youll be released after your interview he wont be come with me moments later aridatha singh remarked youre a woman arent you i was the last time i checked were here this is narayan narayan get up you have a visitor narayan this is aridatha as promised aridatha looked at me trying to understand narayan stared at the son he had never seen and saw something there that made him melt just for an instant and i knew that i could reach him if i could keep it from looking like i was asking him to betray kina i stepped back and waited for something to happen nothing did aridatha kept glancing back at me narayan just stared out of patience at last i asked narayan shall i send people to collect khaditya and sugriva as well and their children too this threatened narayan and told aridatha that he had been abducted because he belonged to a particular family i recognized the instant the truth occurred to him there was an entirely different look in his eyes when he glanced back at me again i said not much good can be said about this man from my point of view but you cant call him a bad father fate never gave him the chance to be good or bad except to the girl for whom he had done everything possible to her complete indifference hes very loyal aridatha realized that this was not about him at all that he was a lever meant to get some kind of movement out of narayan singh the narayan singh the infamous chief of the strangler cult aridatha won my heart all over again when he squared up his shoulders stepped forward and offered his father a formal greeting there was no warmth in it but it was absolutely proper i watched them try to find some common ground some point at which to start and they found it quickly enough we had not found any evidence ever to disdain narayan singhs affections for his lily aridatha thought quite highly of his mother the mans a piece of work isnt he i was startled i had not heard a sound but riverwalker was behind me river did not have much talent for lightfooting it which left me with the perfectly scary notion that aridatha singh really was having an effect on me yes he is and i dont quite know why well ill tell you he reminds me of willow swan a bedrockdecent guy only smart and still young enough to be unspoiled by life river you should hear yourself talk youre halfway intelligent dont mention it front of the guys oneeye will figure out why he cant cheat me at tonk moren half the time he considered aridatha again pretty too better keep him away from your librarian theyll elope on you another broken heart you think what kind of clues i dont know i could be wrong when does he have to be back can we keep him all night you figuring on testing him out river did not usually rag me much so i knew i had to be asking for it somehow no not that way the villain in me came up with an idea we introduce him to the radisha before we turn him loose now youre matchmaking no now im showing a foursquare guy that his ruler isnt in the palace he can make the rumors credible because he can tell the truth couldnt hurt you keep an eye on those two here ill go talk to the woman riverwalker raised an eyebrow nobody but swan used that term to describe the radisha anymore youre picking up bad habits probably i found the radisha lost inside herself not asleep not meditating just wandering around inside probably feeling immensely guilty about having been relieved by her recent lack of stress i felt a moment of compassion she and her brother might be our foes but they were sound people at heart rajadharma had been bred into them maam she was due respect but i could not use princely titles i need to speak to you she raised her eyes slowly they seemed to be knowing caring eyes even in despair were all of my household staff my enemies we didnt choose to become your enemies and even today we honor and respect the royal office you would of course to remind me of my folly like the bhodi and their selfimmolations our quarrel with you wont ever be as great as our quarrel with the protector we could never find a path to peace with her youd never unleash the skildirsha on the city she would and the depth of her evil is such that she doesnt see the wickedness in what shes doing youre right do you have a name if she was safely a few hundred years in the past we might consider her a goddess a power capable of smashing kingdoms out of whimsy the way a child might kick over an anthill just to see the bugs scramble im called sleepy im the annalist of the black company im also the villain who plans most of your misfortunes this situation wasnt an intentional part of the master plan but the opportunity presented itself now it looks like we mightve outmaneuvered ourselves the radisha had become focused go on the protector has chosen to cover up your disappearance officially youre in your anger chamber purifying yourself and asking the gods and your ancestors to calm your heart and give you wisdom in the coming troubled times you have taken breaks to issue some fairly bewildering rescripts though my brothers brought back these two my brothers are illiterate so they couldnt select for content but these are probably representative ill have more brought in if you like the radisha read the announcement of rewards first it was straightforward and sensible this must make you uncomfortable it does she doesnt have the money what is this a tenpercent reduction in the rice allowance we dont have a rice ration we dont need to ration rice no you dont though everybody who wants rice cant afford it and some of us who would be happy to see the last of the stuff dont get to eat anything else you know what this is the radisha pounded her right forefinger against the rescript like she was trying to peck a hole through ill bet all those strange personalities they dont just come out as voices or she was in an especially strange humor when she dictated these she has those spells when the voices seem to take over completely they never last long ah i said to myself this is an interesting tidbit worth pursuing later would you care to counter with something more sound i dont have the manpower to cover the entire city but i can see that new rescripts are posted in the more important places how do you prove theyre genuine anyone can take a piece of treated naada and write something on it im working on that we have a guest a highly respected soldier from one of the city battalions we brought him in to visit another prisoner i thought he might pass the word that youre our prisoner too interesting you know what shell do dont you call your bluff produce an imitation or illusory version of me and challenge you to produce your radisha which you wont do because youre not really interested in getting killed correct we can deal with that the protector has a serious handicap nobody believes anything she says theyve started thinking that way about you too because youre beginning to come across as her stooge why did you always have such a hateful and treacherous attitude toward the company im not her stooge you have no idea how many of her mad schemes ive managed to stifle i did not tell her that we did i had her angry enough to talk but prodded just a little more why did you hate my brothers before they ever came down the river i didnt hate maybe i chose the wrong word there was something the annalists before me all sensed it and knew youd turn on the company as soon as you felt safe from the shadowmasters you werent as obsessed as smoke was but you shared his disease i dont know ive wondered about that a lot the last decade it went away after i gave the order to turn on you but smoke and i werent the only ones the whole principality felt the same there was a memory of a time before when the company there was no such time not that anybody bothered to record in the histories and documents of those days the little ive been able to decipher of our own annals from back then is dully routine the only terrible battle i found came when the company was three generations old it took place not far from here and the company lost it was almost wiped out its three volumes of annals fell into enemy hands theyve been in taglian libraries ever since from the moment the company returned to taglios access to those has been denied us all kinds of crazy things were done to keep us from getting to those books people died because of those books and from all i can see the real secret thats hidden there that had to be kept at all cost was that nothing extraordinary happened during those early years it was not an age of rapine and endless bloodshed how could all the people of a dozen states remember something that never happened and become terrified that it was going to happen again i shrugged i dont know well ask kina how she did it right before we kill her the radishas expression told me she was thinking she was not alone in her ability to believe the impossible i said you want to shake loose from your lunatic friend you want to get off the hook with us you want to get your brother back presumably the possibility that the prahbrindrah drah still lived had grown significant in her recent thoughts the radisha opened and closed her mouth several times never an attractive woman age and present circumstances conspired to make her almost repulsive i should condemn time was doing no favors for me either i said it can be managed all of it my brother is dead no hes not no one outside the company knows not even soulcatcher but the people she trapped out there under the plain are frozen in time sort of i dont understand the mystic science involved the point is theyre there theyre healthy and they can be brought back out ive just made a deal that will give us the key we need to open the way you can bring my brother back cordy mather too the light was not good but i detected the rush of color to her neck there are no secrets from you people are there not many what do you want from me i never expected to be at this point with the woman despite her downtoearth sensible businesslike reputation so i didnt have a ready answer but i did manage to come up with a wish list quickly you could step out in public someplace where a whole lot of people would see you and recognize you and repudiate the protector you could exculpate the black company you could fire the great general you could announce that youve been under soulcatchers evil spell for fifteen years but now youve finally made your escape you could make us the good guys again i dont know if i can do that ive been afraid of the black company for too long im still afraid water sleeps i said whats the protector done for you the radisha had no answer for that we can bring back your brother think of the pressure that would take off you rajadharma in a tightly controlled voice the radisha snapped dont say that that tears my entrails out and strangles me with them exactly what i had wished on her a time or two when i was in a less forgiving mood aridatha singh looked at me oddly he wasnt anything like i thought narayan singh would be seeing his sovereign had not impressed him nearly so much as seeing his father had not many people are once you get to know them river you want to take this man back where you found him it was night yes but we still had those two protective amulets left over from the shadowmaster wars they definitely looked like they were still good i wished we had another hundred but goblin and oneeye could not make them anymore i am not sure why they shared no trade secrets with me i suppose they were just too old i worry a lot when i consider a future without them in it and a future without oneeye cannot be far away o lord of hosts preserve him until the captured are delivered and all our quarrels are resolved men were charging everywhere around the warehouse some were continuing frenetic preparations for the companys evacuation some were getting ready to accompany narayan and me to the grove of doom to collect the nyueng bao key the nyueng bao do trangs confederates and the handful still attached to the company somehow seemed to be doing a lot of nervous moving around just to be moving they were scared and worried banh do trang had suffered a stroke during the night oneeyes prognosis was not encouraging i told goblin im not saying she had anything to do with it but do trang was the first one to realize that the girl was roaming around outside her flesh hes just old sleepy nobody did it to him you ask me hes really way overdue he hung on here because he cares about sahra shes all right now it looks like her husband might actually be freed and hes too old to run away soulcatcher is going to find this place eventually once mogaba arrives and starts searching i wouldnt be surprised if do trang just decided that dying was the best thing he could do for everyone right now i did not want do trang to go for all the reasons none of us like to see those close to us die but also because he was in his quiet way the best friend the company had had in generations like everyone else i tried to lose myself in work i told goblin even if shes totally innocent i want the girl fixed so she cant wander whatever you have to do short of permanently crippling or killing her goblin sighed lately that was all he did when someone gave him more work i guess he was too tired to squawk anymore where is oneeye uh furtive look around a whisper dont say i said anything i think hes trying to figure out how to take his equipment with us i shook my head and walked away santaraksita and baladitya called out to me they had accepted their situation and were applying themselves with a will the master librarian seemed particularly excited about facing a real academic challenge for the first time in years he said dorabee in all the excitement i forgot to mention that i did get an answer to your question about a written nyueng bao language there was one and not only was there one this oldest book is written in an antique dialect of that language the others were recorded in an early taglian dialect although the original of the third volume does so employing the foreign alphabet instead of native characters which argues that the invader alphabet had welldefined phonetic values that at the time must have been more precise than those of the native script right santaraksita gawked after a moment he said dorabee you never cease to amaze me absolutely correct so have you discovered anything interesting the black company came off the plain which was called glittering stone even then and mostly minced around from one small principality to the next squabbling internally over whether or not they were going to sacrifice themselves to bring on the year of the skulls there was plenty of enthusiasm among the priests attached to the company but not much among the soldiers many of those apparently volunteered as a way to escape something called the land of unknown shadows not because they wanted to bring on the end of the world the land of unknown shadows eh anything else ive developed some very good information on the price of horseshoe nails four centuries ago and on the scarcity of several medicinal plants that are now found in every herb garden earthshaking stuff stay with it sri i meant to tell him he had to evacuate with the rest of us but decided not to upset him right away he was having a good time no point making him face a choice between abduction and being put to death just yet uncle doj materialized do trang wants to see you i followed him to the tiny room the old man had built for himself in a remote corner of the warehouse on the way doj warned me that do trang was unable to speak hes already seen sahra and tobo i think he was fond of you too were going to get married in the next life if the gunni are right i am ready to travel i stopped what im going with you to the grove of doom youd better not have some crazy idea about snatching the key i agreed to help ill help i want to be there to make sure the deceiver keeps his word the deceiver miss sleepy deceiver also i agreed to turn over that volume of the books of the dead its hiding place is on the way very well the presence of ash wand will be a comfort to me and a vexation to my enemies doj chuckled it will indeed we wont be coming back here i know when we leave ill be carrying everything i wish to retain you wont need to pretend with do trang he knows his path do him the honor of an honest farewell i did more i became all teary for the first time in my adult life i rested my head on the old mans chest for a minute and whispered my thanks for his friendship and renewed my promise to see him in the next life a small heresy but i do not think god has been monitoring me too closely banh lifted a hand weakly and stroked my hair and after that i got up and went away somewhere to be alone with my grief for a man who it seemed had never been that close yet who was going to have a major impact on the rest of my life i understood that after the tears stopped i would never be quite the same sleepy again and that that was one legacy do trang wanted to leave behind the biggest problem i expected with the evacuation was one that came up every time the company picked up and moved out after having been settled in one place for a long time roots had to be torn up ties had to be severed men had to abandon the lives they had created for themselves some just would not go some who did go would tell someone where they were headed the nominal strength of the company was somewhat over two hundred people a third of whom did not live in taglios at all but maintained identities at scattered locations where they could aid brothers who were traveling overall it was very much like what the deceivers used to do partly that was intentional because those people had spent centuries finding the safest ways early on couriers went out carrying code words to all our distant brothers to warn them that a time of trouble was coming nobody would be told what was happening only warned that something was and that it was going to be big once that code word arrived it would already be too late to drop out of anything behind the couriers eventually would come the majority of the men in driblets small enough not to attract attention disguised a dozen ways departing taglios in what i considered their order of plausible risk the last to leave town would be those with the heaviest entanglements all the men would pass through a series of checkpoints and assembly points each time being informed only of an immediate destination the key hope though was that soulcatcher would not begin to catch on until those who were going to go were well away those who refused to go would be excused if they remained loyal to the company interests in the city it would be useful to have a few agents on hand after the company appeared to have gone that too was something the deceivers had done for generations there would be flashy smoke shows the demon niassi would be much more prevalent putting a damper on grey efficiency the men who stayed i would not know who they were because i would be among the first to leave would be expected to undertake what was supposed to look like a series of random assaults breakins and acts of vandalism that later would begin to appear to be part of a terror campaign meant to peak during the druga pavi if soulcatcher took the bait she would spend her time preparing to ambush us there if not every hour bought was an hour farther down the road my brothers would be before the protector realized that we had done the unexpected again and even then i expected her to look in the wrong places for a long time my party was the first to leave taglios we went the morning banh do trang died with me went narayan singh willow swan the radisha drah mother gota and uncle doj riverwalker iqbal singh with his wife suruvhija and two children and baby and his brother runmust in addition we had several goats with small packs and chickens tied to their backs two donkeys one or the other of which gota rode much of the time and an ox cart drawn by a beast we strove hard to keep looking sadder and scruffier than it really was most everyone adopted some form of disguise the shadar trimmed their hair and beards and the whole family adopted vehdna dress i stayed vehdna but became a woman the radisha became a man uncle doj and willow swan shaved their heads and became bhodi disciples swan darkened himself with stain but there was no way to change his blue eyes gota had to do without nyueng bao fashions narayan singh remained exactly the same virtually indistinguishable from thousands of others just like him we looked bizarre but even stranger bands collected to share the rigors of the road and we would collect together only when we camped on the road we stretched out over half a mile one singh brother out front the other in back while river stayed fairly close to me the brothers carried a pair of devices given them by goblin and oneeye if narayan the radisha or swan strayed far from a line running between them choke spells would begin constricting around their throats none of the three had been informed of that we were all supposed to be friends and allies now but i believe in trusting some of my friends more than others on the rock road that the captain had had built between taglios and jaicur we did not catch the eye at all but a crowd like that with a baby and an ox cart and regular vehdna prayers and whatnot is not swift nor did the season help i became thoroughly sick of the rain the last time i traveled down the rock road i rode a giant black stallion that covered the distance between taglios and ghoja on the river main in a day and a night without hurrying four days after leaving the city we were still at least that long from the bridge at ghoja which would be our first dangerous bottleneck in the afternoon uncle doj chose to announce that we had come as close as the road would carry us to the place where he had hidden the copy of the book of the dead aw darn i said i was hoping it would be way farther down the road how are we going to explain having a book if we get stopped doj showed me his palms and a big smile im a priest a missionary blame it on me despite the hardships he was happy come help me dig it up what is this place i asked two hours later we had come into something that might have come from one of murgens old nightmares about kina twenty yards of woods formed a palisade all around it its a graveyard during the chaos of the first shadowlander invasion before the black company came possibly even before you were born one of the shadowlander armies used this as a camp then as a burial ground they planted the trees to conceal the tombs and monuments from enemy eyes noting my appalled expression he added down there they have different customs for dealing with the dead i knew that i had been there i had seen it but never had i seen it so concentrated nor exuding such an air of depression this is grim a spell makes it seem that way they thought they would come back and turn the place into a memorial after they won the war they wanted to keep people away im willing to go along with their wishes this is too creepy for me its not that bad come on this shouldnt take more than a few minutes it did but not a lot longer it was a matter of pulling the door away from one of the fancier tombs and digging out a bundle wrapped in several layers of oilskins this is a place worth remembering doj said as we went away people around here wont come near it people from farther away dont know about it its a good hideout i cant wait youll love the grove of doom too ive been there i didnt like it either but at the time i was too worried about stranglers to be scared of ghosts or ancient goddesses its another good place to hide i am not suspicious by nature the way soulcatcher is but i am suspicious occasionally i am particularly suspicious of reticent old nyueng bao who suddenly turn chatty and helpful the captain hid out there once i said he didnt find the place congenial either whatre you up to up to i dont understand you understand perfectly old man yesterday i was just another jengali albeit one you had to tolerate today suddenly im getting unsolicited advice im being offered the benefit of your accumulated wisdom like im some kind of apprentice you want me to take a turn carrying that he was after all an old man as the pace and pressures have increased and events have taken unexpected but usually favorable twists ive begun reflecting more intently on the wisdom of hong tray on the foresight she showed even upon her devilish sense of humor and i believe im finally beginning to grasp the full significance of her prophecies or of mass quantities of bullfeathers tell it to sahra and murgen next time you see them and put a little honest sentiment into your apologies my attempt to be unpleasant did not subdue him that took the arrival of the afternoon rains a little early a lot heavy supported by a truly ferocious fall of hail along the road dashing out from under the trees where we had left our own party a score of travelers tried to collect the ice before it melted taglians never see snow and rainyseason storms provide the only time they ever see ice unless they travel far down into what used to be the shadowlands to the higher elevations of the dandha presh scavenging hailstones was a young peoples game the old folks pushed under the trees as far as they could get wearing their rain gear the baby would not stop crying she did not like the thunder runmust and iqbal tried to keep an eye on the children as well as to watch unknown travelers closely they were convinced that anyone met on the road might be an enemy spy which seemed a perfectly sensible attitude to me riverwalker prowled cursing the rain that also seemed a perfectly sensible attitude uncle doj did a fine job of not drawing attention to his burden he settled beside gota she began to gripe but without her usual enthusiasm i sat down near the radisha we were calling her tadjik these days i said have you begun to understand why your brother found life on the road so appealing i trust youre being sarcastic not entirely what was the worst crisis you faced today your feet get wet she grunted she got the point i believe it was the politics he resented the fact that no matter what he considered doing there were always a hundred selfish men who wanted to subvert his vision for their own profit you knew him the radisha asked not well not to philosophize with but he wasnt a man who kept his views secret my brother being away mustve changed him a lot more than i thought it could then he never revealed his inner self while he lived in the palace that would have been too risky his power was more secure out there he didnt have to please anyone but the liberator his men came to love him they wouldve followed him anywhere which got most of them killed when you turned on the company hes really alive you arent just manipulating me for your own ends of course i am manipulating you that is but it is true that hes alive all the captured are thats why we left taglios even though we had your side on the run we want our brothers out before we do anything more i heard a whisper sister sister what the radisha had not spoken she eyed me inquisitively i didnt say it i glanced around apprehensively saw nothing must just be the rain in the leaves uhm the radisha was not convinced either hard to believe i really missed goblin and oneeye i found uncle doj again lady insisted that youre a minor wizard if you have any talent at all please use it to see if were being watched or followed once soulcatcher started looking for us outside taglios it should not take long for her crows and shadows to find us uncle doj grunted noncommittally real fear found us the morning after next just when it seemed we had every reason to be positive we had made good time the day before there were no crows around yet and it looked like we would reach the grove of doom before the afternoon rains which meant we could complete our business there and get clear before night fell i was happy a band of horsemen appeared on the road south of us headed our way as they drew nearer it became evident that they were uniformly clad what should we do river asked just hope they arent looking for us keep moving they showed no interest in travelers ahead of us though they forced everyone off the road they were not galloping but were not dawdling either uncle doj drifted nearer the donkey not carrying gota ash wand lay hidden amidst the clutter of tent and tent poles that formed that animals burden several precious fireball projectors were among the bamboo tent poles too we had very few of those left now we would have no more until we fetched lady out of the ground goblin and oneeye could not create them themselves though goblin admitted privately that the opposite would have been the case even just ten years ago they were too old for almost anything that required flexible thought and especially physical dexterity the mist projector was in all probability the last great contribution they would make and most of the nonmagical construction on that had been accomplished using tobos young hands i caught a glint of polished steel from the horsemen left side of the road i told river i want everybody over there when we have to get out of their way but i spoke too late pointman iqbal had already jumped off to the right i hope he has sense enough to get back across after they pass by he isnt stupid sleepy hes out here with us isnt he thats a fact the band of horsemen turned out to be what i expected the forerunners of a much larger troop which in turn proved to be the vanguard of the third territorial division of the taglian army the third territorial division was the great generals personal formation which meant that god had chosen to bring us facetoface with mogaba i tried not to worry about what sort of practical joke god was contemplating only he knows his own heart i just made sure my whole crowd was on the left side of the road i got us loosened up even more then i worried about which of us might be recognizable by mogaba or any veterans who had been around long enough to recall the kiaulune and shadowmaster wars none of us were memorable few of us went back far enough to have crossed paths with the great general that is except uncle doj mother gota willow swan right and narayan singh narayan had been a close ally of the great general in the days before the last shadowmaster war those two had had their wicked heads together innumerable times i will need to alter my appearance what the skinny little deceiver had materialized beside me startling me if he could sneak up like that this will be the great general mogaba not so and he might recognize me even though it has been years since last we stood facetoface you astonish me i admitted i do what the goddess desires of course there is no god but god yet every day i had to deal with a goddess whose impact on my life was more tangible there were times when i had to struggle hard not to think in forgiveness he is like the earth suppose you just borrow some clothing and get rid of your turban though doing nothing struck me as the perfect solution with him as noted before narayan singh resembled the majority of the poor male gunni population i thought mogaba would have trouble recognizing him even if they had been lovers unless narayan gave himself away and how could he do that he was the master deceiver the living saint of the cult that might work singh drifted away i watched him suddenly suspicious he could not be unaware of his own natural anonymity therefore he must be trying to create a predisposed pattern of thought inside my mind i wished i could just cut his throat i did not like what he did to my thinking i could easily become obsessed with concerns about what he was really doing but we needed him we could not collect the key without him even uncle doj did not know exactly what we were seeking he had never actually seen or even known about the key before it was stolen i hoped he would recognize it if he saw it i might spend a little time thinking how we could get around my having given him such solid guarantees that he was willing to travel with us and trust us not to murder the daughter of night while they were separated the cavalry finished clattering past they had paid us no heed since we had not insisted on getting in their way behind them a few hundred yards came the first battalion of infantry as neat clean and impressive as mogaba could keep them while on the march i received several offers of temporary marriage but otherwise the soldiers were indifferent to our presence the third territorial was a welldisciplined professional division an extension of mogabas will and character nothing like the gangs of ragged outcasts that constituted the company we were a military nil anyway we could not get together and fight our weight in lepers today let alone deal with formations like the third territorial croakers heart would be broken when we dragged him out of the ground my optimism began to fade with the soldiers hogging the road we traveled much slower the landmarks showing the way to the grove of doom were in sight but still hours away the cart and the animals could not be pushed on muddy ground i began to watch for a place to sit out the rain though i did not recall any good site from previous visits to the area uncle doj was no help when i asked he told me there is no significant cover closer than the grove someone should go scout that you have reason for concern were dealing with deceivers i did not mention that slink and the band from semchi were supposed to meet us there doj did not need to know and slink might have gotten slowed down if he had to duck around mogabas army and patrols ill go when i can leave without arousing curiosity take swan hes the most likely to give us away the radisha was a risk too though thus far she had shown no inclination to yell for help but riverwalker was close enough to grab her by the throat if she even took a deep breath she was not stupid if she intended to betray us she meant to wait till she could manage it with some chance of surviving the attempt uncle doj and willow swan managed to drift away without attracting attention though uncle had to go without ash wand i joined river and the radisha i noted this country is a lot more developed than it used to be when i was young most of the land between taglios and ghoja was deserted villages were small and poor and supported themselves on minimal tracts of land there were no independent farms in those days now the latter seemed to be everywhere founded by confident and independenceminded veterans or by refugees from the tortured lands that once lay prostrate under the heels of the shadowmasters many of the new farms crowded right up to the road rightofway they made getting off the road difficult at times the force moving north numbered about ten thousand men enough to occupy miles and miles of roadway even without the train and camp followers coming on behind soon it was obvious we would not reach the grove of doom before the rains came and might not get there before nightfall given any choice at all i did not want to be anywhere near the place after dark i had gone in there by night once before ages ago as part of a company raid meant to capture narayan and the daughter of night we murdered a lot of their friends but those two had gotten away i remembered only the fear and the cold and the way the grove seemed to have a soul of its own that was more alien than the soul of a spider murgen once said that being in that place at night was as bad as walking through one of kinas dreams though of this world it had a powerful otherworldly taint i tried to ask narayan about it why had his predecessors chosen that particular grove as their most holy place how had it been different from other groves of those times when humanitys impact on the face of the earth had been so much less why do you wish to know annalist singh was suspicious of my interest because im naturally curious arent you ever curious about how things came to be and why people do the things they do i serve the goddess i waited evidently he deemed that an adequate explanation being somewhat religious myself i could encompass it even though i did not find it satisfying i offered a snort of disgust narayan responded with a smirk she is real he said she is the darkness you see her handiwork around you every day not true untrue little man but if she ever gets loose i think we will this discussion had become terribly uncomfortable suddenly it put me in the position of admitting the existence of a god other than my god which my religion insisted was impossible there is no god but god narayan smirked mogaba did the one good thing he had ever done for me by turning up in person he saved me the rigorous and embarrassing mental gymnastics necessary to reconfigure kina as a fallen angel thrown down into the pit i knew it could be done elements of kina myth could be hammered into conformity with the tenets of the only true religion given a quick coat of blackwash and i would have completed a course of religious acrobatics elegant enough to spark the pride of my childhood teachers mogaba and his staff traveled three quarters of the way toward the rear of the column the great general was mounted which was a surprise he was never a rider before the greater surprise though was the nature of his steed it was one of the sorcerously bred black stallions the company had brought down from the north i had thought they were all dead i had not seen one since the kiaulune wars this one not only was not dead it was in outstanding health despite its age it also appeared bored by the business of travel dont gape riverwalker told me people get curious about why other people are curious i think we can afford to stare some mogaba will feel like he deserves it mogaba looked every bit the great general and mighty warrior he was tall and perfectly proportioned wellmuscled wellclad wellgroomed but for the dust of silver in his hair he looked little older than he had been when first i saw him right after the company captured jaicur from stormshadow he had had no hair then having preferred to shave his head he seemed in a good humor not a condition i had associated with him in the past when all his schemes had come to frustration as the captain just seemed to bumble around and do the one thing that would undo all his efforts as the great general came abreast his mount suddenly snorted and tossed its head then shied slightly as though it had stirred up a snake mogaba cursed although he was never in any danger of losing his seat laughter dropped out of the sky and a white crow fell right behind it alighting precariously atop the pole carried by the great generals personal standardbearer cursing still mogaba failed to note that his steed turned its head to watch me as i passed the darned thing winked i had been recognized the beast must be the very one i had ridden so long ago for so many hundreds of miles i began to get nervous someone amongst mogabas personal guard launched an arrow at the crow it missed it fell not far from runmust who shouted angrily before he thought now the great general vented his spleen upon the archer the horse continued to watch me i fought an urge to run maybe i could get through this yet the white crow squawked something that might have been words but were just racket to me mogabas mount jumped enough to freshen the well of vituperation it faced forward and began to trot the ultimate effect was to divert attention from us southbound scrubs everybody but iqbals suruvhija stared at the ground and walked a little faster soon we were past the worst danger i drifted over beside swan who was still so nervous he stuttered when he tried to crack a joke about pigeons coming to roost on the great general while he was still alive laughter passed overhead the crow up high was almost indistinguishable against the gathering clouds i wished i had someone along who could advise me about that thing for a generation crows have not been good omens for the company but this one seemed to have done us a favor could it be murgen from another time murgen would be watching i was sure but that crow had no way to communicate so maybe so if so this encounter would have been an adventure for him too what with him knowing that if we got caught his chances for resurrection plummeted to zero the passages of the great general held us up long enough that we could not leave the road unremarked until after the rains began falling hard enough to conceal our movements from everyone except someone extremely close by we left the road unnoticed then our travel formation collapsed into a miserable pack only narayan singh showed real eagerness to get to the grove and he did not hurry not often long on empathy i found myself pitying iqbals children swan pointed out itd be to singhs advantage to get us there just after night falls darkness always comes uhn a deceiver aphorism darkness is their time and darkness always comes you dont seem particularly bothered he was hard to hear the rainfall was that heavy im bothered buddy ive been here before it isnt what youd call a good place i could not state that fact with sufficient emphasis the grove of doom was the heart of darkness a spawning ground for all hopelessness and despair it gnawed at your soul unless you were a believer apparently it never seemed to trouble those for whom it was a holy place places are natural sleepy people are good and evil youll change your mind after you get there i got a sneaking suspicion im gonna drown first do we got to be out in this you find a roof ill be glad to get under it big thunder had begun fencing with swords of lightning there would be hail before long i wished i had a better hat maybe one of those huge wovenbamboo things nyueng bao farmers wear in the rice paddies i could just make out riverwalker and the radisha i followed them hoping they were following someone they could see i hoped we did not have anyone get disoriented and lost not tonight i hoped the guys from semchi were where they were supposed to be iqbal appeared in the gloom as the hail began to fall he bent over to try to ease the sting of the missiles i did the same it did not help much iqbal shouted left down the hill theres a stand of little evergreens better than nothing at all swan and i dashed that way the hailstones kept getting bigger and more numerous as the thunder got louder and the lightning closer but the air was cooling down there is a bright side to everything i slipped fell rolled found the trees the hard way by sliding in amongst them uncle doj and gota river and the radisha were in there already iqbal was an optimist i would not have called those darned things trees they were bushes suffering from overweening ambition not a one was ten feet tall and you had to get down on your belly in the damp and needles to enjoy their shelter but their branches did break the fall of the hailstones which rattled and roared through the foliage i started to ask about the animals but then heard the goats bleating i felt a little guilty i do not like animals much i had been shirking my share of their caretaking hailstones dribbled down through the branches and rolled in from outside swan picked up a huge example brushed it off showed it to me grinned and popped it into his mouth this is the life i said when youre with the black company every day is a paradise on earth swan said this would be a superb recruiting tool as those things always do the storm went away we crawled out and counted heads and discovered that not even narayan singh had gone missing the living saint of the stranglers did not want to leave us behind that book really was important to him the rain dwindled to a drizzle we clambered out of the muck many communing bluntly with their preferred gods while we formed up we did not spread out much now except for uncle doj who managed to disappear into a landscape with almost no cover over the next hour we ran into several landmarks i recognized from croakers and murgens annals i kept an eye out for slink and his companions i did not see them i hoped that was a good omen rather than a bad the later it got the more peachy it seemed to narayan singh i was afraid he would curse us all by betraying a genuine smile i considered mentioning his childrens names just to let him know he was weighing on my mind my divination skills were flawless it was dusk when we reached the grove we were all miserable the baby would not stop crying i was developing a blister from walking in wet boots with the possible exception of narayan not a soul amongst us remained missionoriented everybody just wanted to drop somewhere while somebody else got a fire going so we could dry out and get something to eat narayan insisted that we press on to the deceiver temple in the heart of the grove itll be dry there he promised his proposal aroused no enthusiasm though we were barely inside its boundary the smell of the grove surrounded us it was not a pleasant odor i wondered how much worse it was back in the heyday of the deceivers when they murdered people there often and in some numbers the place possessed strong psychic character an eerieness a creepiness gunni would blame that on kina because this was one of the places where a fragment of her dismembered body had fallen or something such despite the fact that kina was also supposed to be bound in enchanted sleep somewhere on or under or beyond the plain of glittering stone gunni do not have ghosts we vehdna do nyueng bao do for me the grove was haunted by the souls of all the victims who died there for kinas pleasure or glory or whatever reason stranglers kill had i mentioned it narayan or one of the more devout gunni would have brought up the matter of rakshasas those malignant demons those evil nightrangers jealous of men and gods alike rakshasas might pretend to be the spirit of someone who had passed on merely as a tool for tormenting the living uncle doj said like it or not narayan is right we should move into the best shelter available we would be no less safe there than here and we would be free of this pestilential drizzle the rain just would not go away i considered him he was old and worn out and had less reason to want to move on than any of us younger folks he must have a reason to want to go on he must know something doj always did getting him to share it was the big trick i was in charge time for an unpopular decision well go ahead grumble grumble grumble the temple projected a presence more powerful than that of the grove i had no trouble locating it without being able to see it walking close behind swan asked me how come you never tore this place down when you were on top i did not understand his question narayan just ahead of me overheard it and did understand they tried more than once we rebuilt it when no one was watching he launched a rambling rant about how his goddess had watched over the builders it sounded like a recruiting speech he kept it up until runmust swatted him with a bamboo pole it was one of those poles too though narayan did not know the grove was a very dark place perfect for an ambush by shadows runmust was not going to go quietly i could not help wondering what evils soulcatcher was up to now that she had complete freedom to work her will upon taglios i hoped the people who stayed behind completed their missions particularly those tasked to penetrate the palace again jaul barundandi had to be recruited and brought in too deep to run before his rage subsided sufficiently for reason to reassert itself the baby continued to cry burrowing into her mothers breast without looking for nourishment the noise worried everyone anyone who wished to visit misfortune upon us would have no trouble tracking us we would be unlikely to hear them sneaking up because of the crying and the sound of drizzle falling from branch to branch in the waterlogged trees river and the company singhs kept their hands on their weapons uncle doj had recovered ash wand and was keeping it handy despite the risk of rust the animals were as thrilled as the infant was the goats bleated and dragged their feet the donkeys kept getting stubborn but mother gota knew a trick or three for getting balky beasts of burden moving a considerable ration of pain was involved the rain never ended narayan singh took the lead he knew the way he was home i felt the dread temple loom before us although i could not see it narayans sandals whispered as they scattered soggy leaves i listened intently but heard nothing new until willow swan started muttering nagging himself for having followed up on the one original idea he had ever had if he had ignored it he could be rocking beside a fireplace in his own home listening to his own grandkids cry instead of tramping through the blue miseries on yet one more mystery quest where the best he could look forward to was to stay alive longer than the people dragging him around then he asked me sleepy you ever consider throwing in with that little turd somewhere an owl screamed which one and why narayan bring on the year of the skulls then we could all finally sit back and relax and not have to slog around in the rain and shit anymore no i havent the owl screamed again it sounded frustrated what sounded like crow laughter answered it taunting but thats what the company set out to do in the first place isnt it to bring on the end of the world a handful of the senior people did apparently but not the guys who actually had to do the work theres a chance they didnt have any idea what it was all about that they marched because staying home might be a less pleasant option some things never change i know that story by heart careful these steps are slicker than greased owl shit he had heard the birds conversing too that was a northern saying that lost something in translation rain or no the goats and donkeys flat refused to move any nearer the deceiver shrine at least until a light took life inside the temple doorway that came from a single feeble oil lamp but in the darkness it seemed almost bright swan observed narayan knows right where to look dont he im watching him every minute for what good keeping a close eye on a deceiver would do to tell the truth i was counting on uncle doj doj would be much harder to trick he was an old trickster himself as a trickmaster i needed to stick to what i knew which was designing wicked plots and writing about them after they ran their course something flapped overhead as i entered the temple owl or crow i did not turn quickly enough to discover the truth i did tell runmust and iqbal keep a close watch while i check this out doj swan come with me you know more about this place than anyone else below river and gota swore vilely as they strove to keep the goats under control iqbals sons had fallen asleep where they stood indifferent to the ongoing rain narayan blocked my advance just steps inside the temple not until i complete the rituals of sanctification otherwise youll defile the holy place it was not my holy place i did not care if i defiled it in fact that sounded like an amusement to be indulged just before i had the place torn down yet again and this time plowed under but i did have to get along for the moment doj keep an eye on him runmust you too he could pick the living saint off with his bamboo if the deceiver tried to be clever we have an understanding narayan reminded me he seemed troubled and not by me he kept poking around like he was looking for something that was supposed to be there but just was not you make sure you hold up your end little man i stepped back outside into a drizzle that had become more of a heavy falling mist sleepy iqbal whispered from the base of the steps check what i found i barely heard him the baby continued to crank longsuffering suruvhija rocked her and hummed a lullaby she was not much more than a girl herself and i suspected not very bright i could not imagine any woman being happy with her life but suruvhija seemed content to go where iqbal led a breeze stirred the branches of the grove what of course i could not see i descended the temple steps into the damp chilly darkness here he shoved something into my hands pieces of cloth fine cloth like silk six or seven pieces each with a weight in one corner i smiled into the face of the night i snickered my faith in god was restored the demon had betrayed her children again slink had gotten to the grove in time slink had been sneakier than any deceiver slink had done his job he was out there somewhere right now covering us ready to offer narayan another horrible surprise i felt much more confident when i went back inside and yelled at narayan get your skinny ass moving singh weve got women and children freezing out here narayan was not a happy living saint whatever he was looking for under cover of fortifying the temple against the defiling presence of unbelievers just was not there to be found i was tempted to toss him the captured rumels i forbore that would only make him angry and tempt him to go back on his agreement i did tell him youve had time enough to sanctify the whole darned woods against the presence of nonbelievers dont you think you forget how miserable it is out here you should cultivate patience annalist its an extremely useful trait in both our chosen careers i forbore mentioning that we had been patient enough to get him tucked into our trick bag then his exasperation surfaced for a moment he hurled something to the floor he was not out of control by much but it was the first time i ever saw him less than perfectly composed when he was supposed to be the master of the situation he whispered something as he beckoned me i do believe he took his goddesss name in vain this new version of the temple was scarcely a shadow of what croaker and lady had survived the present idol was wooden not more than five feet tall and unfinished the offerings before it were all old and feeble the temple as a whole did not possess the sinister grim air of a place where many lives had been sacrificed these were lean times for deceivers narayan persisted in his search i could not bring myself to break his heart by telling him the friends he expected to meet must have fallen foul of the friends id hoped to meet you need to keep a certain amount of mystery in any relationship i said tell me where its all right to spread out and where youd rather we didnt and ill see that we do our best to honor your wishes narayan looked at me like id just sprouted an extra head i told him ive been thinking a lot lately were probably going to be working together for a while itd make things easier for everybody if we all made the effort to respect one anothers customs and philosophies narayan scooted off he began the process of laying a fire and of telling people where they could homestead the temple was not that big inside there would not be much room to spread out there singh would not turn his back on me you spooked him good riverwalker told me hell spend the whole night with his back to the wall trying to stay awake i hope my snoring helps iqbal dont do that the fool had actually started helping mother gota set up to do some cooking that old woman was a menace around a cook fire she was already under a ban throughout the company she could boil water and give it a taste to gag you iqbal grinned a grin that told the world he needed to consult oneeye about his teeth were setting this up for me all right much better much much better after she finished helping iqbal the old woman helped milk the goats now i understood how narayan felt maybe i should keep my back to a wall and watch my dozing too gota was not even complaining and uncle doj had stayed outside presumably to enjoy the refreshing weather and cheerful woods it was dry in that wicked temple but it never got warm i do not believe a brushfire could have routed the chill that inhabited that place that gnawed into your bones and soul like an ancient and ugly spiritual rheumatism even narayan singh felt it he hunched over the fire twitching as though he expected a blow from behind at any minute he muttered something about his faith having been tested enough i do not belong to an empathetic and compassionate brotherhood those who offend us must look forward to moments of extreme discomfort should god in his magnanimity see fit to present us with the opportunity to provide it and our antipathy toward narayan singh was so old it had become ritual so it was not with any commiseration that i told him were prepared to make the exchange our first book of the dead for your key his head came up he stared at me directly the true narayan behind the masked narayan considering me coldly wariness took life in the corners of his eyes how could never mind we have it a swap was the deal and were ready to swap now calculation began to replace caution i would have bet a handsome sum he was assessing his chances of murdering us in our sleep so he would not have to keep his side of the bargain it would be perhaps a less elegant solution than mass murder narayan but why not just do the deal the way we agreed i shivered the temple seemed to be getting colder if that was possible in fact ill give you a bonus once you hand over the key you can go away free as long as you vow not to screw with the black company anymore a vow he would make in an instant i was sure such vows being worth the bark they are written on when they spring from the mouths of deceivers kina would not expect him to keep faith with an unbeliever a truly generous offer annalist singh replied suspiciously let me sleep on it by all means i snapped my fingers iqbal and runmust broke out the shackles put the goatbells on him tonight too we had several of those to go with several goats once attached to narayans shackles they made a racket whenever he moved he was a stealthmaster but not master enough to keep the bells from betraying him but dont be surprised if i dont feel as generous when light and warmth return to the world darkness always comes but the sun also rises i had my blanket around me already i pulled it tighter and lay down squirmed a little in a vain attempt to get comfortable then fell into the sort of evilhaunted dreams apparently experienced by anyone who passes the night in the grove of doom i was aware that i was dreaming and i was familiar with the dreamscapes though i had never visited them myself both lady and murgen had written about them the visual elements did not trouble me terribly but nothing had prepared me for the stench which was the stink of thousandweekold battlefields worse than any stench i remembered from the siege of jaicur countless crows had come to banquet there after a while i began to feel another presence far off but approaching and i was afraid not wanting to come facetoface with narayans dreadful goddess i wanted to run but did not know how murgen had drawn upon years of experience when he eluded kina then i realized i was not being stalked this presence was not inimical in fact it was more aware of me than i of it it was amused by my discomfort murgen tis i my apprentice i thought you d dream here tonight i was right i like being right its one of the joys of bachelorhood i had forgotten until i became a haunt i dont think sahra would appreciate of course not forget that i dont have time therere things you should know and i wont be able to reach you again directly until you enter the dark roads on the glittering plain listen i listened life in taglios was proceeding normally the scandal at the royal library and disappearance of the chief librarian had been played into a major distraction by the protector soulcatcher was more interested in consolidating her position than in rooting out remnants of the black company after all these years she still did not take us as seriously as we wanted or she was completely confident that she could root us out and exterminate us any time she felt like bothering that being a possibility murgens advice was sound we should keep moving fast while that option was available the best news was that jaul barundandi had shown an eager willingness to attach himself to the cause in hopes of avenging his wife his initial assignment to be carried out only if he was confident he could manage without getting caught or leaving evidence was to penetrate the protectors quarters and steal destroy or somehow incapacitate the magical carpets she had stolen from the howler if those could be denied her our position would improve dramatically he was also to recruit allies without telling them that he was helping the black company the ancient hysterical prejudice remained potent it sounded wonderful but i counted on nothing men driven solely by a need for revenge are flawed tools at best if he let the obsession consume him he would be lost to us before he could do any of the quiet longterm things that make an inside man such a treasure the bad news was bad indeed the main party traveling by water had passed through the delta and was now ascending the naghir river meaning it was way ahead of us in terms of time still needed to reach the shadowgate oneeye had suffered a stroke two nights earlier during a drunken knockdowndragout with his best friend goblin death did not claim him goblins swift intercession had prevented that but now he suffered from a mild paralysis and the sort of perplexing speech problems that sometimes come after a stroke the latter made it difficult for oneeye to communicate to goblin what goblin needed to know to cope with the problem the words oneeye wanted to say or write were not the words that came out a problem that is maddening enough for the ordinary annalist coping only with time constraints and native stupidity you cannot prepare yourself enough the inevitable is always a shock when it lowers its evil wing as if responding to a great joke the circling crows rattled with dark mocking laughter the skulls in the bonefield grinned enjoying the grand joke too there were more minor bits of news once murgen exhausted his store i asked can you reach slink if hes here can you put a thought into his empty head possibly try with this my idea amused murgen he hurried off to haunt slinks certaintobestrange dreams the crows scattered as though there was nothing interesting keeping them around anymore i continued to people the place of nightmare hoping i would not become a regular as had befallen lady and murgen i wondered if lady still went there making her interment that much more a session in hell a crow landed high up in a barren tree against the face of what passed for a sun in that place i could not distinguish it but it seemed different from the other crows sister sister i am with you always terror reached down inside me and squeezed my heart with a fist of iron i shot bolt upright panic and confusion swamped me as i grabbed for my weapons doj stared at me from beyond the fire nightmares i shivered in the cold yes theyre the bad side of staying here but you can learn to shut them out i know what to do about them get away from this godforsaken place as soon as i can tomorrow early right after the deceiver turns over the key and you authenticate it i thought i heard faint crow laughter in the night outside i took my turn on watch i discovered that i was not the only one with problem dreams everyone slept poorly including narayan iqbals baby never stopped whimpering the goats and donkeys though not allowed inside also bleated and snorted and whimpered all night long the grove of doom is just plain a bad place no way around that some things are black and white morning was not much more pleasant than night had been and even before breakfast narayan tried to sneak away riverwalker showed remarkable restraint in bringing him back still able to walk you were going to run out on me now i demanded i had a good idea what he really had in mind but did not want him to suspect i knew what had become of the friends he had expected to rescue him i thought you wanted that book back he shrugged i had a dream last night and it wasnt a good dream it took me places i didnt want to go with beings i didnt want to see but it was a true dream i came away with the certainty that neither of us has any chance of getting what we want if we dont fulfill our ends of our bargain so im here to tell you im playing it straight up the book of the dead for the key narayan betrayed a flicker of annoyance at my mention of a dream no doubt he had hoped for divine guidance and had failed to receive it last night i just wanted to look for something i left here last time i visited the key no a personal trinket he squatted beside the cook fire where mother gota and suruvhija were preparing rice the radisha to the amazement of all was trying to help or better put was trying to learn what was being done so she could help at another time neither woman offered the princesss status any special respect gota snarled and complained at the radisha exactly as she would have done with the rest of us i watched narayan eat he used chopsticks i had not noticed that before paranoid me i searched my memory trying to remember if singh had used the customary wooden spoon in the past uncle doj like all nyueng bao used chopsticks and he claimed they constituted some of his deadliest weapons i was going to go crazy if i did not get narayan out of my life for a while he smiled as though he was reading my mind i think maybe he put too much faith in my word on behalf of the company show me the book annalist i looked around doj the man appeared in the temple doorway what was he up to in there yes the master deceiver wishes to see the book of the dead as you wish he descended the leafstrewn outer steps rummaged through one of the donkey packs came up with the oilskin package we had retrieved from the shadowlander tomb he presented it to the deceiver with a bow and a flourish stepped back and crossed his arms i noted that in some mystic manner ash wand had found its way onto his back i recalled that dojs adopted family bore narayan singh and the strangler cult an abiding grudge deceivers had murdered to tan the son of sahras brother thai dei thai dei lay buried beneath glittering stone with the captured uncle doj had offered no promises to narayan singh i wondered if singh knew all that most of it probably though the subject never arose in his presence i noted also that without plan or signal my other companions had placed themselves so that we were surrounded by armed men only swan seemed unsure of his role settle and have some rice i told him i hate rice sleepy were going places where therell be a little more variety i hope ive eaten rice till its coming out my ears too narayan opened the oilskins reverently set them aside one by one ready to be reused the book he revealed was big and ugly but not much distinguished it from volumes i saw every day when i was dorabee dey banerjae nothing branded it the most holy most sacred text of the darkest cult in the world narayan opened it the writing inside was completely inelegant erratic disorganized and sloppy the daughter of night had begun inscribing it when she was four as narayan turned the pages i saw that the girl was a fast learner her hand improved rapidly i saw too that she had written in the same script used to record the first volume of the annals were both in the same language where was master santaraksita when i needed him out on the naghir with sahra and oneeye no doubt complaining about the accommodations and the lack of fine dining too bad old man i have the same problems here satisfied that its genuine i asked narayan could not deny it so ive lived up to my half of the bargain i have in fact made every effort to facilitate it the game is back to you now you have nothing to lose annalist i still wonder how i would get away from here alive i wont do anything to keep you from leaving if revenge is absolutely necessary itll be that much sweeter down the road narayan tried to read my true intentions he was incapable of accepting anything at face value on the other hand theres no way youll go anywhere if you dont produce the key and well know if you try to pass off a substitute i looked at doj narayan did the same then he settled into an attitude of prayer and sealed his eyes kina may have responded the grove did turn icy cold a sudden breeze brought a ghost of the odor from the place of the bones singh shuddered opened his eyes i have to go into the temple alone wouldnt be a back way out of there would there singh smiled softly would it do me any good if there were not this time your only way out of here is not to be a deceiver so be it therell be no year of the skulls if i dont take a chance let him go i told doj who stood between narayan and the temple river and runmust i noted now had bamboo in hand in case the little man made a break hes been in there a long time river complained but hes still there doj assured us the key must be well hidden or not there anymore i did not say whatre we looking at here i asked doj im not clear on what this key is is it another lance head the lance of passion had opened the plain to croaker then had ushered the captured to their doom ive only heard it described its a strangely shaped hammer hes about to come out narayan appeared he seemed changed invigorated frightened riverwalker gestured with his bamboo runmust raised his slowly singh knew what those poles could do he had no chance if he tried to run now he carried what looked like a castiron war hammer old rusty and ugly with the head all chipped and cracked narayan made it seem heavier than it looked doj i asked what do you think fits the description annalist except for the head being all cracked singh said i dropped it it cracked when it hit the temple floor feel it doj if theres any power there you ought to be able to tell doj did as i said once singh surrendered the hammer the nyueng bao seemed startled by its weight this must be it annalist take your book and start running deceiver before temptation makes me forget my promises narayan clutched the book but did not move he stared at suruvhija and the baby suruvhija was using a red silk scarf to dab spitup off the infants chin fools idiots while we were getting ready to travel one of iqbals kids the older boy noticed a particularly deep flaw in the head of the hammer the rest of us had been too busy congratulating ourselves and deciding what the company would do once we brought the captured forth from the plain the boy got his fathers attention iqbal summoned runmust and me being old folks it took us a while to see what the boy meant us having bad eyes and all looks like gold in there that would explain the weight doj come here you ever hear anything about this hammer being gold inside iqbal began prying with a knife a fragment of iron fell away no doj said dont damage it any more everybody calm down its still the key doj study it carefully i dont want all the years and all the crap we went through to go to waste now what weapons had begun to appear look whos here swan said where did those guys come from slink and his band had arrived i exchanged looks with slink he shrugged gave us the slip im not surprised we screwed up here he knew somebody was out there suruvhija still had the red scarf draped over her shoulder folks we need to get traveling we want to get across the bridge at ghoja before the protector starts looking for us from the beginning i had pretended that getting across that bridge would give us a running chance i told slink you guys did a great job at semchi couldve been better if id thought about it idve waited till they damaged the bhodi tree then wed have been heroes instead of just bandits i shrugged next time swan tell that goat were going to eat it if it dont start cooperating you promise i promise well get some real food when we get to jaicur our crossing at ghoja was another grand anticlimax we all worked ourselves into a state of nerves before we reached the bottleneck i sent slink forward to scout and did not believe a word emotionally when he reported the only attention being paid anyone went to those few travelers who argued about paying a twocopper pais toll for use of the bridge these tightwads were commended to the old ford downstream from the bridge a ford that was impassable because this was the rainy season traffic was heavy the soldiers assigned to watch the bridge were too busy loafing and playing cards to harass wayfarers some part of me was determined to expect the worst ghoja had grown into a small town serving those who traveled the rock road which was one of the black companys lasting legacies the captain had had the highway paved from taglios to jaicur during his preparations for invading the shadowlands prisoners of war had provided the labor more recently mogaba had used convicts to extend the road southwestward adding tributaries to connect the cities and territories newly taken under taglian protection once we were safely over the main i began to ponder our next steps i gathered everyone is there any way we could forge a rescript ordering the garrison here to arrest narayan if he crosses the bridge doj told me youre too optimistic if hes going south hes already ahead of us swan added not to mention that if he fell into the protectors hands shed find out everything he knows about you the voice of an expert heard i didnt take the job voluntarily all right she could yes he knows where were headed and why and that we have the key but what does he know about the other bunch if he doesnt get caught wont he try to intercept them so he can do something about getting the daughter of night away from them no one found any cause to disagree i suggest we remind one another of that occasionally so it gets said sometime when murgen is around to hear it sahra never promised to spare narayans ragged old hide maybe she could ambush him and take back that unfinished first book of the dead swan pointed out that crow is still following us a small but lofty fortification overlooked the bridge and ford from the south bank the bird was up top watching us it had not moved since our crossing maybe it wanted to rest its bones too river whispered we still have one bamboo pole with crowkilling balls in it leave it alone it doesnt seem to mean any harm for now anyway i was sure it had tried to communicate several times we can take it out if anything changes at ghoja we heard nothing but the traditional grumbling about those in charge rumors concerning events in taglios seemed so exaggerated that no one believed a tenth of anything they heard later after we reached jaicur and were taking it easy for a while the temper of rumor began to change it now carried a subtle vibration suggesting the great spider at the heart of the web had begun to stir it would be a long time before any concrete news caught up but the general consensus was that we should get going right now and not dawdle along the way runmust discovered that a man answering narayans description had been seen lurking in the vicinity of the shop operated by his nowpseudonymous offspring sugriva the man does have a weakness should we kill sugriva while were here hes never done anything to us his father did it would be a reminder to him he doesnt need reminding if narayan is so dim that he thinks were done with him now let him just let me be there to see the look on his face when we catch him again narayan had stood out in jaicur because the city was still very nearly a military encampment people would remember us as well if asked during the next few weeks i roamed around looking for my childhood a few times but nothing that i remembered people or places good or evil remained that past survived nowhere but within my mind which was the one place i wished that it could die the practical rules of company field operations resemble those obeyed by stage magicians we would prefer our audience saw nothing at all but we do realize that invisibility is impractical so we try to show the watcher something other than what he is looking for thus the goats and donkeys and south of jaicur all new looks and identities for everybody with the enlarged party breaking up into two independently traveling families plus a group of failed southern fortunehunters dragging home in despair and defeat after having had their spirits crushed by the taglian experience there were quite a few men of the latter sort around they had to be watched many were not above taking advantage of weaker parties if they thought they could manage it the roads were not patrolled anymore the protector did not care if they were safe doj and swan gota and i formed the advance party we looked weak but that old man was worth four or five ordinary mortals we had only one scrape it was over in seconds several blood trails led off into the brush doj had chosen to leave no one dead the land became less hospitable and rose steadily in clear air it was possible to look ahead and catch the faintest glimpse of the peaks of the dandha presh still many days journey south of us the paved road ended alongside an abandoned work camp they mustve run out of prisoners swan observed the camp had been stripped of everything portable what they ran out of is enemies soulcatcher thought were worth an investment in a road she could always find people she doesnt like and use them up in an engineering project and she had done so on the western route which was being followed by the rest of the company they would have paved footing all the way to charandaprash their road and the waterways serving it had remained under construction until just a few years ago when the protector evidently decided the kiaulune wars really were over that it was not necessary to make life easy for the great general and his men and bullied the radisha into no longer spending the money i wondered what the radishas perspective would be i suspected she had believed she was in charge right up to the moment we disappeared her then she had begun getting an education here amongst her faithful subjects we reached lake tanji which i love the lake is a vast sprawl of icy indigo beauty when i was a lot younger we fought our deadliest encounter with the things that had given the shadowmasters their names there more than a decade later you could still see places where rock had melted if you went exploring some of the narrow gulches scarring the hillsides you could find clutches of human bones that had come back to the surface with time this is a place of dark memory doj remarked he had been here for that battle too and so had gota who had stopped complaining long enough to deal with her memories also she really did have a lot of pain these days the white crow streaked overhead it dropped down the slope ahead vanished into the ragged foliage of a tall mountain pine we saw that bird almost every day now there was no doubt it was following us swan swore that it had tried to strike up a conversation with him once when he was out in the brush relieving himself when i asked what it wanted he said hey i got the hell out of there sleepy ive got problems enough i dont need to get known as a guy who gossips with birds too it mightve had something interesting to say without a doubt and if it really wants to tell somebody something badly enough itll come talk to you right now swan looked down the slope and said its hiding from something but not from us i looked back up the slope the ground appeared untouched up there there was no sign of other travelers below me downhill the meandering track appeared occasionally upon the slope and along the shore both of which were deserted this was no longer a popular route i could retire beside that lake i told swan must not be the best place or somebody wouldve beaten you to it he had a point this country was far emptier now than it had been twenty years ago then there had been villages around the lake there you go swan said looking back what i looked it took a moment oh the bird not just a bird a crow the regular kind of crow your eyes are better than mine ignore it if we dont pay it any special attention it shouldnt have any reason to concentrate on us my heartbeat was rising though maybe it was just a feral crow and had nothing to do with soulcatcher crows are not fastidious about their dining or maybe the protector had at last begun looking for us outside of taglios white crow in hiding black crow in the air searching what did it mean not much we could do about it whatever though uncle doj had a calculating eye whenever he looked up at the black crow it lost interest after a while it went away i told the others that shouldnt be a problem crows are smart for birds but one by itself cant remember a lot of instructions or carry much information back if it is one of hers we had to assume that it was crows were much less common than they used to be those remaining always seemed to be under soulcatchers control her control was probably why they were dying out if this one was a scout for the protector it would be days yet before it could report doj observed if it was suspicious we can expect to have shadows around in a few days that would be soulcatchers best means of scouting us shadows traveled faster than crows could be given much more complex instructions and could bring back far more information but could soulcatcher control them so far away the original shadowmasters had had major difficulties managing their pets over long distances we passed along the shores of lake tanji each of us seized an opportunity to bathe in the icy water the old road then led us on to the plain of charandaprash where the black company had won one of its greatest triumphs and the great general had suffered his most humiliating defeat through no fault of his own though a capricious history would not recall the blame due his cowardly master longshadow wreckage from that battle still lay scattered across the slopes a small garrison watched over the approaches to the pass through the dandha presh it showed no interest in clearing any mess or even in monitoring traffic nobody looked my group over nobody asked questions we were assessed an unofficial toll and warned that the donkey might find the footing treacherous in the high pass because there was still ice on the rocks up there we did learn that there had been heavier traffic than usual lately that told me that sahras group had encountered no insuperable difficulties and was ahead of us as it should be even with all the old men and reluctant companions the mountains were far colder and more barren than the highlands we had crossed i wondered how the radisha was handling it about her thoughts concerning the empire she had acquired mostly thanks to the company doubtless her eyes had been opened some they needed a lot of opening she had spent most of her life cooped up inside the palace the white crow turned up every few days but its darker kinfolk did not maybe the protector was preoccupied elsewhere i wished i had murgens talent for leaving his body i had not had so much as a good dream since leaving the grove of doom i knew exactly as little as everyone else and that was extremely frustrating after having had easy access to secrets from afar for so long nights in the mountains get really cold i told swan i was tempted to take up his suggestion that we go off somewhere and set up housekeeping in our own tavern and brewery when it got really cold a few lesser sins did not seem to matter the timing of events in taglios is uncertain because the principal reporter murgen had maintained such a casual relationship with the concept for the last decade and a half but his sketchy descriptions of events in the city following our departure are of more than passing interest at first the protector suspected nothing the staybehinds planted smoke buttons and started rumors but with a declining enthusiasm the taglian peoples began to sense at the same time though the populace developed an abiding suspicion that the protector had done away with the reigning princess the people became less tractable by the hour the arrival of the great general and his forces guaranteed the peace moreover it freed the protector to go hunting enemies instead of spending her time making sure her friends remained intimidated enough to continue supporting her in just days she found the nyueng bao warehouse on the waterfront empty now except for a few cages occupied by missing members of the privy council none of whom were in shape to resume their duties an armamentarium of booby traps came with the prodigal ministers of course but none of those were clever enough to inconvenience soulcatcher herself quite a few greys were not so fortunate the protector took rather a heartless view of those who did fall victim to the company legacy better to get the dimwits winnowed out now when the broader risk is minimal she told mogaba the great generals attitude complemented hers precisely questions asked in the neighborhood produced no information of substance however vigorously they were put the nyueng bao merchants had been careful to maintain a veil around themselves and their businesses they had even employed the magical in their quest for greater anonymity wisps of confusion spells persisted yet i smell those two wizards soulcatcher muttered but you promised me that they were dead didnt you great general i saw them die myself youd better hope you dont irritate me so much you dont survive to see them die again for real her voice was that of a spoiled child the great general did not respond if soulcatcher frightened him he showed no sign neither did he betray any anger he waited reasonably confident that he was too valuable to become the victim of an evil caprice perhaps in his heart of hearts he thought the protector was not equally valuable theres no trace of them soulcatcher mumbled later in a voice academically cool theyre gone yet the impression of their presence persists as bold as a bucket of blood thrown against a wall illusion mogaba said im sure youd find a hundred instances in the black company annals of where they drew an enemys eye in one direction while they moved in another or made someone believe their numbers were far greater than they actually were youd find as many instances in my diaries if i bothered to keep any i dont because books are nothing but repositories for those lies the author wants his reader to believe the voice she used now was the antithesis of academic it was that of a man who knew from painful experience that education just taught people sneakier ways to rob you they arent here anymore but they may have left spies of course they did its doctrine but youll have a hell of a time finding them they wont be people anyone else would suspect jaul barundandi and two of his assistants laid out a dinner while the protector and her champion talked their presence attracted no notice paranoid though she was soulcatcher paid little heed to the furniture every staffer had been interrogated in the hours following the radishas disappearance and no inside accomplices had been found the protector was not unaware that she was not as beloved of the staff as the radisha had been but she was not troubled no mundane attacker had any genuine hope of penetrating her personal defenses and these days she had no peer in this world sheer perversity and protracted elusiveness had put her in a position to elect herself queen of the world if she wanted to bother someday when she got her head organized she was going to have to think about that halfway through a rare meal soulcatcher paused in midchew she told mogaba find me a nyueng bao any nyueng bao right now right away the lean black man showed no emotion as he rose may i ask why their headquarters was inside a nyueng bao warehouse nyueng bao have been associated with the company since the fighting at dejagore the last annalist married one of them he had a child by her the association may be more than historical happenstance she knew a great deal more about nyueng bao than she was willing to share of course mogaba inclined his upper body in a ghost of a bow mostly he was comfortable working with soulcatcher mostly he approved of her thinking he went in search of someone who could catch him a couple of swamp monkeys the servants hovered around the protector perfectly attentive idly she noted that these three were among the same half dozen who struggled to make her life easier wherever she happened to be in the palace in fact one or more always followed her on her exploratory safaris into the maze of abandoned corridors that made up the majority of the palace just in case she needed something lately they had brought life into her personal quarters which for so long had been as chill and barren and dusty as the empty sectors it was their nature it was bred into them they must serve without the radisha to fulfill their need for a master they had had to turn to her mogaba was away hours longer than she liked when the man did deign to return her voice of choice was spoiledbrat querulous where have you been what took you so long ive been demonstrating how hard it is to catch the wind there are no nyueng bao anywhere in the city the last time anyone can remember seeing any of them was the day before yesterday in the morning they were going aboard a barge that later headed downriver toward the swamps evidently the swamp people have been leaving taglios since before the radisha disappeared and you hurt your heel soulcatcher growled she did not want to be reminded that she had been tricked the heel itself was reminder enough the nyueng bao are a stubborn people famous for it mogaba agreed ive visited them twice before each time they failed to appreciate my full message i suppose ill have to go preach to them again and round up any fugitives theyve taken in it was an obvious conclusion that the company survivors had retreated into the swamps the nyueng bao had taken in fugitives before and supportive evidence was available if the protector cared to dig the barges carrying the majority of the company had gone downriver you had to go down into the delta to get to the naghir river which was the principal navigable waterway leading into the south soulcatcher popped up she rushed out with the bounce and enthusiasm of a teenager mogaba settled down to contemplate the remains of his meal which had not yet been cleared away one of the servants murmured we thought you might wish to continue sir should you prefer otherwise we will clear away instantly mogaba looked up into a bland face that projected eagerness to serve nevertheless he had a momentary impression that the man was measuring his back for a dagger take it away im not hungry as you wish sir girish take the leftovers to the charity postern make certain the beggars there know that the protector is thinking of them mogaba watched the servants depart he wondered what had given him the impression that that man was insincere the truth supposedly lay in a mans deeds and that one never behaved as anything less than a totally devoted servant soulcatcher stamped into her personal suite the more she thought about the nyueng bao the more enraged she became what would it take to teach those people that seemed like something they could work out between them before the sun came up a night of shadowterror ought at the very least to put them into a mood to pay attention soulcatcher understood herself better than outsiders believed she did she wondered why she was in so foul a temper which seemed to go beyond her usual caprice and irritability she belched hammered her chest with a fist to loosen another burp maybe it was the spicy food she sensed bad heartburn coming she felt a little lightheaded too she climbed to the parapet where she kept the only two flying carpets left in the world that could be reached only by the route she followed she would go down there and make those swamp monkeys pay for the heartburn too dinner had been a nyueng bao ethnic specialty consisting of big ugly mushrooms uglier eels and unidentifiable vegetables in a blisteringly spicy sauce served upon a bed of rice it had been a favorite of the radishas served often the kitchens had not changed their routines because the protector did not care about the menu the protector belched again the growing heartburn seared her insides she jumped on the larger carpet it creaked under her weight she ordered it to head downriver fast a few miles out four hundred feet above the rooftops streaking faster than a racing pigeon sabotaged frame members under the carpet began to snap once the first went the stress became too much for the others the carpet disintegrated in seconds a burst of light flared bright enough to be seen by half the city the last thing soulcatcher saw as she arced toward the surface of the river was a huge circle of characters declaring water sleeps just before the flash leaped through his window a bemused mogaba discovered a folded sealed letter on his spartan cot belching glad he had eaten no more of that spicy food he broke the wax and read my brother unforgiven then the unexpected lightning grabbed his attention he read the slogan in the sky too all the labor he had invested in learning to read over the past few years was to be rewarded thus what now if the protector was gone pretend she was in hiding too and make the deceit a double veil he belched again settled down on his cot he did not feel well at all that was a baffling new feeling for him he never got sick a chatty youngster of native stock and a more than customarily ambitious disposition interviewed us at the military control point we encountered at the southern end of the pass he was not yet old enough to be pompously officious but he would get there personally he seemed more interested in foreign news than in contraband or wanted men whats going on up north he wanted to know weve seen a lot of refugees lately he examined our meager possessions without ever looking inside anything gota and doj rattled at one another in nyueng bao and pretended not to understand the young mans accented taglian i shrugged and responded in jaicuri at first which is close enough to taglian for the two peoples to understand one another most of the time but here it only frustrated the young official i had no desire to stand around gossiping with a functionary i do not know about others we have had nothing but decades of misfortune and suffering we heard there were opportunities down here so we abandoned the land of our sorrows and came the official assumed i meant a particular country as i had hoped rather than recognizing that the land of our sorrows was the vehdna way of describing where a convert lived before he became acquainted with god you say there are many others doing the same as us i tried to sound troubled recently yes which is why i feared something might be afoot he feared for the stability of the empire to which he had attached himself i could not resist a prank there were rumors that the black company had surfaced in taglios and was warring with the protector but there are always crazy stories about the black company they never mean anything and they had nothing to do with our decision the young man became more unhappy he passed us through without further interest i did not bother commending him but he was the only official we had encountered since leaving taglios who was making a serious effort to perform his duties and he was doing it only in hopes of getting ahead i never had to bring out the richly complex legend i have invented for our foursome in which swan was my second husband gota the mother of my deceased first spouse and doj her cousin all of us survivors of the wars the story would have played in any region where there had been any extended fighting splatchcobbled family survival teams were not at all uncommon i complained i worked on weaving us a history all the way down here and i never got to use it not once nobodys doing their job doj smiled and winked and vanished into the broken ground beside the road off to reclaim the weapons we had hidden before approaching the checkpoint somebody should do something about that swan declared next viceregal subofficer i see ill march right up and give him a piece of my mind we all pay taxes we have a right to expect more effort from our officials gota woke up long enough to call swan an idiot in taglian and nyueng bao she told him he ought to shut up before even the god of fools renounced him then she closed her eyes and resumed snoring gota had begun to concern me she had shown less life every day for the past few months doj seemed to think she believed she no longer had anything to live for maybe sahra could get her going again we should be joining up with the others before long maybe sahra could get her excited about rescuing thai dei and the captured i was troubled about consequences all these years i had striven toward the undertaking we would launch before long and now for the first time i had begun to wonder what success might really mean those people buried out there never were paragons of sanity and righteousness they had had almost two decades to ferment in their own juices they were unlikely to entertain much brotherly love toward the rest of the world and then there was the guardian demon shivetya and somewhere the enchanted and enchained thing worshipped by narayan singh and the daughter of night not to mention the mysteries and dangers of the plain itself and all the perils we did not yet know only swan had any experience of that he had nothing positive to report nor had murgen at any time over the years though his experiences had been dramatically different from swans murgen had experienced the glittering plain in two worlds at once swan seemed to have experienced the version in our world in sharper focus even after so many years he could describe particular landmarks in exquisite detail how come you never talked about this before i never hid it sleepy but there just dont seem to be much percentage in volunteering anything in this world if i admit anything i know about that place next thing ill know is good old willow swan is elected to go back up there as the guide for a gang of invaders guaranteed to irritate the shit out of whatever spirits haunt the place am i right or am i right you arent as stupid as you let on i thought you didnt see any spirits not the way murgen claimed he saw them but that dont mean i didnt feel them creeping around youll find out you try to sleep at night when you feel hungry shadows calling you from a few feet away its like being inside a zoo with all the predators in the world slavering just the other side of the bars bars that you cant see and cant even feel and so have no way of knowing if theyre trustworthy and all this jabber aint doing my nerves any good at all neither sleepy we may never have to go up there swan if the key weve got is a fake or isnt any good anymore then there wont be anything we can do but maybe set up your brewery and pretend we never heard of the protector or the radisha or the black company be still my heart you know goddamn well that things going to be the true key your god my gods somebodys gods have got a boner for willow swan and theyre gonna keep making sure that whatever happens its gonna be the worst possible thing and its gonna happen to me i oughta run out on you now i oughta turn you in to the nearest royal official only that would let soulcatcher know that im still alive then shed get real nasty asking me why i didnt turn you in three four months ago not to mention youd probably get yourself dead long before you could unearth an official who cared enough to listen to you theres that too doj came back with the weapons we passed them around resumed traveling swan continued eloquently describing himself as the firstborn son of misfortune he went through these spells of high drama a half mile down the road we encountered a small peasants market a few old folks and youngsters who could not contribute much on the farm waited to take advantage of travelers still shaking from the miseries of the mountains fresh foods in season were their hot sellers but they retailed gossip at no charge as long as you contributed a few snippets of your own they found doings beyond the dandha presh particularly intriguing i asked a young girl who looked like she could be the little sister of the customs official back up the road do you remember many of the people who came through here my father was supposed to have come down ahead of us to find us a place to settle i proceeded to describe narayan singh in detail the child was a lighthearted thing without a care or concern chances were she did not recall what she had eaten for breakfast she did not remember narayan but went off to find someone who might where was she when i was young enough to get married swan grumbled shell be pretty when shes older and she doesnt have a brain in her head to complicate things buy her bring her along raise her up right im not as pretty as i used to be i tried to think of someone who was not even sahra qualified i waited swan muttered doj and gota wandered around uncle swapping tales and mother examining the wares for sale except for the produce those were feeble she did acquire a scrawny chicken the one positive of our travel team was that there were no gunni or shadar to complicate mealtime only gota who kept trying to do the cooking maybe i could murder the chicken in her sleep and get it roasted before she woke up the girl brought a very old man he was no help either he seemed interested only in telling me what he thought i wanted to hear but it did seem possible that narayan had come through the pass some time before we had i hoped murgen was on the job and had alerted the others to the possibilities doj and gota headed on down the road before i finished with the locals surprised that my command of the language was adequate to the task evidently gota was tired of riding the donkey certainly could use the break is that a pet the small girl asked its a donkey i said really astonished that i had been having so little trouble communicating they had donkeys down here did they not i know that i meant the bird huh well the white crow was perched on the donkeys pack it winked it laughed it said sister sister and flapped into the air then glided on down the mountain swan said i was just thinking i found an up side to this trip its not raining down here maybe ill see if theyll let me have the child in exchange for your strong back were getting a little too domestic here goodwife sleepy didnt you ever have a real name anyanyadir the lost princess of jaicur but even now my wicked stepmother has discovered that i still live and has summoned the princes of the rakshasas to bargain with them for my murder hey im kidding im sleepy and youve known me practically since i started being sleepy off and on so just let it be once we cleared the mountains it was no long journey to the site of kiaulune incredible destruction had been wrought there during the shadowmaster wars then during the kiaulune wars between the radisha and those who chose to keep faith with the black company a pity most of the wreckage had been cleared away even before soulcatcher decided she could declare victory and go north to claim her new place as protector of all the taglias the radisha should have seen it at its worst to understand what she had wrought by betraying her contract with the company but the worst now existed only in the memories of survivors the onceclamorous valley now boasted a sizable town and a checkerboard of new farms peopled by a mixture of natives former prisoners of war and deserters from every conceivable faction peace had broken out and was being enthusiastically exploited on the presumption that it could not possibly last the transition from the old kiaulune once called shadowcatch and the new simply called the new town saw one thing remain unchanged over there on the far slope of the valley miles and miles away beyond the crumbled brushstrewn ruins of oncemighty overlook where the land quickly changed from rich green to almost barren brown was the dreaded thing called the shadowgate it did not stand out but i felt its call i told my companions we have to be careful not to get in a hurry now haste could be deadly the shadowgate was not just the only way we could get up onto the plain to go free the captured it was also the only portal through which the shadows imprisoned up there could escape and begin treating the whole world the way their cousins had the destitute of taglios and that gate was in tender shape the shadowmasters had injured and weakened it badly when gaining access to the shadows they enslaved were in complete agreement on that uncle doj replied all the lore emphasizes the need for caution there had been some disagreement between us lately he had resumed his romance with the idea of the company annalist becoming his understudy in the peculiar role he played among the nyueng bao the company annalist who had no great interest in the job but doj was one of those people who just have grave difficulties getting their minds around the concept no thats new i said indicating a small structure a quarter mile below the shadowgate beside the road and i dont like its looks it was hard to tell from so far but the structure looked like a small fortification built of stone salvaged from the rubble of overlook doj grunted a potential complication swan observed we keep standing around looking like spies somebodys going to get unpleasant with us a point not without substance although those in charge seemed awfully lax it was obvious that trouble had not visited in a while quite probably not since the black company left somebody probably named me because im the only one here who looks like what she says she is will have to go scout around the original plan had been for everybody to camp in the barrens not far downhill from where that new structure now stood i was troubled someone should have been watching for us to come out of the mountains i hoped that was just sahras oversight she had been married to the company for an age but never did learn to think like a soldier if nobody offered good advice or she chose to ignore the advice she was given because like many civilians she could not grasp why all the little horsepuckey things have to be done she might not have thought it important to watch for us i prayed it was as simple as that nobody demanded that i give them the role of scout poor me more sore feet while the rest of them loafed around in the shade of young pines the white crow materialized minutes after i turned the knee of a hill and the others were out of sight it swooped at me and squawked it swooped at me again i tried to swat it like it was some huge really annoying bug it laughed and came back now squawking what sounded like words i got it finally the bird wanted me to follow it lead on fell harbinger never forgetting that im not gunni and therefore hobbled by no holy ban against eating meat i had enjoyed if that is the proper word crow stew several times during the lowest lows of my military career the crow had only my interests at heart it led me straight to a large tent village on a hillside overlooking the near outskirts of the new town our people had to be only some of the refugees housed there but sahras hand was obvious everywhere the layout was neat and orderly and clean exactly as the captains rules insisted though those are honored mainly in the breech when he is not around i suffered an immediate conflict charge ahead to see everyone i had missed for months or run back and collect my traveling companions once i started gabbing it might be hours before my choice got made for me tobo spotted me my first warning was a shout sleepy a mass of churning arms and legs charged in from the left and collected me in a totally unexpected hug i wriggled loose youve grown a lot he was taller than me now and his voice had deepened you wont be able to be shiki anymore the great men of taglios will be brokenhearted goblin says its time i start breaking the girls hearts anyway there was not much doubt that he would have the power to do that he was going to be a handsome man who had no lack of confidence uncharacteristically i slipped an arm around his waist and walked down toward where other familiar faces had begun to appear how was your journey mostly kind of fun except when they made me study which was about all the time sri surendranath is worse than goblin but he says i could be a scholar so mother always backs them up whenever anybody wants to make me study but we got to see a lot of neat things there was this temple in praiphurbed that was completely covered with carvings of people doing it all different ways oh im sorry he reddened tobo had a mental image of me as a sort of chaste nun and most of my adult life would not contradict that view but i am not against interpersonal adventures i am just not interested myself probably because swan insists i have not yet run into the man whose animal presence completely overwhelms my intellectual reluctance swan being a leading authority in his own mind he keeps volunteering who knows maybe someday i will become curious enough to experiment just to find out if i can be touched without running away to my place to hide now the others were wishing me welcome with a sincerity that set another place inside me a small warm place all aglow my comrades my brothers all kinds of rattle and chatter inundated me now we were going to do something now we were going to get somewhere now we were going to kick some ass if we had to sleepy was here to figure it all out and tell everybody where and when to stick the knife god knows all the secrets and all the jokes i said and i wish hed share the secret of the joke that explains why he created such a scruffy bunch of hired killers i used a little finger to get rid of a tear before anybody realized that it was not raining you guys look pretty fat for having been on the road so long somebody said shit we been here waiting for you for a whole fuckin month some of us the slowest ones got here last week hows oneeye doing i asked as sahra wriggled through the throng hes fucked up a voice volunteered howd you know i exchanged hugs with sahra she said we were starting to worry a question clung to the edge of her statement tobo your grandmother and uncle doj are waiting in the woods back up the road run up and tell them to come on down wherere the rest somebody demanded swan is with them the rest are behind us somewhere we broke up into three groups after we reached the highlands there were crows around we didnt want to give them anything obvious to watch we did the same thing after we left the barges sahra told me did you see many crows we saw only a few they might not have been the protectors the white one keeps turning up we saw it too are you hungry you kidding ive been eating your mothers cooking since we left jaicur i looked around people were watching who were not black company they might only be refugees too but the enthusiasm of my reception was sure to cause talk sahra laughed it sounded more like the laughter of relief than that of good humor how is mother i think theres something wrong sahra shes stopped being nasty bitter old ky gota most of the time shes lost inside herself and those times when she is completely aware she almost has manners in here sahra lifted a tent flap it was the largest tent in the encampment and uncle doj a step slower but still uncle doj he wants me to turn nyueng bao and be his apprentice like i have a lot of free time being murgens apprentice he says its just because he doesnt have anybody else to pass his responsibilities on to whatever they are he seems to think i should sign on before he tells me what for did you get the key we did uncle doj has it in his pack but singh got away not unexpectedly did he turn up here we picked up rumors along the way that gave me the idea that he was ahead of us and gaining ground you do still have the girl sahra nodded but shes a handful i think bringing her south again put her in closer touch with kina common sense tells me we should break our promise and kill her she settled on a cushion im glad youre here im completely worn out keeping these people under control when theres so little for them to do its a miracle that we havent had any major incidents i bought a farm you what i bought a farm not far from the shadowgate they tell me the soil is lousy but its a place where most of the men can stay out of sight and keep out of trouble and even stay busy building housing or working the ground so well eventually be selfsupporting half the gang is over there now most of these guys here would be too except that murgen said you were going to arrive today you made good time we didnt expect you for several more hours does that mean youre all caught up on whats going on in the world outside i have a particularly talented husband who doesnt always share everything with me and i dont always share him with the others and we both probably shouldnt be that way therere a thousand things we need to talk about sleepy i dont know where to start so why not just with how are you the brotherhood had to begin moving goblin burst into the tent uninvited and gasped out the news that murgen said my feted arrival had caught the eyes of official informants and had aroused the suspicions of the local authorities those folks had been disinclined to investigate the refugee camp before only due to a complete lack of ambition i sent kendo and a dozen men to secure the southern end of the pass through the dandha presh both to guarantee a favorable welcome for those coming down behind me and to help keep anyone from strolling off northward with news about where we were i sent several small teams off to capture senior officers and officials before they could become organized there was no real fixed solid governmental structure here because the protector favored the rule of limited anarchy it was obvious that these former shadowlands despite their proximity to the glittering plain were no more than an afterthought to the powers in taglios the troubles in the region had been settled with a vengeance the great general had won the reputation he had desired there were few troops and no officials of any renown here now it looked like a safe remote province suitable for rusticating human embarrassments deemed not worth exterminating even so region wide there were many more of them than there were of us and we were out of battle practice ourselves brains speed and ferocity would have to sustain us till we gathered the whole clan and completed preparations to follow the road up the south side of the valley so now youve had your power fix and youve got time to talk how the hell are you sleepy goblin asked he looked exhausted worn to the bone from traveling but still full of vinegar its nice to talk to somebody where i dont have to lean over backwards to look them in the eye walk in the goddamn door talking that shit i knew there was a reason i didnt miss you you say the sweetest things hows oneeye getting better having gota here will hurry it up but hes never going to be completely right hes going to be slow and shaky and have spells where hell have trouble remembering what hes doing and hell always have trouble communicating especially when hes excited i nodded took a deep breath said and its going to happen again isnt it it could it often does it doesnt have to though he rubbed his forehead headache i need some sleep you can drive yourself crazy trying to deal with something like this if you need sleep youd better get it now things are starting to happen well need you fresh when it gets exciting i knew there was another reason i didnt miss you you havent been here long enough to blow your nose and already people and things are flying all over getting ready to beat each other in the head its my perky personality think i should visit oneeye up to you but hell be heartbroken if you dont hes probably already all bent out of shape because you came and saw me first i asked how to find oneeye and left goblin i noted that refugees not associated with the company were sneaking out of the camp there were signs of excitement over in the new town too gota doj and swan were nearing the camp from the uphill side tobo larked around them like an excited pup i wondered where swan would stand once the real excitement started he would stay neutral as long as he could probably you look better than i expected i told oneeye who was actually doing something when i ducked into his tent that spear i thought you lost it ages ago the weapon in question was an elaborately carved and decorated artifact of extreme magical potency that he had begun crafting back during the siege of jaicur its designated target then had been the shadowmaster shadowspinner later he had continued improving it so he could use it against longshadow that spear was so darkly beautiful that it seemed a sin to use it just to kill someone oneeye took his time collecting himself he looked up at me there was less of him than there was when last i had seen him and even then he had been just a shell of the oneeye i remembered from when i was young no just that one word none of the usual creative invective or accusations and insults he did not want to embarrass himself the results of the stroke were more crippling emotionally than physically he had been master of his surroundings for two hundred years far beyond the dreams of men but now he could not count on being able to speak a complete coherent sentence im here ive got the key and things have begun to happen already oneeye nodded slowly i hope he understood there had been a woman in jaicur she was a hundred nineteen when she died they said in all my years i never saw her do anything but sit in a chair and drool she understood nothing anyone said to her she had to be changed like a baby she had to be fed like a baby i did not want that to happen to oneeye he was old and cantankerous and a major pain more often than not but he was a fixture of my universe he was my brother that other woman that married one she does not have the fire his words were a ghost of speech when he talked his hands shook too badly to hold his tools shes afraid to succeed and afraid not to you are busy little girl he beamed because he had gotten that out without much trouble you do what you must but i have to talk to you again soon before this happens to me again he spoke slowly and with great care you are the one he was tiring so great was his mental effort he beckoned me closer murmured soldiers live and wonder why someone threw the tent flap back brilliant light burst inside i knew it was gota without being able to see her odor preceded her try not to make him talk too much hes worn out i have seen this problem before cold yet civil more animated than she had been for some time but still not the caustic frequently irrational gota of last year i will be of more value here her accent was much less heavy than usual go kill someone stone soldier been a while since anybody called me that gota bowed mockingly as she waddled past bone warrior soldier of darkness go forth and conjure the children of the dead from the land of unknown shadows all evil dies there an endless death i stepped outside baffled what was that all about behind me calling the heaven and the earth and the day and the night i thought i had heard that formula before but could not recall the place or the context surely it was sometime when a person of the nyueng bao conviction was being particularly cryptic the excitement had increased someone had stolen some horses already had acquired them let us not leap too far with our conclusions several riders were charging around unguided by any rational plan something should have been in place for a situation like this i grumbled thiss what happens when nobody wants to take charge you three men get over here what in the name of god are you doing after listening to their hemming and hawing i gave some orders they galloped off with messages i murmured there is no god but god god is the almighty boundless in mercy show mercy unto me o lord of the seasons let mine enemies be even more confused than my friends i felt like i was inside the eye of a storm of screwups my fault all i did was show up if i was likely to have that effect someone should have met me away from witnesses and led me to sahras farm that might have given us time to get into shape with nobody the wiser we really had very little formal organization no declared chain of command and no established table of responsibility we had no real policies other than fixed enmities and an emotional commitment to release the captured we had deteriorated into little more than a glorified bandit gang and i was embarrassed it was partly my fault i rubbed my behind i had a distinct feeling the captain was going to catch up on years worth of chewouts i could make all the excuses i wanted about only being a standin for murgen while he was buried but i had been chosen as his understudy and the annalist is often the standardbearer too and the standardbearer is generally designated because those in command think he is capable of becoming lieutenant and possibly eventually captain which meant that murgen had seen something in me a long time ago and the old man had not found cause to disagree with him and i had done nothing with that but have a good time designing torments for our enemies while a woman who was not a pledged member of the company assumed most of its leadership by default sahras courage and intelligence and determination were beyond reproach but her skills as a soldier and commander were less so she meant well but she did not understand strategies not designed around her own needs and desires she wanted to resurrect the captured of course but not for the benefit of the black company she wanted her husband back to sahra the company was just a means of achieving her ends we were about to pay the price of my reluctance to step forward and serve the interests of the company we were hardly more than the gang of thugs the protector claimed us to be i was willing to bet that any determined resistance we encountered hereabouts was likely to shatter what little family spirit the company had left we would have to pay for forgetting who and what we were and my anger mainly at myself made me seem twice lifesize i stomped around screaming and foaming at the mouth and before long had bullied everyone into doing something useful and then a sorry bunch of ragamuffins trudged out of the new town and headed for the refugee camp like a reluctant flock of geese honking and straggling all over they numbered about fifty and carried weapons the steel was more impressive than the soldiers carrying it the local armorer did his job well whoever trained recruits did not they were more pathetic than my gang and my guys had the advantage of having knocked people over the head before and so had little reluctance to hurt someone again particularly if that someone threatened them tobo go get goblin the boy eyed the approaching disorder i can handle that clusterfuck sleepy oneeye and goblin have been teaching me their tricks scary idea a frenetic teenager with their skills and their lunatic lack of responsibility that might well be you might be a god but i didnt tell you to handle it i told you to go get goblin so move it red anger flooded his face but he went if i had been his mother he would have argued until the wave of southerners rolled over us i walked toward the soldiers painfully conscious that i still wore the rags i had had on since the day we sneaked out of taglios nor was i equipped with anything remarkable in the way of weapons i carried a stubby little sword that never had been much use for anything but chopping wood i was always at my best as the kind of soldier who stands off at a distance and plinks the enemy when he is not looking i found a suitable spot and waited arms crossed no grand effort had been made to train these troops or clothe them well which reflected the protectors disdain for petty detail what threat could the fledgling taglian empire possibly face out here at the edge of beyond anyway there were no threats from beyond the borders the officer leading the pack was overweight which also told me something about the local military peace had persisted for a decade but times were not yet so favorable that this country could support many fat men huffing and puffing the officer could not speak first i told him thank you for coming it shows initiative and a mind capable of recognizing the inevitable swiftly have your men stack their weapons over there assuming everything goes the way it should well be able to let them go home in two or three days the officer gulped some more air while he strove to understand what he was hearing evidently this little person had some mad notion that she had the upper hand though he had no way of telling if i was he she or it i allowed the rags at my throat to fall open long enough for him to see the black company medallion i wore as a pendant on a silver chain water sleeps i told him sure rumor had had plenty of time to carry that slogan to the ends of the empire though i failed to intimidate him into ordering his men to disarm instantly i did buy a few moments for the rest of the gang to gather and a grimlooking band of cutthroats they were goblin and tobo came down to stand beside me sahra shouted at her son from somewhere behind us but he ignored her he had decided he was one of the big boys now and that stinking goblin kept encouraging his fantasies i said i suggest you disarm whats your name whats your rank if you dont get rid of the weapons a lot of people will get hurt and most of them are going to be you it doesnt have to be that way if you cooperate the fat young man gulped air i do not know what he had expected this was not it i was not it i expect he was used to bullying refugees too battered by fate to even consider resisting another humiliation goblin cackled heres your chance kid show us what you got heres one ive been practicing when nobody was around tobo kept on talking but in a whisper so soft i could not make out the words in a few seconds i did not care about the words anyway tobo began turning into something that was no gangly teenage boy tobo began turning into something i did not want to be around the kid was a shapeshifter impossible that stuff took ages to master at first i thought he was going to become some mythical being a troll an ogre or some misshapen and befanged creature still essentially human in shape but he went on to become something insectoid mantislike but big and really ugly and really smelly and getting bigger and uglier and smellier by the second i realized i did not smell so good myself which is usually a clue that you smell pretty awful to those around you since you are not normally aware of your own odor like most of what he saw from his teachers tobo was presenting an illusion not undergoing a true transformation but the southerners did not know that i was part of an illusion of my own goblins huge grin told me who was behind the little practical joke too he was not too far over the top with it either so i might not have noticed had i not been alerted by what was happening with tobo i seemed to be becoming some moretraditional nightmare something like what you might expect to see if for generations they had been saying that the black company was made up of guys who ate their own young when they could not roast yours have your men stack their weapons before this gets out of hand tobo made a clacking noise with his mouth parts he sidled forward rotating his bug head oddly as he considered where to start munching the officer seemed to understand instinctively that predators take the fat ones first he discarded his weapons where he stood having no inclination to get any closer to tobo i said men you might help these fellows dispose of their tools my own people were as stunned as the native soldiers were i was stunned myself but remained plenty scared enough to take advantage while we retained the upper hand psychologically i went around to the other side of the soldiers putting them between horrors horrors they were not yet sure were entirely illusions sorcerers conjured some pretty nasty creatures sometimes or so i have heard that must be true my brothers had told me about the ones they had seen the annals told me about more the southerners began to give up their weapons spiff or wart or somebody remembered to make them lie down on their bellies once a handful got it started the rest found themselves short on the will to resist too sahra could not hold back anymore she tied into goblin what are you doing to my son you crazy old man i told you i dont want him playing with a ssss and a clack erupted from tobo a claw on the tip of a very long limb snipped at sahras nose the kid was going to be sorry about that stunt later uncle doj hustled up not now sahra not here he pulled her away his grip evidently caused her considerable distress her anger did not subside but her voice did the last thing i heard her say was something unflattering about her grandmother hong tray i said goblin enough with the show i cant talk to this man if i look like a rakshasas mother it aint me sleepy im just here to watch take it up with tobo he sounded as innocent as a baby tobo was preoccupied having altogether too much fun playing the scary monster i told goblin youre going to be teaching him that stuff youd better put some time into getting across the concept of selfdiscipline too not to mention you need to teach him not to bullshit people i know whos doing what to whom here goblin stop it i was not disappointed to discover that tobo had some talent it was almost inevitable actually it was in his blood what troubled me was the time of life when goblin and presumably oneeye had chosen to lure his talent into the open in my opinion tobo was at exactly the wrong age to become allpowerful if no one controlled him while he learned to rule himself he could become another perpetual adolescent chaotic like soulcatcher all part of the program sleepy but you need to understand that hes already more mature and more responsible than you or his mother want to admit hes not a baby you have to remember that most of what you see in him is him showing you what he thinks you expect to see hes a good kid sleepy hell be all right if you and sahra dont mother him to death and right now hes at an age when you have to back off and let him stub his toes or regret it later childrearing advice from a bachelor even a bachelor can be smart enough to know when the childrearing part is over sleepy this boy has a big hybrid talent be good to him hes the future of the black company and thats what that old nyueng bao granny woman foresaw when she first saw murgen and sahra together back during the siege marvelous reasoning old man and your choice of time to bring that to my attention is typically impeccably inconvenient ive got fifty prisoners to deal with ive got a pudgy little new boyfriend here and i need to convince him that he ought to help me talk his fellow captains into cooperating with us what i dont have is time to deal with the difficult side of tobos adolescence pay attention in case you havent noticed were no longer a secret the kiaulune wars have started up again i wouldnt be surprised if soulcatcher herself didnt turn up someday now get me out of this imaginary ugly suit so i can do whatever i have to do oh youre so forceful goblin made the illusion go away he made the one surrounding the boy fade too tobo seemed surprised that he could be overruled so easily but the little wizard softened the blow to his ego by immediately engaging him in a technical critique of what he had accomplished i was impressed by what i had seen but tobo as the future of the company that made me real uncomfortable despite its questionable reassurance that the company did have a future i stirred the fat officer with a toe come on hop up here we need to talk spiff let the rest of these people sit up as soon as their weapons are cleared away ill probably let them go home in a little while goblin you want to go face the music with sahra get that out of the way so it isnt just waiting for a bad time to blow up on us the fat officer got his feet under him he looked very very unhappy which i could understand this was not his best day i took hold of his arm lets you and me take a walk youre a woman dont let it go to your head do you have a name how about a rank or title he offered a regional name about a paragraph long filled with the unmanageable clicks that mess up a language otherwise already unfit for the normal human tongue as proof of my assertion i offer my inability to manage it at much more than a pidgin level despite having spent years in the area i picked out what sounded like it identified his personal place in the genealogy of a nation i can call you suvrin then he winced i got it after a moment suvrin was a diminutive no doubt he had not been called that by anyone but his mother for twenty years oh well i had a sword he did not suvrin youve probably heard rumors to the effect that were not nice people i want to put your mind at ease everything youve ever heard is true but this time were not here to loot and pillage and rape the livestock the way we did last time were really just passing through we hope with minimal dislocation for everybody both us and you what i need from you assuming youd rather cooperate than lie in a grave being walked on by some replacement who will is a bit of official assistance aimed at hurrying us on our way have i been going too fast for you no i speak your language well thats not what i never mind heres whats happening were going to go up on the glittering plain why pure fear filled his voice he and his ancestors had lived in terror of the plain since the coming of the shadowmasters i offered a bit of nonsense for the same reason the chicken crossed the road to get to the other side suvrin found that concept so novel he could think of no response i continued itll take us a while to get ready we have to assemble provisions and equipment we have to scout some things and not all of our people have arrived yet id just as soon not fight a war at the same time so i want you to tell me how to avoid that suvrin offered an inarticulate grumble whats that i never wanted to be in the army my fathers doing he wanted me away from the family someplace where i couldnt embarrass him but he also wanted me doing something he felt to be in keeping with the family dignity he thought if i was a soldier thered be nothing i could mess up we had no enemies who could embarrass me stuff happens your father should know that hes lived long enough to have a grownup son you dont know my father you might be surprised ive met plenty just like him probably some that were way worse theres nothing new in this world suvrin and that includes all kinds of people how many more soldiers are there around here how many all told on this side of the mountains do any of them have any special loyalty to taglios will they abandon taglios if the pass is closed the territories south of the dandha presh were vast but weak longshadow had exploited them mercilessly for more than a generation then the shadowmaster and kiaulune wars had devastated them uh he wriggled but not hard just enough to satisfy his selfimage we spent the remainder of the day together suvrin made the transitions from grudging prisoner to nervous accomplice to helpful ally he was easily led overresponding to modest praise and expressions of gratitude my guess was that he had not had many nice things said to him during his young life and he was scared to death that i would demolish him the instant he did fail to cooperate we sent the rest of the soldiers home as soon as our men stripped the new town armory most of the weapons stored there looked like they had been picked up off old battlefields and treated with contempt ever since by the armorer whose work i had so much admired earlier i found the man and drafted him he was a prima donna a master with an artists attitude i figured oneeye could tame him suvrin accompanied me when i went across to the farm sahra had acquired poor leader though he was suvrin really was in charge of all the armed forces in the kiaulune region which said very little for the quality of his men or for the wisdom and commitment of his superiors but i decided to keep him handy he was useful as a symbol if nothing else when i went across i insisted that everyone else make the move too i wanted everyone not out on picket duty or patrol in one place so we could respond quickly in strength to any threat i told suvrin ive neutralized the whole province except for that little fort below the shadowgate right that stronghold had sealed its gate the men inside would not respond to the messenger i sent suvrin nodded he was having second thoughts too late will they leave if you tell them to go no theyre foreigners left by the great general to keep the road to the shadowgate closed how many fourteen good soldiers embarrassed much better than mine which might only mean that they could march in step tell me about their fort how are they set for water and provisions the fat man hemmed and hawed suvrin suvrin you have to think about this uh you cant get in any deeper than you already are you can only do your best to get back out too many people have seen you cooperating already im sorry buddy youre stuck i fought sliding into the character of vajra the naga seductive as it was it was so blessedly useful suvrin made a sound suspiciously like a whimper courage cousin suvrin we live with it every day all you can do is put on a deathshead grin and tug on their beards and yank out their tail feathers here we go this looks like the place a poorly built structure had loomed out of the darkness light leaked out through the roof and walls both i wondered why they bothered maybe it was still under construction i could make out the vague shapes of tents beyond it something stirred on the rooftree as i pulled the door hanging aside so suvrin could enter the white crow a soft chuckle came from the bird sister sister taglios begins to waken the thing took wing i watched it fade in the light of a rising fragment of moon that had been pretty clear i shrugged and went inside i could worry about the white crow next week once i finally got a chance to go to bed are any of you guys aware that were at war that under similar circumstances every army since the dawn of time has put out sentries to watch for people sneaking up several dozen faces watched me blandly goblin asked you didnt see anybody theres nothing out there to see old man ah and you got here alive too which remark left me to understand that there were dire traps out there held in abeyance only by the alert decisionmaking of sentries i not only overlooked but whose presence i never suspected all i can say to that is somebody must have taken a bath sometime since the turn of the century the same could not be said for most of the crowd inside that shelter which might be the reason the roof and walls were so porous this is my new friend suvrin he was the captain of the local garrison i blew in his ear and he decided he wanted to help us so we would go away before the protector shows up and makes life tough for everybody somebody in back said you could blow in mine and ow what the fuck you hit me for willow vajra the naga said knock it off swan keep your hands to yourself vigan i dont want to hear your mouth again you should know better whatve you guys done to get ready to knock over that tower over by the shadowgate nobody said a word you guys obviously did something while you were waiting around i gestured at our surroundings you managed to build a house badly or a barracks but you didnt do anything else therere no scouts out no planning got done no preparations got made was there something going on that i havent heard about yet goblin sidled up in an uncharacteristic tone he murmured dont press these issues now isnt the time just tell people what to do and send them out to do it i trust the little wizards wisdom occasionally sit down heres what well do dig out whatever fireball launchers we have left vigan pick ten men carry the heaviest launcher yourself the others can carry lighter ones if there arent enough to go around bring bows well go take care of this right now vigan choose your team the man who had made the mistake of irritating me rose in a surly tone he named his helpers chances were all of them had irritated him sometime recently it rolls downhill in the few minutes it took vigan to get ready i had the others tell me things they thought i ought to know i had the men encircle the little fort we carried torches and made no effort to sneak per instructions vigan carried the heaviest piece of bamboo it had an interior diameter of three inches he told me theres supposed to be only a couple three balls left in this one that ought to be enough right here should be fine a good archer with a strong bow might cause us trouble but those were exceeding rare in modern taglian armies mogaba was a warrior he believed real men got in close where they could get splattered with each others blood when they fought it was a blind spot we had exploited more than once during the kiaulune wars and would exploit again until he figured it out goblin shuffled into position behind us tobo did too they said nothing which must have been a trial for the boy he talked in his sleep what do i do vigan asked let them have one through the stonework right above the gate louder i said stand fast nobody do anything until i tell you the first two times vigan turned his hand release crank nothing happened is it empty i asked its not supposed to be goblin advised try again then its been over ten years since it was used maybe it just needs to be loosened up i mused ill bet nobodys bothered to keep the mechanism clean and you folks wondered why i wanted to hire an armorer go ahead crank it again carefully so you dont lose your aim whack cracklecracklecracklesizzle into the distance the fireball ripped right through the little fortifications two outside walls and whatever lay between them stone steamed and ran the scarlet ball wobbled through the air for several miles more gave up the last of its momentum gradually darkened as it drifted to earth beyond the ruins of overlook move to the left a few yards drop your aiming point five feet then do it again vigan was having fun now there was a bounce to his step as he moved to his new position this time it took only one extra turn of the crank to get the fireball launched a blistering limecolored ball ripped through the fortification it hit something significant inside it had almost no energy left when it appeared on the far side a gout of steam blew out the top of the tower mustve gotten a water barrel i said water and the fireballs made a wicked combination resulting in storms of superheated steam suvrin where are you two fireballs should have gotten their attention inside should have gotten the survivors to thinking now i could begin placing my shots suvrin have you ever been inside that rockpile the fat man came forward reluctantly when he was close by me his face was in the light the garrison inside would remember him he wanted to lie to me too i could see but he did not have the courage yes whats the layout it doesnt look like it could be that complicated it isnt animals and storage on the ground floor they can pile up stuff behind the gate so you cant knock it in they live on the second floor its just one big room theres a stove for cooking and pallets for sleeping and racks of weapons and thats about it and the roof is basically just a fighting platform right wait a minute vigan dont spend any more fireballs than we have to let them think for a while now maybe theyll give up they know i didnt hurt suvrins men tobo circle around and tell all the men that if they have to launch a fireball we need it to go through the second level preferably low theyll probably get down on the floor when death starts coming through can i shoot one of those things sleepy get the message out first i watched him scoot off he did not expose himself unnecessarily faces could be seen occasionally behind the archers embrasures over yonder a couple of arrows had come out and fallen harmlessly i told goblin if anybody had been paying attention wed have the place mapped down to the last cot and table and wed know exactly where to aim every fireball to get the best effect youre absolutely right again just as you always are be quiet for a second theres something going on here those men arent as scared as they should be as he spoke i glimpsed a face peeking over the parapet a moment later the white crow plummeted out of the night it knocked the leather helmet off the soldier i yelled everybody wake up theyre about to pull something goblin had started muttering already he was doing something odd with his fingers men jumped up atop the little fort each had something in hand ready to throw a halfdozen fireballs squirted their way without my approval one grenadier went down but not before he launched his missile glass i saw same type oneeye had used to make firebombs years ago we still had a few of those too but throwing firebombs at us out here would be pointless we were too far away to be reached aim low i yelled shadows coming that was not a shout that had been heard for an age but it was one the veterans remembered and could respond to without ever thinking goblin was already wobbling across the slope in as near a sprint as his old bones could manage still muttering and wiggling his fingers pink sparks leaped between his fingers and slithered around amongst his few remaining hairs he grabbed a skinny little bamboo pole from one of the men it had been painted with black stripes meaning that its dedicated purpose was use against shadows fireballs flew some peppered the fortress some dove after the shadows that spilled out of the breaking glass containers suvrin began whimpering behind me i told him dont run theyll get you for sure they love a fleeing victim there was a lot of screaming inside the fortress fireballs streaking through had found human targets in their way the fireballs were almost as bad as the killing shadows one of my men began shrieking when a shadow found him but he was the only one goblins spell helped some the quick use of fireballs helped more goblin began loosing fireballs from the pole he had snagged but sent them racing northward instead of toward the stubborn little fort he quit after only a few tries he came back to me theyve done their job those brave boys in there they got their warning away he was as sour as a lemon slice under the tongue so i take it soulcatcher didnt die when she hit the water i had heard the news from taglios only up to the part where the protectors carpet had fallen apart in midair with her streaking along four hundred feet above the river the break coming at that point had not been because anyone was trying to make things particularly dramatic it was just because there was too much going on to have a lot of time left for catching up especially where murgen was concerned murgen seemed to be employed full time easing sahras frights and concerns she was one of the ten who were taken sleepy those people dont hurt easy hell she survived having her head cut off she carried it around in a box for about fifteen years i grunted sometimes it was hard to remember that soulcatcher was much more than just an unpleasant distant senior official they likely to have any more surprises in there i meant the question for suvrin but goblin answered if they did they wouldve used them you thinking about going in after them oh heck no somebody might get hurt somebody besides them suvrin go over there and tell them if they surrender in the next half hour ill let them go if they dont ill kill them all before the hour is up the fat man started to protest vigan poked his behind with the tip of a dagger i told suvrin if they do anything to you ill avenge you thats a big weight off my heart goblin asked how are you going to avenge anybody considering youre not going to go in there after them thats what we have wizards for this looks like a wonderful opportunity for you to give tobo some onthejob training am i surprised not hardly for a hundred years its been what do we do now i dont know lets let goblin handle it i oughta just take a hike and let you figure it out for yourself im tired im going to sit down here and rest my eyes until suvrin gets back i heard goblin tell vigan to put another heavyweight fireball into the corner of the fortification along the length of the wall so all its energy would be spent devouring the pale limestone there was a solid thump swiftly followed by the smell of superheated limestone as i drifted away goblin muttered something about burning them out the surface of the river was not friendly when soulcatcher hit it but neither was the impact like hitting stone from the same altitude her fall had been long enough to allow her time to prepare for the landing even so the collision was brutal enough to extract her consciousness temporarily but she had prepared for that too between curses when consciousness returned she was drifting downriver with the flood head above the surface it being the rainy season the river was high and the current brisk it took a great effort to complete the swim to the south bank by the time she crawled out of the flood and collapsed she was a halfdozen miles downstream from where she had gone in which was outside the city proper in a domain best known for its jackals of both the two and fourlegged varieties it was said that leopards still hunted there at night the occasional crocodile could be found along the shore and it was not that many years since a tiger had come visiting from down the river the protector experienced no difficulties with any mad or hungry thing a hundred crows perched around her standing guard others flapped about in the darkness until squadrons of bats had gathered birds and bats together discouraged the scavengers and predators till soulcatcher awakened and in a fit of pique sent an entire band of jackals racing away with their pelts aflame she stumbled toward home regaining strength slowly muttering about growing old and less resilient a tremor entered the voice she chose to inveigh against the predations of time eventually she reached the home of a moneylender where she commandeered transportation back to the palace she arrived there somewhat after the breakfast hour in a temper so foul that the entire staff made a point of becoming invisible only the great general came to inquire after her wellbeing and he went away when she started snarling and snapping though she reveled in her paranoia soulcatcher did not suspect that her accident had been anything else until she examined her remaining carpet preparatory to another effort to fly off to entertain the nyueng bao then she discovered that the light woodenframe members on which the carpet was stretched had been weakened by strategic saw cuts the who and probable why became clear within seconds she sent out a summons to jaul barundandi and his associates surprise barundandi was nowhere to be found he had been called out of the palace for a family emergency he had said just moments after her return so the greys reported when told to investigate what an amazing coincidence find him find the men he worked with regularly we have a great deal to discuss greys scattered one bold captain however remained behind to report rumor in the city says the bhodi intend to resume their selfimmolations they want the radisha to come out and address their concerns personally the news did not improve soulcatchers temper ask them if they would like me to donate the naphtha they need im feeling particularly charitable today also ask them if they can hold off starting long enough for the carpenters to put up grandstands so more of the radishas good subjects can enjoy the entertainment i dont care what those lunatics do get out of here find that barundandi slug the voice she used was informed with a potent lunacy jaul barundandis luck was mixed he managed to avoid the attentions of the bats and crows and shadows the protector released when the greys had no immediate success in locating him but an informer eventually betrayed him when the reward for his capture grew large enough the lie was that he had attacked and severely wounded the radisha that only the protectors swift intercession with her most powerful sorcery had saved the princesss life the radishas situation remained grave the taglian people loved their radisha jaul barundandi discovered that he had no friends but his accomplices and it was one of those who betrayed him in exchange for a partial reward and a running start jaul barundandi suffered terrible torments and tried hard to cooperate so the pain would stop but he could tell the protector nothing that she wanted to know so she had him put into a cage and hung fifteen feet above the place where the bhodi disciples generally chose to give up their lives and issued a rescript encouraging passersby to throw stones it was her intent that he hang there indefinitely his suffering neverending but sometime during the first night somehow someone managed to toss him a piece of poisoned fruit while leaving his betrayer and a murdered grey below each with a piece of paper in his mouth bearing the characters for water sleeps crows savaged both corpses before they were discovered it was the last time black company tokens would be seen but their appearance was sufficient to provoke the protector almost beyond reason for days the stillloyal remnants of the greys remained extremely busy making arrests most of them of people unable to guess what they had done to irk soulcatcher she never did get to the nyueng bao swamp despite having made necessary repairs to her remaining carpet taglios became more fractious by the hour she had to devote her entire attention to keeping the city tamed then came the faithful and tattered little shadow that had made its way through mountains and forests over lakes and rivers and plains in order to bring her news of what was happening in the nethermost south soulcatcher screamed a scream of rage so potent that the entire city became informed of it instantly immigrants began to rehearse the wisdom of a return to the provinces the great general and two of his staff officers broke through the door to the protectors apartment certain she needed rescuing instead they found her pacing furiously and debating herself in half a dozen voices they have the key they must have the key they must have murdered the deceiver maybe they made an alliance with kina why would they go down there why would they go onto the plain after what happened to the last group what keeps pulling them out there ive read their annals theres nothing in those what do they know the land of unknown shadows they cannot have developed an entirely new and independent oral tradition since they served me in the north if its important one of them will record it why why what do they know that i dont soulcatcher became aware of mogaba and his men the latter looked around nervously trying to figure out where the voices were coming from when soulcatcher became excited those seemed to come from everywhere at once you have you caught me any terrorists yet no nor shall i unless an angry family member comes forward because he thinks it would be a good way to get even there wont be more than a handful left here and those probably dont know each other i gather from what i overheard that theyve gone back to shadowcatch he had worked for the shadowmaster longshadow he could not get out of the habit of calling kiaulune by the name given it by his previous employer exactly were back where we were fifteen years ago only now they have the radisha and the key her tone left no doubt she placed the blame entirely on him mogaba was not bothered not immediately he was accustomed to being blamed for the shortcomings of others and he did not believe the remnants of the black company could offer any real threat any time soon they had been beaten down too thoroughly and had been away from it too long they were more military than the deceivers only inside their own fantasies even the comicopera functionaries down there ought to be able to wear them down and bury them eventually they would find no aid or sympathy in the shadowlands the people down there really did remember the black companys last visit the key what is that a means of passing through the shadowgate unharmed a talisman that makes it possible to travel on the plain her voice had become pedantic now it became angry i possessed that talisman at one time long ago i used it to go up there and explore longshadow would have been unmanned had he known more unmanned than the eunuch he already was but it disappeared in the early excitement around kiaulune i suspect that kina clouded my mind while the deceiver singh stole both it and my sisters darling daughter i cant imagine why that rabble would want to go onto the plain after the previous disaster but if its something they want to do its something i want to prevent prepare for a journey we cant leave taglios unsupervised for as long as it would take us to travel all the way to shadowcatch we dont have the stallion anymore even if it could carry double soulcatcher was baffled what the black stallion from the north the one ive been using all these years its vanished it broke down its stall and ran off i told you that last month she did not recall that obviously well fly but mogaba hated flying in the days when he had been longshadows general he had had to fly with the howler almost daily he still loathed those times i thought the larger carpet was the one that was destroyed the small one will carry both of us itll be hard work ill have to rest a lot but well still be able to get down there and back before these people know were gone and try to take advantage a week for the round trip ten days at the outside the great general had a few dozen reservations but kept them behind his teeth the protector was worse than longshadow had been about suffering opinions she did not want to hear soulcatcher said well adopt disguises once we get there and go among them i want you to keep an eye out for a hammer so by so made of cast iron but far heavier than it ought to be mogaba bowed slightly he said nothing about how difficult it would be for either of them to blend in with the crowd they would be chasing soulcatcher told him prepare your men theyll have to keep taglios under control for a cquple of weeks mogaba withdrew saying nothing about the proposed time changing already in his position it was necessary to do a lot of saying nothing the protector watched him go amused he did not conceal his thinking nearly as well as he believed but she was ancient in her wickedness and had studied the dark side of humanity so thoroughly that she could almost read minds the little fortress settled in upon itself slowly as though made of wax only slightly overheated as soon as i fell asleep and could not interfere goblin handed the magical siege work over to tobo who did a creditable job of rooting the enemy survivors out of their shelter the wicked little thing had been taking lessons a lot longer than he and his teachers would admit the garrison was bringing out its dead and wounded when a shout awakened me i sat up morning had begun to arrive and the world had changed whats spiffs problem i asked one of my veterans had recognized one of theirs the devil himself arrived to explain the guy in charge thats khusavir pete sleepy you remember we thought he was killed when the bahrata battalion got wiped out in the ambush at kushkhoshi i remember and i recalled something that spiff did not know a fact i shared only with murgen who had been the ghost in the rushes while the slaughter was taking place khusavir pete at that time a sworn brother of the company had led our largest surviving force of allies into a trap that efficiently took us out of the kiaulune wars khusavir pete had cut a deal khusavir pete had betrayed his own brothers khusavir pete was high on my list of people i wanted to meet again though until just now i had been the only one who knew that he had survived and that his treachery had been rewarded with a high post money and a new name but just seeing him had some of the men figuring it out fast you shouldve asked her to change your face too i told him when they flung him down bleeding in front of me though youve had a better run than you probably expected when she turned you i held his eyes with mine what he saw convinced him it would not be worth his trouble to deny anything vajra the naga had come out to play more and more of the men gathered around most of them not getting it until i explained how khusavir pete had been seduced by soulcatcher into betraying and helping destroy more than five hundred of our brothers and allies wouldbe greetings quickly became imaginative suggestions of ways whereby we might reduce the traitors life expectancy i let the man listen until some of the troops tried to lay hands on then i told goblin hide him somewhere we may have a use for him yet the excitement was over i had indulged in a decent meal my attitude much improved i took the opportunity to renew my acquaintance with master surendranath santaraksita this life seems to agree with you i told him as i arrived you look better now than you did when we left the city and that was true dorabee lad i thought you were dead despite their endless assurances he leaned closer and confided they arent all honest men your comrades by some chance did goblin and oneeye offer to teach you to play tonk the librarian managed to look a little sheepish not to play with them is a lesson everyone has to learn sheepishness transformed into impishness i think i taught them a little something too card tricks were one of my hobbies when i was younger i had to laugh at the idea of those two villains getting taken themselves have you discovered anything that would be useful to me ive read every word in every book we brought along including all of your companys modern chronicles written in languages known to me i found nothing remarkable i have been amusing myself by trying to work backward into the chronicles i cant read by comparing materials repeated in more than one language murgen had done a lot of that he had had a thing about copying stuff over in cleaner drafts and one of his great projects had been to revise ladys and the captains annals for accuracy based on evidence provided by other witnesses while rendering them into modern taglian we have all done that to our predecessors some so that every recent volume of the annals is really an unwilling collaboration i said we drag a lot of books around dont we like snails carrying your history on your back its who we are cute image though doesnt all that study get dull after a while the boy keeps me sharp boy tobo hes a brilliant student even more amazing than you were tobo i know who would expect it of a nyueng bao youre destroying all my preconceptions dorabee mine are taking a beating too tobo either santaraksita had an unsuspected talent for inspiring students or tobo had suffered an epiphany and had become miraculously motivated you sure its tobo and not a changeling the demon himself popped in sleepy runmust and riverwalker and them are on their way over good morning master santaraksita tobo actually seemed excited to be there i dont have any other duties right now oh sleepy dad wants to talk to you where things had been happening too fast there had been no chance to catch up with murgen goblins tent everybody but mom thought that would be the safest place to keep him i had no trouble picturing sahra being irritated about not being able to share the occasional private moment with her husband when i ducked out the young man and the old were already settling with a book i glared a warning at santaraksita which it developed was both wasted and unnecessary goblin was not home of course not he was working his way through a long list of jobs bestowed upon him by me chuckle i found it hard to credit the possibility that one human being could make so huge a mess in a space so constricted the inside of goblins tent was barely wider than either of us was tall and twice as deep at its peak it was tall enough for me to stand up with two inches to spare what looked like a milkmaids stool undoubtedly stolen constituted the wizards entire suite of furniture a ragged burrow of blankets betrayed where he slept the rest of the space was occupied by a random jumble mostly stuff that looked like it had been discarded by a procession of previous owners there was no obvious theme to the collection it had to be stuff he had acquired since his arrival here sahra would never have allowed him space on a barge for such junk the mist projector stood at the head of goblins smelly bedding tilted precariously leaking water if this is the safest place to keep that darned thing then the whole company is mad with delusions of adequacy a whisper came from the mist projector i got down close to it which offered me an opportunity to become intimately aware of the aroma permanently associated with goblins bedding some pieces of which must have been with him since he was in diapers what murgens strongest effort was barely audible more water you need to add more water or there wont be any mist much longer i started to drag the evidence out of the tent anger gave murgen a little more voice no dammit bring the water to me dont take me to the water if you suffer from a compulsion to drag me around at least wait until after you water me and dont waste time im going to lose my anchor here in a few minutes finding a gallon of water turned out to be a challenging experience what took you so damned long bit of an adventure coming up with the water seems it never occurred to any of these morons that we need to have some handy somewhere just in case the royal army decides to camp between us and the creek where weve been getting it which is almost a mile away i just unleashed several geniuses on the problem how am i supposed to put this in here theres a cork in the rear it might be of some use to you to start doing readings from the annals like they do in temples the way i used to do sometimes pick something situationally appropriate in those days the company was in service and so on so they have examples of why it might be useful to haul water up the hill before you have to use it and such like these are grown men you cant just bully them into doing the right things but if you start reading to them theyll have heard tell of other times when the annalist did that and theyll recall it was always right before the big shitstorm moved in youll get their attention tobo said you want to talk to me i need to catch you up on whats going on elsewhere and i want to make suggestions about your preparations for the plain one of which is to listen to willow swan but the most critical of which is youre going to have to upgrade discipline the plain is deadly even worse than the plain of fear which you dont remember you cant ignore the rules and stay alive there one idea would be for you not to burn or bury the man who was killed by the shadow last night make every survivor look at him and think about what will happen to all of you if even one of you screws up up there read them the passages chronicling our adventures have swan bear witness i could just bring a handful of reliables in to get you you could but the rest of the world wouldnt be very nice to the men you leave behind right now theres a shadow heading north to tell soulcatcher where you are she may know enough already to figure out what youre trying to do she definitely doesnt want her sister and croaker on the loose and nursing a grudge shell get here as fast as she can and aside from soulcatcher theres narayan singh he retains kinas countenance so hes extremely hard to trace but i do catch glimpses occasionally hes on this side of the dandha presh and hes probably not far away he wants to recapture the daughter of night and reunite her with the book you traded for the key which by the way you should take away from uncle doj before he becomes overly tempted to try something on his own and so goblin can study it uhm he was a gush of information this morning all of it carefully rehearsed theres more to the key than you see right away i have a feeling the deceiver overlooked something doj keeps picking at it trying to find out whats inside the iron we should find out more about it before we trust it and we need to find out fast it wont be all that long before that shadow gets to taglios river and runmust are coming in theyre halfway responsible people ill turn some of the work over to them as soon as theyre rested up then i can worry about worry about it now let swan sergeant for you hes experienced and hes got no choice but to throw in with us now catcher will never believe that he didnt betray her i hadnt thought of that you dont have to do everything yourself sleepy if youre going to take charge you need to learn to tell people what needs doing then get out of the way and let them do it you keep hanging over their shoulders nagging like somebodys mother you arent going to get much cooperation you seduced that fat boy yet what that localyokel captain the one who couldnt keep in step if you painted his feet different colors you got him wrapped up yet youre zigging when im zagging you lost me completely let me draw you a picture you forget to tell him catcher is going to stop by you get him to make a deal he keeps his job he helps us out so he can get us out of his hair when he isnt looking you fix him up so when the shitstorm starts he dont have no choice but to take his chances with us i have him wrapped up then seventy percent hey blow in his ear throw a liplock on his love muscle do whatever you have to if catcher loses him she wont ever trust anybody else down here either goblin used almost the same language as murgen had when i stopped to visit again he found murgens advice fully excellent grab fat boy by his prong and never let go give him a little squeeze once in a while to keep him smiling ive probably said it before youre one cynical mudsucker its all those years of watching out for oneeye that done it to me i was a sweet innocent young thing when i joined this outfit not unlike yourself you were born wicked and cynical goblin chuckled how much stuff do you think you need to collect before we go up the hill how long do you think itll take it wont take forever if suvrin cooperates never ever forget that you dont have long i cant emphasize that enough soulcatcher is coming youve never seen her when shes all worked up the kiaulune wars dont count he must have seen something extreme he was determined to pound the point home the kiaulune wars dont count she was just entertaining herself with those i forced myself to make the visit i had been avoiding the daughter of night wore ankle shackles she resided inside an iron cage heavily impregnated with spells that caused everincreasing agony as their victim moved farther away she could escape but that would hurt if she pushed it hard enough she would die it appeared that every possible step had been taken to keep her under control except the lethal step reason urged me to take i had no more motive for keeping her alive except that i had given my word the men all took turns being exposed to her in pairs at mealtimes and such sahra had not been lax she appreciated the danger the girl represented my first glimpse left me stricken with envy despite her disadvantages she had kept herself beautiful looking much like her mother in a fresher body but something infinitely older and darker looked out through her pretty blue eyes for a moment she struck me not as the daughter of night but as the darkness itself she did have plenty of time to commune with her spiritual mother she smiled as though aware of the serpents of dark temptation slithering the black corridors of my mind i wanted to bed her i wanted to murder her i wanted to run away begging for mercy it took an exercise of will to remind myself that kina and her children were not evil in the sense that northerners or even my vehdna coreligionists understood evil nevertheless she was the darkness i stepped back tossed the tent flap open so my ally daylight could come inside the girl lost her smile she backed to the far side of her cage i could think of nothing to say there was really nothing we could say to one another i had no inclination to gloat and little news of the world outside to report which might motivate her to do something besides wait she had her spiritual mothers patience that was sure a blow from behind rocked me i clawed at my stubby little sword white wings mussed my nattily arranged hair talons dug into my shoulder the daughter of night stared at the white crow and revealed real emotion for the first time in a long time her confidence wavered fear leaked through she pressed back against the bars behind her have you two met i asked the crow said something like wawk wiranda the girl began to shake if possible she became even paler her jaw seemed clenched so tight her teeth ought to be cracking i made a mental note to discuss this with murgen he knew something about the crow what could rattle the girl so badly the crow laughed it whispered sister sister and launched itself back into the sunlight where it startled some passing brother into a fit of curses i stared at the girl watched the inner steel reassert itself her gaze met mine i felt the fear within her evaporate i was nothing to her less than an insect certainly less than a stubbed toe at the beginning of her long trek across the ages shuddering i broke eye contact that was a scary kid our days began before sunrise they ended after sunset they included a great deal of training and exercise of the sort that had been let slide for too long tobo worked with almost fanatic devotion to improve his skills as an illusionist i insisted upon daily readings from the annals in an effort to reinforce the depth and continuity of brotherhood that were so much the foundation of what the company was there was resistance at first of course but the message sank in at a pace not unrelated to a growing realization that we were going to go up onto the glittering plain really or were going to die here in front of the shadowgate when soulcatcher chose to write our final chapter the renewed training paid dividends quickly eight days after we reduced the fort below the shadowgate another mob like suvrins but much larger trudged in out of the country west of the new town thanks to murgen we had plenty of warning with tobo and goblin assisting we sprang a classic company ambush using illusions and nuisance spells that confused and disorganized a force that had had almost no idea what it was doing already we hit fast and hard and mercilessly and the threat evaporated in a matter of minutes in fact the relief force fell apart so fast we could not take as many prisoners as i wanted though we did round up most of the officers suvrin generously identified those he recognized suvrin was practically an apprentice company man by now so desperate was he to belong to something and to gain the approval of those around him i felt halfway guilty exploiting him the way i did the prisoners we did take became involuntary laborers in our preparations for the future most jumped on the opportunity because i promised to release those who did work hard before we went up onto the plain those who failed to work hard would go along as porters somehow a rumor got started amongst the prisoners that human sacrifice might be involved in what we were going to be doing once we passed the shadowgate i found goblin in with oneeye whose recovery seemed to have been sped by gotas presence possibly because he needed to be well enough to get away from her and her cooking i do not know they had the key laid out on a small table between them doj tobo and gota watched even mother gota kept her mouth shut sahra was conspicuously absent she was carrying her snit over tobo too far i expect there was more to it than what she admitted though a big part would center on her fear of the near future right there oneeye said just as i leaned forward to see what goblin was doing the little bald man had a light hammer and a chisel he tapped the chisel a piece of iron flipped off the key this had been going on for a while evidently because about half the iron was gone revealing something made of gold i was so surprised at the wizards lack of greed that i almost forgot to worry about what they were doing to the key i opened my mouth without looking up oneeye told me dont shit your knickers yet little girl we aint hurting a thing the key is this thing inside this golden hammer you want to bend down a little closer maybe you can read whats inscribed on it i bent i scanned the characters made visible by removal of the iron looks like the same alphabet as the first book of the annals not to mention the first book of the dead which i did not mention goblin used the tip of his chisel to indicate a prominent symbol that appeared in several places doj says he saw this sign at the temple in the grove of doom it should be there i knew that one master santaraksita had taught me its meaning its the personal sign of the goddess her personal chop if you want i did not name a name i suggested dont speak the name not in any of its forms in the presence of this thing that would be guaranteed to attract her attention everyone stared at me i asked you didnt do that already did you no uncle you dont know what this thing might really be do you i had an intuition it was something narayan singh might never have surrendered had he been aware that it was in his possession i thought it might exist solely so that the priest who carried it could obtain the attention of his goddess instantly even in my own religion people had had a much more immediate and scary relationship with the godhead in ancient times the scriptures told us so but no such golden hammer played any part in the kina mythology insofar as i could recall curious maybe master santaraksita could tell me more goblin continued chipping away i continued watching the process went faster as each fragment fell that isnt any hammer i said thats a kind of pickax its a deceiver cult thing and older than dirt it has to be something of huge religious significance i suggested show it to the girl see how she responds youre as close to a kina expert as weve got sleepy what could it be theres actually a name for that kind of tool but i cant remember what it is every deceiver band had a pickax like this not made out of gold though they used them in the burial ceremonies after their murders to break the bones of their victims so they would fold up into a smaller wad sometimes they used them to help dig graves all with the appropriate ceremonies aimed at pleasing kina of course i really do think somebody should show this to the daughter of night and see what she says it seemed like a thousand pairs of eyes were staring at me waiting for me to volunteer i told them im not doing it im going to bed all those eyes kept right on staring i had put myself in charge this was something nobody but the guy in charge ought to handle all right uncle tobo goblin you back me up on this that child has talents we cant guess at yet i had been warned that she still tried to walk away from her flesh at night despite all the constraints surrounding her she was both her mothers daughter and there was no telling what might happen when she had to suffer too much stress tobo protested i dont like to be around her she gives me the creeps goblin beat me to it kid she gives everybody the creeps shes the creepiest thing ive run into in a hundred fifty years get used to it deal with it its part of the job which they say you were born to do and which you did ask for curious goblin the mentor and instructor seemed much more articulate than goblin the wanttobelayabout and slacker the little wizard suggested you carry the key youre young and strong the daughter of night did not look up when we entered the tent perhaps she was not aware of us she seemed to be meditating possibly communing with the dark mother goblin kicked the bars of her cage which rattled nicely and shed a shower of rust well look at her cute what i asked shes been working some kind of spell on the iron its rusting away a thousand times faster than it ought to clever girl only the clever girl looked up our eyes met something behind hers chilled me to the bone only what i asked only every spell holding her and controlling her has that cage for an anchor anything that happens to it will happen to her look at her skin i saw what he meant the daughter of night was not exactly rusty herself but did look spotty and frayed at the surface her gaze shifted to uncle goblin tobo and she gasped like she was seeing the boy for the first time she rose slowly drifted toward the bars gaze locked with his then a little frown danced across her brow her gaze darted down to tobos burden her mouth opened and i swear a sound like the angry bellow of an elephant rolled out her eyes grew huge she lunged forward her shackles gave way the bars of the cage creaked and let fall another shower of rust they bent but did not give she thrust an arm through in a desperate effort to reach the key little bits of skin blackened and fell off her and still she was beautiful i observed i guess we can safely say the thing does hold some significance for the deceivers you could say so goblin admitted the girls whole arm had begun to look like it had been badly burned so lets take it away and see what else we can find out and get the cage reinforced and her shackles replaced tobo the boy kept staring at the girl like he was seeing her for the first time dont tell me he just fell in love i couldnt handle it if we had to worry about that in addition to everything else no uncle doj reassured me not love i think but the future just maybe although i tried to insist he would not expand upon that remark he was still uncle doj the mystery priest of the nyueng bao things came together nicely after the defeat of the relief column murgen said nobody else was likely to challenge us without help from beyond the mountains which help unfortunately was on the way already soulcatcher was airborne and lurching southward in small erratic leaps that nevertheless were bringing her closer faster than any animal could do even one of those magical stallions from the tower at charm but still definitely very feebly for a flying carpet once upon a time the howler could conquer the miles between overlook and taglios in a single night soulcatcher had to rest several hours for every hour she spent aloft even so she was on her way and the impact of the news on the troops was electric with only days left or possibly only hours everyone buckled down and put their back into it i saw very little slacking little wasted effort and some very serious concentration when it came to honing military skills suvrin was right in there with the troops drilling his behind off literally though he had been with us only a short time he had begun to lose weight and show signs of shaping up he approached me soon after murgen and goblin began issuing regular reports about soulcatchers progress i want to stay with you maam he told me you what i was surprised im not sure i want to be part of the black company but i do know for sure that i dont want to be here when the protector shows up she has a reputation for seldom letting herself be swayed by the facts the futility of me having resisted you wont impress her youre right about that if you shirked because you wouldve gotten killed doing what she expected shell arrange it so you get dead anyway in a less pleasant way if possible all right suvrin youve kept your word and youve been a good worker he winced you understand what suvrin actually means junior essentially but youre stuck with it now most people in the company dont go by their birth names even most of the men who go by regular names dont go by their real ones theyre all getting away from their past and you will be too he grimaced report to master santaraksita until i find something else for you your job will be to assist him old baladitya is no use at all hes worse than santaraksita who keeps getting farther and farther behind in his packing because he keeps getting distracted by his books santaraksita had managed to acquire several antique volumes locally that had miraculously survived the countless disasters that had beset the region these past several decades suvrin bowed thank you there was a fresh bounce in his step as he walked away i suspected he and master santaraksita might have a lot in common heck suvrin could even read tobo materialized my father says to tell you that soulcatcher has reached charandaprash and that shes decided to rest there before she crosses the dandha presh a few more hours grace excellent means theres a good chance there wont be anything left here for her to find but our tracks how are you getting along with your mother did you make any effort at all dad also says he wants you to post somebody with a warning horn that can be sounded once the protector gets dangerously close and he says you should pull in the pickets watching the pass now just in case soulcatcher changes her mind about taking some time off that was a good idea runmust and riverwalker made the mistake of being close enough to be seen i sent them to go bring the scouts home tobo you cant ignore your mother youll end up getting along with her worse than she gets along with your grandmother sleepy why cant she just let me grow up because youre her baby you idiot dont you understand that when youre twice as old as oneeye youll still be her baby the only baby that cruel fate hasnt gobbled down you do remember that your mother had other children and she lost them uh yeah ive never had children i never want to have children in part because i can see how horrible it would be to see my own flesh and blood die and not be able to do anything to prevent it family is supposed to be extremely important to you nyueng bao i want you to drop whatever youre doing right now go over and sit on that boulder spend two hours not thinking about anything but what it must have meant to your mother to see your brother and sister die think about how badly she must not want to go through that again think about what it must be like to be her after everything else shes had to go through youre a smart kid you can figure it out when you are around people long enough you get a feel for how they react i could see his first petulant inclination was to remind me that i had been younger than he was now when i attached myself to bucket and the company which had little to do with the argument at hand but which was the sort of tool you grab when you are that age if you intend to say something make sure it makes sense before you do because if you cant think logically and argue logically then there isnt much hope that youll have any success with the sorcery no matter how talented you are i know i know from everything youve seen the bigger the wizards are the crazier they are but within the boundaries of their insanity every one of them is rigorously mathematically rational the entire power of their minds serves their insanity when they stumble its because they let emotions or wishful thinking get in the way all right i surrender ill sit on the damned rock until it hatches oh dad also said to tell you that narayan singh is somewhere close by he can sense the deceiver but he cant pinpoint him kina is protecting him with her dreams dad says you should ask the white crow to look for him if you can find it and get it to sit still long enough crowhunter maybe ill call myself that it sounds more glamorous than sleepy tobo sounds more glamorous than sleepy tobo headed for the boulder and settled in an approved attitude i hoped i had planted seeds that would take root and sprout while he was trying to think of everything else but at least you get to change your name when you grow up stupid anytime i feel like it i can tell everyone to call me whatever strikes my fancy crowhunter gave up her name she was a failure the white monster was nowhere to be found so i went and spent some time with sahra even though she did not welcome me right away we recalled old days hard times her husbands lack of perfection till i thought she was relaxed enough to actually listen to what i had to say about tobo the villain himself scored a coup by showing up with an olive branch at the perfect time i elected to remove myself while things were going well i hoped the peace would last but did not count on forever i would settle for one halcyon week in a week we would know if it was possible to resurrect the captured in a week we would either be dead on the glittering plain or ready to return as a force of ultimate destruction or maybe the warning horn sounded deep in the night when even those who were stuck with guard duty were at their most sluggish but the man on horn duty was married to his job he kept blowing and blowing in minutes our entire encampment was seething and i was out there with my heart in my throat striding along making sure the chaos was only apparent not real everyone remained calm and focused there was no panic i was pleased even a little training and discipline are better than none i ducked into goblins tent sahra and tobo were there already and not at one anothers throats i must have gotten through to the kid i should keep after them both in my copious free time i bent close to the mist projector whats the word murgen whispered soulcatcher is airborne and moving south she plans to arrive shortly after sunrise she has a good idea where you are during her rest time she sent a shadow down to scout your position she didnt learn a lot more the shadow didnt dare get close enough to eavesdrop she plans to don one of her disguises and infiltrate your camp so she can find out what youre really up to from the beginning shes operated under the assumption that were dead out here even though she didnt kill us directly when she trapped us she flew out of there believing wed be dead in just a few days i expect learning that croaker and lady are still alive is going to be the kind of shock that ruins her whole century how fast is she moving strike that you said shed get here just after sunrise is mogaba with her that would make a big difference in how fresh she would be when when she arrived which would determine the shape of what i started doing now no if she manages to get in among you and unearths all the answers to the questions she has shell smash you scatter you grab the key then go back for the great general murgen sneered when he used mogabas title the fact that we never beat him once heads up during the kiaulune wars did nothing to ease our contempt for him as a deserter and traitor warn me if she does anything unexpected sahra have you checked on your mother briefly doj and jojo are helping her and oneeye i think she was a little delirious she kept muttering about a noose and a land of unknown shadows and calling the heaven and earth and the day and the night all evil dies there an endless death that too what is it i dont know a phrase i picked up somewhere it has to do with the plain but i dont know what doj might be able to tell you he promised to be cooperative and forthcoming but since i passed on his offer to make me his apprentice that hasnt materialized my fault as much as his probably i havent taken time to press him i have work to do i ducked out the excitement had become more rigorously organized there were torches and lanterns to light the road to the shadowgate a band of our bravest were up near the gate already arranging more lighting and finetuning the colored powders used as road marks loaded animals were beginning to line up likewise a train of carts babies cried children whined a dog barked without pause sounds of men slipping through the darkness beyond the light came from all around prisoners who had been sure we meant to drag them onto the plain to become human sacrifices were being chivied toward the new town some of the harder men had wanted to use them as bearers instead of the animals disposing of them as their usefulness ended i had demurred they would become obstinate and obstreperous after the first few died and we would not be able to eat them after we ate up the consumables they carried not that the majority of us would eat flesh anyway but those who could would from the beginning i spied willow swan strolling through the mob he spun off orders like a drill instructor i approached him gone nostalgic for the good old days when you were the boss grey a true genius whose name we wont bring up in present company sent all the master sergeants to make preparations at the shadowgate she didnt detail anybody to keep things moving down here the unnamed genius had to admit that he was right river runmust spiff all the men i had known the longest and trusted the most were up there or somewhere out in the darkness i guess i just assumed sahra and i could handle everything else forgetting that i would be sprinting around making decisions for everyone who could not make up their minds for themselves thanks if i dont get a better offer by my fortieth birthday ill marry you yet swan made a halfhearted effort to click his heels so how old are you today seventeen thats about what i guessed with maybe another twenty years of experience plus wear and tear its tough being a teenager today just ask tobo nobodys ever had it as awful as he does he chuckled speaking of kids whos handling the daughter of night which i dont want to be me darn i figured goblin and doj for that but goblins tied up helping keep track of soulcatcher and doj has gota and oneeye to worry about thanks for reminding me i headed back toward goblins tent hey short wart leave it to tobo and sahra a while we got to get the daughter of night loaded up goblin came out muttering surveyed the excitement grumbled all right lets get at it only how come the fuck we never gave her a name so what if she dont want one she dont want to live in no cage either even booboo would be easier than calling her daughter of night all the time whoa what the fuck is that he stared past me downhill i turned saw a pair of red eyes bobbing in the darkness coming closer fast i grabbed for my sword then i frowned as i heard the hoofbeats then i said hey buddy is that you what the heck are you doing here i thought you had yourself a job working for the traitor the old black stallion stepped close lowered its head to nuzzle the hair beside my right ear i hugged it around the neck we had been friends once upon a time but i had not thought we were so close that it would desert mogaba and track me down over hundreds of miles once it discovered that i was still alive the creatures had been created to serve the lady of the tower but were supposed to be used to passing from one secondary master to another this one had been murgens before it had become mine then i had lost it you ought to get out of here i told it your timings really lousy soulcatcher is going to be all over us in just a few hours if were not already up there on that plain the horse surveyed my companions and what it could see of the company shuddered then turning its gaze on swan the stallion managed a very human snort i patted its neck im not sure i dont agree with you but willow does have his redeeming qualities he just keeps them well hidden go ahead and tag along if you want im not riding not without a saddle swan chuckled so much for the conquering vehdna horsemen whose pride disdained both saddles and stirrups admitting no shortcomings of my own i still have to observe that most of those proud horsemen were over six feet tall ill find you a ladder and promise never to say a word about how those proud conquerors fared as soon as they ran into cavalry who did favor saddles and stirrups bite him buddy to my amazement the stallion snorted and nipped at willows shoulder swan leaped back you always did have a temper and bad manners halfass might be the company far be it from me to interfere with your sparking crowhunter goblin said but i thought you had a notion to do something with booboo sarcastic eavesdropping mudsucker i did didnt i and i overlooked our old pal khusavir pete too i havent checked in on him lately either is he still healthy the horse nuzzled me again i patted its neck maybe it felt more nostalgic about our good old days than i did i can check you definitely overlooked him in your master plan oh no i didnt not a bit i have a very special mission cooked up specially for khusavir pete and if he pulls it off not only will he get to stay alive ill forgive everything he did at kushkhoshi somebody shouted a scarlet fireball blistered across the night it missed its target it did not miss a tent however then another tent after that then the crude wooden barracks the men had built while they were waiting for me to arrive all three began to smolder that was narayan singh willow swan said stating what twoscore people had seen during the carmine instant and he had booboo can it swan i started yelling at everyone nearby trying to organize a pursuit goblin told me calm down sleepy all we need to do is wait till she starts screaming then go pick her up i had forgotten the incredible array of control spells attached to the daughter of night her pain would increase geometrically as she moved farther away from her cage then at some distance known only to goblin and oneeye choke spells would kick in and tighten rapidly narayan could take her away from us but only at the cost of killing her unless i asked the spells have to be taken off from outside she could be her mother and sister the shadowmasters and the ten who were taken all rolled into one and shed still have to have somebody else help her get loose all right then well wait for the screams there were no screams not then or ever murgen looked hard he could find no sign kina was dreaming strongly protecting her own goblin remained adamant that they had to be close by that there was no way the daughter of night had shed her connection to her cage i told swan then you gather up some men and drag that cage up to the shadowgate well make her follow us the warning horn sounded again soulcatcher had crossed the summit she was on our side of the dandha presh there were hints of light in the east it was time to leave a brutal argument was under way aboard soulcatchers carpet as she approached her destination skimming the rocks the suns blinding fires behind her part of her wanted to forget about assuming a disguise and infiltrating the enemy that part wanted to arrive as a killing storm destroying everything and everyone that was not soulcatcher but by doing that she would expose herself to the counterefforts of people who had shown themselves very resourceful in the past innovation was one of the more irksome traditions of the black company she grounded the carpet and stepped off concealed it using a minor spell then she crept toward the company encampment a few yards at a time until she found a good hiding place where she could undertake the illusion creations and modest shapechanges that would render her unrecognizable that work required total concentration back in the brush not far from where she had set down uncle doj crept forward and after having used his small wizards skills to make sure there were no booby traps demolished soulcatchers flying carpet in a straightforward nononsense manner using a hatchet he might be old and a step slower but he was still very quick and very sneaky he was almost all the way back to the shadowgate when soulcatcher appeared looking the epitome of scruffy young manhood a white crow balanced precariously in a bit of rainhungry brush observed her passage when she could no longer glance back and see anything damning the bird flapped into the place where she had changed and started going through the clothing and whatnot she had left behind the bird kept making noises like it was talking to itself soulcatcher entered the encampment where she had expected to find the remnants of the black company it was empty but up ahead she saw a long column already beyond the shadowgate one man with a sword across his back had not passed through the gate yet but he was moving swiftly and a number of people were waiting for him just on the other side they did have the key and they had used the damned thing she should have gotten here faster she should have attacked dammit everyone knew subtlety was no good with these people hey they had to have known that she was coming there was no other explanation for this they had known she was coming and they knew where she was now and the first fireball was so accurately directed that it would have taken her head off if she had not been getting down already in another moment the damned things were streaking in from several different sources they set brush afire and shattered rocks she got down on her stomach and crawled before she worried about her dignity she had to get away from the focal point of the fire unfortunately her efforts did not seem to matter the assassins seemed to know exactly where she was and her disguise did not fool them for an instant as a swarm of fireballs closed in she flung herself into a deep hole that had been a cesspit not that long ago no matter right now shelter was priceless now the snipers could not get her without coming out of hiding and coming to her she took advantage of the respite to engineer prepare and launch a counterattack that involved a lot of color and fire and boiling oily explosions none of which did much harm because her surviving attackers had fled through the shadowgate as soon as she went into the pit she climbed out nothing happened she glared up the hill so even the snipers were beyond the shadowgate now nearly a dozen people were standing around there waiting to see what she would do she calmed herself she could not let them goad her into doing something stupid the shadowgate was in extremely delicate shape one angry thoughtless move on her part might damage it beyond repair she conquered the rage that threatened to conquer her she was ancient in her wickedness time was an intimate ally she knew how to abide she limped uphill urging her anger to bleed off in movement with an ease no normal being could manage the slope immediately below the shadowgate was covered with swaths and patches of colored chalk a carefully marked safe path passed through soulcatcher did not yield to temptation and try to follow it there was a chance that they had forgotten that she had gone this way before or perhaps they refused to believe she could recall that in those days the safe path had entered the shadowgate eight feet farther west just beyond that rusty twisted iron cage lying on its side as though it was exhausted and dying she waved a finger naughty naughty willow swan damn his treacherous shouldbedead bones and the nyueng bao family stared back impassively the palefaced little wizard goblin smirked obviously remembering whose fault it was that she could no longer walk normally and the ugly little woman smiled evilly she said i wasnt trying to suck you in sweet stuff i did suck you in she lifted a hand and raised a middle finger in a sign obviously learned from a northerner water sleeps protector what the hell did that mean no human being can jump as high as soulcatcher did nevertheless she managed to get her heels ten feet off the ground a gnats breath before the fireball ripped through the air where she had stood i should have kept my big darned mouth shut gloating will do you in every time how many stories and sagas are there where the hero survives because his captor insists on wasting time bragging and gloating before the execution add another one to the roll where company annalist sleepy does the incredibly dumb deed and leaves the target not quite relaxed enough of course she was fast epically fast poor old khusavir pete only got off two more fireballs before soulcatcher got to him where we had left him chained it did not play out the way i hoped only the way i expected now khusavir pete would have a hard time repaying any debt he still owed us i caught a glimpse of motion the white crow plunging like a striking hawk it pulled out and glided away i murmured to myself sister sister i was beginning to read the messages come here tobo he was carrying the key he was supposed to be up at the head of the column but had hung back so he could watch the fireworks he was the only one of us who did not have the sense to be frightened because he was not up where he belonged all progress had come to a halt above us he wore a hangdog look as he approached he expected to be chastised and he would be later hold up the key but wont that the company isnt a debating club tobo show her the key today he hoisted the key overhead angrily the morning sunlight blazed off the golden pick soulcatcher did not show much excitement but i had not meant the demonstration for her benefit really i wanted narayan singh to know what he had let slip through his fingers it was the key of course but it was also some ancient and holy relic of kinas strangler cult in their glory days every deceiver company priest had carried a replica i muttered you win some you lose some narayan in the excitement you got the girl back but ive got this and i can carry it youve got the daughter of night and you can take her anywhere you want to if you can carry her and her cage goblin and oneeye had crafted a masterpiece of wicked sorcery she could not even escape by destroying the cage whatever happened to it would happen to her i was not pleased about having to leave the cage behind but the shadowgate had been decidedly stubborn in resisting its passage that could have been overcome by sheer muscle power but i had not been able to get enough men onto it fast enough to force it through before the fireballs started flying good luck baby darkness dragging all that iron around whilst you pursue your wickedness i hoped singh had left the book of the dead hidden on the other side of the dandha presh so it would be a long time before the girl and it embraced one another long enough for me to get where i wanted to go and accomplish what i wanted to accomplish thats good tobo now get back up front and get this mob moving swan tell me about the camping circles and give me your best guess about how soon were likely to run into trouble because of breaks in the protection of the road i dont remember them ever being more than a few hours apart and although we used them as camping places i think that they were actually crossroads thats easier to tell at night ominously he added youll see everything is different at night i did not like the sound of that i was still in the rear guard and only halfway to the crest when soulcatcher found out what had happened to her flying carpet the sound of her anger reached us despite the dampening effect of whatever barrier stood between us and the rest of the world the earth shivered at the same time uncle doj was not far away standing at the edge of the road watching for evidence of his success i said she seems displeased with the prospect of having to walk home my friend the horse stood behind me looking over my shoulder it made a sound that could have passed for a snicker if it had not been a horse making it doj indulged in a rare smile he was thoroughly pleased with himself willow swan asked me what did you do now not me doj he totally obliterated her means of transport shes on her own two hooves now shes a hundred miles from her only friend and goblins already fixed up one of her feet so she cant run or dance what youre telling me then is that youve created another limper he was old enough to remember that nemesis of the company i could not contradict him i did lose my smile i had read those annals often because they had been recorded by the captain himself when he was young nah i dont think so soulcatcher doesnt have the concentrated venom and nearly divine malice that possessed the limper she doesnt get obsessed the way he did shes more chaos walking while he was malevolence incarnate i showed swan my crossed fingers id better dash up front and pretend that i know what im doing tobo he went ahead without you doj said you upset him i noted that the column had resumed moving which meant that tobo was on the plain already carrying the key like a protective talisman i needed to give a lot of thought to the fact that that artifact evidently considered a holy of holies by the stranglers may actually have been brought off the plain into my world by the ancestors of the nyueng bao i had to spend some thought on what the key might mean to the last informed priest of the nyueng bao something beside the road caught my attention just before i reached the crest and got my first close look at the glittering plain it was a small frog mostly black but with stripes and whorls of dark green upon its back it had eyes the color of fresh blood it clung to a slightly tilted slab of greyblack rock it wanted to go somewhere anywhere but its right hind leg was injured and when it tried to jump it just sort of spun around in place where the heck did that come from there isnt supposed to be anything alive up here i had been looking forward to having the clouds of flies that followed the animals get thinned out when they buzzed out beyond the safe zones and encountered killer shadows swan said it wont be alive for long the white crow dropped it i think it was bringing it along for a snack he pointed at the white crow bolder than ever the bird had made itself at home on the back of my friend the mystic stallion the horse seemed content with the situation perhaps even a little smug when it looked at me i just remembered swan said for what its worth last time we came up here croaker made everybody who belonged to the company touch their badges and amulets to the black stripe that runs down the middle of the road right after he touched the stripe with the lancehead on the standard maybe none of that amounts to anything but im a superstitious kind of guy and id be more comfortable youre right so be quiet i recently reread everything murgen had to say about his trip and he thought it might be a good idea too tobo hold up i did not believe the boy would actually hear me over the clatter generated by the column but did expect that people would pass the word i looked at the hapless frog once more and marveled that the crow was smart enough to let it go then i hastened to overtake our fledgling wizard the column stopped tobo had gotten my message he had chosen not to ignore it maybe he had caught something from the white crow his mother and grandmother both were right there with him where he waited making sure he did sensible things he was exasperated by the delay he was already far ahead of everyone but sahra and gota ah as i recalled murgen had had the same trouble with the lance of passion my first glimpse of the plain awed me its immensity was indescribable it was as flat as a table forever it was grey on grey on grey with the road just barely darker there was no doubt whatsoever that this was all one vast artifact hang on tobo dont go any farther i called we almost forgot something you need to take the key and touch it to the black stripe that runs down the middle of the road what black stripe swan said it doesnt show up nearly as well this time but its there if you look it was i found it come back this way you can see it back here tobo backtracked reluctantly maybe i should have gota carry the key she could not move fast enough to outrun the rest of us i stared on beyond tobo feeling a faint touch of that passion to hurry myself i was getting close to my brothers now darkgrey clouds were beginning to gather down there murgen had mentioned a nearly permanent overcast that nevertheless did not always seem to have been around during his nights i could make out no hint of the ruined fortress that was supposed to be a few days ahead of us i did see plenty of the standing stones that were one of the outstanding features of the plain i see it tobo shouted pointing downward the little idiot swung the pickax burying the point in the road surface the earth shuddered this was no devastating quake like those some of us recalled from years ago when half the shadowlands had been laid waste it was just strong enough to be sensed and set tongues wagging and animals protesting the morning sun must have touched the plain oddly somehow because all the standing stones began to sparkle people oohed and aahed i said i guess this is why they call it glittering stone swan demurred i dont think so but i could be wrong dont forget what i said about the company badges i havent forgotten tobo pried the pick out of the roads surface the earth shifted again as gently as before when i joined him he was staring downward baffled it healed itself sleepy what when i hit it the pick went in sort of like the road was soft and when i yanked it back out the hole healed itself swan remarked the center stripe is getting easier to see he was right maybe that was because of the brightening sunlight the ground trembled again behind me voices changed tone becoming frightened as well as awed i glanced back a huge mushroom of dark rouge dust with black filigree highlights running through it boiled up from whence we had come its topmost surface seemed almost solid but as it rose and moved the pieces of junk riding on it fell off goblin burst into laughter so wicked it must have carried for miles somebody got into my treasure trove i hope she learned a really painful lesson i was close enough for him to add a whispered i wish it could be fatal but theres not much chance of that probably not ill settle for crippling her other leg i said sahra theres something i need you to do you remember murgen telling us how he kept getting ahead of everyone when he came up here tobo has been doing the same thing try to slow him down sahra sighed wearily she nodded ill stop him she seemed apathetic though i dont want him stopped i just want him slowed down enough so everyone else can keep up this could be important later i decided the two of us needed to have a long talk in private the way we used to do before everything got so busy it was obvious that she needed to get some things out where they could be lined up and swatted down and pushed away from her long enough for her heart to heal she did need healing and for that she had no one to blame but herself she did not want to accept the world as it was she seemed worn out from fighting it and in those ways she had begun to look very much like her mother i told her put a leash on him if thats what it takes tobo glowered at me i ignored him i made a brief speech suggesting anyone who carried a black company badge should press it to the roads surface right where tobo had wounded it the public readings aloud i had been doing had included murgens adventures on the plain nobody questioned my suggestion or refused to accept it the column began moving again slowly as we found ways to bless if only secondarily the animals and those who did not have company badges i stayed in place and said something positive to everyone who passed by i was amazed at the number of women and children and noncombatants in general who had managed to attach themselves to the band without me really noticing the captain would be appalled uncle doj was last to go by that troubled me vaguely a nyueng bao to the rear more nyueng bao to the front with the foremost a halfbreed but the whole company was a miscegenation there were only two men in this whole crowd who had belonged to the company when it had arrived from the north goblin and oneeye oneeye was almost spent and goblin was doing his determined best quietly to pass on as many skills as he could to tobo before the inevitable began to overhaul him as well i walked past the slowmoving file intent on getting back up near the point so i could be among the first to see anything new i did not see or feel any particular mission in anyone i passed it seemed that a quiet despair informed everyone these were not good signs this meant the euphoria of our minor successes had collapsed most of these people realized that they had become refugees swan told me we have an expression up north going from the frying pan into the fire seems like about what weve done here really we got away from soulcatcher but now what now we march on until we find our buried brothers then we break them out youre not really as simple as you pretend are you no im not but i do like to let people know that things arent always as difficult as they want to make them i glanced around to see who might overhear i have the same doubts everyone else has swan my feet are on this path as much because i dont know what else to do as they are out of high ideals sometimes i look at my life and it seems pretty pathetic ive spent more than a decade conspiring and committing crimes so i can go dig up some old bones in order to find somebody who can tell me what to do surrender to the will of the night what sounds like something narayan singh would say doesnt it in my great grandfathers time it was the slogan of the ladys supporters they believed that peace prosperity and security would result inevitably if all power could be concentrated in the hands of the right strongwilled person and it did turn out that way more or less in principalities that did surrender to the will of the night particularly near the core of the empire there were generations of peace and prosperity plague pestilence and famine were uncommon warfare was a curiosity going on far far away criminals were hunted down with a ferocity that overawed all but the completely crazy ones but there was always bad trouble along the frontiers the ladys minions the ten who were taken all wanted to build subempires of their own which never lacked for external enemies and they all had their own ancient feuds with one another hell even peace and prosperity create enemies if youre doing all right theres always somebody who wants to take it away from you i never pictured you as a philosopher swan oh im a wonder after you get to know me im sure you are what are you trying to tell me i dont know killing time jacking my jaw making the trip go faster or maybe just reminding you that you shouldnt get too distressed about the vagaries of human nature ive been getting my roots ripped out and my life overturned and a boot in my butt propelling me into an unknown future blindfolded for so long now that i am getting philosophical about it i enjoy the moment in a different context i do surrender to the will of the night despite my religious upbringing i have never cherished a fatalistic approach to life surrender to the will of the night put my life in the hands of god god is great god is good god is merciful there is no god but god this we are taught but the bhodi philosophers may be right when they tell us that homage to the gods is best served when seconded by human endeavor going to get dark after a while swan reminded me thats one of those things ive been trying to avoid thinking about i confessed but narayan singh was right darkness always comes and when it did we would find out just how wonderful a talisman our key was have you noticed how the pillars keep on glittering even though the sky has started to look like its going to rain i have murgen never mentioned this one phenomenon i wondered if we had not done something never done before did this happen last time you were up here no there was a lot of glitter when we had direct sunlight but none that seemed like it was selfgenerated uhm and was it this cold it had been getting chillier all day i recall a sort of highland chill nothing intolerable whoa sounds like party time a whoop and holler had broken out at the head of the column i could not determine a cause visually being of the short persuasion what is it the kids stopped looks like hes found something what tobo had found were the remains of the nar sindawe who had been one of our best officers in the old days and possibly the villain mogabas brother certainly those two had been as close as brothers until the siege of jaicur when mogaba chose to usurp command of the company clear away from him people i growled give the experts room to take a look the experts being goblin who dropped to his knees and scooted around the corpse slowly moving his head up and down murmuring some sort of cantrips touching absolutely nothing until he was certain there was no danger i dropped to one knee myself he got a lot farther than i wouldve expected goblin said he was tougher than rawhide was it shadows the body had that look yes goblin pushed gently the corpse rolled slightly nothing left here hes a driedout mummy a voice from behind me said search him you retard he mightve been carrying a message i glanced back oneeye stood behind me leaning on an ugly black cane the effort had him shivering or maybe that was just the cold air he had been riding one of the donkeys tied into place so he would not fall if he dozed off which he did a lot these days i suggested move him over to the side of the road we need to keep this crowd moving we have about eight more miles to go before we stop for the night i pulled that eight out of the air but it was a fact that we needed to keep moving we were better prepared for this evolution than our predecessors had been but our resources remained limited swan when a mule with a tent comes along cut it out of line uhm we need to make a travois to bring the body every face within earshot went blank were still the black company we still dont leave our own behind which was never strictly true but you do have to serve an ideal the best you can lest it become debased a law as ancient as coinage itself says bad money will drive out good the same is true of principles ethics and rules of conduct if you always do the easier thing then you cannot possibly remain steadfast when it becomes necessary to take a difficult stand you must do what you know to be right and you do know ninetynine times out of a hundred you do know and you are just making excuses because the right thing is so hard or just inconvenient heres his badge goblin said producing a beautifully crafted silver skull in which the one ruby eye seemed to glow with an inner life sindawe had made that himself it was an exquisite piece from talented hands you want to take it that was the custom gradually developed since the adoption of the badges under soulcatchers suzerainty back when the captain was just a young tagalong with a quill pen the badges of the fallen were passed down to interested newcomers who were expected to learn their lineage and thus keep the names alive it is immortality of a sort i jumped sahra made a startled noise i recalled that something similar had happened to murgen last time although in that case only he had sensed it i thought maybe i ought to consult him an entire squad of soldiers had been assigned to tend and transport the mist projector as delicately as was humanly possible even tobo was under orders to match his pace to that manageable by the crew moving our most valuable resource tobo had not done a good job of conforming carts creaked past pack animals shied away from sindawes remains but never so far they risked straying from the safety of the road i had begun to suspect that they could sense the danger better than i could because i had to rely entirely upon intellect for my own salvation only the black stallion seemed unmoved by sindawes fate the white crow seemed very much interested in the corpse i had the feeling sindawe was someone it knew and mourned ridiculous of course unless that was murgen inside there as someone had suggested trapped outside his own time master santaraksita came along leading a donkey baladitya the copyist bestrode the beast he studied a book as he rode completely out of touch with his surroundings perhaps that was because he could not see them or he did not believe in the world outside his books he had the lead rope of another donkey tied to his wrist that poor beast staggered under a load consisting mostly of books and the tools of the librarians trade among the books were some of the annals on loan including those that i had salvaged from the library santaraksita pulled out of line this is so absolutely exciting dorabee having adventures at my age being pursued through ancient eldritch living artifacts by terrible sorcerers and unearthly powers its like stepping into the pages of the old vedas im glad youre enjoying it so much this man used to be one of our brothers his adventure caught up with him about fourteen years ago and hes still in one piece nothing lives on the plain unless it has the plains countenance even including the flies and carrion eaters youd expect to find around a corpse anywhere but there are crows here he indicated birds circling at a distance i had not noticed them because they were making no sounds and there were only a few of them in the air as many as a dozen more perched atop the stone columns the nearest of those were now just a few hundred yards ahead theyre not here to feast i said theyre the protectors eyes they run to her and repeat whatever we do if they touch down after dark theyll end up just as dead as sindawe did hey swan right now up and down the column pass the word nobody does anything to bother those crows it might break holes in the protection the road gives against the shadows youre determined to put me on catchers shit list arent you what she doesnt know im not dead does she those crows are going to put the finger on me i laughed soulcatchers displeasure shouldnt worry you right now she cant get to you you never know he went off to tell everybody i wanted those watchcrows treated like favored pets a strange and intriguing man santaraksita observed strange anyway but hes a foreigner were all foreigners here dorabee that was true very true i could close my eyes and still be overwhelmed by the strangeness of the plain in fact i felt that more strongly when i was not looking at it when my eyes were closed it seemed as aware of me as i was aware of it once we got sindawe loaded i continued walking beside master santaraksita the librarian was every bit as excited as he claimed everything was a wonder to him except the weather is it always this cold here dorabee its not even winter yet he knew about snow only by repute ice he knew as something that fell from the sky during the ferocious storms of the rainy season it could get a lot colder i dont know swan says he dont recall it being this chilly the last time he was up here but that was at a different time of year and the circumstances of the incursion were different i was willing to bet that seldom in its history had the plain ever experienced the crying of a colicky baby or the barking of a dog one of the children had sneaked the dog along and now it was too late to change anyones mind how long will we be up here ah the question nobodys had the nerve to ask youre more familiar with the early annals than i am anymore youve had months and months to study them while i havent had time to keep my own up to date what did they tell you about the plain nothing not who built it not why by implication kina is involved somehow so are the free companies of khatovar and the golem demon shivetya at least we think the thing in the fortress up ahead is the demon whos supposed to stand guard over kinas resting place not very effectively apparently because the ancient king rhaydreynak drove the deceivers of his time into the same caverns where soulcatcher trapped the captured and we know that the books of the dead are down there somewhere we know that uncle doj says without offering any convincing evidence the nyueng bao are the descendants of another free company but we also know that uncle and mother gota sometimes mention things that arent part of the usual lore dorabee santaraksita i found wore that expression he always put on when i surprised him i grinned told him i rehearse all this every day twenty times a day i just dont usually do it out loud i believe i was hoping you would add something to the mix is there anything by direct experience we know that it takes three days to get to the fortress i assume that stronghold is located at the heart of the plain we know theres a network of protected roads and circles where those roads intersect where roads exist there must be someplace to go to me that says there must be at least one more shadowgate somewhere i looked up you think you bet our survival on the possibility that theres another way off the plain yep we didnt have anywhere left to run back there there was that look again suvrin plodding along and listening in silence had that look too i said although ive been surrounded by gunni all my life im still unfamiliar with the more obscure legendry and i know even less about that of the older less wellknown nonproselytizing cults what do you know about the land of unknown shadows it seems to be tied in with aphorisms like all evil dies there an endless death and calling the heaven and the earth and the day and the night the last one is easy dorabee thats an invocation of the supreme being you might also hear it as the formula calling the earth and the wind and the sea and the sky or even calling yesterday and today and tonight and tomorrowyou spout those off thoughtlessly because theyre easy and you have to deliver a certain number of prayers every day im sure vehdna who actually keep up with their prayers take the same shortcuts twinges of guilt my duties of faith had suffered abominably the past six months are you sure no but it sure sounded good didnt it easy you asked about gunni i could be wrong in a different religious context of course how about bone warrior stone soldier or soldier of darkness excuse me dorabee never mind unless something related occurs to you id better trot up the line and get tobo slowed down again as i passed the black stallion and white crow the latter chuckled and whispered that sister sister phrase again the bird had heard the entire conversation chances were that it was not murgen nor was it soulcatchers creature but still it was extremely interested in the doings of the black company to the point of trying to give warnings it seemed quite pleased that we were headed south and were unable to turn back behind me master santaraksitas group paused he and baladitya studied the face of the first stone column where golden characters still sparked occasionally it is immortality of a sort the people of the former shadowlands clung to the best cover available while they watched nemesis cross their country in a slow and angry progression toward the pass through the dandha presh in more than one place soulcatchers appearance gave rise to the rumor that khadi had been reborne and was walking through the world again she always did love a good practical joke what the witnesses saw seemed to be the goddess in her most terrible aspect she was naked except for a girdle of dried penises and a necklace of babies skulls her skin was a polished mahogany black she was hairless everywhere she had vampire fangs and an extra pair of arms she seemed about ten feet tall what she did not seem was happy people stayed out of her way she was not alone in her wake came an equally naked woman as white as soulcatcher was dark she was five and a half feet tall even covered with cuts and bruises and dirt she was attractive her face was empty of all expression but her eyes burned with patient hatred she wore only one item of ornamentation a shoulder harness to which a cable ten feet long had been attached that cable connected her to the rusty iron cage floating in the air behind her the cage enclosed a skinny old man who had suffered several severe injuries including a broken leg and some bad burns the girl was compelled to tow the cage she never spoke even when the monster encouraged her with a switch possibly she had lost the faculty narayan singh had been the unfortunate who triggered goblins booby trap not its beloved intended the deceiver shared the cage with a large bound book he was too weak to keep it closed wind toyed with its pages once in a while the breeze showed its vicious side and yanked a page away from the books tired binding sometimes delirious narayan thought he was in the hands of his goddess either being punished for some forgotten transgression or transported to paradise and perhaps he was right it did not occur to soulcatcher to wonder what use she had for him alive not that she was taking any special trouble to keep him that way nor did the daughter of night seem particularly concerned about his fate i managed to overtake tobo before he sped through the crossroads circle were stopping here i told him hanging onto his shoulder he looked at me like he was trying to remember who i was back up to the circle all right you dont have to be so pushy good the real you is back yes i do no one else seems to be able to restrain you as we stepped into the circle i told him there should be a yes right here there was a hole in the roadway surface four inches deep and as big around as my wrist put the handle of the pickax in that why if the shadows can get inside the protected areas thats the direction theyll come from come on do it weve got a ton of work to do if were going to set up a safe camp there were too many of us to get everyone inside the circle that meant some would have to overnight on the road not a practice encouraged by murgen i wanted only the calmest personalities back there murgen guaranteed that every night on the plain would be some kind of adventure suvrin found me trying to get iqbal and his family moved toward the heart of the circle the animals were hobbled there and i had a feeling that the plain really did not like being trampled upon by things with such hard feet what is it suvrin master santaraksita would like to see you at your earliest convenience he grinned like he was having a wonderful time suvrin have you been getting into the ganja or something im just happy i missed the protectors state visit therefore im all right until sometime thats still far off yet im on the greatest adventure of my life going places no one of my generation would have thought possible even a few weeks ago it wont last it just plain wont last the way my luck runs but im for damned sure having fun now except my feet hurt welcome to the black company get used to it bunions should be our seal not a fire breathing skull did anyone learn anything useful today my guess would be that master santaraksita might have come up with something else why would he bother to send me to find you you got bold and sarky fast once you got up here ive always thought im more likable when im not afraid i glanced around i wondered if stupid ought not to be in there somewhere too show me where the old boy is suvrin had the chatters bad for him hes a wonder isnt he santaraksita i dont know about that hes something keep an eye out that you dont accidentally find his hand fishing around in your pants suvrin had made camp for himself and the older men right at the edge of the circle on its eastern side santaraksita had to have picked the spot it was directly opposite the nearest standing stone the librarian was seated gunnistyle crosslegged as near the edge as he dared get staring at the pillar is that you dorabee come sit with me i overcame a burst of impatience settled i was out of shape for that the company continued its northern habits using chairs and stools and whatnot even though we now had only two old crew souls left such is inertia what are we looking for master it was obvious he was watching the standing stone lets see if youre as bright as i believe you are there was a challenge i could not ignore i stared at the column and waited for truth to declare itself a group of the characters on the pillar brightened momentarily that had nothing to do with the light of the setting sun which had begun creeping in under the edge of the clouds that was painting everything bloody after a while i told santaraksita it seems to be illuminating groups of characters according to some pattern mainly in reading order i think down and to the left reading downward in columns isnt uncommon in the temple literature of antiquity some inks dried quite slowly if you wrote in horizontal lines you sometimes smeared your earlier work writing downward in columns right to left suggests to me lefthandedness possibly those who placed the stellae were mostly lefthanded it struck me that writing whatever way was convenient for you personally could lead to a lot of confusion i said so absolutely dorabee deciphering classical writing is always a challenge particularly if the ancient copyists had time on their hands and were inclined to play pranks ive seen manuscripts put together so that they could be read both horizontally and vertically and each way tells a different story definitely the work of someone who had no worries about his next meal todays formal rules have been around for only a few generations they were agreed upon simply so we could read one anothers work and they still havent penetrated the lay population to any depth most of that i knew already but he needed his moments of pedantry to feel complete they cost me nothing and what do we have here im not sure my eyes arent sharp enough to pick up everything but the characters on the stone closely resemble those in your oldest book and ive been able to discern a few simple words he showed me what he had written down it was not enough to make sense of anything mostly i think were looking at names possibly arranged in a holy scripture sort of way maybe a rollcalloftheancestors kind of thing it is immortality of a sort perhaps certainly you can find similarly conceived monuments in almost every older city iron was a popular material for those who considered themselves truly rich and historically significant generally though they were erected to celebrate individuals notably kings and conquerers who wanted following generations to know all about them and every one of those ive ever seen was a complete puzzle to the people living around it now thus a feeble immortality of a sort and theres the point well all achieve our immortality in the next world however we may conceive that but we all want to be remembered in this one i suppose so that when the newly dead arrive in heaven theyll already know who we are and yes even though i am a devout practicing gunni im very cynical about what humanity brings to the religious experience im always intrigued by your thinking master santaraksita but in todays circumstances i just dont have time to sit around musing on humanitys innumerable foibles nor even those of god or the gods if you prefer santaraksita chuckled do you find it amusing to see our roles thus reversed a few months in the real world had done wonders for his attitude he accepted his situation and tried to learn from it i considered accusing him of being a bhodi fellow traveler i fear im much less of a thinker than you like to believe master ive never had time for it im probably really more of a parrot than anything and i suspect that surviving in your trade eventually leaves everyone more philosophical than you want to admit dorabee or more brutal none of these men were ever sterling subjects santaraksita shrugged you remain a wonder whether or not you wish to be one he made a gesture to indicate the standing stone well there you have it it may say something or it may just be remembering the otherwise unheralded whose ashes nourished weeds or it may even be trying to communicate since some of the characters seem to have changed his tone became one of intense interest as he completed his last sentence dorabee the inscription doesnt remain constant i must have a closer look at one of those stellae dont even think about it youd probably be dead before you got to it and would get the rest of us dead too he pouted thiss the dangerous part of the adventure i told him thiss the part that leaves us no room for innovation or deviation or expressing our personalities youve seen sindawe no better or stronger man ever lived that was nothing he deserved whenever you feel creative you just go look on that travois then take another look gah it smells like the inside of a stable here already a little breeze wouldnt hurt as long as it blew away from me the animals were all crowded together and surrounded so they could not do something stupid like wander out of the protective circle and herbivores tend to generate vast quantities of byproduct all right all right i dont make a habit of doing whats stupid dorabee he grinned really what about how you got here maybe its a hobby he could laugh at himself theres stupid and stupid none of those boulders is going to make my pebble turn into a standing stone im not sure if thats a compliment or an insult just keep an eye on the rock and let me know if it says anything interesting it occurred to me to wonder if these pillars were related to the pillars the company had found in the place called the plain of fear long before my time those stones had even walked and talked unless the captain exaggerated even worse than i thought whoa look there right along the edge of the road thats a shadow being sneaky its already dark enough for them to start moving around it was time i started moving around making sure everyone remained calm the shadows could not reach us if no one did anything stupid but they might try to provoke a panic the way hunters will try to scare up game despite the numbers and the animals and my own pessimism nothing went wrong goblin and i made repeated rounds of the circle and the tailback running north up the protected road we found everyone in a mood to be cooperative i suppose that had something to do with the shadows clinging to the surface of our invisible protection and oozing around like evil leeches nothing focuses the attention like the proximity of a bad death there are other ways in and out of this circle besides the one we came in and the one were going to use tomorrow i told goblin how come we cant see them i dont know maybe its magic maybe you ought to ask oneeye why him youve been around long enough that you shouldve discovered the truth he knows everything just ask hell tell you evidently he was less worried about his friend he was back to picking on oneeye you know youre right i havent had much chance to talk to him but i did notice that hes going allout to be a pain why dont we go wake him up tell him hes in charge and get ourselves some shuteye which is what we did with slight modifications after we made sure there was a watch rotation for every potential entry into the circle whether it could be seen or not with help from gota and uncle doj oneeye was still capable of contributing a little something to his own protection not that he was willing to admit that i believe goblin went off and whispered something to tobo too after we went our respective ways i had just gotten comfortable on my nice rock bed when sahra invited herself over for a chat i really was tired and uncharitable when i sensed her presence i just wanted her to go away and she did not stay long she said murgen wanted to talk to you but i told him you were exhausted and needed to rest he wanted me to warn you that your dreams may be particularly vivid and probably confusing he said just dont go anywhere and dont panic i have to go tell goblin and oneeye and uncle and some others and have them spread the word to everyone else rest easy she patted my hand letting me know we were still friends i grunted and closed my eyes murgen was right night on the glittering plain was another adventure entirely the landmarks were similar but seemed to be ghosts of their daytime selves and the sky was not to be trusted the plain itself was still all shades of grey but now with some sort of implied illumination that left all the angles and edges clearly defined once when i glanced upward i saw a full moon and the sky crowded with stars then only moments later the overcast was back and there was nothing to be seen at all the characters inscribed on the standing stones all seemed busy which was not something murgen had noted during his own visit i watched for a moment recognizing individual characters but no words nevertheless i had an epiphany i would have to pass on to master santaraksita in the morning the inscriptions on the pillars did begin at the upper right and read downward for the first column the second column read from the bottom upward then the third read back down and so on i became more interested in the things moving amongst the pillars though there were some big shadows out there things with a presence potent enough to terrify and scatter the little shadows radiating hunger as they crawled over the surface of our protection the big ones would not come closer they had about them an air of infinite wicked patience that left me convinced they would be out there waiting if it took a thousand years for one of us to screw up and open a gap in our protection in dream all roads leading into the circle were equally welldefined each was a glimmering ruler stroke running off to glowing domes in the distance of all those roads and domes though only those on our northsouth trace seemed to be fully alive either the road knew what we wanted to do or it knew what it wanted us to do in an instant i was amazed bewildered terrified exultant having realized that in order to see what i was seeing i would have to be at least a dozen feet above my normal height of eye which meant that i had to go outside my skin the way murgen did and while i had wished for the ability a thousand times and the view was engrossing the risks were none i cared to face when the opportunity was real i sped a prayer heavenward god needs to be reminded i was totally ecstatically happy being sleepy without one shred of mystical talent really if it was necessary that somebody in my gang do this sort of thing goblin or oneeye or uncle doj or almost anyone else could have the magic sparing only tobo despite him being the prophesied future of the company tobo was still a little too short on selfdiscipline to be handed any more capabilities the presence of the small shadows was kind of like that of a flock of pigeons they were not silent on that ghostworld level but they did not try to communicate unless with one another it took me only moments to shut them out the skies above were more troublesome each time i lifted my gaze i saw that some dramatic change had occurred sometimes there was an impenetrable overcast sometimes a wild starfield and a full moon once there were fewer stars and an extra moon once a distinct constellation hung right over the road south it conformed exactly to murgens description of a constellation called the noose hitherto i had always suspected the noose to have been a fabrication on mother gotas part then just beyond the golden pickax i spied a strapping trio of the uglies murgen had reported meeting in that very spot his first night on the glittering plain were they yakshas rakshasas i tried to shoehorn them into gunni or even kinas mythology but just could not make them fit there would be plenty of room though i did not doubt the gunni are more flexible in matters of doctrine than are we vehdna we are taught that intolerance is our gift of faith gunni flexibility is just one more reason they will all suffer the eternal fires the idolaters god is great god is merciful in forgiveness he is like the earth but he can become a tad meanspirited with unbelievers i tried desperately to recall murgens report of his encounter with these dream creatures nothing came forward despite the fact that i had been the one who had written it all down i could not for certain recall if his night visitors had been identical to these these were humanoid and humansize but definitely lacking human features possibly they wore masks in the guise of beasts judging from their frenetic gestures they wanted me to follow them somewhere i seemed to recall something similar having happened during murgens episode he had refused so did i although i did drift toward them and did attempt to engage them in conversation i did not of course have a knack for generating sound without a body or tools and they did not speak any language i knew so the whole business was an exercise in futility they became extremely frustrated they seemed to think that i was playing games they finally stamped away obviously possessed by a big anger murgen i dont know where you are but youre going to have to spend some time clueing me in here the ugly people were gone no skin off my nose now maybe i could get some sleep some real sleep without all these tooreal dreams and awful improbable skies it started to rain which told me which sky was the true sky and paramount above the me that lay twitching fitfully as the cold drops began to make themselves felt there was no way to get in out of it there was no way to erect tents or other shelters on the plain in fact the matter of weather had not arisen during our planning sessions i do not know why though it seems that there is always something big that you overlook something to which every planner on the team turns a blind eye then when the breakdown or failure comes you cannot figure out how you overlooked the obvious somehow we must have concluded that there was no weather on the plain maybe because murgens annals did not recall any but somebody should have noticed that the captured made this journey at a different time of year somebody should have realized that that was sure to have some impact somebody probably named me it had been cool already when the rain began to fall it grew chillier fast crabbily i got up and helped cover stuff to protect it helped get out means for recovering some of the water then confiscated a piece of tenting and another blanket rolled up and went back to sleep ignoring the rain it was only a persistent drizzle and when you are exhausted nothing but sleep matters much i found murgen waiting when i got home to dreamland you seem surprised i told you id see you on the plain you did but i dont need it to be right now right now i need to sleep you are youll wake up as refreshed as if you hadnt dreamed at all i dont want to be drifting around loose from my body either then dont i can control it you can just decide not to do it its pretty basic most people manage it instinctively ask around tomorrow see how many of these people even recall being loose from their flesh its something everybody does up here its something everybody can do if they want most dont want it so emphatically that they dont even recognize that the opportunity is there which doesnt matter its not why im here it matters a bunch to me that stuff is scary im just a simple lowclass city brat cancel the old whineandtoe shuffle sleepy youre wasting time i probably know as much about you as you know about yourself therere things you need to know im listening till now youve dealt with the plain well enough by letting the annals guide you stick with the rules youve already made and you wont have any trouble dont dawdle you didnt bring enough water even if you slaughter your animals as you go the way you planned theres ice here that you can melt but if you waste time getting here youll end up having to kill more animals than you want and take good care of them while theyre still alive dont let them get so thirsty they start charging around looking for water and go busting through your protection thatll heal itself but it does take time the shadows wont give you time then were safe from the break that killed sindawe and some of the others yes youll find bucket tomorrow i warn you now so youll have time to prepare yourself i was prepared already i had been prepared for a long time actually seeing bucket dead would be difficult but i would get past it tell me what i should do now that im here youre doing it just dont do it slowly should i split the group send a strike force forward that wouldnt be wise you wouldnt be able to manage whichever group you werent with and thatll be the one where somebody screws up and gets us all killed you too theres nobody else who can get me out if you fail there isnt even anyone else out there who knows that were alive the daughter of night and narayan singh know probably they had overheard enough to figure it out certainly which means soulcatcher does too now but you know i dont really see those people developing an interest in raising the dead not to mention that now the shadowgate can only be opened from this side this is the last cast of the dice sleepy and its for everything i did not remind murgen that narayan singh and his ward had a very strong interest in resurrecting someone who was practically his gravemate he was right about the shadowgate assuming there were no more keys outside how did i know you were going to say something like that he gave me the smile that probably won sahras heart i told him you should go see sahra i already have thats why i was so late getting around to you what can i say oh i saw those creatures the i did not know what they were called so i tried to describe them the washane the washene and the washone collectively referred to as the nef theyre dreamwalkers too too im a dreamwalker you can see me but only with your minds eye in some way that you remember me the nef are out here all the time they may be trapped or they may no longer have bodies to go back to ive never been able to tell they want to communicate so badly because they want something badly but dont seem capable of learning how theyre from one of the other worlds if they no longer have bodies they may even be skinwalkers so be very careful around them the duh what are you blathering about oh we havent talked about any of that yet have we any of what i really thought youd figure most of it out by reading between the lines the companies had to come from somewhere and it would be hard to scratch out a living on a tabletop of bare stone so they must have come from somewhere else somewhere very else since the plain isnt so big you cant walk around it and discover that theres nowhere for armies to come from the land just gets colder and more inhospitable im real thick boss you shouldve drawn me some pictures i wasnt keen on having anyone outside know i didnt want anybody getting scared to come get me youre my brother he ignored me i havent slept here so i have a lot of time on my hands ive used some of it exploring there are sixteen shadowgates sleepy and fifteen of them open onto places that arent our world or did at one time most of them are dead now and in my state i cant see what used to be on the other side without actually going out there and i dont have the eggs to do that because i like my own world just fine and i dont want to take a chance of getting trapped any farther away from it than i already am only four of the gates are still alive and the one to our world is so badly hurt that it probably wont last many generations more i was lost completely i was prepared for none of this and yet he was right when he hinted that there were bells i should have heard ringing what does all that have to do with kina it isnt in her legend anywhere in fact what does it even have to do with us its not in our legend anywhere yes it is sleepy the truth is just so old that time has totally distorted it examine gunni mythology theres a lot there about other planes other realms of reality different heavens and whatnot those stories go way back before the coming of the free companies a thousand years or more near as ive been able to find out when the first free company came off the plain almost six hundred years ago that event marked the first time our shadowgate had been used in at least eight centuries thats a lot of time for truth to mutate whoa whoa youre starting to imply things i cant quite get my mind around youd better open it up and spread it out wide sleepy because theres a whole lot more and i doubt ive discovered even a tenth of it i have a dark cynical untrusting side that at times even doubts the motives of my closest friends why is it that none of this ever got mentioned until now this isnt fresh news to you is it no it isnt but i told you i want out of here badly i chose not to pass on any information that might handicap you handicap me what the heck are you talking about kina and the captured arent the only things sleeping up here therere also a lot of truths that would shake the foundations of our world truths i have no trouble imagining wholesale slaughters and holy wars arising to suppress truths i have no trouble seeing getting my family and the company obliterated theyre so threatening im trying to open my mind but im having trouble i feel like im about to plunge into an abyss just hang on ive been out here forever and i still have trouble with it i think the way to start is i should outline the history of the plain yes why dont you do that that might be interesting you still have that edge on your tongue dont you maybe swan is right and what you really need is a good all right all right listen closely the plain was created so far back in antiquity that nobody on any of the worlds has any idea who built it how or why though you have to believe that it was meant to be a pathway between the worlds why the shadows and standing stones and i cant tell you anything if im not the one doing the talking sorry in the beginning there was the plain just the plain with its network of roads that have to be walked a certain way to get to other worlds for example every traveler has to enter the great circle at the center of the plain before he can leave the plain again back then there were no shadows no shadowgates no standing stones no great fortress inside the great circle no caverns beneath the stone no sleeping gods no captured no books of the dead there was nothing but the plain the crossroads of worlds or possibly of time one rogue school of thought insists the gates all open into the same world but at times which are separated by tens of thousands of years at some time still in unimaginable antiquity human nature asserted itself and wouldbe conquerers began to charge back and forth across the plain during a period of exhaustion the wise men of a dozen worlds combined to make the first modifications to the plain they built a fortress in the great circle and garrisoned it with a race of created immortal guardians whose task it would be to prevent armies from passing from world to world then we pass to the edge of protohistory the age now recalled poorly as it is distorted in gunni myth those driven to conquer will try to do so whatever the obstacles kina apparently started out as your runofthemill darklord type that arises every few centuries as ladys first husband was only she was another in a line and association of many such some of whom are now recalled as gods because of the impact they had on their times the whole cabal decided to beef kina up until she could overcome the demons on the plain in the process she did become what for want of a better descriptive we would have to call a god and she behaved every bit as badly as her associates should have expected with results more or less like those recalled in the mythology once kina was asleep her associates opened the maze of caverns under the plain and buried her way down deep somewhere then they created shivetya the steadfast guardian to keep watch or they conscripted a surviving demon of the same name and strengthened him and bound him to do the job if you prefer a less common version of the story then apparently too exhausted to recover their greatness they faded away so kina came out on top even if she ended up imprisoned why didnt they just kill her thats something ive never understood about these squabbles amongst the gods theres only one version of the kina myth where her enemies do anything but just tuck her in and in that one even after shes all chopped up and scattered around they leave the pieces alive and trying to get back together my guess would be she had some kind of deadman spell that entwined the fates of the other gods with her own those people wouldnt have trusted one another for a second all of them would have had some protective mechanism like longshadow used when he tied his fate into the wellbeing of the shadowgate but the shadowgate doesnt depend on his health anymore not as long as he stays inside i was just posing an example sleepy lets stick to the history of the plain what followed kinas downfall isnt documented at all but more conquerers came and went and further efforts were made to dissuade them while keeping the plain open for commerce the gates and keys were created one world gathered its sorcerers and had them steal the souls of millions of prisoners of war creating the shadows and endowing them with a bitter hatred of everything living they meant to close down the plain entirely which naturally led some other race to create the shields that protect the circles and roads nobody knows for sure how or when the standing stones began to appear but theyre the most recent addition to the plain probably put out by the precursors of the multipleworlds religious movement that produced the free companies i understand that the stones arent quarried theyre created things theyre immune to the shadows and indifferent to the protective shields but theyre attuned to the various keys carried away during the free companies age its too much to grasp itll take a long time to digest kina is real though absolutely buried right down here under me somewhere ive never been tempted to go look for her i wouldnt want to accidentally cut her loose i dont know how i could manage that but i definitely dont want to find out the hard way what about rhaydreynak and the books of the dead where do they fit rhaydreynaks war on the cult of kina antedated the appearance of the free companies by several centuries supposedly yet there were scary similarities suggesting shared origins the rise of the free companies is actually one of the least well known despite its being closest in time there were many companies over several hundred years they came from several different worlds and went off into several more representing almost as many different sects of kina worshippers most seem to have been sent out to explore not conquer or to serve as mercenaries or even to bring on the year of the skulls what their true mission seems to have been was to determine which world should be awarded the honor of being sacrificed in order to bring on the year of the skulls then a bunch of worlds decided to gang up on ours kina spanned many worlds her deviltry was almost universal apparently and we lost the toss and got to bury her in ours youre not in our world anymore sleepy thiss the inbetween where you are depends on what gate you walk out and these days you have only one choice its shadowgate lies straight ahead on the far side of the plain its as if the plain itself is closing down the alternate ways i dont get it why would it do that and how sometimes its seems like the plain itself is alive sleepy or at least that it can think is it where we came from is it where the captain spent most of his life trying to go no the company cant go back to khatovar croaker will never reach the promised land that shadowgate is dead the world where youre headed is very much like our own to other worlds its known by a name that translates into taglian somewhat vaguely as the land of unknown shadows without thinking i responded all evil dies there an endless death what startled yes how did you know they were the people who committed the murders that produced the shadows i heard it somewhere from a nyueng bao yes nyueng bao de duang in current nyueng bao usage that means something like the chosen children colloquially and nothing whatsoever thats sensible literally in the days when their forebears were sent out from the land of unknown shadows it meant roughly the children of the dead youve been busy i observed hardly considering how long ive been trapped here try it for a decade sleepy you wont have to put up with any of the distractions you complain about when you arent getting everything you want to do done no kidding seems to me im all of a sudden having to work even while im sleeping not for long whoever has control of that mistmaking thing is trying to get me to answer him why dont you sneak around there and smash that sucker so i dont have to get dragged into it every time somebody wants my view on how to crack a walnut or whatever else the crisis of the moment happens to be not hardly former boss im carrying a whole bag of nuts myself you would murgen departed as though yanked away i could have sworn i heard the laughter of an eavesdropping white crow how come youre so crabby willow swan demanded when i snapped at him for no good reason rag time again already i blushed me after twenty years among the crudest men on two hooves no jerk i didnt sleep very well last night what it exploded out of him like the shriek of a stomped rat i didnt sleep well last night oh yeah not our sweet little sleepy guys anybody ro river whoever you want to step up and remind us about the roar in the rain last night riverwalker told me boss your snoring made more noise than a tiger in heat we had people get up and move back up the road toward home to get away from the racket there were people wanted to strangle you or at least put your head in a sack i bet if anybody else knew what the hell we were doing and where we were going youd be on that travois with general sindawe but im such a sweet delicate flower i couldnt possibly snore i had been accused of the crime before but only jokingly never with such passion river snorted swan decided not to marry you im stricken ill see if oneeye doesnt have a cure a cure the man cant even take care of himself i scrounged up something to eat it was barely worth the effort and definitely not filling we would be on short rations for a long time before i finished what morning preparations were possible for me the forward elements were already moving the general mood was more relaxed we had survived the night and yesterday we had shoved it to the protector real good the relaxation ended when we found buckets remains big bucket real name cato dahlia once a thief once an officer of the black company was almost a father to me he never said and i never asked but i suspect he knew i was female all along he was very unpleasant to some of my male relatives way back when you did not want to be the object when bucket got angry i managed not to break down i had had a long time to get used to the idea that he was gone though there was always some small irrational hope that murgen was wrong that death had overlooked him and he was buried with the captured the men put bucket on the travois with sindawe without having to be told i tagged along and became entranced by one of those unaccountably irrelevant trains of thought that often take shape at such times we had left a truly nasty mess where we had spent the night particularly in the line of animal waste likely the captured had done the same during their passage along this same road however other than the odd corpse there was no sign that they had passed through there were no dung piles now no gnawed discarded bones no vegetable waste no ashes from charcoal braziers nothing only human bodies lasted and they became thoroughly desiccated i would have to take it up with murgen meantime it was a mental exercise that would keep me from dwelling upon bucket we trudged on southward the rain came and went never more than a drizzle though sometimes the wind brought it stinging in from a sharp angle i shivered a lot and worried about it getting cold enough to sleet or snow no other evil found us eventually i spied the vague silhouette of our initial destination that mysterious central fortress the wind began to blow steadily some of the men complained about the cold some complained about the wet quite a few complained about the menu and a handful insisted on complaining about all the complaining i sensed few positive feelings concerning what we were doing i felt very much alone almost abandoned the whole day long despite wellmeant efforts from swan sahra and quite a few others only uncle doj did not bother because even at this late date he remained piqued because i would not enlist as his apprentice he continued his emotional machinations several times i caught myself retreating into my away place and had to remind me that i did not need to go there now none of those people could hurt me anymore not if i did not let them i controlled their reality they survived only in my memory even that is immortality of a sort we vehdna believe in ghosts and we believe in evil i wondered if the gunni might not be onto something after all for them the pain inspired by the departure of loved ones is less personal and far more fatalistic and is accepted as a necessary stage of life that does not end with this one transformation if the gunni by some bizarre and remote practical joke of the divine happen to be in possession of a more accurate theology i must have been a bad bad girl in a previous life i sure hope i had fun forgive me o lord of the hours who art merciful and compassionate i have sinned in my heart thou art god there can be no other there were flakes of snow in the air whenever the wind took to loafing then each time it found renewed ambition it hurled tiny flecks of ice that stung my face and hands though it sounded fearful the level of grumbling never reached suggestions of mutiny willow swan trotted up and down the column gossiping and dropping reminders that we had nowhere to go but straight ahead the weather did not hamper him at all he seemed to find it invigorating he kept telling everyone how wonderful it would be once we got some real snow say four or five feet the world would look better then yes sir he guaranteed it he grew up in stuff like that and it made a real man out of you with equal frequency i overheard some advice the fulfillment of which was physically impossible for anyone not some select variety of worm as often the people cried out offering up impassioned pleas to oneeye goblin even tobo to fill swans mouth with quicksetting mortar are you having fun i asked him oh yeah and theyre not blaming you for anything either his boyish grin told me he was not being some kind of unwanted hero he was playing games with me too all northerners seemed to have that capacity for play even the captain and lady sometimes had shown signs with one another and oneeye and goblin the little black wizards stroke may have been a godsend i could not imagine those two missing an opportunity for screwing up as grand as this one was if they were both in excellent health when i suggested something of the sort to swan he failed to understand once i explained he observed youre missing the point sleepy unless theyre extremely drunk those two wont do anything dangerous to anybody but themselves im on the outside and i recognized that twenty years ago how could you miss it youre right and i do know that im just looking for things to go wrong i get gloomy when i try to prepare myself for the worst how come youre so cheerful right up ahead another day two maximum i get to say hi to my old buddies cordy and blade i looked at him askance could he be the only one of us more excited than frightened by the possibilities inherent in releasing the captured only one of those people had not spent the past fifteen years trapped inside his own mind and i was not convinced that murgen was not working overtime to maintain a false facade of sanity the others i did not doubt that quite a few would come forth stark raving mad nor did the rest nowhere was that fear more evident than in the radisha tadjik had remained almost invisible since she had rejoined us this side of the dandha presh though riverwalker and runmust stayed close she needed no watching and made few demands she stayed to herself cloaked in brooding the farther we moved from taglios the nearer we approached her brother the more withdrawn she became on the road after the grove of doom we had become almost sisterly but the pendulum had been swinging the other way ever since jaicur and we had not exchanged a hundred words a week this side of the mountains that did not please me i enjoyed her company conversation and slashing wit even master santaraksita had had no luck drawing her out lately though she had developed an affection for his scholarly drollery between them the pair could gut and flense a fools argument faster than a master butcher ever cleaned a chicken i mentioned the problem to willow swan ill bet its not her brother thats bothering her he wouldnt be the biggest thing anyway id guess shes down about not being able to go back ever since she realized were probably on a onewayer here shes been in a black depression uhm its rajadharma thats not just a handy propaganda slogan for her sleepy she takes being the ruler of taglios seriously you got her strolling on down here month after month seeing what the protector did in her name you have to understand that shes going to be upset about the way she let herself get used and then she has to face the fact that shell probably never get a chance to do anything about it shes not that hard to understand but he had been close to her for thirty years were going back oh sure and on the one chance in a zillion that we really do whos going to have an army waiting can you say soulcatcher sure and i can also say shell forget us in six months shell find a more interesting game to play and can you say water sleeps so can soulcatcher sleepy you dont know her nobody does except maybe lady a little but i got closer than most for a while not exactly by choice but there i was i tried to pay attention for what good it would do me she isnt entirely inhuman and she isnt as vain and heedless as she might want the world to think bottom line you need to keep one critical fact firmly in mind when youre thinking about soulcatcher and that is that shes still alive in a world where her deadliest enemy was the lady of the tower remembering that in her time lady made the shadowmasters look like unschooled bullies youre really wound today arent you just stating the facts heres one of your own right back water sleeps the woman who used to be the lady of the tower will be back on her feet in another few days youd better ask murgen if he thinks shell want to bother getting up ill bet you its not this cold where shes at the breeze on the plain had begun to gnaw both deeply and relentlessly i did not disagree even though he knew the truth he might not remember but he must have helped soulcatcher move the captured into the ice caverns where they lay imprisoned a murder of crows appeared from the north fighting the wind they had very little to say to one another they circled a few times then fought for altitude and rode the breeze toward mama they would not have much to report we began to find more bodies sometimes in twos and threes a fair number of the captured had not been caught at all i recalled murgens report that almost half the party made a break for the world after soulcatcher got loose here they were i did not remember most of them they were taglian or jaicuri rather than old crew mostly which meant they had enlisted while i was up north on murgens behalf we came upon suyen dinh duc buckets nyueng bao bodyguard ducs body had been prepared neatly for ceremonial farewells that bucket had paused in the midst of terror to honor one of the quietest and most unobtrusive of the nyueng bao companions spoke volumes about the character of my adopted father and that of duc bucket had refused to accept protection he did not want a bodyguard and suyen dinh duc had refused to go away he had felt called by a power far superior to buckets will i believe they became friends when nobody was looking i began to shed the tears that had not come when we had found bucket himself willow swan and suvrin tried to comfort me both were uneasy with the effort not quite knowing if hugging would be acceptable it sure would have been but i did not know how to let them know without saying it that would have embarrassed me too much sahra provided the comfort as the nyueng bao gathered to honor one of their own swan woofed the white crow had landed on his left shoulder and pecked at his ear it studied the dead man with one eye and the rest of us with the other uncle doj observed your friend was supremely confident that someone would come this way again annalist he left duc in the attitude called in respect of patient repose which we do when a proper funeral has to be delayed neither gods nor devils disturb the dead while they lie so disposed i sniffled water sleeps uncle bucket believed he knew wed come buckets belief had been stronger than mine mine barely survived the kiaulune wars without sahras relentless desire to resurrect murgen i would not have come through the times of despair i would not have become strong enough to endure when sahras own time of doubt came upon her now we were here with nowhere to go but forward i dried my eyes we dont have time to stand around talking our resources are painfully finite lets load him up doj interrupted we would prefer to leave him as he is where he is till we can send him off with the appropriate ceremonies and those would be what i havent seen many dead nyueng bao since the siege of jaicur you people do a good job of dancing around death but i have seen a few of your tribe dead and there wasnt any obviously necessary funeral ritual some got burned on the ghats as though they were gunni i saw one man buried in the ground as if he were vehdna ive even seen a corpse rubbed with bad smelling unguents then wrapped like a mummy and hung headdown from a high tree branch doj said each funeral would have been appropriate to the person and situation im sure whats done with the flesh isnt critical the ceremonies are intended to ease the souls transition to its new state theyre absolutely essential if theyre not observed the dead mans spirit may be compelled to wander the earth indefinitely as ghosts or dreamwalkers doj seemed startled uh ghosts a restless spirit that wants to finish tasks interrupted by death they cant so they just keep going although vehdna ghosts are wicked spirits cursed to wander by god himself i had no trouble following dojs notion then well leave him here you want to stand beside him to make sure he stays safe from traffic bucket had placed duc at the edge of the road so he would not be disturbed by the terrified fugitives back then how did he die swan asked then he squawked the white crow had nipped his ear again everybody turned to stare at swan what do you mean i asked look if a shadow got duc and somebody tried to lay him out proper that layerouter would be here dead as a wedge too right so he mustve died some other way before a dim lamp seemed to come alive inside his head catcher did it the crow said it was crow caw but the words were clear haw haw catcher did it the nyueng bao began to press in on swan catcher did it i reminded them probably with a boobytrap spell by the time duc reached this point she wouldve been ten miles ahead of anybody on foot she was mounted remember from what i remember about duc he probably saw the trap as bucket tripped it and jumped in the way gota pointed out the protector could not have left a booby trap to kill duc if she had not been released her taglian was the best i had ever heard it the anger in her eyes said she wanted no mistake to be made sahra whispered suyen dinh duc was a second cousin to my father i said weve been through this before people we cant exonerate willow swan but we can forgive him if we recall the circumstances he faced do any of you really think you can get the best of the protector facetoface no hands but some of you think so in your heart few nyueng bao lacked for arrogant selfconfidence heres your challenge run back and prove it the shadowgate will let you out soulcatcher is on foot shes crippled you can catch up fast can you ask for any more i paused what no takers then lay off swan the white crow cawed mockingly i saw a few thoughtful sheepish faces but gotas was not one of them gota had never been wrong in her life except that one time when she had thought she might be wrong swan let it roll off as he had done for years he had learned from the strictest instructress he did suggest you said we need to keep rolling sleepy although i guess we meateaters can start on the vegetarians after their stories run out carry the key tobo thank you sahra sahra turned away mother stay with tobo dont let him walk any faster than you do ky gota grumbled something under her breath and turned away from us she followed tobo her rolling waddle could be deceptive when she was in a hurry she overhauled the boy grabbed hold of his shirt off they went the old womans mouth going steadily no gambler by nature still i would have bet that she was fuming about what foul mortals the rest of us be i observed ky gota appears to have found herself not one of the nyueng bao found any reason to celebrate that eventuation a mile later we came across the only animal remains that we would ever find from the earlier expedition they were piled in a heap bones and shredded dry flesh so intertangled there was no telling how many beasts there had been or why they had gathered together in life or in death the whole grim mess appeared to have been subsiding into the surface of the plain slowly given another decade it would be gone the ugly dreamwalkers returned after dark they were more energetic in their efforts tonight the rain returned too it was more energetic and was accompanied by thunder and lightning that made sleeping difficult as did the cold rainwater all of which seemed determined to collect inside the circle where we were camped the stone did not appear to slope but water sure behaved as though it did the animals drank their fill likewise the human members of the band runmust and riverwalker directed everyone to fill waterbags and top off canteens and as soon as someone raised his voice to bless our good fortune the first snowflakes began to fall what sleep i did manage was not pleasant a fullblown tumult was underway in the ghostworld and it spilled over into my dreams then iqbals daughter decided this would be a wonderful time to cry all night which got the dog started howling or maybe that happened the other way around shadows swarmed over the face of our protection they were more interested in us than they had been in the interlopers of murgens time he told me so himself the shadows remembered ages past i was able to eavesdrop on their dreams on their nightmares all they remembered were horrors from a time when men resembling nyueng bao tortured them to death in wholesale lots while sorcerers great and small spanked the demented souls until when they were released eventually they were so filled with hatred of every living thing that even a creature as slight as a roach was subject to instant attack with great ferocity some shadows already evilly predatory by nature became so wicked they even attacked and devoured other shadows there had been millions so victimized and the only virtue in their creators was that they manufactured the horrors from invaders who arrived in countless waves from a world where an insane sorcerer king had elevated himself to near godhood then had set out to take full mastery of all the sixteen worlds uncounted tens of thousands of corpses littered the glittering plain before the shadows stemmed that tide scores of the monsters escaped into neighboring worlds they spread terror and havoc until the gates could be modified to prevent their passage for centuries no traffic crossed the plain then came another age of halfhearted commerce once some genius devised the protection now shielding the roads and circles the shadows saw everything they remembered everything they saw and remembered the missionaries of kina who had fled my own world at the pinnacle of rhaydreynaks fury in every world they reached the goddesss dark song fell upon a few eager ears even amongst the children of those who had created the shadows commerce on a plain so constrained and dangerous perforce remained light it took determined people to hazard the crossing traffic peaked when the world we recalled as khatovar launched a flurry of expeditions to other worlds to determine which would be best suited to host the cosmic ceremony called the year of the skulls followers of kina from other worlds joined that quest companies marched and countermarched they argued and squabbled they accomplished very little eventually a consensus took shape the sacrifice ought to be the world that had treated the children of kina so abominably in the first place rhaydreynaks descendants should reap what he had sown the companies sent out were not swarms of fanatics the plain was dangerous few men wanted to cross it most of the soldiers were conscripts or minor criminals under the rule of a few dedicated priests they were not expected to return it became the custom for the conscripts families to hold a wake for their bone warriors or stone soldiers before they departed even though the priests always promised they would be back in a matter of months the few who did return usually came back so drained and changed so bitter and hard they came to be known as soldiers of darkness kinas religion was never popular anywhere it took root always a minority cult it lost what power it did have as generations passed and the early fervor faded into the inevitable tedious rule of functionaries one world after another abandoned kina and turned away from the plain dark ages took shape everywhere one gate after another failed and was not restored those that did not fail fell into disuse the worlds were old worn tired desperately in need of renewal the ancestors of the nyueng bao may have been the last large party to travel from one world to another they seemed to have been kina worshippers fleeing persecution at a time when the rest of their people had become insanely xenophobic and determined to expunge all alien influences the ancestors of the nyueng bao the children of the dead had vowed to return to their land of unknown shadows in blazing triumph but of course because they were safe on the far side of the plain their descendants soon forgot who and what they were only a handful of priests remembered not entirely correctly a voice that did not speak aloud tickled my consciousness sister sister it said i saw nothing felt only that featherweight touch but it was enough to spin my soul sideways and toss it into another place where when i caught my spiritual breath the stench of decay filled my nostrils a sea of bones surrounded me unknown tides stirred its surface there was something wrong with my eyes my vision was warped and doubled i raised a hand to rub them and saw white feathers no impossible i could not be following murgens path i could not be losing my moorings in time i would not stand for it i willed myself caw not from my beak a black shape popped into sight in front of me wings spread slowing talons reached toward me i spun hurled myself off the dead branch where i had been perched and was sorry instantly i found myself just yards from a face five feet tall it boasted more fangs than a shark does teeth it was darker than midnight the odor of its breath was the stench of decaying flesh the triumphant grin on those wicked ebony lips faded as i evaded the swat of a gigantic clawed hand i sleepy was in a trouserssoiling panic but something else was inside the bird with me and it was having fun sister sister that was close the bitch is getting sneakier but she will never surprise me she cannot nor will she understand that she cannot who is me the exercise was over i was in my body on the plain in the rain shuddering while my minds eye observed the capering dreamwalkers i examined what i had experienced and concluded that i had been given a message which was that kina knew we were coming the dreaming goddess had been pretending quiescence of recent decades she knew patience intimately by all its secret names and i may have been given another message as well kina still was the mother of deceit quite possibly nothing i had learned recently was entirely or even partially true if kina had found a way to wander the shadowed reaches of my mind i had no doubt that she could she had managed to inform entire generations and regions with a hysterical fear of the black company before the advent of the old crew i swear i sensed her amusement over having quickened in me a deeper and more abiding distrust of everything around me suvrin wakened me early he sounded glum i could not see his face in the darkness trouble sleepy he whispered and i have to give him credit he was first to realize the implications of the fact that it was snowing but then he had seen more of the white stuff than any of us but swan and willow had been away from it long enough to turn into an old man i wanted to moan and groan but that would have done no good and we needed to get a handle on the situation right away good thinking i told him thanks go around in that direction and wake up the sergeants ill circle around to the left despite my nightmares i felt rested the snowfall in no way recognized the presence of the protection shielding our campsite which meant the boundaries were no longer obvious i sensed a heightened killing lust amongst the shadows they had seen this before it would be snack time if anyone started running around nervously we had oneeye and goblin on our side tobo too they could winkle out the whereabouts of the boundaries but they needed a little light to do the job one by one i made sure everyone wakened and understood the gravity of the situation especially the mothers i made sure everyone understood that no one should move around until daylight wonder of wonders nobody did anything stupid once there was light enough the wizards started drawing lines in the snow i arranged for teams to enforce the boundaries everything went so well i was feeling smug before it turned time to go then i discovered that it was going to be a long day which of course i should have known instinctively this next leg of the journey had taken the captured only a few hours it would take us far longer the shattered fortress could not be discerned behind the falling snow the old old men would have to mark out every step before it could be taken walking to either side of tobo and the key keeping him centered on the road but never getting ahead of him just in case a quarter mile along i was worrying about time already we had too many mouths and too few supplies harsh rationing was in place these people had to be gotten across the plain fast excepting those of us who would bring out the captured thiss getting out of hand goblin yelled if it gets any heavier were up shit creek he was right if this snowfall turned into a blizzard we were going to have no other worries if it worsened much we were going to die out here and make soulcatcher the happiest girl in the world she probably was anyway now that she had had time to reflect on the fact that there was no one left able to dispute her in any whim she cared to indulge water sleeps so what those days were over not while i was still standing they were not swan joined me for breakfast hows my wife this morning frigid darn open mouth insert boot with manure veneer swan grinned ive known that for years isnt this something theres more than an inch already its something all right unfortunately i dont encourage myself to use the kind of language needed to describe it most of these people have never seen snow watch out for somebody to do something stupid in fact you might stick close to the radisha i dont want her getting hurt because somebody doesnt use his head all right did you dream last night of course i did i got to meet kina right up close too i saw lights on the road to the east of us that got my attention really in my dream they were just witchlights maybe the plains own memories or something there wasnt anything there when i went to look getting bold in your old age are you it just sort of happened i wouldnt have done it if id thought about it did i snore again last night you solidified your grasp on the alltime womens championship youre ready to compete at the next level must have something to do with the dreaming sahra drifted up she looked grim she did not like what was happening even a little the snow or the way we had to cope with it but she bit her tongue she understood that it was now too late to be a fussy mom like it or not her boy was carrying us all right now oneeye limped along using a staff somebody had made for him from one of the smaller bamboo weapons i did not know if it was still armed very likely so he being oneeye he told me im not going to last at this little girl but ill go as long as i can show tobo what to do and let him take over as soon as hes got it let gota carry the pickax and you get up on the horse advise from there the old man just nodded instead of finding some reason to argue betraying his true weakness goblin scowled at me though assuming he was going to get a large ration of unsolicited counsel but he shrugged off the temptation to debate tobo hold up you really understand what we have to do today ive got it sleepy then give your grandmother the key where is that horse buddy of mine get up here you carry oneeye i noted that the white crow had left the beasts back in fact the bird was nowhere to be seen up you go old man who you calling old little girl oneeye drew himself up as tall as he got you so old youve gotten shorter than me get your tail up there i really want to get there today i offered goblin a hard look just in case he got a notion to try poking sticks in the spokes he just looked back blankly or maybe blandly spoiled brat me i got my way the ruined fortress loomed out of weakly falling snow around what felt like noon once tobo got the hang of discovering the boundaries well enough to keep up with goblin the band began moving at a pace limited only by mother gotas capacities and she seemed taken by a sudden urge to hasten toward whatever destiny awaited whoever arrived with the key my natural pessimism went almost entirely unrewarded had iqbals boys not discovered the wonders of snowballs i would have had nothing to complain about at all even then i would have been entertained had not a few wild volleys of missiles not strayed my way we arrived at the chasm murgen had mentioned a tear in the face of the plain rent by powers almost unimaginable the earthquake responsible had been felt as far away as taglios it had flattened whole cities this side of the dandha presh i wondered if it had wrought as much destruction in the other worlds connected to the plain i also wondered if the quake had been natural in origin had it been caused by some premature effort of kinas to rise and shine swan willow swan get up here mother gota had halted at the lip of the chasm simply because there was no way for her to go forward the rest of the mob crowded up behind the leaders because naturally everyone wanted to see i snapped make a hole people make a hole let the man get up here i stared at the wrecked fortress shattered was too strong a description but its state of disrepair went way beyond neglect too i supposed if the original golem garrison were still around it would be in perfect condition and right now the whole crew would be outside dusting off the snow patches attached to every little roughness of the stone swan grumbled you need to make up your mind darling you want me to look out for the radisha or never mind i dont have time im cold and im cranky and i want to change that look at this crack is this the way it was before because even though its pretty impressive its nowhere as huge as murgen made me think it would be everybody but iqbals baby can skip across this swan studied the gap in the plain immediately evident to any eye was the fact that there were no sharp edges the stone seemed to have softened and oozed like taffy no it wasnt like this at all it looks like its been healing its not a quarter as wide as it was i bet in another generation there wont even be a scar so the plain can heal itself but not so things that were added later i indicated the fortress except for the spells protecting the roads apparently start moving across swan stick with tobo and gota nobody else has any idea where to go from here there you are i answered an impatient caw from above if i kind of squinted and looked sideways i could make out the white crow perphed on the battlements looking down still muttering to himself though somewhat good naturedly swan stepped across the crack slipped fell skidded got up exercising a string of outofshape northern expletives everyone else laughed i summoned runmust and riverwalker i want you two to figure out how to get the animals and carts across draft suvrin if you want he claims hes had some minor experience in practical engineering and keep reminding everyone that if they remain calm and cooperative well all get to sleep in a warm dry place tonight well maybe dry warm was probably too much to expect uncle doj and tobo helped mother gota across sahra followed several other nyueng bao followed her that made an awful lot of nyueng bao concentrated in one place suddenly my paranoia began to quiver and narrow its eyes suspiciously i said goblin oneeye come along slink where are you come with us slink i could count on to be quick and deadly and as morally reluctant as a spear when i pointed and said kill uncle doj did not fail to note the fact that even now i trusted him only incompletely he seemed both irked and amused he told me there isnt anything for our people here annalist this is all for tobos benefit thats good thats good i wouldnt want the future of the company to be placed in the slightest risk doj frowned disappointed by my sarcasm i have not won your heart yet stone soldier how could you you keep calling me names and wont even explain all will become clear i fear of course once we reach the land of unknown shadows right youd better hope there arent any halftruths or outright coverups in your doctrine all evil dies there an endless death it could still be true doj responded with a baleful look but it seemed neither angry nor calculating i said swan show us the way i think thiss as far as i can take you swan told me he spoke slowly as though having trouble sorting out his thoughts i dont get it stuff keeps going away i know i was farther inside than this i know all the things we did but when i try to remember anything specific i lose everything between the time i got to this point until sometime during the gallop back stuff comes to me all the time when im not trying i do remember that maybe catcher messed up my brain somehow theres an alltime understatement goblin muttered swan ignored goblin he complained we were actually off the plain before i realized that we were the only ones who would be coming out i was not sure i believed that but it did not matter now i grunted suggested how about you make a guess maybe your soul will remember what your brain cant first you need to get some light in here what do i have wizards for i asked the gloom certainly not anything useful or practical like providing a light they wouldnt need one they can see in the dark goblin muttered something unflattering about the sort of woman who indulges in sarcasm he told swan sit down and let me look at your head let me tobo enthused at the same time let me try to make a light i can do this one he did not wait for permission filaments of lemon and silver light crawled over his upraised hands swift and eager the darkness surrounding us retreated i thought reluctantly wow i said look at him he has the strength and enthusiasm of youth oneeye conceded i glanced back he was still astride the black stallion wearing a smug look but obviously exhausted the white crow was perched in front of him it studied tobo with one eye while considering our surroundings with the other it seemed amused then oneeye began to chuckle tobo squealed in surprise wait stop goblin whats happening the worms of light were snaking up his arms they would not respond to his insistence that they desist he started slapping himself oneeye and goblin began to laugh meantime the two of them had done something to swan to clarify his mind the man looked like he had just sucked down a tall frosty mug of selfconfident recollection sahra saw nothing funny in tobos situation she screamed at the wizards to do something she was almost incoherent which betrayed how much stress she inflicted upon herself doj told her he isnt in any danger sahra he just let himself get distracted it happens its part of learning or words to that effect several times before sahra calmed down and began to look defiant and sheepish at the same time goblin told tobo ill take it till you get your concentration back and in a moment there was light enough to see the walls of the huge chamber someone who is skilled at something always makes it look easy the little bald wizard was no exception he told oneeye help swan keep his head clear i thought the place looked like a nice change from sleeping out in the weather i wished there was fuel we could burn to heat it whither now i asked swan for some time i had been silently regretting not having caught murgen while i was dreaming so i could have gotten reliable directions the white crow squawked and launched itself leaving oneeye cursing because it had swatted him in the face with its wings i was starting to understand the beast somebody see where it goes one of you sorcerer geniuses want to send a light with it tobo had received control of his light again and had it working in good form but it took all his attention to manage it i hoped he outgrew this moreconfidencethansense stage before he took a really big bite of disaster uncle doj trailed the crow at a dignified pace i supposed i ought to contribute something more than executive decisions so i followed him a ball of leprous green light from behind overtook me and made a nest in my tangled hair my scalp began to itch i had a suspicion oneeye might be sneering at my personal hygiene which i confess sometimes became the victim of a negligent attitude sort of thisll teach me to take my darn helmet off i grumbled i refused to allow him to flash me his smug toothless grin by not looking back i had not been wearing an actual helmet god save me that would have been cold i had been wearing a leather helmet liner which had kept my ears from getting frostbitten barely winter it was one of those things the planning team had not foreseen i hurried past doj who was startled when he saw my hair then he grinned as big as ever i had seen him do i tossed him a bloodthirsty scowl unfortunately to do so i had to turn around far enough to see oneeye and goblin suddenly stop exchanging handslaps and snickers even sahra turned slightly sideways to conceal her amusement all right so suddenly i am the clown princess of the company eh we would see those two would i realized that they had lured me into accepting their system of thought before long i would be setting traps so i could get even first the crow cawed it was down on the cold stone floor it danced back and forth suddenly impatient its talons clicked softly i dropped to my knees it let me get almost within touching distance before it flopped farther into the darkness more light took life behind us as people and animals came inside making the predictable racket every new arrival had to know what was going on the crow became a silhouette if i lowered my head and looked at it with my cheek against the floor i told doj theres light coming from somewhere this must be where the captured got into the inner fortress i got down on my belly there was a definite gap in a wall of stone so dark it seemed unseeable even in the available light i could not make out anything on the other side doj got down and placed his own cheek on the floor indeed i called we need some more light over here and maybe some tools river runmust have those people start setting up some kind of camp and see what you can do about shutting out the cold that would be difficult there were several large gaps in the outside wall goblin and oneeye stopped grinning like fools and came forward dressed in their business faces they kept tobo right there with them determined to teach him their trade quickly handson with more light it was easier to see what the bird meant me to see which had to be the crack soulcatcher had sealed after working her wicked spells on the captured there any spells or booby traps here i asked the little girls a genius oneeye grumbled his speech had grown a little slurred he needed rest badly the bird strutted through and didnt go up in smoke right that suggest anything no spells goblin said dont mind him hes just cranky because him and gota havent had no privacy for a week im gonna fit you out for all the privacy youll need for a couple of eons runt man im gonna plant your wrinkled old ass enough lets see if we can make the hole any bigger the crow made impatient noises on the other side it had to have some connection with the captured even if it was not murgen operating from some lost corner of time certainly i hoped it was not murgen from the future that would imply a less than successful effort on our part now i grumbled and snarled i stamped back and forth while half a dozen men expanded the hole every one of them grousing about the shortage of light i did not contribute much as a human candle either maybe the thing in my hair was goblin and oneeye offering commentary on how bright i was though i doubted that after only two hundred years they could yet have developed that much cleverness and subtlety a larger and larger crowd piled up behind me river i growled i said you should have these people do something useful tobo get back from there you want a boulder to fall on your head a voice behind me suggested you ought to get more light on it so you can see if you need to do any shoring i turned slink there were miners in my family then youre as near an expert as weve got oneeye jabbed a thumb at goblin the dwarf here has sapper experience he helped undermine the walls at tember his face split in an ugly grin goblin squeaked a definite clue that tember was an episode he did not recall fondly i did not remember any mention of a tember in the annals reason suggested that the referenced event must have taken place long before croaker became annalist which he had done at an early age two of croakers more immediate predecessors miller ladora and kanwas scar had been so lax in their duties that little is known about their time other than what their successors have reconstructed from oral tradition and the memories of survivors it was during that era that croaker otto and hagop joined the band croaker says little about those days himself am i to take it then that i shouldnt invest unlimited faith in goblins engineering skills oneeye cawed like a crow as an engineer our bitty buddy makes a wonderful lumberjack things fall down wherever he goes goblin growled like a mastiff issuing a warning see this here skinny little baldegg genius sold the old man the notion of sneaking into this burg tember by tunneling under its walls deep down because the earth was soft itd be easy oneeye snorted as he talked his laughter barely under control and he was right it was easy when his tunnel caved in the wall fell down and the rest of us charged through the gap and sorted them temberinos out goblin grumbled and about five days later somebody remembered the miners somebody was just plain damned lucky he had a friend as good as me to dig him out the old man just wanted to put up a gravestone goblin growled some more not so and the real truth is the tunnel never wouldve collapsed if this twolegged overripe dog turd hadnt been playing one of his stupid games you know i almost forgot i never did pay you back for that you shouldve never brought it up you human prune damn you almost went and died on me before i got you paid off i knew you were up to no good you had that stroke on purpose didnt you of course i did you nitwit every chance i get i try to die just sos you cant backstab me no more you want to be that way i saved your ass and you want to be that way aint no fool like an old fool bring it on you hairless little toady frog i maybe slowed down a step the last couple years but im still three steps faster and ten torches brighter than any lilywhite boys i snapped children we have work to do here they must have driven the whole company crazy when they were young and had the energy to keep it up all the time as of this moment all the slates are clean of anything that happened before i was born just open me a hole so i can go see what we have to do next the two wizards did not stop growling and muttering and threatening and trying to sabotage one another in small ways but they did lend their claimed expertise to the effort to open the gap once the opening had been expanded enough to use there was a brief debate about who would use it first the accord was universal not me but when i squatted down to duckwalk forward into the shadows in hopes i could get a look at what might eat me a few seconds before its jaws snapped shut several gentlemen turned all noble and chivalrous i suspect it was significant that two of them swan and suvrin were not company brothers goblin grumbled all right all right now youre making us look bad all of you get out of the way he bustled forward he did not have to duck i did just slightly as i followed him through i did not need anyone to be noble or chivalrous or to go in before me there is no god but god i muttered his works are vast and mysterious i was five steps inside and had just bumped into goblin who had stopped to stare as well i presume thats the golem demon shivetya or his ugly little brother murgen had not kept me posted on the golems state at last report it had been just a single earth tremor short of plunging into a bottomless abyss still nailed to a huge wooden throne by means of a number of silver daggers i observed it appears the plain has been healing itself in here too i eased forward there was still a vertiginous abyss i had to close my eyes momentarily while i regained my equilibrium shivetya remained poised over it but the gap clearly was narrower than murgen had described in closing the surface had pushed the wooden throne upward somewhat shivetya was no longer in momentary peril of falling it looked like a few decades would see him lying there with his nose pressed into healed stone the overturned throne on top of him still willow swan invited himself to join me he said that thing hasnt moved since last time i countered thought you couldnt remember anything whatever the short farts did it seems to be working i recognize things when i see them goblin told swan considering what could still happen if shivetya starts jumping around holding still seems like a pretty good idea dont you think could you hold still for fifteen years i said hes held still a lot longer than that swan hes been nailed to that throne for hundreds of years or even thousands he has to have been nailed down since before deceivers fleeing rhaydreynak came here on their way to other worlds and hid the books of the dead that observation got me some looks particularly from master santaraksita i had not yet shared the tales i had gleaned from murgen else he wouldve stomped them good at the time they wouldve looked like the kind of thing he was put here to guard against i think who nailed him down goblin asked i dont know might be a handy piece of information youd want to keep an eye on a guy who could do that kind of thing i would swan agreed he grinned nervously its listening i said i moved along the edge of the abyss several steps squatted from there i could see the demons eyes they were open a crack i could also see that there were three of them instead of two the third being in the center of the forehead above and between the other two this point had not come up before though it was the sort of thing you would expect of a gunnistyle demon the oversight became selfexplanatory as soon as the demon sensed my scrutiny the third eye closed and vanished i asked swan that throne look like its solidly wedged yeah why just wondering if we could move it without losing it down that crack im no engineer but it looks to me like youd really have to work at it to dump it down there now obviously it could go one really stupid move its a hell of a deep hole but the curious kept piling up behind us their chatter was becoming annoying every single whisper turned into a gaggle of echoes that made the place seem more haunted than it was everybody be quiet i cant hear myself think i must have sounded nastier than i intended people shut up and gawked i asked does anyone see a way to get that thing turned right side up and pushed back away from the gap how come youd want to do that oneeye asked quit shoving junior suvrin asked using equipment we have on hand yes and it would have to get done today i want the majority of these people back on the road south at first light tomorrow that means using brute force right now some of us would have to get on the other side of the fissure and lift the top of the throne enough so people and animals on this side could get the leverage to pull it on up using ropes swan said you try to stand it up the way it is there the bottom end will just slide off the edge then its a grand ride off to the entrails of the earth how come youd want to do that oneeye demanded again i ignored him again i concentrated on the argument spreading outward from suvrin and swan i let it run for several minutes then i announced suvrin seems to be the only one here with a positive view so hes in charge suvrin draft anybody you want help yourself to any resources you need sit shivetya back up for me you hear that steadfast guardian gentlemen if you have any ideas feel free to share them with mr suvrin suvrin said i cant dont shouldnt guess the first thing wed better do is get a solid idea of how much weight were dealing with and well have to rig up some way to get across the gap mr swan you handle that young mr tobo i understand youre skilled at mathematics suppose you help me calculate how much mass were dealing with here tobo grinned and headed for the throne not at all intimidated by the demon one adjustment i said i need swan with me hes been here before runmust you and iqbal figure out how to get across willow come with me out of earshot of the others swan asked whats going on i didnt want to remind anybody that the company got this far once before somebody might recall a grudge against the man who made it impossible for our predecessors to go any farther oh thanks i guess he glanced at the clot of nyueng bao mother gota continued to nurture her grudge she had a son somewhere down under this stone i may just have a strange perspective i do believe all of us should accept responsibility for our actions but im not sure we ever understand why we do some things do you know why you cut soulcatcher loose id bet youve spent the odd minute here and there trying to figure that out youd win except itd be more like the odd year here and there and i still cant explain it she did something to me somehow just with her eyes all the way across the plain probably manipulating my feelings about her sister when the time came it seemed like the right thing to do i never had a doubt until it was all over and we were on the run and she kept her word he understood she gave me everything her eyes promised everything i could never have from the sister i really wanted whatever her failings soulcatcher keeps her word sometimes we get what we want and find out that it wasnt what we needed no shit story of my life sleepy around fifty people came onto the plain two of you got away thirteen died on the road trying the rest are still out here somewhere and you helped put them where they are so im going to need you to show me are you still blind in the memory or have you started to remember oh those spells took its coming back but not necessarily organized the same way that it happened so bear with me when i seem a little confused i understand i kept an eye on the others as we talked sahra seemed to be putting herself under a lot of unnecessary stress doj looked ferociously ready to seize the day should an opportunity pop up gota was nagging oneeye about something while keeping one grim eye aimed swans way goblin was trying to get the mist projector set up amidst a jostling crowd i noted there seems to be more light than murgen reported tons more and its warmer too if i was allowed a guess mine would be that it has something to do with the healing thats going on i did feel overdressed for the indoor weather it was not hot but it was warmer than the plain outside and there was no wind biting where are the captured there was a stairway over there we must have gone a mile down into the earth you carried thirtyfive unconscious people down there and got back in time to get away from the evening shadows without killing yourself catcher did most of it she has a spell that makes things float through the air we roped the people together and pulled them along like a string of sausages she did the pulling actually i stayed on the uphill end more or less at first because the stair has some twists and turns we had trouble getting them around the corners but a lot less trouble than if wed carried them one at a time i nodded i knew of other instances when catcher had used the same sorcery seemed like a handy one to have we could use it right here right now to hoist my future buddy shivetya curious once upon a time murgen said that name meant deathless although more recently i had been given the meaning steadfast guardian but i had been provided with whole new sets of creation myths and whatnot too i fought off an urge to charge off and plunge down the stairway right then i hustled back to talk it over with the others most of the crowd were preoccupied with an effort to get shivetyas throne turned right side up by the power of talking about it suvrin told me its a way to keep warm and a way to work off some tension no doubt i heard plenty of traditionalstyle grumbling questioning the intelligence of any leader who wanted to play around with something like that great ugly thing over there on that throne i gathered everyone interested swan knows the way down to the caverns his memory is getting better all the time goblin and oneeye preened i gave them no chance to congratulate themselves publicly im going down there to scout i want the rest of you to get camp set up i want you to work out specifically how well divide up tomorrow so the majority can scoot on across the plain to safety we had discussed this time and again how we could break up the party leaving the minimum number of people with the maximum stores to bring out the captured while the rest moved on to it was hoped a more congenial clime dojs position so perfectly rational was that we should ignore the captured until we had crossed the plain had gotten ourselves established in the land of unknown shadows and were capable of mounting a more thoroughly prepared and supplied expedition but none of us knew what we would face at that end of this passage and way too many of us were emotionally incapable of walking away from our brothers again now that we were this close i should have gotten more information out of murgen while we still had some flexibility time was winnowing our options rapidly sahras response to uncles repeating his suggestion was blistering enough to melt lead she might be reluctant to have her husband back but she was not going to delay any crisis swan leaned over my shoulder and whispered if you hang around here waiting for all these people to agree on something were going to get very old and very hungry before anything happens the man had a point a definite point i got my daily constitutional in before we reached the stairway i began to appreciate just how vast the hall at the heart of that fortress was my party dwindled into the distance i observed this thing has got to be a mile across almost exactly its a few yards under according to soulcatcher i dont know why i wish we had a torch i saw patterns in the flooring last time i was here when there wasnt quite so much dust but she wouldnt let me waste time looking at them there was a lot of dust there had been none outside the plain tolerated nothing alien except the corpses of invaders evidently even here we had yet to discover any sign of the animals or equipment that had accompanied the captured south how much farther almost there watch for a dropoff a dropoff a step down its only about eighteen inches but you could break a leg if it surprises you i turned an ankle last time we found the dropoff i stopped to look back once i stepped down all sorts of genius was being invested in the assignments i had given closer sahra and the radisha and several others to whom i had not given specific assignments had decided to follow me i said youre right it does look like therere some kind of inlays if we have time maybe we can take a closer look i considered the edge of the stone this curves and its polished that part of the floor is a circle and its almost exactly oneeightieth of the diameter of the plain according to soulcatcher the raised part where the demons throne used to sit is oneeightieth the size of this thats probably got to mean something it have anything to do with the captured not that im aware of then well worry about it later the stairs start over here they did indeed right next to the wall the crack in the floor had extended clear through that the walls partial collapse had filled the gap there then the material from the wall had been pushed back up as the fissure healed itself the stairs simply started there was a rectangular hole in the floor steps went down roughly paralleling the outer wall away from the crack in the floor which had healed almost completely there was no handrail twenty steps down we reached a landing eight feet by eight the descending steps led off from our right this flight appeared to go downward forever faint light crept up it just strong enough so you could see where to put your feet sahra and the radisha had caught up close enough that i could hear them talking without being able to pick up specific words both women sounded frightened by the immediate future i could sympathize i was nervous about achieving my lifes ambition myself just a little you want to go first swan asked he lacked considerable enthusiasm i thought are there booby traps or something no she probably wanted to just in case somebody passed this way someday just for the sheer mean fun of it but there wasnt enough time she piddled around so much for so long i didnt really believe wed ever get away im sure we wouldnt have if she hadnt been who she was she spun spells that chased the shadows away shed been in there before and shed practiced there it is what nothing just remembering something stupid me all those years i wondered how swan and soulcatcher had found time to bury the captured without getting gobbled up by shadows and i had overlooked the obvious the fact that soulcatcher was a major sorceress and already had some experience manipulating shadows you can be screamingly blind to the obvious if you dont realize that you have not opened up all the doors of your mind forgive me o lord of the hours be merciful be compassionate i shall close the borders of my soul as soon as my brothers are free at this point swan had no incentive to steer me into danger i started downstairs the architects engineers and stonemasons responsible had not been determined to achieve geometric perfection though this portion of the stairwell continued downward in a specific general direction it tended to meander from side to side of a straight line nor were the steps of a uniform height the builders had been thoughtful enough to provide landings every little way though i had a feeling those would seem to be miles apart once i started climbing up again if we have to bring oneeye down here were going to have to carry him back up he wont survive the climb otherwise you might want to organize what youre going to do before we go down there then i cant decide what has to be done until i see what im dealing with you might call up your genie in a bottle get him to tell you hes never said much about the place where hes at not since hes been in there himself its like hes constrained against that i dreamed about it a few times but i dont know how accurate my dreams were swan groaned i really didnt want to make this trek will it be that bad not going down but heading the other way is likely to change your attitude i dont know im beginning to get a little winded just going in this direction then slow down a few minutes isnt going to make a difference not after all these years he was right and wrong there was no rush for the captured but for us with our limited resources time was destined to become critical swan continued you need to slow down sleepy really its going to get a little bit hairy in a minute he was absolutely right but he understated the case dramatically the stairwell did a meander to the right it caught up with the chasm caused by the earthquakes that had occurred during the reign of the shadowmasters there was only half a stairway there it hung in the face of a cliff that left a whole lot of down on my righthand side and it was down that was entirely too well illuminated by a reddish orange light that may have come from the stone itself since there seemed to be no other obvious source though i did have trouble opening my eyes wide enough to look wraithlike wisps of vapor wobbled upward from somewhere down below the air seemed wanner i asked were not heading into hell itself are we some vehdna believe alshiel is a place where wicked souls will burn for all eternity swan understood not your hell but id guess its hell enough for them thatre trapped down there i stopped on the remains of a landing the steps narrowed to two feet just below me by leaning out slightly i could see clearly that the stairwell had been constructed inside a larger bore at least twenty feet in diameter the shaft had been filled with a stone darker than that through which it had been cut maybe the bore had needed to be that big so kina could be dragged down below i asked can you imagine what an engineering project this must have been people with plenty of slaves arent daunted by big projects whats the matter i have a problem with heights this next part is going to take a lot of prayer and some outside encouragement i want you to go first i want you to go slow and i want you to stay where i can touch you i believe in meeting my fears eyeball to eyeball but if it gets bad and i feel like i might freeze up i want to be able to close my eyes and keep going i was astounded by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded i understand the real problem then is whos going to keep his eyes open for me whoa dont panic sleepy i was joking i can handle it really it was not the worst thing i ever dealt with i never abandoned rational thought but it was difficult even when swan promised me that an unseen protective barrier existed on the abyssal side and demonstrated its presence the animal inside me wanted to get the heck out of there and go someplace where the ground was flat and green there was a sky overhead and there might even be a few trees swan assured me that i was missing one heck of a view especially as we approached the lower end of the gap where the light was brighter revealing churning mists way below mists that concealed the depths of the abyss i kept my eyes closed until we were back into a closed cavern again i had started counting steps up top so i could get an idea of how deep we went but i lost count while i was pretending to be a fly crawling on a wall i was too busy being terrified but it did seem like we had traveled a long way horizontally as well as downward almost immediately after i had that thought the stair turned left then left again the orange red light faded away the stair made a couple more quick turns into a total darkness which aroused whole new species of terrors but nothing bit me and nothing came to steal my soul then there was light again growing so subtly i was never really aware of first noticing it it had a golden cast to it but was extremely cold and as soon as i was aware of it i knew we were approaching our destination the stairwell passed right through a natural cavern at one time that had been sealed off but the quakes had toppled the responsible masonry walls i asked we here almost careful climbing over the stones they arent very stable whats that what that sound we listened after a while swan said i think its wind sometimes there was a breeze when we were down here before wind a mile underground dont ask me to explain it it just is you want to go first this time yes i thought you would golden caverns where old men sat beside the way frozen in time immortal but unable to move an eyelid madmen they some covered with fairy webs of ice as though a thousand winter spiders had spun threads of frozen water above an enchanted forest of icicles grew downward from the cavern roof so murgen described it once upon a time decades ago the description remained apt though the light was not as golden as i expected and the delicate filigrees of ice were denser and more complex the old men seated against the walls caught up in the webs were not the wideeyed madmen of murgens visions though they were dead or asleep i did not see one open eye nor did i see one face i recognized willow who are these people the bitter wind continued to rush through the cavern which was a dozen feet high and nearly as wide with a relatively flat floor side to side it sloped with the length of the cavern it looked like ancient frozen mud covered with a pelt of fine frost fur water had run through the cavern in some epoch before the coming of men these ones i dont know they were here when we came down i leaned closer but was careful not to touch these caves are natural they have that look then theyve been down here all along they were here before the plain was built possibly probably and whoever buried kina knew about them so did the deceivers chased here by rhaydreynak hunh this one is definitely deceased naturally mummified but definitely gone the corpse was all dried out bare bone showed at a folded knee and tattered elbow these others who knows maybe the right sorcery could get them up and running around like iqbals kids why would we get them up were here to get the guys that me and catcher buried right theyre on up there he pointed upslope where the light was even less golden becoming almost an icy blue the light was not bright not nearly so much so as in the vision i had experienced maybe it was more a psychic witchlight than a physical one more suited to the dreamwalkers eye i mused they might be able to tell us something interesting ill tell you something interesting swan muttered to himself in a normal voice for my benefit he said i dont think so at least i dont think it would be anything any of us would want to hear catcher took extreme pains to avoid even touching them getting the captives past without disturbing them was the hardest work we did i bent to examine another of the old men he did not look like he belonged to any race i knew they must be from one of the other worlds maybe theres a saying where i grew up let sleeping dogs lie sounds like exquisitely appropriate advice we dont know why they were put down here i have no intention of releasing any deviltry but our own these men here arent the same as those there were several different groups last time i doubt that thats changed i got the feeling that they were dumped here at different times see how much less ice there is around these guys makes me think it takes centuries to accumulate ow what i banged my head on this damned rock icicle thing hmm i mustve overlooked it somehow get smart and ill punch you in the kneecap lofty does it feel like its colder in here than it ought to be it was not my imagination and not the icy wind either always his grin had gone away its them i think starting to realize somebodys here it keeps building up it can get on your nerves if you pay any attention to it i could feel the growth of whatever it was insanity becoming palpable i suppose that was the impression anyway how come were able to move around in here i asked why arent we frozen wed probably end up that way if we stayed long enough to fall asleep these people all had to be unconscious when they were brought down here really we were up where there was less ice the frost on the floor still betrayed the tracks left by soulcatcher and willow swan years ago the old men here were different they resembled nyueng bao except for one who had been tall thin and extremely pale but they dont stay asleep several pairs of open eyes seemed to track me i hoped it was my imagination stimulated by the spookiness of the cave i never actually saw any movement footsteps i jumped hiphigh to a short elephant before i realized that it had to be sahra and the radisha and whoever else had decided not to participate in all those exciting projects that were underway upstairs go keep those people from stomping in here and messing everything up ill get an idea of the layout and try to figure out what well have to do swan scowled and growled and grunted then minced carefully back down the slight slope toward the stairwell he talked to himself all the way and i did not blame him even i thought nothing ever went right for him i took a step in the direction the old footprints led my boots went out from under me i hit hard then slid downhill until i caught up with swan who did a convincing job of acting amused after he stopped me you all right bruised my side hurt my wrist i shoulda told you that floor can be pretty slippery where theres a lot of frost youre lucky i dont swear uhm you forgot on purpose youre as bad as oneeye or goblin did i just hear my name taken in vain oneeyes voice punctuated by rasping panting more suitable to a lunger came from the shadows down where the stair intercepted the cavern god is great god is good god is the allknowing and allmerciful his plan is hidden but just and save me from the mystery of his plan because all i ever get is the misery of his plan what is he doing down here i asked swan i know ill leave him behind i know im definitely not going to carry him up out of here just so he doesnt suffer another stroke from the effort hit him over the head when he isnt looking i began moving deeper into the cave again im going to try this one more time beneath my breath i continued my conversation with god as usual he did not trouble himself to defend his works to me my fault for being a woman i nearly missed the transition from the ancient nyueng bao types to company men because the first few modern bodies belonged to nyueng bao bodyguards i halted only when i reached and recognized a nyueng bao bodyguard named pham quang i studied him for a moment i backed up carefully when you looked for it the boundary was evident my brothers and their allies had several centuries less frost accumulation upon them they had only just begun to develop the delicate webbings that encased the older bodies that seemed awfully fast actually considering how long some of the others must have been buried possibly soulcatcher had indulged in a little artistry during her visit interspersed with my brothers were several bodies so ancient that they had become completely cocooned i intuited them as bodies only because the chrysalises slumped just like the captured did a thought it might be worthwhile having oneeye along after all down here soulcatcher might have taken time to set a trap or two just for the devil of it the nar generals isi and ochiba sat against the cave wall opposite pham quang ochibas eyes were open they did not move but did seem fixed on me i hunkered down got as close as i could without touching him those brown pools were moist there was no dust on their surfaces nor any frost they had opened quite recently a chill crawled down my spine a very creepy feeling came over me i felt like i was walking among the dead in the far north whence swan came carrying travelers tales some religions supposedly pictured hell as a cold place my imagination running with the terror that my brothers situation sparked had no trouble picturing this cave as a suburb of hell i rose carefully and moved away from ochiba now the cave floor was almost perfectly level my brothers were not crowded together the rest seemed to be scattered along the next several hundred feet not all immediately visible because of a turn in the cave a few old cocoon men were interspersed with them i see the lance i announced which was wonderful now we could split into two parties and have both retain their capacity for accessing the plain my voice echoed like there was a chorus of me all talking at the same time hitherto swan and i had tried to speak softly the echoes had been little more than ghostly whispers although extremely busy even at that level keep it down oneeye said what are you doing little girl you dont have any idea what youre dealing with here he had gotten past swan somehow and was headed my way he was awfully damned spry for a twohundredyearold stroke victim this business had him truly excited that left me suspicious but i had no time to try reasoning out what angle the man might have i looked into another pair of eyes these belonging to a long bony pallid man who had to be the sorcerer longshadow longshadow was a prisoner of the company he had been brought along because neither croaker nor lady trusted anyone else to guard him and he could not be exterminated because the health of the shadowgate insofar as they had known was dependent upon his continued wellbeing and well that they had been so distrustful it would be a much different and more terrible world if the shadowmaster had been left behind to tinker at whatever wickedness took his fancy soulcatchers evil was capricious and unfocused longshadows malice and insanity were deep and abiding that insanity stared out of his eyes right then on my mental checklist i made a tick that meant this one would stay right where he was others might have plans for him but they were not in charge if we could work out how to strengthen our worlds shadowgate maybe we could even execute him i continued moving working my silent triage constantly bemused because there were so many faces that i did not recognize a lot of men who had enlisted while i was away from the center of the action oh darn what oneeye was only a few steps behind me gaining ground fast his voice seemed to rattle as it echoed its wheezer the stasis didnt take for him oneeye grunted evidently indifferent old wheezer came from the same tribe oneeye did although wheezer was more than a century younger than the wizard there had never been any affection between them he had a better run than he deserved wheezer had been old and dying of consumption when he joined the company during its passage southward decades ago and he had continued to survive despite his infirmities and despite all the trials the company had endured herere candles and cletus theyre gone too and a couple of nyueng bao and two shadar i dont recognize something happened here this makes seven dead men all in a clump dont move little girl dont touch anything before i have a chance to look it over i froze it was time to acknowledge his expertise i havent found them yet i snapped at sahra and the radisha i dont want to go any farther if oneeye cant assure me that im not going to kill somebody just by being here against all advice those two had pushed as far forward as i would let them go i could understand that they wanted to see their husbands and brothers and boyfriends but they ought to have sense enough to restrain themselves until we knew what we could and could not do without risking harm to those very husbands and brothers and boyfriends sahra gave me a sharp hurt look sorry i said insincerely come on think you can see that the stasis down here didnt work for everyone swan how far up this tunnel do we have to go i could see a scatter of eight recumbent forms between myself and the curve none of whom were immediately recognizable as the captain lady murgen thai dei cordy mather or blade from where we stand now roughly eleven people still arent accounted for i dont remember swan grumped bass echoes chased one another around the cavern they were worse with my higher pitched voice though memory spell wearing off i dont think so this feels more like something i never knew im still a whole lot confused about what went on down here one big problem was that none of us really knew exactly how many captured there were swan was the best witness because he had ridden with them but he had not kept track other than of key people murgen never had been any help because after he had become one of the captured he had apparently become unable to explore the immediate vicinity where he was confined we need to get murgen awake first thing nobody else will know all the names and faces it seemed probable that some of the people i did not recognize just were not part of the company oneeye figure out how to wake these people up as soon as i find murgen i want to get him into talking condition can i go ahead squabbling echoes reminded me to keep my voice down crabbily oneeye responded yes just dont touch anybody or even anything that you dont recognize and stop trying to rush me can you bring them out of stasis i dont know yet do i ive been too damned busy answering dumb questions leave me alone long enough and i might figure it out though tempers were getting short and manners were becoming frayed i sighed rubbed my forehead and temples because i had begun to develop a headache listened to the sounds of more people descending the stair willow see if you can keep those fools out of here till oneeyes ready i looked ahead without eagerness not only did the cavern turn to the right it steepened the waterpolished floor was covered with frost the footing was going to be treacherous caw the white crow was up there somewhere it had been announcing itself repeatedly sounding more impatient every time i moved forward carefully when i reached the steeper floor i knelt and brushed the frost away to improve the footing i told sahra and the radisha if you have to follow me youd better be even more careful than i am they insisted they were careful not one of us slipped and went flailing back down the slope heres longo and sparkle i said and that wad definitely looks like the howler in fact that wad definitely was that crippled little master sorcerer he had been one of the ladys henchmen in the far north then our enemy down here he had become a prisoner of war along with his ally longshadow and lady must have foreseen some use for him or she would not have kept him alive but he was not likely to get released while i was in charge in his way he was crazier than soulcatcher the crow chided me for taking so long the howler was awake his will was such that he could move his eyes though nothing more was within his capacity one glimpse of the madness within those dark orbs and i knew that this man could not be permitted to make it back to the world be very careful around this one i said or hell nail you as surely as soulcatcher nailed swan oneeye howler is awake he can move his eyes oneeye repeated my warning absentmindedly dont get too close to him the crow began to nag its voice gave birth to a particularly annoying generation of echoes ah radisha heres your brother and he seems to be in pretty good shape no dont touch thats probably what contaminated the stasis spells protecting the dead men youll just have to be patient same as the rest of us she made a sound like a low growl the icy cave ceiling above us made creaking sounds that added to the volleys of echoes i continued its hard i know its hard but right now patience is the best tool we have for getting them out of here safely once i was sure she would restrain herself i resumed inching forward the white crow cawed impatiently out loud i thought i do believe ill wring that things neck the radisha reminded me youll build bad kharma you might come back as a crow or parrot in your next life one of the beauties of being vehdna is that you dont have a next life to worry about and god the allpowerful the merciful has no love at all for crows except to use as plagues upon the unrighteous does anybody know if master santaraksita planned to come down here my organizational skills had vanished because of my own eagerness to reach the captured it occurred to me only now that the scholars knowledge might prove especially useful here if he could connect anything in this cave to known myth i got no answer ill send for him if i have to ah sahra heres your honey dont touch i said that a little too loudly the echoes got very boisterous several small icicles broke loose from the ceiling they shattered with an almost metallic tinkle when they struck the floor the crow spoke very distinctly come here and i having finally figured it out told it if your manners dont improve dramatically you might not get out of here at all the bird was strutting back and forth nervously in front of croaker and lady soulcatcher had left those two snuggled up together arranged so that the captain had one arm around ladys waist while she held his other hand with both of hers in her lap additional delicate touches suggested that soulcatchers wicked sense of play had peaked for this bit of still life if catcher had left any booby traps at all this was where they would be oneeye i need help any traps that existed were beyond me ladys eyes were open there was no dust on them she was angry and the white crow wanted to tell me all about it patience i counseled close to becoming impatient myself swan oneeye come on up here swan arrived first despite coming from farther away i asked you recall anything special she did with these two any little bit of sneakiness no i wouldnt worry about it by the time she laid them out she was worried about what might happen next thats the way she is when shes starting something its her whole world and she has no doubts about any part of it but the closer she comes to getting finished the more trouble she has keeping her confidence up nice to know that shes human i did not mean a word of that oneeye look for booby traps around here and make up your mind tell me if you can bring these people back darn it my headache had not gotten any better but thank the god of mercies it had grown no worse another icicle fell i know i know i heard you the first time you asked he grumbled something about wishing he knew a way to charm me up a better love life i stared past croaker and lady the cavern went on pale light barely illuminated it there was no gold in that at all now a touch of silver a touch of grey a lot of blue ice in fact the sedimentary rock seemed to give way to actual ice now ahead willow did catcher go up there when you were here he checked where i was looking no but she could have during an earlier visit someone had traveled in that direction recently in cavern scales of time there were still clear tracks in the frost and i suspected that i would not enjoy the journey once i began to follow them but i would do so i had no choice i had failed elsewhere by letting narayan and the daughter of night get away that kina undoubtedly supplied them with a subtle boost did not sufficiently signify i should have been better prepared oneeye talk to me can you resurrect these people or not if youd stop barking for five minutes i could probably figure that out take your time sweetness itll take us a while to starve that ice up there must have been what swan had meant when he mentioned ice on the plain youve had all the foolaround time im willing to give you i told oneeye can you do it yes or no right now the shape im in i need more rest his speech was slow and slurred and had taken on an odd rhythm that made following him difficult he was right of course all of us needed rest but we also needed to finish our business and get off the plain hunger was a reality already it was not going to go away i feared it might become a companion as intimate and dreaded as it had been during the siege of jaicur i had decided already that i would adopt uncle dojs suggested strategy we would recover only a few people now we would return for the others later but that meant making cruel choices somebody would end up hating me no matter what i did if i was really clever i would find some good oldfashioned goblinlike way of spreading the blame all around me those tagged to wait could not hate everybody and there went some good oldfashioned wishful thinking sleepy we were talking about human beings if there is any way to be contrary unreasonable and obnoxious human beings are sure to find and pursue it with verve and enthusiasm at whatever might be the most inconvenient time is anybody at all still up topside i demanded i had settled down for a short nap when the timing had seemed appropriate and that had turned into a long nap that might have become a permanent nap had not so many people been around to keep me from drifting too far away i dreamed while i was out i knew that but i remembered none of it the smell of kina remained strong in my nostrils so i knew where i must have gone though oneeye was seated beside me apparently assisting me with my snoring a worried goblin appeared checking to make certain his best friend did not drift too far into sleep beyond me mother gota had become engrossed in a protracted debate with the white crow that must have been a classic dialog to disinterested listeners goblin murmured from now on dont make any sudden movements sleepy always look around you always make sure that youre not going to damage any of our friends i heard tobo talking rapidly softly in a businesslike voice i could not distinguish his words somewhere uncle doj rattled away too whats happening weve started waking them up its not as complicated as we feared it might be but it takes time and care and the people we bring out arent going to be any use to us after they waken if you had any plans along those lines oneeye worked it all out before he collapsed the little wizard sounded grimmer suddenly collapsed oneeye collapsed was it just exhaustion i hoped i dont know i dont want to know yet for now im just going to let him rest right down on the edge of the stasis or even into it if i think thats necessary once his body regains its strength ill bring him out and see how bad it really was he did not sound optimistic i said if we had to we could leave him here in stasis till we could give him proper treatment which reminded me youre not just getting everyone up are you theres no way we can nurse and feed the whole crowd surely the captured would not be able to take care of themselves after fifteen years of just sitting around stasis or not they might even be as weak and unskilled as babies and have to learn everything all over again no sleepy were going to do five people thats all uhm good hey where the heck did the standard go it was right over there im the standardbearer i have to keep track i had it moved over by the gap to the stair so somebody going that way can take it upstairs will you quit fussing thats sahras specialty speaking of sahra tobo where do you think youre going while i was talking with goblin the boy had slipped past and headed up the cave i was just gonna go see whats up there no youre just gonna stay right here and help your uncle and goblin take care of your father the captain and the lieutenant he gave me a black look despite everything he still had those moments when he was just a boy he put on a pouty face that made me grin willow swan came up behind me ive got a problem sleepy which would be i cant find cordy cordy mather not anywhere from the corner of my eye i noted that the radisha had overheard she rose slowly from a squat in front of her brother looked our way she said nothing nor did anything otherwise that might betray an interest it was not common knowledge that she and mather had enjoyed an intimate relationship youre sure im sure you did bring him down here absolutely i grunted there was one other absentee whose nonpresence i had been willing to ignore until some rational excuse for her disappearance arose the shapeshifter lisa bowalk unable to shed the guise of a black panther had gone up onto the plain as a prisoner but was not now to be found among the dead above or the captured down below lisa bowalk had been possessed of a towering hatred for the company and particularly for oneeye because it was oneeyes fault that she had become trapped in the feline shape i had to ask what about the panther willow its not around here anywhere either what panther oh i remember i dont know he was looking around like he thought he might spot his old friend mather hiding behind a stalagmite i remember we had to leave her upstairs because we couldnt get her cage around the first turn in the stair i mean it would have gone if catcher and i didnt have anything else to mess with but we couldnt manage it and the rest of the string both so catcher decided to leave the cage up there for later i dont know what happened when later came i dont remember much of anything that happened after we came down here maybe oneeye should give me another dose of that memory spell he tugged on and twisted the ends of his hair girlstyle and stared down the slope i know i left cordy right down there just a little above blade where it seemed like the floor would be more comfortable right down there was the downhill edge of the clot of seven dead men there had to be a connection goblin whats the story are we going to wake these people up or not me ignoring everything he had said earlier goblin responded with a sneer that turned into one of his big toad grins ive already got murgen out but i wanted him down here where i could ask questions i mean ive got him out of stasis bimbobrain hes right over there im working on the captain and lady now tobo and doj have been doing prelims on thai dei and the prahbrindrah drah exactly according to my expectations with the latter two men included entirely for political reasons neither was likely to contribute much to the companys glory or survival i moved down to where murgen lay snoring the echoing racket and the melting ice webs were the only changes i saw i squatted anybody think to bring blankets down i had not i am what you would have to call disorganized when it comes to presenttense operations it had not occurred to me to bring spare clothing or blankets or gear but i sure can plan bloodshed and general mayhem real well there were treasure chambers down here somewhere though i had glimpsed several in my dreams there might be something useful there if we could find them my stomach growled i was getting hungry the rumble reminded me that it would not be long before our situation became desperate murgens eyes opened he tried to form an expression a smile for sahra but the effort was too much for him his gaze shifted to me a whisper struggled through his lips the books get the daughter his eyes closed again it was true the captured were not going to jump up and dance tarantellas when they were liberated murgens message was clear the books of the dead were down here something had to be done before the daughter of night got another chance to begin copying them and i had no doubt that she would manage that despite soulcatcher she had kina backing her up ill take care of it i did not have a ghost of a notion how i would manage that though the rescue was running smoothly like a wellgreased siege engine missing only a few minor parts goblin had murgen and croaker headed toward the surface aboard makeshift litters croaker had not said a word nor had he made any effort to do so even though he had been awake and aware he stared at me for a long time i had no idea what was going on inside his head i just hoped he was sane before he departed murgen did give my hand a small squeeze i hoped that was an expression of gratitude or encouragement i was not at all happy about his being unable to provide information or advice i had not thought much about what role i would play after the captured were wakened i had operated on the unspoken assumption more or less that i would retire to my annals or even farther to the standardbearer job if murgen wanted to be annalist again more and more people kept coming downstairs even though i had tried to send word up to warn everyone that they faced a horrible climb going in the other direction the white crow continued to curse and jabber semicoherently until it lost its voice i was concerned about lady she had managed that feathery spy quite well for a long time never giving herself away even when she did try to clue me in but now she seemed to be losing control of herself i assured her repeatedly that she would go upstairs as soon as i had bearers capable of getting her there doj sahra and gota had thai dei ready to travel i gave them the goahead oneeye would follow him then lady would go the prahbrindrah drah would be the last this time tobo seemed fascinated by his father apparently because he could not quite believe that the man was real in a fleshy sense circumstances had kept his parents separate almost since his conception the boy started to tag along after the rest of the family i called out tobo stay down here you have a job to do see about your dad after we get lady and the prince moved out hello suvrin whyre you down here curiosity sri santaraksitas curiosity he insisted that he had to see the caverns he drove me crazy reminding me how storied they are in religious legend he couldnt be this close to something like that and not explore it personally i see i noticed the old librarian now he was working his way up the line of old men examining each and murmuring to himself occasionally he would bounce up and down in excitement swan had gone back to make him keep his hands to himself he wanted to finger and sniff every bit of ancient metal and cloth he seemed to have trouble understanding that those old men were still alive but very vulnerable swan bring him up here i did want the benefit of his expertise just a while ago in a softer voice i told suvrin youre the one whos going to carry him back upstairs if he cant make it on his own and ill be right behind you giving encouragement by poking you with a spear suvrin seemed to have thought about the climb already he was not looking forward to it either the man has no concept i interrupted what about shivetya hes back right side up and safely away from the pit i cant say he seemed particularly grateful though he say or do something no it was his expression and that was probably because we dropped him on his nose once in think id have trouble being grateful for a pop in the snoot myself santaraksita was puffing when he joined us he was excited were walking the actual roads of myth dorabee i have begun begging the lords of light to let me live long enough to report my adventures to the bhadrhalok who will call you a liar over and over again sri you know the right people dont become involved in actual adventures all of you follow me now were going to have another actual adventure traveling into mythology i headed on up the steepening slope i soon discovered that someone had gone this way before me at first i suspected tobo had gotten farther than i had thought then i decided that the disturbances in the frost were too old for that so concluded that soulcatcher must have gone back this way just to see what she could see back there small side caves entered the main cavern few of them large enough to permit passage of an adult body the main cave dwindled in diameter we had to hunch down then we had to crawl whoever had gone before us had done the same do you know what youre doing swan asked do you know where youre going of course i do leadership tip sound confident even when you have no idea just do not make a habit of it they will find you out i had been through here in my dreams but only sort of evidently because every few feet i ran into some detail i did not recall from those nightmares and then we stumbled onto something that was far more than a mere detail the sole of a boot nearly smacked me in the face because i was concentrating on trying to decipher the story encrypted in the frost on the cave floor that was the story of someone who had been moving wildly maybe in a panic not only had the frost been rubbed away in places the stone itself was bruised or chipped i think ive found mather willow it was one of those odd moments when you discover the trivial i noticed that cordy mather really needed to have his boots resoled i did not immediately wonder how a mans leg could stick out like that with the toe pointing halfway upward above horizontal while the man himself was lying on his stomach wed better stop right here and take a good look i dont see the man doing this to himself swan said ill get goblin dont do anything till he gets here dont sweat it im fond of my hide if i lose it ill miss out on our honeymoon i drew my sword for what good that might do then raised up slowly till the top of my head bumped the cavern roof cordy mather had crawled over a hump in the floor and something fatal had happened to him before he could get all of himself onto the downward side suvrin eased up beside me inexplicably i found myself painfully aware of him as a masculine presence luckily he was even less interpersonally adept than i was he failed to notice my flustered and uncomfortable reaction odd the urge was not something i would pursue certainly i just wondered why i sometimes suffered these sudden random impulses some of which were extremely difficult to resist ninetynine percent of the time i did not so much as think about the possibility of combining myself a man and a bed in a search for adventure maybe i should not have been teasing swan suvrin said that sure doesnt look very appetizing what do you think happened im not even going to guess im just going to sit here and wait for the expert to show up may i look santaraksita asked suvrin scooted back he discovered that the older man was too broad to pass by him there so we all had to retreat twenty yards so santaraksita could get past us in turn i admonished him repeatedly not to go farther forward than i had i definitely dont want to have to drag you out of here though i will grant that the man was a great deal leaner now than when i had worked for him and because you want to get home to tell the bhadrhalok all about this you were right about them dorabee they wont believe a word i say and not only because theyre the right people but because surendranath santaraksita never had an adventure in his life he never had the urge until this adventure had him rich men have dreams poor men die to make them come true you persist in amazing me dorabee who are you quoting vtc ghosh he was an acolyte of bb mukerjee one of the six bhomparan disciples of sondhel ghose the janaka santaraksitas face lit right up dorabee you are a marvel indeed a wonder of wonders the pupil begins to exceed the master what was your source i dont recall ever having read of a ghosh or a mukerjee featured in the janaka school i snickered like a prankster kid thats because i was pulling your leg i made it up sri and that seemed to leave him even more amazed goblin broke it up swan says you found a dead man yes it looks like cordy mather from this end i didnt see his face though i wasnt going to move anything anywhere until we had a good idea what happened to him id rather it didnt happen to me goblin grunted pudgeman you want to back down here so i can get past you this tunnel gets pretty tight dont it watch out you dont let your chubby butt plug it up for how come do you want to go slithering around back here anyway sleepy because if i keep going this way far enough ill get to the place where the deceivers concealed the original books of the dead goblin gave me a funny look but took my word for it i talked to ghosts in mist machines birds talked to me a talking bird was following me right now at a distance at the moment it did not have much to say because its throat was sore but it did manage to rip out a curse or two whenever it had to dodge somebodys flailing feet thats interesting i thought so ah yeah its not sorcery though its your basic mechanical booby trap springloaded stabs you with a poisoned pin therere probably twenty more between here and where you want to go what do you think mather was trying to do if he woke up and found himself down here and didnt know where he was or what had happened to him he might have panicked and taken off and just went in the wrong direction i bet its his fault all those guys back there are dead he probably tried to wake them up goblin grunted again there thats disarmed id better go ahead and see what else is waiting but first we need to get mather pulled back so you all can get past him if you can weasel past him so can i yeah you can but what about your boyfriend and your sugar daddy theyve got a little more pork on them he grunted and cursed softly as he fought mathers remains back over the hump in the floor i noticed for the first time that the echoes were different in this more confined space jammed with bodies they were almost nonexistent i do not believe it was miles to where the deceivers of antiquity concealed their treasures and relics but my body believed that before we got there goblin disarmed another dozen traps and found several more that had fallen victim to time the underground wind whimpered and whined as it rushed past us in the tight places it sucked the warmth right out of me but it did not dissuade me i went where i wanted to go and was hungry enough to eat a camel when i got there it had been a long long time since breakfast i had a dread feeling it could be longer still before supper it feels like a temple doesnt it suvrin asked he was less troubled than the rest of us though raised nearer this place than anyone else he was less intimate with the legends of the dark mother he stopped staring at the three lecterns and the huge books they bore long enough to turn to me and whisper here he offered me a bit of crumbling flax cake from the pouch he wore at the small of his back you must have read my mind you talk to yourself a lot i dont think you realize youre doing it i did not it was a bad habit that needed breaking right now i heard you when we were crawling through the tunnel that had been a private discourse with my god an internal dialog i had thought the subject of food had come up and here was food so maybe the allmerciful was on the job after all thanks goblin you feel any tricks or traps in here there were echoes again though with a different timbre we were inside a large chamber the floor and walls were all ice that had been cut and polished by the flow of frigid water i presumed the invisible ceiling was the same the place did have a feel of the holy to it even though that was the holiness of darkness no traps that i can sense id think theyd leave that sort of stuff outside dont you he sounded like he wanted to convince himself youre asking me to define the psychology of those who worship devils and rakshasas vehdna priests would guarantee you that theres nothing so foul or evil as to be beyond the capacity of those most accursed of unbelievers i thought they would guarantee it if they had heard of the stranglers i had not heard of them before i became attached to the company suvrin said sri i dont think you should master santaraksita had recognized the ancient books as something remarkable and just could not resist going up for an upclose look i agreed with suvrin master dont go charging the noise sounded something like someone ripping tent canvas for half a second then popped like the crack of a whip master santaraksita left the floor of the unholy chapel folded around his middle and flew at the rest of us in an arc that admitted only slight acquaintance with gravity suvrin tried to catch him goblin tried to duck santaraksita bounced suvrin sideways and ricocheted into me the lot of us ended up in a breathless tangle of arms and legs the white crow had something uncomplimentary to say about that you and me and a stew pot critter i gasped when i got my breath back i snagged goblins leg no more traps eh theyd leave that sort of thing out in the caverns eh what the devil was that then that was a magical booby trap woman and a damned fine example of its kind too it remained undetectable until santaraksita tripped it sri are you injured i asked only my pride dorabee he puffed only my pride itll take me a week to get my wind back though he rolled off suvrin got onto his hands and knees he had a definite green look to him youve enjoyed a cheap lesson then i told him dont rush into something when you dont know what youre rushing into youd think id know that after this last year wouldnt you you might think yes dont anybody ask how junior is doing suvrin grumbled he couldnt possibly get hurt we knew youd be fine goblin told him as long as he landed on your head the little wizard limped forward as he neared the point where santaraksita had gone airborne he became very cautious he extended a single finger forward one slow inch at a time a smaller piece of cloth ripped goblin spun around his arm flung backward he staggered a couple of steps before he fell to his knees not far from me after all this time he finally recognizes the natural order of things goblin shook his hand the way you do when you burn your fingers damn that smarts thats a good spell its got real pop dont do that suvrin had decided to throw a chunk of ice on its way back the missile parted suvrins hair it then hit the cavern wall and showered the white crow with fragments of ice the bird had a word to say about that it followed up with a few more i began to wonder if lady had lost track of the fact that she was not herself the white crow and in fact was just a passenger making use of the albinos eyes goblin stuck his injured finger in his mouth squatted down and considered the chamber for a while i squatted too after taking time out to keep suvrin and master santaraksita from making even greater nuisances of themselves swan slithered into the chamber disturbing the crow the bird said nothing though it just sidled away and looked put out about all existence swan settled beside me wow kind of impressive even though its simple those are the original books of the dead supposedly almost as old as kina herself so why is everybody just sitting here goblins trying to figure how to get to them i told him what had happened damn i always miss the best stuff hey junior run up there and show us your flying trick again master santaraksita did the flying mr swan suvrin needed to work on his sense of humor he did not own a proper black company attitude i asked why not try it yourself willow take a run at the books you promise to let me land on you no but ill blow you a kiss as you fly by itd probably help if you people would shut up goblin said he rose but by being blindingly blisteringly brilliant ive worked it out anyway already in spite of you all we get to the lecterns by using the golden pickax as a passkey that was why narayan singh was so upset when he saw what we had tobo still has the pick i said a minute later i said dont everybody stumble all over each other offering to go get him lets just go together and all be equally miserable goblin suggested thats what the black company is all about sharing the good times along with the bad you trying to con me into thinking that this is one of the good times i asked crawling into the cave right behind him nobody wants to kill us today nobodys trying that sounds like a good time to me he had a point a definite point maybe my company attitude needed attention too behind me suvrin grumbled about starting to feel like a gopher i glanced back swan had had an attack of good sense and decided to bring up the rear thereby making sure that master santaraksita did not stay behind and tinker with things that might cause a change in goblins opinion about this being one of the good times where did he go i mused aloud people were still working in the cave of the ancients getting lady and the prahbrindrah drah ready to go upstairs but tobo was not among them he wouldnt just run upstairs would he he had the energy of youth but nobody was so energetic they would just charge into that climb on impulse while i tromped around muttering and looking for the kid goblin did the obvious and questioned witnesses he got an answer before i finished building up a good mad sleepy he left surprise surprise what that was not all of it the little wizard was upset he turned right when he left sleepy he oh now i did have a good mad worked up a booming headthrobbing wanttomakesomebodypay real bad mad that idiot that moron that darned fool ill cut his legs off lets see if we can catch him right was downward right was deeper into the earth and time deeper into despair and darkness right could only be the road to the resting place of the mother of night as i started out with intent to turn right i collected the standard the white crow shrieked approval goblin sneered youre going to be sorry before you go down a hundred steps sleepy i was tempted to abandon the darned thing before we had gone that far it was too long to be dragging around in a stairwell this stair has no bottom i told goblin we were puffing badly despite the direction we were headed we had passed openings into other caves the stairwell had pierced each appeared to have been visited by human beings sometime in the past we discovered both treasures and boneyards i suspected sri santaraksita baladitya and i could not live long enough just to catalog all the mysteries buried beneath the plain and every darned unknown ancient thing i glimpsed in passing called to me like the sirens of legend but tobo was still ahead of us and seemed deaf to our calling perhaps just as we did not waste time and breath responding to suvrin and santaraksita who kept calling down to us from ever farther behind it was my devout hope they would be smitten by good sense and abandon the pursuit goblin did not respond to my remarks he had no breath left over i asked cant you use some kind of spell to slow him down or knock him out im worried he really cant be so far ahead that he cant hear us darn i had gotten tangled with the standard again goblin just shook his head and kept moving he cant hear puffpuff but he dont know that he cant hear enough said there was a bottom to the stair and the queen of deceit was napping down there with just a whisper of awareness left for manipulating a cocky knowitall boy who had a touch of talent and had taken possession of an instrument that could become a nasty weapon in the hands of those who would disarm her and have her slumber continue neverending after a while we had to slow down the unnatural light faded until it became too weak to provide a reliable forecast of our footing the occasional breezes rising past us were no longer cold and they had begun to bear traces of a familiar repugnant odor when goblin caught that smell he slowed way down worked hard on regaining his breath before he had to suck that stench down in its full potency been a while since ive come facetoface with a god he said i dont know if ive got what it takes to wrangle one anymore and what would that be i never realized that i was in the company of an experienced godwrangler it takes youth it takes confidence it takes brashness most of all it takes a huge ration of stupidity and a lot of luck then why dont we just sit down here and let those sterling qualities carry tobo through though i confess im a little nervous about his supply of luck im tempted sleepy sorely and sincerely he needs the lesson troubled perhaps even a little frightened he continued but hes got the pickax and the company needs him hes the future me and oneeye are today and yesterday he started picking up the pace again which meant a rapid heightening of the intensity of my skirmish with the standard what do you mean hes the future nobody lives forever sleepy the burst of speed did not last we encountered a mist that complicated the hazards of darkness the visibility turned nil and the footing became particularly treacherous for a short person trying to drag a long pole down a tight and unpredictable stairway the moist air was heavier than anything i had experienced since the fogs above the corpsechoked flood that had surrounded jaicur during the siege a chilling shriek came from far back up the stair my mind flooded with images of horrors pouncing gleefully upon suvrin and master santaraksita the shriek continued approaching faster than any human being could possibly descend that stairway what the hell is that goblin snapped i dont the shrieking stopped at the same time i stepped down and there was no more down to step i staggered betrayed by the darkness the lance banged into overhead and wall we had reached another landing i assumed until i felt around with my toes and the standard and could find no more edge what do you have over there i asked steps behind me a wall to the right that goes forward about six feet then ends all level floor ive got a wall on the left that just keeps going on and a level floor gah something slammed into my back i had only an instant of warning the sound of wings violently flapping as a large bird tried to stop before it hit the white crow cursed as it landed on the floor it flopped around for a moment then started climbing me that would have been a sight i am sure had there been any light to reveal it i fought down an impulse to bat the creature into the darkness i hoped it was here to help tobo my voice rolled away into the distance then came back in a series of echoes the heavy air seemed to load those up with despair the boy did not answer but he did move or something moved i heard a rustle from less than twenty feet away goblin talk to me about this weve been blinded by sorcery theres light out there im working on getting our sight back give me your hand lets stick together the crow murmured sister sister walk straight ahead look bold you will pass through the darkness its diction had improved dramatically over the past year maybe that was because we were so much closer to the force manipulating the bird i felt around for goblin grabbed hold pulled dropped the standard picked it up and pulled again all right im ready that crow knew what it was talking about after a half dozen steps we transited into a lighted ice cavern make that comparatively lighted dim greyblue light leaked in through translucent walls as though it was high noon just on the other side of a few feet of ice much more light radiated from the vicinity of the woman asleep on a bier at the center of the vast chamber some seventy feet away tobo stood halfway between us and it looking backward completely surprised to see us there and equally baffled as to where there might be dont you move boy goblin snapped dont you even take a deep breath until i tell you its safe to do so the form on the bier was a little fuzzy as though surrounded by heat shimmer and in spite of that i knew the woman lying there was the most beautiful creature in the world i knew that i loved her more than life itself that i wanted to rush over there and drink deeply of those perfect lips the white crow sneezed in my ear that certainly took the edge off the mood where have we seen all this before goblin asked voice dripping sarcasm she must be awfully weak or shed pluck something better from our minds than a replay of an old sleeping beauty fairy tale there isnt a castle built like this anywhere south of the sea of torments a castle what what castle the word for castle did not exist in taglian or jaicuri i knew it meant a kind of fortress only because i had spent so much time exploring the annals we seem to be inside the keep of an abandoned castle therere dormant rose creepers all over the place therere tons of cobwebs in the middle of everything is a beautiful blonde woman lying in an open casket she just begs to be kissed and brought back to life the part that always gets ignored and that our ungracious hostess has overlooked here is that the bitch in the story almost certainly was a vampire that isnt what i see carefully detail by detail i described the ice cave and the absolutely not blonde woman i saw lying upon a bier at its center while i spoke goblin finally worked some subtle spell on tobo that kept him too confused to move goblin asked do you remember your mother sleepy i vaguely recall a woman who might have been she died when i was little nobody talked about her we did not need to go into this we had work to do right here right now i hoped he got that message from my tone and expression what do you want to bet that what youre seeing is an idealized vision of your mother charged up with a whole lot of sexual comehither i did not argue that might be he knew the artifices of darkness i did keep moving forward slowly closing in on tobo which would mean that up close and quickly she doesnt have a real good connection with whats outside her two decades ago it had become clear that kina did not think or work well in real time that she did best when she applied her influence over years rather than minutes im too old to be snared by temptations of the flesh and youre too unsexed and undefined he grinned weakly the kid on the other hand is at that age id give a toe or two to see what he sees ruff he gestured tobo collapsed like a wet sock grab the hammer hang onto it hard dont get any closer to her than you absolutely have to drag tobo back to the doorway he sounded old and hollow and possessed by a despair that he did not want to share whats going on goblin talk to me this was a situation where we ought not to keep dangers to ourselves were facetoface with the great manipulator whos been disfiguring our lives for twentyfive years shes very slow but shes far more dangerous than anything weve faced before i know that but my reaction was elation my spirits soared all my hidden doubts kept so carefully submerged for so long now seemed trivial even silly this lovely creature was no god not like my god is god forgive me my weakness and my doubts o lord of hosts the darkness is everywhere and dwells within us all forgive me now when the hour of my death stares me in the face in forgiveness he is like the earth i grabbed hold of tobos arm and yanked him upright i clutched him as tightly as i gripped the standard he would not break away easily disoriented he did not struggle when i pulled him back from the sleeping form i averted my eyes she was beauty incarnate to gaze upon her was to love her to love her was to dedicate oneself to her will to lose oneself within her o lord of the hours watch over and guard me in the presence of the spawn of alshiel i need the pickax tobo i tried not to think about why i wanted that unholy tool at this distance kina might be able to pluck that right out of my mind moving slowly tobo removed the pick from under his shirt and handed it over got it i told goblin then get going as i started to do that suvrin and santaraksita gasping violently stumbled into the light both froze staring at kina in soft awe suvrin declared holy shit shes gorgeous master santaraksita seemed to be experiencing some confusion as he stared suvrin started forward drooling i popped him in the funny bone with the dull end of the pick head that not only got his attention it relaxed his overwhelming interest in kina mother of deceivers i told him mistress of illusion turn around get the boy out of here take him back to his mother sri dont make me hurt you too something like a bit of mist rose from and hovered over the sleeping womans mouth for an instant it seemed vaguely manshaped which reminded me of afrits the unhappy ghosts of murdered men millions of such devils could be at kinas beck run goddamnit goblin said run the crow told me i did not run i got hold of santaraksita and started pulling goblin was talking to himself something about wishing he had had the good sense to steal oneeyes spear if he was going to get himself into something like this goblin i heaved the standard it was not my intent that it do so but it stood straight up and bounced a couple of times on its butt before it tipped forward and fell into the little wizards eager hands he turned with it as the illusions surrounding kina evaporated if kina was ever human if any of the countless forms of myth regarding her creation indeed resembled fact a lot of work had gone into making her big and ugly she is the mother of deceivers sleepy the mother of deceivers that great hideous form covered with pustules from which infant skulls suppurated could no more be the true aspect of kina than the sleeping beauties had been the stench of old death became powerful i stared at the body now lying upon the icy floor it was the dark purpleblack of the deathdancer of my dreams but it dwarfed shivetya it was naked its perfect female proportions distracted from the ten thousand scars that marred its skin it did not move not even to breathe another feather of vapor rose from one huge nostril get the fuck out of here goblin shrieked he jerked to the right suddenly the lance of passion darting toward some target i could not see the lances head burned like it was covered by flickering alcohol flames a huge unheard scream tore at my mind suvrin and master santaraksita moaned tobo squealed the white crow unleashed a random stream of obscenities i am sure i contributed to the chorus as i kicked and punched the others to get them going i realized that my throat was raw goblin whirled back to his left thrusting at the wisp of mist that had left kinas nostril a moment before once again pale blue fire surrounded the head of the lance this time it ran a foot up the shaft before it faded this time the lances head betrayed penstrokes of dark ruby glow along its edges another wisp of the essence of kina rose from her nose there was no darkness or mist hiding the entrance now kinas focus was elsewhere suvrin and santaraksita were on the stair already wasting breath babbling about what they had seen i slugged tobo up side the head with all the force i could muster get out of here when he opened his mouth to argue i popped him again i did not want to hear it i did not want to hear anything not even a divine revelation it could wait goblin get your sorry butt in motion were out of the way the third wisp impaled itself upon the lances head this time the fire crept two yards up the shaft though it did not seem to affect the wood directly however this time the lances head became so hot that shaft wood in contact with it began to smolder goblin started to back down but another wisp rose and drifted faster than he moved getting between him and the stair he thrust at it a few times but each time he did it drifted out of reach it continued to control his path of retreat i am no sorceress despite a life spent in the proximity of wizards and witch women and whatnot i have no idea how their minds work when they are involved with their craft so i will never be clear on what thought process led goblin to make his decision but from having known the man most of my life i have to conclude that he did what he did because he believed it was the most effective thing that he could do having failed to skewer the wisp having noted that a second had appeared and had begun to circle him from the opposite direction the frogfaced little man just whirled lowered the head of the lance and charged kina he let out a great mad bellow and drove the weapon through the flesh of an arm and into her ribs below her right breast and just before the weapon struck home one wisp flung itself in front trying to block the thrust the lances head was ablaze when it pierced demonic flesh the second wisp set goblin aflame even screaming telling me to get out goblin continued to heave against the lance driving it deeper into kina possibly in some mad wild hope of penetrating her black heart the blue flame feasted on goblins flesh he let go of the lance threw himself to the icy floor rolled around violently slapping at himself nothing helped he began to melt like an overheated candle he screamed and screamed on that psychic level where i had sensed her moments earlier kina also screamed and screamed and screamed suvrin and santaraksita screamed tobo screamed i screamed and staggered into the stairwell retreating despite the urging of that mad part of me that wanted to go back and help goblin and there could have been no greater madness than that the destroyer ruled the cavern of her imprisonment goblin had struck a fierce blow but in truth its impact was no greater than the nip of a wolf cub at the ear of a dozing tiger i knew that and i knew that the cub caught was trying to buy time for the rest of its pack i gasped tobo go ahead as fast as you can tell the others he was younger he was faster he could get there long before i could he was the future i would try to keep anything from coming up the stair behind him the screaming continued down below from both sources goblin was being more stubborn than ever he had been with oneeye we climbed as fast as master santaraksita could manage i stayed behind the other two already ready to turn and put the unholy pickax between us and any pursuit i was convinced that the power of that talisman would shield us darkness no longer inhabited the stair visibility was much better than it had been when we came down so good in fact that had there been no landings to break up the line of sight we would have been able to look up the stairs for a mile i was gasping for breath and fighting leg cramps before the screaming stopped suvrin had collapsed once already losing what little his stomach contained master santaraksita seemed the hardiest of us now without a complaint to his name though he was so pale i feared his heart would betray him before long as we fought for breath i stared downward listening to the ominous silence god is great gasp there is no god but god gasp in mercy he is like the earth gasp he walks with us in all our hours gasp o lord of creation i acknowledge that i am your child master santaraksita had enough spare breath to chide hes going to get bored and find something else to do if you dont get to the point dorabee hows this gasp help better much better suvrin get up the white crow arrowed up the stairwell nearly bowled me over landing on my shoulder i did make the process more difficult by trying to duck the arriving bird it lashed my face with flapping wings climb it said slowly without panic steadily i will watch behind you we climbed for five or ten days hunger nagged me terror and lack of sleep made me see things that were not there i did not look back for fear of seeing something terrible closing in we moved slower and slower as the effort devoured our energies and will and our capacity for recovery it became a major trek and an act of ultimate will to climb from one landing to the next then we began resting between landings though neither suvrin nor santaraksita ever suggested it the crow told me stop and sleep no one argued there are limits to how far and hard terror can drive anyone we found ours i collapsed so fast i later claimed i heard my first snore before i hit the stone of the landing i was only vaguely aware of the crow launching itself into the darkness headed downward again sleepy my soul wanted to leap up and flail around in terror my flesh was incapable and quite possibly indifferent i was so stiff and i hurt so much that i just could not move my mind still worked fine it ran as sparkling swift as a mountain stream huh i continued trying to get the muscles unlocked easy its willow just open your eyes youre safe whatre you doing way down here way down where uh youre one landing downstairs from the cave of the ancients i kept trying to get up muscle by muscle my body gradually yielded to my will i looked around vision foggy suvrin and master santaraksita were still asleep swan said they were tired guaranteed i heard you snoring all the way up in the cave twinge of fear wheres tobo he went on up top everyone went i made them go i stayed in case the crow told me not to come down but whats one landing you think you can get moving again i cant carry anybody i can barely keep going myself i can manage one flight up to the cave thats far enough for now the cave i still have something to do there are you sure you want to go out of your way im sure willow i could tell him it was a matter of life or death for a whole world or maybe for multiple worlds but why be melodramatic can you get these two moving again and headed toward the top i did not think master santaraksita could bear seeing what i intended to do next ill get them moving but im sticking with you that wont be necessary yes it will you can hardly stand up ill work it out you go right ahead and talk itll get the kinks out of your jaw but im staying i stared at him hard for some time he did not back down neither did he betray any motive but concern for a brother he suspected of failing to be in her right mind i closed my eyes for half a minute then opened them to peer down the stairs god was listening swan was working on suvrin the shadowlander officer had his eyes open but seemed unable to move he murmured i must be alive otherwise i wouldnt hurt so much panic flooded his eyes did we get away i said were getting away weve still got a long way to climb goblins dead swan said the crow told me when it came up to get something to eat where is that thing down there watching i felt a chill paranoia touched me there had been a connection between lady and kina ever since narayan singh and kina had used lady as a vessel to produce the daughter of night that had created a connection a connection lady had hammered into place cleverly unbreakably so that she could steal power from the goddess indefinitely forgive me o lord drive these infidel thoughts from my heart swan said huh nothing part of the ongoing dialog between me and my god suvrin sweety you ready to do some jumping jacks suvrin offered me an oldfashioned stormcloud glower smack her swan at a time like this cheerful ought to be against the laws of heaven and earth youll be cheerful in a minute too as soon as you figure out that youre still alive humph he began to help swan waken master santaraksita upright now i did a few small exercises to loosen up even more ah dorabee santaraksita said softly i have survived another adventure with you ive got god on my side excellent do keep him there i dont think i can survive another of your adventures without divine assistance youll outlive me sri perhaps probably if i do get out of this and i dont tempt fate ever again you youll probably graduate to snakedancing with cobras sri ive decided i dont want to be an adventurer anymore dorabee im too old for it its time to wrap myself up in a cozy library again this just hurts too much ow young man swan grinned he was not that much younger than the librarian lets get going oldtimer you keep lying around here and whatever adventure you found down there is going to catch up and have you all over again a possibility that posed a fine motivation for us all when we finally got moving again i brought up the rear swan wrangled my companions i gripped the golden pickax so tightly my knuckles ached goblin was dead that did not seem possible goblin was a fixture a permanent fixture a cornerstone without its goblin there could be no black company you are mad sleepy the family will not cease to exist simply because one member unexpectedly has been plucked out by evil fortune life would not end because of goblins absence it would just get a lot harder i seemed to hear goblin whisper he is the future sleepy snap out of it huh swan said were at the cave you two keep climbing well catch up with you suvrin started to ask i shook my head pointed upward go now and dont look back i waited until i saw suvrin actually guide master santaraksita over the tumbled stones and onto the stairs well catch up whats that swan asked he cupped an ear i dont hear anything he shrugged its gone now something from upstairs we entered the cavern of the ancients the wonder had been polished off it by the trampling about of a horde of company people i was amazed that they had managed without damaging any more of the sleepers as it was almost all the wondrous ice webbing and cocooning had broken up and collapsed a few stalactites had fallen from the ceiling how did that happen swan frowned during the earthquake earthquake what earthquake you didnt there was one hell of a shake i cant say exactly how long ago probably when you were all the way down its hard to tell time in here no lie oh yuck i had discovered why the white crow had all that energy it had been dining on one of my dead brothers some evil part of me tossed up the thought that i could follow the birds example another part wondered what would happen if croaker found out that man was obsessed with the holy state of company brotherhood you never know what youll do until youre in the ring with the bull do you what a proverb from back home means that actually facing the reality is never quite like preparing to face the reality you never really know what youll do until you get there i passed the rest of the captured not meeting any open eyes i wondered if they could hear i offered up some reassurances that sounded feeble even to me the cavern shrank when it came time to get down and crawl i crawled i told swan maybe its good you being here after all im starting to have little dizzy spells you hear anything i listened this time i did hear something sounds like somebody singing a marching song something full of yohohos what the devil down here we have dwarfs too dwarfs mythical creatures like short people with big beards and permanent bad tempers they lived underground like nagas only supposedly big on mining and metalworking if they ever did exist they died out a long time ago the singing was getting louder lets get this handled before somebody interrupts the pessimist in me was sure i would not be able to pull it off if nothing else the earthquake swan mentioned would in some way have sealed the chamber of unholy books off from the rest of the world if the chamber was not sealed off then i would trip the only booby trap that goblin had overlooked if goblin had not overlooked any booby traps then the pickax would not be a protective key it would be a trigger igniting the thousand secret sorceries protecting the books sleepy do you know you talk to yourself when youre worried about stuff what youre crawling along there muttering about all the bad things thatre going to happen you keep on and youre going to convince me that was twice i had to get that under control i did not use to do that the place where the books of the dead were hidden had not changed visibly the pessimist in me worked hard to find a dangerous difference though swan finally asked are you going to study on it till we pass out from hunger or are you going to go ahead and do something i always was a better planner than a doer willow i sucked in a peck of frigid air took the pickax out of my waistband intoned o lord of heaven and earth let there be no password that has to go with this right behind you boss swan said making a joke as he nudged me forward dont be shy now of course not that would belittle goblins sacrifice and memory i realized that my breathing had turned to rapid shallow panting as i reached the point where master santaraksita had achieved flight i held the pick in front of me with both hands muscles protesting its weight squeezing it so tight i feared i would leave my fingerprints etched upon it permanently a tingling began in my hands it crept up my arms as i eased forward my skin crawled and i developed severe goose bumps i said youd better hold onto me willow in case i needed yanking back in case you need the connection to the pick the shield was not rejecting me not yet swan rested his hands on my shoulders an instant before the tingling reached my body i began to shiver suddenly i had the chills and shakes of an autumn sickness woo swan said this feels weird it gets weirder i promised ive got one of those agues where the chill goes all the way to the marrow uh yeah im getting there too toss in some joint aches too come on lets get that fire started and warm ourselves would fire be enough once we moved forward another ten feet the miseries stopped getting worse the tingling on the outside faded i told swan i think its safe to let go now you should have seen your hair it started dancing around when we were halfway through it lasted only a couple of steps but it was a sight ill bet my hair was a sight anyway usually i did not offer it nearly enough attention and i had not had it trimmed in months got anything to start a fire with you dont you didnt prepare for this you knew it had to be done and you didnt bring all right well use mine i just dont have much tinder left didnt want to use mine up when i could use yours thanks a lot youre getting as bad as those two nasty old men chagrined he recalled that one of the nasty old men he meant had just completed his tenure with the company i learned from the best listen ive been thinking about this even if we are past all the traps the books themselves might be dangerous considering the way the brains of wizards work its probably not a smart thing to peek inside at the pages one look at the writings and youre likely to spend the rest of your life standing there reading even if you dont recognize a word out loud i recall reading about a spell that worked that way once so what do we do you notice that all three books are open well have to come at them from underneath and tip the covers shut so that they end up facedown even then we might want to handle them with our eyes shut when we go burn them ive read about grimoires that had rakshasas bound into their covers although nothing as exciting as that ever turned up in the library where i had worked a talking book that can read itself to me thats what i need i thought soulcatcher made you learn how to read when you were the king of the greys she did that dont mean i want to read reading is bloody hard work i thought managing a brewery was hard work you never shied away from that being shorter i took the job of sneaking up on the three lecterns i used extreme caution they might have been great actors but i was soon convinced that they could not see me coming i like making beer i dont like reading he should have been the one getting ready to burn books then i was suffering a crisis of conscience as troublesome as any of my crises of faith i loved books i believed in books as a rule i did not believe in destroying books because their contents were disagreeable but these books contained the dark secret patterns for bringing on the end of the world the end of many worlds actually for if the year of the skulls successfully sacrificed my world others connected to the glittering plain must follow this was not a crisis that needed immediate resolution i had my answers worked out already which was why i was on hands and knees under the lecterns while suffering verbal abuse from an infidel who had no use for my god or for the deceivers merciless destroyer i tipped the covers of the books shut while wondering if there was still some way the children of night could get to me the covers appear to be blank swan said youre looking at the backs of the books im closing them so theyre facedown remember hold it he held up a finger cocked an ear echoes uhm somebodys out there i listened harder singing again i wish they wouldnt sing nobody in the band but sahra can carry a tune in a bucket with a lid on it you can come on up here now i think its safe you think im still alive i dont know if thats necessarily a recommendation youre too sour and bitter for the monsters to eat i on the other hand you on the other hand are plain lucky that my god forbids me to reveal that the only thing interested in eating you would be the kind of beetle that flourishes on a diet of livestock byproduct right there looks like a good place to start a fire swan was up beside me now there was some kind of large brazierlooking thing that still had a few charcoal remnants in it it was made of hammered brass in a style common to most of the cultures of this end of the world you want me to tear a few pages out for tinder no i dont want you to tear pages out werent you listening when i told you the books might make you want to read them i was listening sometimes i dont hear very well though like most of the human race i was prepared in minutes i had a small fire burning i lifted one of the books carefully making sure it faced away from swan and me i fanned its pages out slightly and set it down in the flames spine upward i burned the last volume first just in case something might interfere i wanted the first volume destroyed to be one the daughter of night had not yet seen the first book which she had copied parts of several times and might have partially memorized i would burn last the book caught fire eventually but did not burn well it produced a nastysmelling dark smoke that filled the cavern and forced swan and me to get down on our stomachs on the icy floor the underground wind did carry some of the smoke away the rest was no longer overwhelming when i consigned the second book to the flames while waiting to add the final book to the fire i brooded about why kina was doing nothing to resist this blow to her hopes for resurrection i could only pray that goblins sacrifice had hurt her so badly she could not look outside herself yet i could only pray that i was not a victim of some grand deceit maybe these books were decoys maybe i was doing exactly what kina had planned for me to do there were doubts always youre muttering to yourself again uhn i possessed not so much as the faintest hope that goblins death had put kina out of the misery of the world permanently this feels so nice i said i could go to sleep right here and i did so promptly good old willows sense of duty or selfpreservation or something kept him going he got the last book of the dead into the fire for me before he too settled down for a nap the singing soldiers proved to be runmust iqbal and riverwalker they had come to rescue the rest of us when tobo reached them with news of the disaster that had befallen us down below they had found us by following the smoke at the risk of finding myself goaded into employing unseemly language how is it that i find anyone singing how is it that you havent taken the road to the land of the unknown shadows i believe i was pretty insistent on the necessity for that runmust and iqbal giggled like they were younger than tobo and knew a dirty joke riverwalker managed to maintain a more sober demeanor barely youre tired and hungry so we dont blame you for being cranky sleepy lets do something about that settle down and have a snack he could not restrain a big goofy grin as he rummaged in his pack i exchanged glances with swan i asked you have any clue whats going on here maybe theres a stage of starvation where you get lightheaded and silly i suppose jaicur could have been an exception riverwalker produced something the shape and color of a puffball mushroom but a good eight inches in diameter it looked heavier than a mushroom that size ought to be what the hell is that swan asked river had several more in his pack and his henchmen had brought packs too riverwalker produced a knife and began slicing a gift from our demon friend shivetya evidently after a day of reflection he decided we deserved a payoff for saving his big ugly ass eat he offered me an end slice an inch thick youll like it swan started eating before i did i had an ounce of paranoia left he leaned my way tastes like pork hehhehheh then he had no time for joking he began wolfing the material which looked exactly the same all the way through it had a heavy almost cheesy texture when i surrendered to the inevitable and bit into it my salivary system responded with a flood the experience of taste was so sharp it was almost painful there was nothing comparable in my memory a touch of ginger a touch of cinnamon lemons sweetness the scent of candied violets after the first shock a sense of wellbeing gradually spread outward from my mouth and again from my stomach soon after the first mouthfuls hit bottom more swan said riverwalker surrendered another slice more i agreed and bit into another slice myself it might be poison but if it was it was the sweetest poison god ever permitted shivetya really gave you this about a ton almost literally fit for man and beast even the baby likes it iqbal and runmust found that news hilarious swan snickered too though he could not possibly have any idea what the joke might be in fact i found that assertion rather amusing myself heck everything was amusing i had begun to feel relaxed and confident my aches and pains no longer formed the center of my consciousness they had become mere annoyances way out on the edge of awareness continue iqbal squealed he grew them these nasty lumps developed all over him like bigass boils only when they popped out came these things under more normal circumstances that idea and the images it engendered would have seemed repulsive i grunted took another wonderful mouthful pictured the creation process caught myself in the midst of a fit of giggles i regained control though that took an effort so it finally decided to communicate sort of when we left it was trying to manage some kind of dialog with doj it didnt seem to be working all that well though swan sighed i havent felt this relaxed and positive since cordy and i used to go fishing when we were kids thiss the way we felt lying beside the creek in the shade never really caring if we got a bite while we shared our daydreams or just watched clouds scoot overhead even the recollection of his friends fate did not break his mood entirely i understood what he was trying to communicate even though i had had no special friend with whom to share the rare golden moments of childhood i had had no childhood i felt really good myself i said this whateveritis is great stuff river you seen any side effects yet its damned near impossible to stop yourself if you get the giggles ill try not to get started wow i feel like i could whip twice my weight in wolves right now why dont we get going nobody took the opportunity to mention that me whipping twice my weight in wolves might entail me fighting only the back half of one of the monsters iqbal and runmust continued to giggle over some shared joke of long ago boys i said pointing that way dont touch anything keep going were going to go back upstairs dang me i kept getting silly ideas and every one of them made me want to start laughing riverwalker told me we found out that if we sing it helps us keep our minds on business a big grin spread across his face he began humming one of the filthier marching songs it concerned the business that seems to be on the minds of most men most of the time i hummed along and got everybody started moving foulsmelling smoke from roasted books filled the cavern it seemed even stronger in the stairwell some of it drifted downward kina was not yet aware i was sure she would have done something if she had known but she would not remain ignorant forever i hoped we could get ourselves well on the road before she recovered enough to assimulate the truth her dreams were deadly enough i settled my behind onto the rise in the floor near the entrance to the stairwell i sat there dully wondering why the excavation had been started way out here on the periphery i did not concern myself about it much though i ate again this stuff could get addictive and not because it made me feel happy and silly but because it took away aches and pains and every inclination to sleep i could sit there knowing my body was at its physical limits without having to endure all the suffering associated with that state and my mind remained particularly alert and useful because i was not preoccupied with the miseries plaguing my flesh swan grunted his agreement he did not seem to have been rendered as cheerful as the rest of us although come to think of it i was not doing much whistling or singing myself my mood improved after i had eaten again though in one of his more lucid moments riverwalker suggested we shouldnt waste any more time than we have to sleepy the rest should all be gone by now but they went away hoping that you and the standard would catch up if tobo hasnt already told them ive got some bad news about that the boy said nothing about the standard he may not have had a chance everybody was so shocked about goblin and so worried about how to keep oneeye from finding out goblin drove the lance into kinas body its still there you know me im completely hooked by the company mystique i believe that besides the annals the standard is the most important symbol we have it goes all the way back to khatovar it ties the generations together id understand if somebody wanted to go back after it but that somebody isnt going to be me not in this decade that good feeling was moving through me again i rose swan helped me step up to the higher floor level hello riverwalker chuckled i wondered how long it would take you to notice the crack in the floor was almost gone i went and looked it seemed to be as deep as ever but now was nowhere more than a foot wide how did it heal so fast i assumed our presence had been a catalyst glancing around the crack toward the demons throne i noticed doj and tobo hurrying our way shivetyas eyes were open he was watching i thought you said everybody had left the earthquake did it river ignored the presence of doj and tobo swan said its the latest thing in home repairs go down there and stab that thing again maybe the plain will heal up completely might get the clockwork running again doj said having overheard our conversation as he arrived clockwork doj did a little hop this floor is a huge circle its a oneeightiethscale representation of the plain as a whole with a complete travel chart inlaid it rides on stone rollers and was capable of turning before the thousand voices got curious and broke it interesting i take it your chat with the demon proceeded informatively doj grunted assent but slowly that was the big problem just figuring out that communication has to be managed very slowly i think that would carry over physically too that if he decided to stand up if he could it might take hours but as the steadfast guardian he never had to move fast he controlled the whole plain from here using the charts in the floors and the clockwork mechanisms never had i seen doj so straightforward and animated the knowledge bug must have bitten him along with its kissing cousin that makes the newly illuminated want to share with everyone and that was not like doj at all nor like any other nyueng bao of my experience only mother gota and tobo ever chattered and between them they revealed less than uncle doj on a particularly reticent day doj continued he says his original reason for being created was to manage the machinery that saw that travelers got where they wanted to go over time there were battles upon the plain wars between the worlds this fortress was built around him and at every stage he was saddled with additional duties sleepy the creature is half as old as time itself he actually witnessed the battle between kina and the demons when the lords of light fought the lords of darkness it was the first great war between the worlds it did take place here on the plain and none of the myths have got it close to right that was interesting and i said so but i refused to allow the pasts allure to seduce me right now i must confess a grand temptation to create a permanent camp here doj enthused it will take lifetimes to recover and record everything hes seen so much he remembers the children of the dead sleepy to him the passing of the nyueng bao de duang happened just yesterday we need only to keep him convinced that we should have his help i looked questions at each of my companions riverwalker finally volunteered hes got to have been stuffing himself with the demon food meaning he thought doj was out of character a few leagues too several others also went through big changes when they overindulged that much i understood already tobo have you undergone a complete character shift too he had not said a word that was remarkable he had an opinion about everything he scared the crap out of me sleepy he who the demon the monster shivetya he looked inside my head he talked to me there i think he did it to my father too for years and years maybe in the annals when dad thought kina or the protector were manipulating him im betting that lots of times it was really shivetya that could be that really could be the world is infested with superhuman things that toy with the destinies of individuals and nations gunni priests have been claiming that for a hundred generations the gods were banging elbows with each other stirring the cauldron but none of those gods were my god the true god the almighty who seemed to have elected to elevate himself above the fray i needed the solace of my kind of priest and there were none nearer than five hundred miles how many stories are there about this place i asked doj and how many of them are true i suspect we havent yet heard one out of ten the old swordmaster replied he grinned he was enjoying himself and i wouldnt be surprised if most of them are true can you sense it this fortress this plain theyre many things at the same time until recently i believed it had to be the land of unknown shadows as your captain believed that it had to be khatovar but its only a pathway to other places and shivetya the steadfast guardian is many things too including i think infinitely weary of being everything that hes had to be tobo was so anxious to interject his own thoughts that he danced around like a little boy with a desperate need to pee he announced shivetya wants to die sleepy but he cant not as long as kina is still alive and shes immortal hes got a problem then doesnt he swan had an idea he could divide up that life span and offer it to us id take him up on it i could use another couple thousand years after i get away from this kind of life i moved us closer to the demon as we talked my natural pessimism and sourness evidently reasserted itself though i never stopped feeling younger and happier and more energetic than i had for ages i just stopped giggling with the rest of them i asked wheres your mother tobo his good humor waned momentarily she went with granny gota a glance at doj made me suspect that there had been a sharp encounter between sahra the mother and men willing to accept her son as one of them this was nyueng bao stubbornness again from two directions on this one the troll must have sided with her grandson and doj i changed the subject all right you two claim youve been in shivetyas mind or maybe hes been in yours whichever tell me what he wants i did not believe the demon was being helpful out of the goodness of his ancient heart he could not be he was a demon accursed of god whether he was a creature of light or of shadow to a demon we adventurers had to be as brief and transient as individual honeybees would be to us though like the bees we might be able to make ourselves obnoxious for a short while doj said he wants what anyone in his position would want that seems obvious tobo interjected he also wants loose sleepy hes been pinned that way for a long time the plain keeps changing because he cant get out to stop anybody whats he going to do if we pluck the daggers out of his limbs will he go on being our pal or will he start busting heads doj and tobo exchanged uncertain glances so they had not spent much time worrying about that i said i see well he may be the sweetest guy on gods green earth but he stays right where he is for now a few weeks or months more shouldnt make much difference to him how the heck did he manage to get himself nailed to his chair somebody tricked him tobo said surprise surprise you think so it seemed there was a lot more light now than there had been when i was headed in the other direction with swan or maybe my eyes had adapted to the interior of the fortress i could make out the designs in the floor clearly all the features of the plain could be found there except for the standing stones with their glittering gold characters and those might have been represented by certain shadowy discolorations i was unable to examine more closely there were even tiny points that seemed to be moving which almost certainly meant something if one knew how to read them shivetyas throne rested atop a circular elevation positioned at the heart of an intermediate raised circle just over twenty yards across doj assured me that that was roughly oneeightieth the diameter of the biggest circle and that that was an eightieth of the diameter of the entire plain the smaller circle i noted also boasted its representation of the plain in much less obvious detail presumably shivetya could sit his throne and turning could see the whole of his kingdom if he needed more information he could step down to the next level where everything was portrayed in a scale eighty times finer the implications of the quality of the magical engineering involved in creating all this began to seep through i was intimidated thoroughly the builders must have been of godlike power they had to have been as far beyond the greatest wizards known to me as those were beyond notalents like me i was sure that lady and longshadow soulcatcher and howler would have little more grasp of the forces and principles involved than i did i stepped in front of shivetya the demons eyes remained open i felt him touch me lightly inside for some reason my thoughts turned to mountainous highlands and places where the snow never melted to old things slow things to silence and stone my brain had no better way of interpreting the actuality of what shivetya was i kept reminding myself that the demon antedated the oldest history of my world and i sensed what tobo had mentioned shivetyas quiet calm desire not to grow any older he had a very gunni sort of desire to find his way into a nirvana as an antidote to the infinite tedium and pain of being i tried talking to the demon i tried exchanging thoughts that was a frightening experience even though i was filled with the confidence and good feeling that came from the gift food shivetya had provided i did not want to share my mind even with an immortal golem who could not possibly have any genuine comprehension of the things it contained or of why those troubled me so sleepy huh i jumped up i felt good enough to do that i felt as good as i should have back in my teens had i never had a need to feel sorry for myself the healing properties of the demons gift continued to work their magic swan said we all fell asleep i dont know for how long i dont even know how i looked at the demon it had not moved no surprise there but the white crow was perched on its shoulder as soon as it recognized that i was alert it launched itself toward me i threw up an arm the bird settled on my wrist as though i were a falconer in a voice almost too slow to follow it said this will be my voice it is trained and its mind is not cluttered with thoughts and beliefs that will get in the way marvelous i wondered what lady would think if shivetya took over she would be deaf and blind until we brought her back from her enchanted sleep this will be my voice now i understood the repetition to be a response to my flutter of unspoken curiosity i understand i will aid you in your quest in return you will destroy the drin kina then you will release me i understood that he meant for me to release him from life and obligation not just from that throne i would if i had the power you have the power you have always had the power what does that mean i recognized a cryptic sorcerertype pronouncement when i heard one you will understand when it is time to understand now it is time for you to depart stone soldier go become deathwalker what the devil does that mean i squeaked so did several of my companions all of whom were awake now and most of whom were gobbling demon food while eavesdropping the floor started moving at first almost imperceptibly quickly i noted that only the part immediately around the throne that had healed itself completely was involved i now knew that all the damage including the earthquake so violent it had been felt as far away as taglios had been initiated entirely by soulcatcher during an illconceived experiment she had discovered the machinery and in her willful damntheconsequences way had begun tinkering just to see what would happen i knew that as fully as if i had been there as an eyewitness because an actual eyewitness had given me his memories i knew everything soulcatcher had done during her several visits to the fortress in a time when longshadow believed he was the total master of the shadowgate and did not believe that others would dare approach it even if they did possess a workable key i now knew many things as if i had lived them some were things i was not eager to know a few concerned questions i had had for years offering answers that i could share with master santaraksita but mostly it was just stuff i was likely to find useful if i was going to become what shivetya hoped i would a startled bluebottle of speculation buzzed through my mind i checked to see if i had an answer but i had no memories of what might have become of the key that would have been necessary if indeed longshadow as maricha manthara dhumraksha with his student ashutosh yaksha had come to our world from the land of unknown shadows and for sure i did not get any relief from my fear of heights an instant after the floor stopped turning the white crow launched itself upward and darned if i did not launch myself right after it though not through any wish of my own my companions rose behind me in their surprise and fright several dropped weapons and possessions and probably body contents only tobo seemed to find unanticipated flight to be a positive experience runmust and iqbal sealed their eyes and belched rapid prayers to their false vision of god i spoke my mind to the god who is god reminding him to be merciful riverwalker addressed impassioned appeals to his heathen deities doj and swan said nothing at all swan because he had fainted tobo babbled in delight informing everyone how wonderful the experience was look here look there the vast expanse of the chamber stretches out below us like the plain itself we passed through a hole in the ceiling and into the colder air of the real plain it was dusk out there the sky still crimson over the western horizon but already deep indigo directly ahead the stars of the noose shone palely in front of us as we descended toward the surface i found nerve enough to glance back the fortress stood silhouetted against the northern sky on its outside in worse shape now than when we had arrived all our clutter everything dropped during our ascension or that we had had no time to grab now flew along right behind us for a while i watched eagerly for the standard to join the flock my hopes were disappointed it did not appear in retrospect i cannot see why i should have hoped otherwise now tobo pretended he was a bird by experimenting he discovered that he could use his arms to direct his flight to rise and fall somewhat to speed up and slow down slightly he never shut up for a instant loving every moment continuously admonishing the rest of us to enjoy the adventure because none of us would ever have the chance to experience anything like this again wisdom from the mouths of infants doj announced then he threw up they were both right our flight ended where the rest of the band was camped at the last circle before the southwest road reached our destination shadowgate flying definitely offered the advantage of speed we outflew the white crow arriving less than two hours after our toes departed solid stone that shivetya fellow was a handy friend to have i tried to see what lay beyond the edge of the plain but it was just too dark there might have been one or two small points of light out there it was hard to tell we descended feetfirst evidently immune to shadows i had sensed several of those pacing us but they had shown no inclination to get too close which left me admiring shivetyas power even more for those things were little more than bundles of hatred and hunger to kill we passed through the top of the shielding protecting our brethren without compromising it the whole band watched our arrival in disbelief tobo managed to direct himself toward his mother and accomplished a somersault before he touched down i did not exactly get down and hug the stone surface but i was glad the ordeal was over the singh brothers rushed around looking for family so did doj who ignored sahra and went directly to gota gota was not in good spirits and possibly was in ill health i could not tell much more about anyone in the feeble light available from a changeable moon gota did not offer any complaint or criticism swan stuck with me as soon as he convinced himself that it was safe to open his eyes riverwalker began bustling around being a busybody devoutly determined to make sure everyone and everything conformed to whatever rules he happened to recall at the moment i frowned shook my head but did not interfere we all need our rituals to help us get by sahra i asked how are they i meant those we had brought out of the caverns because i had a suspicion that gotas state meant nothing good and i did not want to hear what i feared it did mean sahra could not feel friendly she blamed me because she had discovered her baby strolling through the sky never mind that he had come down safely and could not stop raving about the experience what a fall from a great height might do to a body never occurred to him but it certainly did to sahra no change in the captured oneeye went into a funk when he heard about goblin and hasnt spoken since mother isnt sure if its emotional withdrawal or he had another stroke what worries her is the possibility that he doesnt want to live anymore who would he fight with i did not mean to belittle though it came out sounding that way sahra showed me an instant of pique but did not reveal her thoughts mother can be a handful probably what got them together in the first place i made no mention of the fact that i feared gota would not be with us much longer the troll had to be around eighty ill go talk to him hes asleep it can wait in the morning then are we still in touch with murgen the light was good enough to reveal sahras anger perhaps she was right i had not had my feet on the ground two minutes and already i wanted to use her husband but she managed the emotion we had worked together for a long time now early on with her usually being the stronger one only occasionally with me taking the lead role we always managed without sharp words we always managed because we knew we had somewhere to go and we had to collaborate to get there these days i took charge most of the time but she could do so when it was appropriate only she was just about where she wanted to get to now was she not she had murgen out of the ground she would not need to go on with her role once he was up and around unless he was not the man she wanted him to be in which case she would have to contrive a new sahra all over again i am sure that had her on edge more than ever neither she nor murgen were the people they had been none of us were there were going to be some difficulties adjusting possibly some major difficulties i anticipated big problems with lady and the captain sahra said ive done my best to keep the mist projector working but i havent been able to make contact since we left that fortress he doesnt seem to be willing to leave his body anymore and i cant get that to wake up more than it already is so she was also afraid that the rescue might have been a mistake that we might have hurt murgen instead of saving him upbeat hopefully she said maybe tobo can help i wondered what had become of the tough focused dedicated sahra who had been minh subredil i tried to reassure this sahra murgen will be fine shivetya had given me the knowledge we needed to reanimate the captured but we have to get him off the plain before we can wake him all the way up same for the others riverwalker returned from his tour the demon food is going fast here sleepy theres enough to get us off the plain and have a couple meals more but then were on our own we either eat the dog and the horses or we scrounge up something locally fast ah well we knew that going in were better off than we expected to be did anybody think to steal anything valuable while we were there that comment got me blank looks then i realized that it was possible no one else had noticed the treasures i had discovered while chasing tobo into the deeps of the earth the boy would have said something if he had seen anything he could not shut up swan told me itll be harvest time when we get there what he shrugged i just know so he might everybody listen up get all the rest you can tonight i want to get up and move out early tomorrow and nobody knows what well run into at the end of the road somebody grumbled something about if i wanted him to sleep why did i not shut up and let him get to work i could not keep my eyes open myself although it had not been that long since i had wakened by shivetyas throne in fact my mind seemed to be shutting down i said forget everything else im going to take my own advice wheres a place i can wrap my blanket around me and lie down before i collapse the only open space was back at the tail end of the company all my flying companions except tobo had to migrate back there i had planned to eat before i slept but exhaustion overwhelmed me before i swallowed my third bite of demons food my final reflection concerned whether god could overlook one of the faithful accepting a gift from one of the damned an interesting exercise god knows all therefore god knew what shivetya was doing and allowed him to do it therefore it must be gods will that we benefit from the demons generosity it would be a sin to defy gods will i dreamed strange dreams of course i did was not shivetya in my mind was i not in the haunted place of glittering stone stone remembered and stone wanted me to know i was in another place then in a time not my own i was shivetya as the demon experienced the world everywhere at once a pale imitation of god i could be everywhere at once because by staring at the floor surrounding my throne i connected with my realm as a whole we became one knowledge the singer and the song men were moving across my face a large band i knew time differently from mortals but i understood that it had been ages since this had happened last mortals did not cross me anymore not often never in numbers like this there was enough sleepy there for me to recognize shivetyas memory of the coming of the captured before they stumbled into soulcatchers trap why would the demon want me to see this i knew this story murgen had shared it with me several times to make sure it got recorded in the annals just the way he wanted there was no solid feeling of a personality surrounding me yet i felt a mild pressure to abandon curiosity to turn outward from questions to cease being a viewpoint to let the flower unfold i should have paid more attention to uncle doj the ability to abandon the self would have been a useful talent at a time like this time was different for the demon definitely but he tried to accommodate the ephemeral mortal to get to the point to provide the information he thought i would find useful i watched the whole adventure including the great and desperate escape that had devoured bucket and had allowed willow the chance to remain in the story as a pawn of wickedness and i did not understand immediately because at first i observed only the finer details of a story already known in outline i was not completely stupid i caught on the question had occurred to me before but had not been critical now i just needed to reclaim enough self to recall that i had asked it the question was what had become of the one member of that expedition for whom there was still no account the incredibly dangerous apprentice shapeshifter lisa deale bowalk trapped in the form of a black leopard had been carried onto the plain in a cage as had the prisoners longshadow and howler she had vanished during the excitement murgen never discovered what had become of her that he mentioned i learned the truth according to shivetya not every trivial detail became entirely clear shivetya had trouble focusing that tightly in time but it seemed that bowalks cage had gotten damaged in the panicky rush to escape by brothers of the company unfortunate enough not to be included amongst the captured panic mothers panic the great wicked cat caught the fever her violence was sufficient to complete the demolition of her cage she ripped her way out injuring herself in the process she fled on three legs carrying her left front paw elevated allowing it to touch stone only when absolutely necessary she whined horribly when she did nevertheless she covered ground fast she traveled nearly thirty miles before nightfall but had chosen a direction at random and apparently did not recognize that she was not headed toward home until it was too late to change her mind she chose a road and ran and in the night one small clever shadow caught up just short of the end of that road it did what untamed shadows always do it attacked i found the result difficult to believe the shadow hurt the panther but did not kill her she fought it and won and stumbled onward and before a more powerful shadow could overtake and finish her she staggered through a derelict shadowgate and became invisible to shivetya which meant that she was last seen alive entering a world neither our own nor the land of unknown shadows i hoped that that crippled gate had finished her or that it had injured her beyond recovery because she was possessed of a hatred as dark as that which impelled the shadows but hers was a hatred much more narrowly directed and the company was its object the fragment of sleepyself never entirely subsumed into the shivetya overview wondered what the captain would think when he learned that bowalk had reached khatovar by accident when it was supposed to be impossible for the company to get there by intent the sleepyself did not see why this news was important enough for shivetya to have hijacked my dreams but significant it must be significant too must be the nef the dreamwalkers that murgen had named the washene the washane and the washone i became more shivetya pulling away from the point experience of tracking the shapechanger i became more one with the demon while the demon became more one with the plain more purely a manifestation of the will of the great engine i enjoyed flickers of memories of golden ages of peace prosperity and enlightenment that had reached across silent stone to many worlds i witnessed the passage of a hundred conquerers i saw portions of the most ancient wars now recalled in the gunni and deceiver religions and even in my own for being shivetya and embracing all times at the same time i could not help but see that the war in heaven which was supposed to have occurred soon after god created the earth and the sky and which ended with the adversary being cast down into a pit could be an echo of the same divine struggle other religions remembered according to their own predilections before the war of the gods there was the plain and before the plain there was the nef the plain the great machine eventually imagined shivetya as its steadfast guardian and servant in turn the demon imagined the washene the washane and the washone in the likeness of the nef these dreamwalking ghosts of the builders were shivetyas gods they existed independently of his mind but not of his existence they would perish if he perished and they had had no desire to be called into being in the first instance bizarre i was caught amongst the personifications of aspects of religion in which i could not believe here were facts my faith forbid me to accept acceptance would damn me forever cruel cruel tricks of the adversary i had been gifted with a mind that wanted to explore to find out to know and i had been gifted with faith and now i had been gifted with information that put fact and faith into conflict i had not been gifted with a priests slippery dexterity when it came to reconciling the philosophically irreconcilable but perhaps that was not necessary truth and reality seemed to be protean on the plain there were too many different stories about kina shivetya and the fortress in the middle maybe every story was true at least part of the time there was an intellectual exercise of a sacerdotal magnitude what if my beliefs were completely valid but only part of the time and only where i was located myself what then how could that be what could that mean it meant unpleasant times in the afterlife if i persisted in relaxing my vigilance against heresies it might be difficult for a woman to achieve paradise but it would be no trouble at all for her to win a place in alshiel that must have been one kickass nightmare willow swan told me kneeling beside me having just shaken my shoulder to waken me not only were you snoring you were grunting and squeaking and carrying on a conversation with yourself in three different languages im a woman of many talents everybody says so i shook my head groggily what time is it its still dark another talent emerges i cant get anything past the old girl i grumbled the priests and the holy books tell us that god created man in his own image but ive read a lot of holy books including those of the idolaters and not once have i found any other evidence that he had a sense of humor let alone is the kind of person who would try to make jokes before the sun even came up youre a sick man willow swan whats going on last night you said wed have to start early so sahra thought you meant we should be ready to go as soon as theres light enough to see so we can get off the plain with plenty of daylight to spare sahra is a wise woman wake me up when shes ready to go i think right now would be a good time to get up then i raised my hands it was just light enough to see them gather round people once a reasonable crowd had done so i explained that each of us who had stayed behind in the fortress had been given knowledge that would help us in times to come shivetya seems very interested in our success he tried to give us what he believed would be useful tools but hes very slow and has his own demonic perspectives and doesnt know how to explain anything clearly so its extremely likely that there is a lot we know that we wont know we know until something makes us think of it be patient with us well probably be a little strange for a while im having trouble getting used to the reeducated me and i live here new knowledge pops up every time i turn around right now though i just want to get off this plain our resources are still limited we have to establish ourselves as fast as we can those faces i could discern revealed fear of the future somewhere the dog whined iqbals baby whimpered momentarily as suruvhija shifted her from one nipple to the other in my consideration that child ought to have been weaned by now but i knew i had no justification for my opinion none of my babies have been born yet and it is getting a little late to bring them in people waited for me to tell them something informative the more thoughtful now wondered what new troubles awaited us since we had actually made it this far swan could be right it could be harvest season in the land of unknown shadows and it could also be the season for scalping foreigners i was troubled myself but had been faced with the unknown so often that i had calluses on that breed of fear i knew perfectly well it would do me no good to fuss and worry when i had no idea what lay ahead but worry i would anyway even when knowledge contracted while i slept assured me that we would not encounter disasters once we shifted off the plain i had planned to offer a rousing speech but quickly discarded that notion no one was interested not even me is everybody ready then lets go getting started took less time than i expected most of my brothers had not stopped to hear me say what they anticipated would be the same old same old they had gone on getting ready to roll i told swan i guess in those days the company works a lot better after supper and a hard days work does for me works even better when ive had something to drink and its a kickass wowser after ive gone to bed i walked with sahra for a while renewing our acquaintance easing the strain between us she remained tense though it would not be that long before she had to deal with her husband in the flesh for the first time in a decade and a half i did not know how to make that easier for her then i walked with the radisha for an hour she too was in an unsettled mood it had been even longer since she had had to deal with her brother in all but the most remote capacities she was a realist however theres nothing i can lose to him is there ive lost it all already first to the protector through my own blindness then you stole me away from taglios and robbed me of even the hope of reclaiming my place bet you something princess bet you that youre already being remembered as the mother of a golden age that actually seemed a reasonable prediction the past always seems better when the present consists of clabbered misery even without the protector back in the capital yet once were established the first mission i mean to launch will be to get word back to taglios that you and your brother are both alive youre really angry and youre going to come back we all must dream the woman told me you dont want to go back do you recall the taunt you laid before me every day rajadharma sure what i may want is of no importance what my brother might want does not signify either hes had his adventures now ive had mine rajadharma constrains us more surely than could the stoutest chain rajadharma will call us back across the uncounted leagues as long as we continue to breathe through the impossible places past all the deadly perils and improbable beings you reminded me again and again of my obligation perhaps by doing so you created a monster fit to battle the beast who displaced me rajadharma has become my vice sleepy it has become my irrational compulsion i continue to follow you only because reason insists that even though this path leads me farther from taglios today it is the shortest road to my destiny ill help where i can i did not commit the company though i still had the captain and lieutenant to waken and deal with i started to move on i wanted to visit with master santaraksita for a while and lose myself perhaps in an interplay of intellectual speculation the librarians horizons were much broader these days sleepy radisha has the black company extracted sufficient revenge we had taken away everything but the love of her people and she was not a bad woman in my eyes youre just one small gesture short of redemption i want you to apologize to the captain once he recovers enough to understand whats happening her lips tightened she and her brother did not let themselves be slaves to considerations of station or caste but still apology to a foreign mercenary if i must i must my options are limited water sleeps radisha i joined suvrin and master santaraksita taking a few minutes to visit with the black stallion on the way there it carried oneeye who was breathing but otherwise did not look much better than a corpse i hoped he was just sleeping an old mans sleep the horse seemed bored i suppose it was tired of adventures master suvrin by some chance do you two suffer any memories you didnt have before we came to the plain they did indeed santaraksita more so than suvrin shivetyas gifts seemed shaped for each individual master santaraksita proceeded to relate yet another version of the kina myth and of shivetyas relationship to the queen of death and terror this one assumed the point of view of the demon it did not say much that was new just shifted the relative importance of various characters and laterally blamed kina for the passing of the last few builders kina remained a blackhearted villain in this version while shivetya became one of the great unsung heroes deserving of a much higher standing in myth which could be true he had no standing at all nobody outside the plain had ever heard of him i suggested when you get back to taglios now master you can establish a mighty reputation by explaining the myths in the words of a being who lived through their creation santaraksita smiled sourly you know better dorabee mythology is one area where nobody wants to know the absolute truth because time has forged great symbols from raw materials supplied by ancient events prosaic distortions of fact metamorphose into perceived truths of the soul he had a point in religion precise truth has almost no currency true believers will kill and destroy to defend their inaccurate beliefs and that is a truth upon which you can rely i raised my head carefully to peer over the edge of the plain at the land of unknown shadows willow swan snaked up on my right he did the same riverwalker copied him on my left river said ill be damned i agreed no doubt about it doj gota come and look will somebody bring oneeye up the little man had started talking about an hour ago he did appear to be in touch with the real world at least part of the time i beckoned the white crow that darned thing was going to give us away if it kept circling to who swan asked i dont see anybody obviously i was thinking out loud again swan weaseled sideways so doj could crawl up beside me doj rose up he froze after fifteen seconds he harrumphed gota said it is the same place we left you got us turned around you fool stone soldier at first glimpse it was identical only look to the right there isnt any overlook and never was and kiaulune isnt the new city i never saw kiaulune before it became shadowcatch but doubted these ruins resembled that old city much either get suvrin he might know i continued to stare the more i did so the more differences stood out doj said it the hand of mankind rested more lightly here and men went away a long time ago it was only the shape of the land that was identical back about the time of the earthquakes you suppose what would have been hardscrabble farmland in my world here looked like better soil that had been abandoned for twenty years it was overgrown by brush and brambles and cedars but no truly sizable trees were yet evident except those that grew in orderly rows and those so distant they painted the foothills of the dandha presh a deep green that was almost black suvrin arrived i offered a few questions he told me it does look like they say kiaulune did before the shadowmasters came when my grandparents were children the city didnt start growing until longshadow decided to build overlook only i dont see anything down there now but ruins look at the shadowgate its in better shape than our own but not in good repair by any standard the quakes had taken their bites you can tell where it is that was a weight off my shoulders i had anticipated fighting starvation while we fussed with strings and colored powders in an effort to survey the only safe pathway through several men carried oneeye up and set him down amongst us they silhouetted themselves above the skyline doing so my grumbling did no good on the other hand no bloodthirsty hordes materialized below the shadowgate so it was possible that we were not yet betrayed oneeye do you sense anything down there i did not know if he would respond he seemed to be asleep again his chin rested on his chest people gave him room because it was in these moments he began to ply his cane after a few seconds though he lifted his chin opened his eyes murmured a place where i can rest the wind that was always with us on the plain almost stole his words away a place where all evil dies an endless death no wickedness stirs down there little girl oneeyes remarks excited everyone who had witnessed his most recent episode half a dozen more men exposed their silhouettes to anyone watching from below still others seemed to think we ought to trudge right on down there in a big disorderly mob right now kendo i called slink i want you each to take six men out through the gate fully armed including bamboo slink take the right side of the road you take the left kendo youll be covering the rest of us as we come out river youre the reserve take ten men and wait just inside the shadowgate youll stay there and become the rear guard if nothing bothers them training and discipline took over a superior standard of both are among the companys most potent tools properly employed they become our deadliest tools we try to inculcate discipline from a recruits first day right alongside a healthy distrust of everyone on the outside we try to pound into his very bones what he needs to do in every situation the slope from the edge of the plain to the shadowgate seemed to stretch for miles i felt bonenaked descending it without the standard tobo carrying the golden pickax had to take my place i told him dont get too fond of the job kid it may be all i have if we get the captain and the lieutenant back and i wont even have that if your dad wants all of his old jobs back experiment quickly proved no key but the pick was needed to leave the plain the shadowgate did tickle and tingle though the first thing i noticed outside was a powerful mixture of sagey and piney smells there had been few odors on the plain then i noticed the incredible warmth this world was much warmer than the plain was it was early autumn here as promised willow as promised kendo and slink kept their squads moving screening our advance more and more people passed through the gate i got myself hoisted onto the black stallion so i could see better which meant that somebody had to carry oneeye i told sahra lets head for those ruins i was about to add something about shelter being easier to find there when kendo cutter shouted i looked where he pointed it took a sharp eye to see them the old men coming uphill slowly wore robes almost exactly the same color as the road and the earth behind them there were five of them they were bent and moved slowly we did give ourselves away up there and somebody was watching doj waste of breath the swordmaster was headed downhill already tobo and gota were right behind him which did nothing for sahras nerves i rushed forward caught the boy you stay back but sleepy you want to debate it with runmust and iqbal he did not want to argue with the large shadar gentlemen i did not want to argue with the troll i let her go she might be more intimidating than doj anyway he was just one old man with a sword she was a vicious old woman with a virulent tongue i checked my battered old shortsword that was going to perform wonders if they climbed over uncle doj then i headed downhill myself sahra accompanied me the old men in brown looked at doj and gota doj and gota looked at them those five men looked like they had been cast in the same mold being nearly as wide as they were tall and very long in the tooth one of the natives said something rapid in a liquid tongue the cadence was unusual but the words sounded vaguely familiar i did catch the phrase children of the dead doj replied at length in nyueng bao which included the formulas the land of unknown shadows and all evil dies there an endless death the old men seemed hugely puzzled by dojs accent but recognized those phrases well enough to become visibly agitated i could not tell if that was a positive sign or not mother gota began muttering the incantation that included calling the heaven and the earth and the day and the night and that excited the old men even more sahra told me evidently the language has changed a great deal since the children of the dead ran away it took me a moment to understand that she was translating what doj had said in an aside to gota there was a stream of chatter from the old men all apparently in the form of pointed questions that doj could not answer sahra said they seem to be extremely worried about someone they keep calling that devildog merika montera also about a pupil of this monster a supposed future grandmaster apparently the two were driven into exile together merika montera would be longshadow we know there was a time when he used the name maricha manthara dhumraksha he sent an agent named ashutosh yaksha to live among the nyueng bao in an effort to find and steal the key that weve brought with us the golden pickax uncle doj chided sleepy these old men dont speak taglian or dejagoran but theres still a chance that they might recognize our version of names they fear and hate just a whole hell of a lot right now theyre clamoring for answers about one achoes tosiakshah it sounds like longshadow and shadowspinner before they were exiled were the last of a race of outsider sorcerers who enslaved these peoples forefathers through their ability to manipulate killer shadows they summoned from the plain wouldnt you know they brought their business with them tell these guys whatever they need to know tell them the truth tell them who we are and what we intend to do and what weve already done to their buddies longshadow and shadowspinner we might be wise to find out a little more about them before we become completely candid i wouldnt expect you to break any lifetime habits doj nodded slightly betraying the slightest smile he faced the old men and began talking i found that my nyueng bao was improving i had no trouble isolating stone soldiers and soldiers of darkness in his monologue native faces kept turning my way always more surprised sahra told me theyre monks of some sort theyve been watching for a long time watching is what their order does in case the shadowmasters try to return they did not expect anyone to come for real they especially didnt expect women eh that amazes them and swan worries them their ancestors experiences with white devils were not positive then of course the white crow swooped and landed on my shoulder and the great black stallion with its prune of a rider came down to stick its nose in and as the chatter picked up still wellseasoned with stone soldier and soldier of darkness and steadfast guardian the rest of the band drifted forward impelled by curiosity first thing i knew tobo was right there beside me along with runmust iqbal and suruvhija and all their offspring the dog and everincreasing jabber about what should we do with the captured where were we going to set up camp you hearing these questions i asked doj i hear them i think were going to be granted this whole valley for the time being while they send messages to the court of all seasons and the file of nine well have more important visitors eventually until then as i understand them we can set down anywhere we want the dialect is a little tricky though so be careful dozens of veteran eyes scanned the valley for defensible positions it took no effort to identify them they were the same as those we recalled from the kiaulune wars i wondered if all the connected worlds would be equally familiar physically i indicated my choice no one demurred runmust and the singhs hurried off to survey the site accompanied by a dozen men armed for anything the five old monks did not protest mostly they seemed bemused and amazed so it was that the black company reached the land of unknown shadows instead of fabled khatovar there it was that the company settled and rested and recovered there it was that i filled book after book with words when i was not planning or leading expeditions to rescue the rest of my captured brothers and even that devildog merika montera so he would be available for another rather less pleasant encounter with justice than the one that had driven him into exile the grandchildren of his former slaves feared him not at all i won him a stay at ladys request so he could help with tobos schooling the stay was good for as long as he did that job satisfactorily and not for a moment more the old monks as tight of lip as their cousin doj agreed that tobo had to be trained but would not reveal their reasoning even to me at one time the land of the unknown shadows had suffered many lean pale bonesacks just like longshadow they were invaders from another world they had brought no wives with them time did not love them and thus it was and thus it was soldiers live and wonder why oneeye survived another four years suffering strokes yet recovering slowly every time seldom did he leave the house we built for him and gota mostly he tinkered with his black spear while gota hovered around and fussed he fussed right back and never stopped worrying about tobos education once again tobo was smothered in parents both real and surrogate he studied with oneeye he studied with lady he studied with longshadow and master santaraksita with the radisha and the prahbrindrah drah and with the masters of our adoptive world he studied hard and well and much much more than he wanted he was very talented he was what his greatgrandmother hong tray had foreseen the captured all returned to us except for those who died beneath the plain but even the best of them murgen lady the captain were strange and deeply changed fey but we were changed as well by life so that those of us they remembered at all were almost alien to them a new order came into being it had to be someday we will cross the plain again water sleeps for now i just rest and indulge myself in writing in remembering the fallen in considering the strange twists life takes in considering what plan god must have if the good are condemned to die young while the wicked prosper if righteous men can commit deep evil while bad men demonstrate unexpected streaks of humanity soldiers live and wonder why the great general started south through the dandha presh moments after the protector abandoned him so she could make more speed consequently he met soulcatcher on the southern side of the summit just a week later she talked to herself continuously in a committee of voices while she was awake and gibbered in tongues during her brief bouts of sleep mogaba thought the daughter of night seemed smugly pleased in the moment before she collapsed from exhaustion kill them mogaba urged the moment he had soulcatchers ear and a bit of privacy those two can be nothing but trouble and theres no way you can profit from keeping them around possibly true the protectors voice was a sly one but if im clever enough i can use the girl to tap into kinas power the way my sister did if theres one thing ive learned from a life noteworthy for its regiments of disappointments its that you cant rely on cleverness youre a powerful woman now kill them while you can kill them before they find a way to turn the tables you dont need to become any stronger theres no one in this world capable of challenging you theres always someone mogaba kill them they sure wont waste a second on you soulcatcher approached the daughter of night who had not moved since her collapse my dear sweet niece wouldnt harm me the voice she chose could have been that of a naive fourteenyearold responding to the charge that her twentyfiveyearold lover was interested in only one thing then she laughed cruelly kicked the daughter of night viciously you even think about it bitch and ill roast and eat you one limb at a time and still make sure you live long enough to see your mother die first the great general neither moved nor made any remark his face betrayed nothing not even to soulcatchers acute eye but in his sinking heart he understood that yet again he had allied himself with complete and unpredictable insanity and yet again he had no option but to ride the tiger he observed perhaps we should give thought to how to guard our minds against intrusion by the queen of terror and darkness im ahead of you general im the professional this voice was that of a selfimportant little mouse of a functionary it became that of a selfconfident woman being conversational the voice mogaba suspected was soulcatchers own it resembled closely the voice of her sister lady for the last week ive had nothing to do but nurture the blisters on my feet and think i conceived marvelous new torments to practice upon the black company too late to enjoy them isnt that the way it always goes you always think of the perfect comeback about an hour too late for it to do any good i suppose ill find other enemies and my innovation wont be wasted most of the time though i considered how best to circumvent kinas power she did not fear naming the goddess directly we can do it the daughter of night stirred slightly her shoulders tightened she glanced up for an instant she looked a little uncertain a little troubled for the first time since her birth she was completely out of touch with her soulmother she had been out of touch for several days something was wrong something was terribly wrong soulcatcher eyed narayan singh that old man was not much use anymore she could test her new torments on him once she had him back in taglios before a suitable audience general if i get caught up in one of those byways that distract me so often i want you to nudge me back to the business at hand which will be empire building and in my spare time the creation of a new flying carpet i think i know enough of the howlers secrets to manage this past week has forced me to admit to myself that i have no innate fondness for exercise soulcatcher prodded the daughter of night again then settled on a rotten log and removed her boots mogaba dont ever tell anyone that youve seen the worlds greatest sorceress stumped for a way to handle something as trivial as blisters narayan singh who had been snoring fitfully suddenly rose up and gripped the bars of his cage his face contorted in terror its butternut color all but gone water sleeps he screamed thi kim thi kim is coming then he collapsed unconscious again though his body continued to spasm soulcatcher growled softly water sleeps well see what the dead can do they were all gone this time it was her world now what else did he say something that sounded like a nyueng bao name uhm yes but not a name something about death or a murder thi kim coming hmm maybe a nickname murder walker i should learn the language better the daughter of night she noted was shaking more than singh the wind whines and howls through fangs of ice it races furiously around the nameless fortress but tonight neither the lightning nor the storm has any power to disturb the creature on the wooden throne is relaxed he will rest comfortably through a night of years for the first time in a long millennium the silver daggers are no inconvenience at all shivetya sleeps and dreams dreams of immortalitys end fury crackles between the standing stones shadows flee shadows hide shadows huddle in terror immortality is threatened
